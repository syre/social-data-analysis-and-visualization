1
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,920
What's the matter?
Is it me?

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,160
Of course it isn't. In a boat
like this, it's uncomfortable.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,280
The boat's uncomfortable, beach
was sandy, air was too conditioned--

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,800
I bet it's the hotel water. They
should let you know you can't drink it.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,080
- You're trying too hard. That's all.
- Yeah, I need to relax more.

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,120
We can relax more later. Now
let's do what we came out here for.

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,480
You're sure it's not dangerous?

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,560
It's just wonderful.
You won't believe it.

9
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,720
Hi, Ron.

10
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,400
- Did you catch a fish?
- Sort of.

11
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,560
I suppose you think that's funny.

12
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,360
No, it's Ocyurus chrysurus.

13
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,760
Since you obviously bothered to look
it up, I won't rip your lips off.

14
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,000
Chris, get that thing
out of my bed.

15
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,920
Okay, I'm trying. I'm trying.

16
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,600
- I'm trying.
- Well, get it out.

17
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,360
Come on, now. Stop it.
Get it out of this bed.

18
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,600
- Hi.
- Good morning.

19
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,480
- What's good about it?
- It's another sunny day.

20
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,000
No shit. These eggs
are not as scrambled as I like them.

21
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,280
That's because they're for Ms.
Kimbrough in room 23. This is yours.

22
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,320
- Scrambled?
- Yes, sir.

23
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,680
I can't figure out why I came
to a small island for my vacation.

24
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,400
I live on a small island.

25
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,040
- Really? Which one?
- Manhattan.

26
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,600
Good morning, Christopher.

27
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,680
- Who is it, Chris?
- Breakfast, Mom.

28
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,400
Give me a break.

29
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,360
What time is it?

30
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,760
Five after 8.

31
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,720
Gonna be late again.

32
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,000
He always comes
when you're getting out of the shower.

33
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,800
- What are you, my chaperon?
- No.

34
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:39,080
I'd rather you looked upon me
as a spiritual advisor.

35
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,560
You wouldn't have guys hitting
on you if you were still with Dad.

36
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,200
Yeah, well, I'm not.

37
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,120
Why don't we live in a house
like normal humans?

38
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,760
Because there's no room service.

39
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,960
No, really, Mom,
this hotel is the pits.

40
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,320
Well...

41
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,880
...it won't be for long.

42
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,440
If they wanna give me this suite
for free while I'm working here...

43
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,560
...might as well take advantage of it.
It's a way to save money.

44
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,760
Remember that job I got crewing
on some rich guy's boat for five days?

45
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,160
Well, we leave this morning.

46
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,440
That's this morning?

47
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,520
I don't know.
I told you I would think about it.

48
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,280
- Yeah, well, everything's okay.
- No, everything is not okay.

49
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,320
We discussed that. I don't know
this guy or anything about him.

50
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,280
Come on. You said
we needed to save money.

51
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,520
I don't like this any more than you do.
Sailing around these islands is tough.

52
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,480
All that grueling sun and wind.

53
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,680
I'd much rather stay at home
and experiment...

54
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,040
...with fabrics and colors
and things.

55
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,440
Things might be different
if there were a father figure around.

56
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,560
- Okay. Okay. Chris. Chris!
- A hotel--

57
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,840
You are a weird boy.

58
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:02,840
You may also be an imposter. My
real son is much younger and shorter.

59
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:09,360
- Mom, why don't you just stand up?
- I am standing.

60
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,120
- Dr. Bell, there's mail for you up front.
- Thank you.

61
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,840
- Enjoy your breakfast.
- I am.

62
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,480
Doctor!

63
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,800
Cindy, it's him.
He's the one.

64
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:29,120
Beverly, you're kidding. You know
I have my eyes on the lifeguard.

65
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,400
Look at him. He's stunning.
I've got to have him.

66
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,480
Come on, Beverly.
That lox?

67
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,960
Why are you so superficial?
He's a doctor.

68
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,600
Morning, Mr. Benotti. Myrna, I hope
you're enjoying your honeymoon here.

69
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,720
- We certainty are.
- I'm so happy.

70
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,720
- Well, let's have breakfast.
- But, honey, I'm not very hungry.

71
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,280
We really should eat, honey.
It's included in the price of the room.

72
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,560
Say, I love those shorts.

73
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,400
- Good morning, Mrs. Wilson.
- A little tight at the top.

74
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:29,840
- Down early this morning, are you?
- At my age, every moment counts.

75
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,400
Say, Ronnie...

76
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:37,000
...you wouldn't care for a casual
encounter, no complications?

77
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:43,520
I could show you a thing or two that
would put these young girls to shame.

78
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,800
I bet you could.

79
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,440
You know what the doctor said
killed my last husband?

80
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,560
No, ma'am.

81
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,120
Excitement.

82
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,600
You wanna lose that boat?

83
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,120
I told you the next time
I caught you dynamite fishing...

84
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,880
...I'd throw your sorry ass in jail,
and I meant it...

85
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,960
...and let you rot.
Nobody will care.

86
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,840
They won't even give a damn.
They won't even notice.

87
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,520
And I'll impound this boat too.

88
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,840
- You sorry son of a bitch.
- I like the smell of this fuse.

89
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,080
- Think fast.
- Son of a bitch!

90
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,400
We done it.

91
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,640
You'll be cooking these tonight.

92
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,960
Run by the boatyard.

93
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,160
I'll have to come by.

94
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,160
- That means we get to keep the boat?
- Boat?

95
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,080
You call this a boat?

96
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,600
Bring something to drink
if you're coming.

97
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,760
Steve and Anne and I
go back a long time.

98
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,080
Permission to come aboard,
Mr. Dumont?

99
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,720
It's you. You're late.

100
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,720
And by the way,
you may call me Captain.

101
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,680
- Why don't you secure this halyard.
- You mean the jib sheet, sir?

102
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,800
- Yes, this thing right here.
- No problem, Captain.

103
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,160
Here's the rest of our motley crew.
This is my daughter, Allison.

104
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,160
- Allison, this is Mr. Kimbrough.
- Hi.

105
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,720
First, I want you to clean the head and
the bilge and the storage compartments.

106
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,120
Then swab down the decks,
box up the hatches...

107
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,720
...and then I want all these fittings
polished on deck.

108
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,840
My pleasure, Captain.

109
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,280
Yes. Now, as soon as all that's done,
we'll hoist sail and take off.

110
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,680
Sir, shouldn't we motor out
past the reef first?

111
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:43,520
Well, of course. Of course.
Hoist sail is just an expression.

112
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,040
Our lives are in your hands.

113
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,440
Make sure you don't put that
on our tab.

114
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,080
Do it.

115
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,680
We're waiting.

116
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,520
Help! Help!

117
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,360
It's all right. I promise you.
I promise you.

118
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,400
I promise you you'll be fine.

119
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,840
Okay. It's okay.
It's okay. You're safe.

120
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,600
Better safe than dead.
You saved my life.

121
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,160
- My pleasure.
- It hurts.

122
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,560
- Can I take a look?
- Yes, please. It's the other one.

123
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,200
We should get you a doctor.

124
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,040
- Aren't you a doctor?
- No.

125
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,400
- You're not a doctor?
- No, but I'm a dentist.

126
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,920
- You're a dentist?
- Dr. Leo Bell, D.D.S. at your service.

127
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,840
Hi, I'm Beverly.

128
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,080
Is everyone clear
on today's activities?

129
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,880
The volleyball tournament
on the beach at 2.

130
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,400
The Mr. Muscle contest at 4:30,
I'm judging.

131
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,520
And the new reggae band at 8...

132
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:59,360
...which means they might arrive by 9,
so try to keep the guests happy.

133
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:04,760
And tomorrow night, don't forget
the annual Fish Fry Beach Festival.

134
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:09,320
And, Anne, I'd like you to give your
little speech about the spawning.

135
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,560
We have some new people. Perhaps you'd
like to explain about the spawning.

136
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,560
Well, it's an excuse
to get drunk and rowdy, basically.

137
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:25,280
This sweet little fish called the
grunion swims up out of the ocean...

138
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:31,200
...onto the beach, for a moment
of privacy for his mating ritual.

139
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,800
And human beings swoop down on him,
scoop him up, and fry him for dinner.

140
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,040
How do you know it's tomorrow?

141
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,520
It's always the first full moon
after the spring equinox.

142
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,760
But how do the fish know?

143
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,520
Better put something on,
we're heading into port.

144
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,760
Aye, aye, captain.

145
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,040
Listen to this, Loretta.
"Log of the Circe, day 26.

146
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,600
It's been 18 days since we ran out
of our rationed supply of money.

147
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,800
Traveling from island to island,
we must live by our wits...

148
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,560
...raiding the ports for provisions and
trusting our sturdy craft for escape.

149
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,520
We're sea bandits, taking what we want,
giving no quarter and asking none.

150
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:28,000
I think we can continue indefinitely,
until Daddy takes the boat back."

151
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,440
Not bad for a Yankee.

152
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:35,200
We've made landfall at Elysium,
just in time.

153
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,200
- Shall we take a shot at it?
- Aye, aye, captain.

154
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,320
Okay.

155
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,880
I wanna talk to one of you.

156
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,680
- You! Come down here.
- What's the matter?

157
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,360
- I've been keeping to the right.
- I'll take care of this.

158
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,840
I tried to reach you.

159
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,680
I tried to get a hold of you.

160
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,120
Your radio was off.
You know better.

161
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,400
I know. You scared the shit out--
You scared Mr. Dumont very badly.

162
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,520
I have to call him Captain.

163
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,760
You tell Captain Dumont to keep
the radio on because of the storms.

164
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,400
- Where are you going?
- Around the cays, south of Buck Island.

165
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,920
Dad, can we go fishing
when we get back? Marlin fishing.

166
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,400
You catch one 800-pound marlin,
you've caught them all.

167
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,600
- Boring.
- Take me fishing, please.

168
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,680
- She's pretty nice.
- Who?

169
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,080
- Well....
- She's cute, huh?

170
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,000
Okay. She's okay.
Not that bad, anyway.

171
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,120
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Nothing.

172
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,560
Okay, let's go.

173
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,640
- What did he want?
- He thought you were a smuggler.

174
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,440
Wanted to strip-search the boat,
but I talked him out of it.

175
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,760
Hey, Annie.

176
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,840
- How you been?
- Okay.

177
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,240
- You know. How about you?
- Same.

178
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,200
Routine.

179
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,000
- Putting on a little weight?
- I don't know. Maybe.

180
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,800
I have to go.
I'm gonna be late for class.

181
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,520
Wait a second.
Do you recognize that dinghy?

182
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,920
- It's an orange and blue caravel.
- Do you know who it belongs to?

183
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,480
You think I sneak down here at night
to memorize boats?

184
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,200
Don't they pay you to do that stuff?

185
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,280
I found it tied to the channel marker
out by the Fitzgerald wreck.

186
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,920
Since you take innocent tourists
out there for their drowning lessons--

187
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,400
Drowning lessons?

188
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,280
- Throwing a party?
- You scared me half to death.

189
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,520
- I'll have to call the manager.
- Don't do that.

190
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,960
- Why not?
- Because I'm starving.

191
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,600
Come on, I saw you and your friend
pull in on that great rig.

192
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,480
We're in a jam. We ran out of food and
all our money was stolen yesterday.

193
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,400
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

194
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,680
Listen, we'll make it up to you.
What's your name?

195
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,040
Mal.

196
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,160
Mal, why don't you
come by the boat later on.

197
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,760
Have a nice dinner,
cruise around the bay for a while.

198
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,360
Maybe get stoned.
Know what I mean?

199
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,080
I'm sure that Loretta and I
can keep you entertained.

200
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,960
- And this is dinner?
- Yeah, that's it.

201
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,000
I don't know.

202
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,960
Listen, Loretta's hip.
She trusts my judgment in men.

203
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,800
Mal, have you ever made it
with two girls?

204
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,520
It's a date.

205
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,200
Good. We're docked up at the point.
Six o'clock all right?

206
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,640
Wait. Let me bring the dinner.
I'm an amateur chef.

207
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,200
I'll make something
really special. Okay?

208
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,200
Gotta go.

209
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,440
See you later, alligator.

210
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,320
Today's dive will take us
to the wreck of the Dwight Fitzgerald.

211
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,360
It was a Navy supply ship that went
down a couple of months ago.

212
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,280
We received permission to dive there,
but we can't go inside.

213
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,600
You're kidding. Our first big dive
and we can't go inside at all?

214
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,640
No. Don't worry,
there will be plenty of things to see.

215
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,200
We're gonna swim all the way around.

216
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,400
There are hundreds of fish
using the boat as a reef.

217
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,280
Boring!

218
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,080
Hey, come here.

219
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,160
You go to asshole school
or something?

220
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,880
Okay. Are there any questions?

221
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,000
Get your equipment:
masks, fins, snorkels only.

222
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,240
The tanks and regulators
are on board the boat. Let's get wet.

223
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,720
- I have a question for you.
- Yes?

224
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,600
Seemed like you were a pretty good
diver. Why take the class?

225
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:15,320
Mainly I was bored, and I heard
that it was part of the package deal.

226
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,320
Also, I heard the instructor
was very cute.

227
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,000
Thank you.

228
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,120
Do you dive on the first date?

229
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,840
- Steve.
- Yes?

230
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,400
We've got a deader on the docks.
They brought him up.

231
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,400
- Drowned?
- I'm not sure.

232
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,600
Steve, it's one
of your wife's students.

233
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,000
Man, you gotta be kidding me.
Let's go.

234
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,600
Drink that.

235
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,440
Are you all right?

236
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,120
Can I ask you a few questions?

237
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,280
- Do you feel up to it?
- Okay.

238
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,240
Alone, please.

239
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,560
Do you know the name of the deceased?

240
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,160
Yeah. Robert Hayward.

241
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:31,480
Hayward. Was he enrolled
in one of your diving tours?

242
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,600
Yes.

243
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:36,840
This incident took place on one
of your regularly scheduled dives?

244
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,760
Yes.

245
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,560
Did you see what happened?

246
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,440
He just swam away
from the rest of the group.

247
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,800
He was only out of sight
for a second.

248
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,040
- Did you see a shark at any time?
- No. It wasn't that.

249
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,280
- A school of barracuda?
- No, but--

250
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,040
- A moray eel?
- Would you listen to me for a minute?

251
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,920
It wasn't a shark, or a barracuda,
or a moray eel, or a jealous lover.

252
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,840
- Then what was it?
- I don't know. That's the point.

253
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,560
I'm familiar with the marine life
in this area, and I don't know!

254
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,080
Give her a break. She's had a shock.
She's upset. Can't you see that?

255
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,800
Who's this?

256
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,280
- What's his name?
- Sherman. Tyler Sherman.

257
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,840
I've gotta look at the body.
I only saw it for a moment.

258
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,520
Out of the question.
That's the coroner's job.

259
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,800
Steven.

260
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,960
I was responsible for that boy. That's
my job. I have to know what happened.

261
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,560
That's right.
You were responsible...

262
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,960
...and that's precisely why
you can't touch the body...

263
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:44,040
...because it may be used in evidence
in a case of negligence.

264
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,960
You are still the most
pigheaded person ever.

265
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,240
That may be true, but
I'm in charge of this investigation.

266
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:54,400
And if I need any information,
I'll ask you.

267
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,400
What do you think?

268
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:05,560
If I had a little spiffy outfit like
that, maybe I could be in charge too.

269
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,960
You know that robot?

270
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,680
Yes. He's my husband.

271
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,480
Here he is. You will not believe
how weird this guy is.

272
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,200
The word is
he hasn't been laid in 10 years.

273
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,760
Wait until you see him,
you'll laugh.

274
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,040
He doesn't look so bad from here.

275
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,440
- Hi. Here I come.
- That's what he thinks.

276
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,760
- Wait until you see what I made.
- I can't wait.

277
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,680
- Should I jump on board now?
- Yeah, but pass me the box first.

278
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,240
Okay.

279
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,720
Okay, now, untie the rope.

280
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,960
Okay.

281
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,520
Boy, this is going to be fun.

282
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,960
- Hand it over here.
- Okay.

283
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,120
And don't forget the other one.

284
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,760
Here.

285
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,800
Okay.

286
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,880
Now, jump!

287
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:14,240
It's a little too far away.
Can you bring it a little closer?

288
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,240
Come on, it's just a couple of feet.

289
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,360
Okay, wait.

290
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,600
Watch this.
Here I come. Oh, boy.

291
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,120
So long, asshole.

292
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,680
Hey. You awake?

293
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,960
- Hey.
- Of course.

294
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,840
I just wanted to tell you
I'm really glad you came with us.

295
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,760
So am I. The way your father drives,
we'd have probably hit a reef by now.

296
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,160
- That's not what I meant.
- I'm sorry.

297
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,640
It's just such a drag my daddy
made us go to bed so early.

298
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,080
Well, why does he make
you go to bed so early?

299
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,680
I think he's just trying
to be cool with me.

300
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:18,440
You see, it took him a whole bottle
of wine to get to sleep.

301
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,240
Need a guide?
Work's incredibly cheap.

302
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,840
- Hi, Tyler. No, thanks.
- How about dinner?

303
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,720
If you're going for a restaurant,
that's the wrong direction.

304
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,040
- I'm not.
- That's all right. We can just...

305
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,000
...stroll and talk.

306
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,480
Tyler, can you give me a break?

307
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,760
I would like to be by myself.
I don't want to talk to anybody. Okay?

308
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,960
You need to talk to somebody.

309
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,400
Why not me?
I am your best friend.

310
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,720
I just met you five days ago.

311
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,480
And all that time I thought
we had this incredible rapport.

312
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:03,200
- Okay. Would you do me a favor?
- Sure. Anything.

313
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,160
- Leave me alone.
- Except that.

314
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:09,280
- Let me just buy you one drink.
- Okay. Tomorrow you can buy me a drink.

315
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,320
You can buy me two drinks.
Feel better?

316
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,760
Nope.

317
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,920
Anne.

318
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,440
How can we have a love affair
if you keep walking away from me?

319
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,080
What do you want?

320
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,880
I just want to spend time with you.
I don't care where you're going...

321
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:32,160
...or what you're doing. I just
would like to be with you. Okay?

322
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,960
- Okay.
- Great!

323
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,160
- You sure?
- Yeah.

324
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,720
Follow me.

325
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,560
Yeah, man.

326
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,520
It's kind of dark in here.

327
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:57,120
You did say that you wanted
to be with me. Didn't you?

328
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,960
Yeah.
You come here often?

329
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,880
- Hey, this is the morgue.
- Very good.

330
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,920
Yeah. I'm kind of
a perceptive sort of guy.

331
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,520
No. We're not going to be
breaking in here, are we?

332
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,560
Jesus, we're breaking in.

333
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,440
Don't leave home
without it.

334
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,720
Anne, what the hell are we doing
in this place, anyway?

335
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:44,160
I'm trying to get a good look at the
body before the coroner gets to it.

336
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,480
Boy, you are one
fun chick, you know?

337
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,280
Where do you think
they put him?

338
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,440
We're gonna have
to pull him out to take pictures.

339
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,440
Help me with this thing.

340
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,800
Take this, I'll get my camera.

341
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,200
Your method
is pretty scientific, lady.

342
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,040
I studied marine biology
before I met Steve.

343
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,920
- Don't try anything funny!
- Nothing funny.

344
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,440
Mrs. Kimbrough,
what are you doing here?

345
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,560
Well, we--

346
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,920
- Came to pay our last respects.
- My ass.

347
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:40,440
Nobody's got any respect anymore.
Not even for the dead.

348
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:44,520
I almost lost my job letting in a guy
because he said he was the bereaved.

349
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,480
Then I catch him having a party.
Sure isn't going to happen again.

350
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,440
No party.
Just on our way out.

351
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,880
Damn right you were.

352
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,920
Shit. The bike. Keep going.
Keep going. Keep going.

353
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,760
Come busting in
as if it's a playground.

354
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,480
No damn respect.
Isn't that right, love?

355
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,120
Oh, hell.

356
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,760
Jeez.

357
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,880
Tremendous jaw pressure.

358
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,000
It sheared cleanly through
bone in places.

359
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:19,720
- You got any wine in the house?
- Only Coke, if there's any left.

360
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,600
I don't know anything
that could do that.

361
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,560
Maybe it's a new kind
of species, you know.

362
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,440
Something that
never existed before.

363
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,760
Like a mutant strain
or genetic engineering?

364
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,560
Yeah, I guess.
Anybody doing stuff to fish?

365
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,560
The Army was,
but that was several years ago.

366
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:47,120
They developed a sort of killer fish
to screw up the rivers in Vietnam.

367
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,200
- Apocalypse Two.
- And Three and Four.

368
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,600
They escaped from their tank
and killed a lot of civilians.

369
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,320
- Maybe it's the same fish.
- No.

370
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,480
They were experimenting
with a freshwater fish...

371
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,560
...from the piranha family,
I think. Serrasalmus or....

372
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,360
Whatever it was,
it couldn't live in the ocean.

373
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,480
Piranha?

374
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,720
Well, they changed it a little,
made it nastier.

375
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,640
What have you been reading?
National Enquirer?

376
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:22,720
No. We get the news here too. You're
the one who brought up the new species.

377
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,120
Yeah, but that was
just a joke!

378
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,960
Christ.

379
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,800
I'm sorry.

380
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:39,040
I know I've been lousy company, but
I just can't stop thinking about it.

381
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,280
I know. I understand.
It could have been you.

382
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,560
Or even worse, me.

383
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:49,880
- I'm glad it wasn't you.
- Yeah. Me too.

384
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:55,080
Well, thanks for dinner,
the show.

385
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,560
It was terrific.
We should do it again.

386
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,000
Tyler.

387
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:06,560
Would you stay?

388
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,720
Just to be here.

389
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,840
We wouldn't have
to make love or anything.

390
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:18,680
Make love? Anne, that was
the furthest thing from my mind.

391
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,520
Boy, these guys, they buy you dinner
and they think they own you!

392
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,360
But that was still
a pretty mean thing to do.

393
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,920
- It was not.
- But he was so cute.

394
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,920
You'd think a snake was cute.
I always miss that.

395
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:53,200
- I'm going below to clean up the mess.
- Okay.

396
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,720
- Loretta, what was that?
- I don't know.

397
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,520
- Well, go look up front.
- Yeah.

398
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,160
I don't see a thing.

399
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,280
Okay.

400
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,600
Loretta! Loretta, what is it?

401
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:21,080
Loretta! Jesus, Loretta!

402
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:28,320
Loretta. Oh, my God, Loretta!
Try to grab onto this.

403
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,560
Jesus Christ,
what's happening? Loretta!

404
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,200
Annie, are you here?

405
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:07,080
That was your husband. Tried to gnaw
my arm off, but there just wasn't time.

406
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,840
You came here to talk. Talk!

407
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,000
- You see this?
- Yes. I see it.

408
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,960
- Where did I find it?
- All right. I was there.

409
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:26,480
- I have an answer if you care to listen.
- I'm listening.

410
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,840
- The Army has a strain of fish that--
- Fish?

411
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,320
See what's on the back
of this? Blood!

412
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,160
I found the nurse at the morgue
with her throat torn out, on dry land.

413
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:39,480
I got another girl right next
to her in the same condition.

414
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:42,560
This is my conclusion: I got
three bodies on my hands...

415
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,920
...and my wife was the last one
to see two of them alive!

416
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:49,840
There's nothing left to talk about.
Stay the hell out of this.

417
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,880
I don't want to hear more
of your cockamamie ideas.

418
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,960
Go home and sit on your hands.
And the next time, lock your door!

419
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,840
You really ought to learn how
to release those pent-up feelings.

420
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,240
You know, my ears popped a little
from that vacuum you left...

421
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,040
...when you ran after Steve.

422
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,480
I have a few things to do.

423
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:29,440
There's some food in the refrigerator
if you care to have some breakfast.

424
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,120
Terrific.

425
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:44,000
I'm canceling the dive tour today,
tomorrow and as long as necessary.

426
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,320
Anne, I'm booked solid
on the dives.

427
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,400
People like the dives.
They like you.

428
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:53,320
You're sticking a red-hot poker
up my ass by canceling now.

429
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:58,080
I advise you to stop water activities
until we find out what's going on.

430
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:01,240
- You're just upset.
- No boating, jet-skiing, windsurfing...

431
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,720
- You're being ridiculous.
- ...snorkeling, swimming, or anything.

432
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,880
Anne, you're fired.

433
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:08,960
What?

434
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:14,080
Unemployed. As of now.

435
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:19,600
And I could use your suite.
So please vacate by tomorrow morning.

436
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:38,400
It's Tyler. I'm still here
on Elysium.

437
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,960
That attack yesterday,
I'm pretty sure that it--

438
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:45,920
Well, now what else
could it be, huh?

439
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:50,240
Listen. I ran into a woman here who's
starting to put the pieces together.

440
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,120
I think she could be
pretty helpful to us.

441
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,360
Yeah, I know that.
Very risky. I realize that.

442
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:02,160
But if she blows the whistle, we don't
have to put our asses on the line.

443
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:05,200
Look, just relax.
It's gonna be okay.

444
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:10,320
I'll take care of it. I'm gonna get
a specimen. I'll get back to you.

445
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:55,800
Did you see them?

446
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,680
One of them came so close
I could have touched it.

447
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:01,080
- Scared the shit out of me. You okay?
- Fine.

448
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:06,200
I gotta get my camera before it gets
dark. I don't think they like light.

449
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,560
Anne? Anne!

450
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,480
You can't go down.

451
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,880
If I can get a picture,
that's proof.

452
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,480
They're not the same piranha
you talked about last night.

453
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,560
- They're more vicious than anything.
- What are you talking about?

454
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:26,240
Four canisters of fertile
piranha eggs sank right there.

455
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,600
- Three were found.
- How do you know that?

456
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:36,200
I worked on the project for about
two years. I'm a biochemist.

457
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,040
- You knew?
- No. I didn't know.

458
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,320
I suspected.
That's why I came.

459
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,680
You knew and didn't say
a goddamn word.

460
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:48,240
- I couldn't. It's all classified.
- Oh, "classified." Bullshit.

461
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,080
You tell me what you know
about those things.

462
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,200
I can't do that.

463
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,000
- Fine. I'm going.
- Wait a minute.

464
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,960
Just sit down
for one second. Okay?

465
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:01,920
All right. I'll tell you
everything I know.

466
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:05,440
My ass could end up in jail
for this, but I'll tell you.

467
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:10,480
We spliced genes from different species
to create the ultimate killer organism.

468
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,800
Grunions that could
live out of water...

469
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,040
...the common flying fish
you see in the bay here...

470
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:19,480
...so it could live in all
environments. Understand?

471
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:23,000
My God. We've got
to tell somebody right now.

472
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,200
You have to come with me
to convince them.

473
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:29,160
- I can't. I'm not supposed to be here.
- Tyler, people are dead.

474
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:32,280
You've got to go and tell them
what you know now.

475
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:35,000
- I've got to get more information.
- God.

476
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:39,600
Then I can fill out my report and
submit it to the proper authorities.

477
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,000
People on this island
are not qualified.

478
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,200
It's gotta go through
proper channels.

479
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:49,120
Fuck the proper channels. Help me now,
or you get the hell out of my way.

480
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:51,880
Turn your radio on, you jackass.
Six. Channel six.

481
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,320
- Hey. Hello?
- Are you Dumont?

482
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:04,920
Yes, this is he.
What have I done?

483
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,880
Let me speak
to Chris Kimbrough.

484
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:14,240
They're both gone.
They must've taken the dinghy.

485
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,680
- Chris and my daughter.
- How long ago?

486
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:23,440
- I don't know. I was sleeping.
- Dumont, listen to me...

487
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:27,280
...very carefully. I'm only gonna
say this once, slowly.

488
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,640
I want you to stay put.

489
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:34,080
When they come back, I want you
to call me on channel six.

490
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,920
Do yourself a favor.

491
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,240
Find my daughter.

492
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:46,720
And when you do,
let me know at once.

493
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:08,880
Okay, honey, this one's for the den.

494
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,560
Great! Okay, let's see you.

495
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,200
All right.

496
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:16,040
- That's for the girls in the office.
- Hey, Ralph!

497
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:19,280
Come on, Myrna,
this one's for your mother!

498
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:20,520
Okay.

499
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,080
Great.

500
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,600
I hope you're coming
to our fish fry tonight.

501
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,240
It's something special.

502
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,680
Is it in our package?
We're on the modified B plan.

503
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,320
Of course, of course.

504
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:35,480
The music, the hors d'oeuvre
and the first drink are free.

505
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:38,400
And dinner is a gift from the sea.

506
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:39,880
Sounds great!

507
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:44,240
Oh, you might want to have a snack.

508
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,400
Things don't start happening
until after midnight.

509
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:51,400
Oh, honey, I just know we're
going to have a great time!

510
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:54,840
- More pictures now.
- Do I have to?

511
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,920
All right.

512
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:18,080
This is all we caught last night.

513
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,640
And the nets like this.

514
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:30,000
But this is what I wanted to show you.

515
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:35,720
They must be getting damn hungry
to eat each other like this.

516
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:48,280
Please, Raoul....

517
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,880
I'm not just being hysterical.

518
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,440
I'm trying the best way I know how...

519
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:58,480
...to convince you that these
things exist. I've seen them.

520
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:02,760
- Piranha?
- I told you what Tyler Sherman said.

521
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:08,080
What they are, where they come from.
According to him, they can fly.

522
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:12,600
I wonder what has triggered
this paranoid delusion?

523
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:17,200
Really, I'm quite concerned
for your health, Anne, dear.

524
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:20,680
You've been breathing too much air
from those musty tanks.

525
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:26,440
Look, the things are here
and they've killed people.

526
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:29,160
You both have a responsibility!

527
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:30,720
Of course.

528
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,360
Let's be quite practical, shall we?

529
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,520
I can't cut all my beach activities.

530
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,240
Fiscally, I'd be cutting my nuts off!

531
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:42,160
Kimbrough, perhaps you can explain...

532
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:45,480
...to her how this island
survives financially.

533
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:48,880
As usual, Raoul, you're full of shit.

534
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,680
The bastards fly.

535
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:04,520
That's it.

536
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:09,320
If you'll excuse me,
I've got business to attend to...

537
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:10,920
...back on earth.

538
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:14,040
Bitch.

539
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,640
Hey, come back here!

540
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,120
I'm gonna maroon you!

541
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:04,800
- I'm gonna black and blue you!
- Part of that sounds great!

542
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,480
Oh, you wretch!

543
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,560
Come on.

544
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,680
Push!

545
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:13,720
Hop in!

546
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:36,920
- Did you locate Chris?
- No.

547
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:39,200
I know he's in the cays
south of Buck Island.

548
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:41,000
- Take care of this.
- Relax.

549
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:44,280
Aaron, take her back to the hotel.
If anything happens...

550
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:47,840
...close the place down
even if it's at gunpoint.

551
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,080
I've heard this twice, Steve.
It's under control.

552
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:55,840
- Why can't we close it now?
- I'll tell you.

553
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,360
I called the Defense Department
about Tyler Sherman.

554
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:01,440
After bureaucratic bullshit,
I got ahold of a colonel...

555
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:03,680
...that admitted he existed.

556
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:07,400
It seems he was fired from
this unnamed government project.

557
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:11,040
That he was unstable,
that anything he said was nonsense.

558
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,840
They said do absolutely nothing.
Nothing.

559
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,960
They would send a team in tomorrow.

560
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:20,320
Well, that sounds real convincing.
They're contradicting themselves.

561
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:23,800
Tyler Sherman came here
because he wanted to warn people.

562
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:27,840
- That's what he was using me for.
- I knew I didn't like him.

563
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,840
We'll talk about him later.
Right now I'm concerned about Chris.

564
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,000
You know how I feel about Chris.
I'm not coming back without him.

565
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,720
Hey, Kimbrough.

566
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:30,720
Listen, everyone!

567
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:36,240
I just want to remind you that
no one is allowed on the beach early.

568
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:40,960
We'll scare them off if we
don't wait until they're all ashore.

569
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:45,880
One person can spoil it for everyone,
so I really must insist.

570
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,800
Aaron.

571
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:51,000
Come in, Aaron, over.

572
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:52,560
This is Aaron.

573
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:57,200
- See anything?
- No, nothing. How about you?

574
01:05:57,360 --> 01:06:00,320
It's okay so far.
Stand by this channel. Out.

575
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,040
Open up, sugar.

576
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:23,680
Hi, Mrs. Wilson.
Is there something I can do for you?

577
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:28,640
You bet. You can help me kill
this Mumm's and eat these oysters.

578
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:31,480
Better watch out,
they're an aphrodisiac.

579
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:33,600
What is it, honey?

580
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:35,880
Hi, Mrs. Wilson.

581
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:37,880
Anything wrong?

582
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:41,160
No, I guess I have
the wrong room number.

583
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:43,240
I'm sorry. Bye!

584
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,720
- Bye.
- Bye-bye, Mrs. Wilson.

585
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:07,960
And no one knows what forces
bring them to these beaches...

586
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:11,680
...year after year, to find a mate...

587
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:14,760
...and spawn in the dark of the night.

588
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:18,760
- Sorry I'm late.
- I know why you're late.

589
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:22,560
- What a waste.
- I don't think so.

590
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:31,000
And remember, whoever catches
the most fish wins a two-day trip!

591
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:34,680
Air search to unit one,
come in, over.

592
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:38,560
Steve, this is Anne.
Did you find Chris yet? Over.

593
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:42,720
Not yet. I'm gonna refuel at
Buck Island and stay out for a while.

594
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:47,240
Okay. Everything's calm here.
Good luck. Over and out.

595
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:56,240
Aaron, this is Anne. Come in.

596
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:30,240
Aaron, come in!

597
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:37,640
You're wonderful!

598
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:41,640
You're great!
You're my dream come true!

599
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:51,400
Hi, lady.

600
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:57,680
There's only one way for a fat guy to
be first when running for the beach.

601
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,720
Cheat!

602
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:03,480
Light the torches.

603
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:06,080
Don't burn me.

604
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:12,400
Now, we must call to the fish
in the traditional style.

605
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:16,880
To lure them from the sea
with the ancient rhythm.

606
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:35,760
All right, we must have total silence.

607
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,680
They killed my son.

608
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:11,800
I'm going to kill them fish.
I'm going to kill them in the wreck!

609
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:17,240
No, Gabby, please, no.
You'll never get down to the wreck!

610
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:21,800
Can you hear the sound?

611
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:30,280
Everybody ready?

612
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,320
Let's go get them!

613
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:37,240
We want fish. We want fish.
<i> </i>

614
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:41,960
We want fish. We want fish.

615
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:47,360
Help!

616
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:56,480
Where are you?

617
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:14,600
If I didn't have so much to drink
tonight, I'd swear I was seeing things.

618
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:34,600
Allison, wake up. Wake up!

619
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:40,440
We're lost.

620
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:43,000
Lost at sea.

621
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:47,920
How romantic.

622
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:49,040
Oh, my God.

623
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,080
Allison!

624
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:55,440
Words cannot describe
the trouble we're in.

625
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,680
I was expecting Gabby.

626
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,680
Gabby's dead.

627
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:10,320
So are a lot of people.

628
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:16,080
- You got the charges he made?
- Yeah.

629
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:18,520
One's mine.

630
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:22,800
You don't have to go. I can handle it.

631
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:28,360
I might as well,
I got the damn suit on.

632
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:35,120
We've got one hour.

633
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:44,000
What about those lights over there?

634
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:46,680
- Where?
- Those. Right there.

635
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:51,400
The red one could be
the channel marker by the hotel.

636
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:55,800
Okay, that's where we're going.

637
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:11,880
Steve, just be sure
you're clear by 6:30.

638
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:15,320
These detonators are electronic
and the time should be accurate.

639
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:20,400
Anne, don't do this. All we have to do
is walk away from this in one piece!

640
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:23,560
I can take care of myself.
Just find Chris. Over.

641
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:24,840
Annie, listen to me.

642
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:27,560
- Annie!
- Don't answer.

643
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:52,520
- Hey, look! It's Dad!
- Hey! Here we are!

644
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:54,080
- Dad!
- Over here!

645
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:56,520
Down here! Dad!

646
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:03,160
- Mr. Kimbrough! We're here!
- He's coming. Over here!

647
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:11,760
Chris, can you drive the dive boat?

648
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:21,000
All right, son,
stay right where you are.

649
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:19,640
Come on, baby.

650
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:24,040
Throw me a rope!

651
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:26,320
Throw me a line!

652
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:31,840
- Come on.
- Dad, what's going on?

653
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,960
Come on! Move your ass.

654
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:39,520
Go, go, go.

655
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:42,640
- Where's Mom?
- Put that on!

656
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:45,280
- Here.
- What's going on, Dad?

657
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:46,920
- Go below.
- I can--

658
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:48,960
Go below!

659
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:56,200
Annie, Annie, Annie.

660
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:36,280
Kimbrough.
<i> </i>

661
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:37,800
Kimbrough!
