1
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,537
"She knew a trick.

2
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:36,675
"She knew how to turn her life into a movie
and watch things happen.

3
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:42,545
"Not to her,
but to a girl who looked just like her.

4
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:44,922
"Was she the runaway

5
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,790
"with everything she owned
in a ratty old backpack?

6
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:53,127
"Or, was she watching a movie about
a hitchhiking runaway on a lonely highway?

7
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:58,062
"A truck slowed till the girl squinted
in his headlights.

8
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,463
"But one good look at her

9
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,700
"and the trucker couldn't get out of there
fast enough.

10
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:05,637
"She didn't even have the strength
to curse him

11
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:09,010
"as she choked on the dust
of his spinning wheels."

12
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:05,367
I'm sorry, Mr. Norquist.
I know I should have this by now.

13
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,462
You've been distracted lately, Aubrey.

14
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:12,272
The next Young Artist Competition
is less than a month away.

15
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,603
I know. I know.

16
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:22,779
Watch this hand.

17
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,236
You see how easy?

18
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,098
Yeah.

19
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,172
I've been meaning to talk to you.

20
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:47,609
You know, I've been thinking, and...

21
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:52,140
I just... I don't know if I'm cut out
to play piano anymore.

22
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:56,986
Aubrey, all artists feel that way. It's normal.

23
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,558
No, I... I want to quit.

24
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,796
I mean, I barely made my winter admit
to Yale, and I could still blow it.

25
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:07,790
I just need to concentrate
all of my efforts into writing.

26
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,960
But you have a gift, an innate talent.

27
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,300
You won the Young Artist Competition.

28
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:16,034
I mean, how much more validation
do you need?

29
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:18,804
That was a long time ago, Mr. Norquist.

30
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:29,816
Hi, you.

31
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,308
<i>" She always felt like half a person.</i>

32
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:28,744
<i>" Half a person with half a soul.</i>

33
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:33,342
<i>" Sometimes, if she dreamed hard enough,</i>
<i>she could bring the two halves together.</i>

34
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:37,514
<i>" But she always woke to the same feelings</i>
<i>of loneliness and loss. "

35
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,560
- Hey.
- Hi.

36
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,969
Where'd you find a blue rose?

37
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,471
I passed a place on the street. Here.

38
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:55,871
Thank you.

39
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:02,375
You okay?

40
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,142
Yeah.

41
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,513
Got me.

42
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:26,061
Sheriff, several federal agents
were seen entering city hall

43
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,606
- about an hour ago.
- Why has the coroner's report been sealed?

44
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:29,936
- Sheriff! Jennifer Toland...
- Please.

45
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:31,066
...disappeared almost two months ago.

46
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,804
Serial killers typically...

47
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:35,472
We have one dead girl,
and you're talking serial killer!

48
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:38,709
- You people astound me.
- Could you just give us a name?

49
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,249
Who has not yet found the aortic arches?

50
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,391
And the super-pharyngeal ganglia?

51
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:49,486
The brain.

52
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,857
Yes, you can barely see that,
even under the microscope.

53
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:58,096
Is that all I am to you?

54
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,229
Just something to relax you
before the game?

55
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:03,035
If I cut a worm in half,
will it become two worms?

56
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:05,303
No, Pete, that's a myth.

57
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:09,880
What's it gonna take for me and you
to be together?

58
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:12,041
A lot more than one blue rose.

59
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:15,143
Aubrey, I think I'm falling in love with you.

60
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,214
We barely know each other, Jerrod.

61
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,384
- You're delusional.
- No, I'm not.

62
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:24,361
I've never felt this way about a girl before.

63
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:25,862
- I just keep thinking about you and...
- Jerrod!

64
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:29,628
Can you point out for me
the female reproductive organs?

65
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:31,764
The seminal receptacles.

66
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,668
Yes, I can, actually.

67
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:38,869
That should be it.

68
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:46,274
Those would be
the male reproductive organs.

69
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:52,920
The female organs are at the other end
of the worm.

70
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:58,620
Looks like you need a little more experience
in the female anatomy.

71
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,200
- Oh, my God!
- I'm sorry.

72
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,713
Jennifer Toland's body was discovered
early this morning.

73
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:20,680
Please don't ask me any questions.
I don't have the details.

74
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:32,193
<i>Nineteen-year-old female, 5'4 " tall.</i>

75
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,931
<i>Amputation of individual digits,</i>

76
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,668
<i>possibly on the same or successive days.</i>

77
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:49,278
<i>Full metacarpal amputation</i>
<i>approximately two weeks later.</i>

78
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:55,845
<i>Ragged cuts indicate</i>

79
00:10:55,955 --> 00:11:01,689
<i>near-lethal levels of amphetamines</i>
<i>inducing a state of forced alertness,</i>

80
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:05,662
<i>suggesting the killer wanted the victim</i>

81
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:08,563
<i>fully conscious during each limb removal.</i>

82
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:28,806
<i>As we all know,</i>
<i>Jennifer Toland's body was found this week.</i>

83
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:32,281
<i>And we'd like to take a moment of silence.</i>

84
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:42,325
<i>Now, let's get out there</i>
<i>and win this one for Jennifer Toland!</i>

85
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,340
Come on!

86
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,710
<i>Curfew is one hour away.</i>

87
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:45,951
<i>Attention, curfew, for under 21,</i>
<i>begins in one hour.</i>

88
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:49,853
Why are you...

89
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,759
Just marry him
and start popping out babies.

90
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:54,890
No way. I'm done sleeping with guys
I'm not in love with.

91
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,901
Oh, like you were some kind
of a sex addict before.

92
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,265
But Jerrod loves you.

93
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:04,070
I'll be 3,000 miles away in January.
I mean, I can't afford to fall in love.

94
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,143
That's nice.

95
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:09,237
<i>It's like someone could stab you</i>
<i>and you'd never even know what...</i>

96
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,714
It's like Mardi Gras or something.

97
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:16,015
Yeah, I read this story about this killer
who sits behind people in movies

98
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:18,851
and stabs them with a needle right here.

99
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,619
You die like instantly.

100
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:23,593
Nobody even knows you're dead
until the movie's over and you don't get up.

101
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,027
It's so creep...

102
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:29,328
Beat them, baby! Owls, number one!
Let's do this! Yeah!

103
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:30,402
Oh, my God!

104
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:32,595
Oh, so weird!

105
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,502
Everybody is insanely crazy.

106
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:37,098
- Hey!
- Hey!

107
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,642
I'm looking for Jerrod.

108
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:41,372
- Oh, good luck.
- Oh, there he is! Jerrod!

109
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,141
- Jerrod!
- Aubrey, wait!

110
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,979
I'll meet you in front of the Fremont at 11:45.

111
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:47,712
Jerrod!

112
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:15,340
Aubrey?

113
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:18,677
Aubrey!

114
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:21,813
Aubrey!

115
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:26,182
Okay, so I am officially freaking out.

116
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:29,193
I'm just gonna try her cell again,
and you've got to try Jerrod.

117
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:30,387
Okay.

118
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,694
- I think it's coming from over here!
- Don't hang up your phone!

119
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:39,395
- Hello? Hey.
- It's me.

120
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:41,029
Where's Aubrey?

121
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,898
What?

122
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,344
Okay, where did she park?

123
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,277
Where'd she park her car?

124
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:51,713
- Come on, you rode with her.
- Yeah, it was on that street.

125
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:54,581
- It's that street, you know the one.
- No. No, I don't know the one.

126
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,314
- Tell me.
- Yeah, I do. It's in front

127
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:59,482
- of the little art gallery with the gate.
- Yeah.

128
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:01,555
- Wait!
- Wait a second!

129
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,058
There it is! There's her car!

130
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:32,745
Help!

131
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:33,875
No!

132
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:37,779
No!

133
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,361
She...

134
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,433
She lives on this thing.

135
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,724
It's her life.

136
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:53,666
Writing.

137
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,736
She loves to write.

138
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:01,269
Mr. Fleming, I'm gonna have to
take that computer from you.

139
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,041
I need to make a copy of the hard drive.

140
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:05,639
Take it, please. Anything you need.

141
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,089
Daniel,

142
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,224
is there any chance
that your daughter might have run away?

143
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:23,699
Was she unhappy about anything?

144
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,394
Aubrey? Unhappy?

145
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,707
No.

146
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,173
Not at all.

147
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:33,871
You sure about that?

148
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:38,616
Where were you
when Aubrey left for the game?

149
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:45,586
I was on a conference call,
so I was in the dining room, pacing.

150
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:48,091
You know, I always pace when I...

151
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:50,821
Do you remember saying goodbye to her?

152
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,156
Can you describe how she looked?

153
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:56,928
What her mood was?

154
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,946
You know, you don't always

155
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:12,573
think to take a mental picture
of your daughter

156
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:14,982
every time she leaves the house.

157
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:17,388
I used to do that, but...

158
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:21,585
"The Worrier," Daniel used to call me.

159
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:29,393
Do you have kids?

160
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:37,773
It falls away, and...

161
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,780
They always come back.

162
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:46,044
You know, they never don't come back.
It just...

163
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,056
Aubrey!

164
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,464
Aubrey!

165
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,388
Keep your eyes peeled!

166
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:39,749
3:00 sharp? Yeah, good man.

167
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,726
Jesus.

168
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:48,095
Well, I hope our little investigation
doesn't interfere with bingo night.

169
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:20,729
I feel like half a person, you know?

170
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:24,233
And, all of a sudden, it dawns on me,
this is Steve and Vicky.

171
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:26,702
Steve and Vicky this, Steve and Vicky that.

172
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:30,036
We're finishing each other's sentences here.

173
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:33,077
Hell, we're finishing each other's thoughts.

174
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:58,126
Hey!

175
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,001
You okay?

176
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:05,567
Hey!

177
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:16,646
Yeah?

178
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,584
Susan!

179
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:22,159
Is she alive?

180
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:26,389
- Oh, God!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay. How bad?

181
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:43,211
Her blood pressure's increasing.

182
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,913
- She's fucking awake.
- For God's sake.

183
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:49,043
Increasing her thiopental.

184
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:03,127
Orthopedic saw. Orthopedic saw, now.

185
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,872
Well! Hey, beautiful.

186
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:19,707
Nobody expected to see those eyes
for a while.

187
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:28,085
- I'm in the hospital?
- You're safe now.

188
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:32,230
What hospital am I in? Where?

189
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:35,132
I'll...

190
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:37,992
I'll get the doctor, okay?

191
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:54,780
Oh, my...

192
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,251
Oh, my God!

193
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:11,360
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

194
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,118
Look, the press is asking questions.

195
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:34,021
- Now, I think what we should do...
- No, no, no. No comments, no leaks.

196
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:37,185
Aubrey Fleming is still missing
as far as the world's concerned,

197
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:39,058
- and I want to keep it that way.
- Everyone at the hospital's

198
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,632
been threatened with dismissal
and obstruction of justice charges

199
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:43,963
if they leak a word of this. We clear?

200
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:46,333
Plausible explanations. Okay.

201
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:49,839
Number one, he was done with her.
He left her on the side of the road to die.

202
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,535
But he didn't count on her will to live.

203
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,111
I don't buy it.

204
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:56,908
He wasn't done with Aubrey Fleming,
not by a long shot.

205
00:26:57,015 --> 00:27:00,246
He only had her for what? 17, 18 days?

206
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:04,379
The sectioning was just getting started.
Her leg wasn't completely off.

207
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:07,424
And why the hell would he sew her fingers
back onto her hand,

208
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:08,583
- and her hand back onto...
- But wait a minute.

209
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:10,183
Remember, Jennifer Toland drowned.

210
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:13,758
I mean, now, it's too early
for an accurate profile but...

211
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:17,033
I think the cutting is about punishment.

212
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,433
And when the punishment is over,

213
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:22,904
he finds a way for the death to happen,
so he doesn't have to be there.

214
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:27,206
Now, he doesn't like the dying part,
but he's got to make sure it happens.

215
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,138
Dying freaks him out.

216
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:31,442
I think she escaped.

217
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:34,382
The only answer
that makes any sense to me.

218
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,414
Hey, honey pie.

219
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,324
Sure did miss you.

220
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:54,137
We're gonna have you home in no time,
and we can put all this behind us.

221
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:56,362
Home?

222
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:58,101
Isn't that right, Doctor?

223
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:00,302
Aubrey's been very brave.

224
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:03,848
With any luck,
we'll have her out of the ICU tomorrow.

225
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:08,682
Who is Aubrey?

226
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:14,123
Who are you?

227
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,757
Who is...

228
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,660
- Who is Aubrey?
- No.

229
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,730
- Oh, my God.
- I don't...

230
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:26,861
I just, I don't...

231
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,032
Don't touch me. Don't touch me.
Please, don't.

232
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:48,020
Aubrey Fleming,
session number one, 10:30 a.m.

233
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:51,358
I'm not Aubrey Fleming.

234
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:52,862
Then what should I call you?

235
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:55,057
My real name would be nice.

236
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:58,965
Session number one, 10:30 a.m.

237
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:01,971
Dakota Moss.

238
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:04,507
Listen.

239
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:08,545
I know I may look a little like
this Aubrey chick, or whatever her name is,

240
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:11,877
but I'm not her, okay? I am not her.

241
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:15,210
Let's get some housekeeping
out of the way first.

242
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:19,284
- Date of birth?
- June 9th, 1988.

243
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:22,358
Social Security number?

244
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:24,884
I don't have one.

245
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:28,464
Look, when you're raised by a crack addict
who thinks the less

246
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:31,194
that people know about you, the better,
it kind of sticks.

247
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:35,295
I made up a Social Security number
when I needed one,

248
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:38,705
but I couldn't keep a job long enough
for that to matter.

249
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:41,904
A job? You're fairly young to be working.

250
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:46,347
Yeah, well, I didn't grow up in New Salem.
I grew up in the real world.

251
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,518
You mentioned your mother.

252
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:51,021
Dead.

253
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:52,721
How did your mother die?

254
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:54,284
O.D.

255
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:58,629
How long ago?

256
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:07,267
<i>Six, seven months ago.</i>
<i>We weren't really what you'd call close</i>

257
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:09,704
<i>since she'd started using again.</i>

258
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:14,074
<i>But I could always count on seeing</i>
<i>the palm of her hand on payday.</i>

259
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:18,309
<i>When she didn't come around,</i>
<i>I assumed she was dead.</i>

260
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:21,112
<i>Wasn't too hard to see that one coming.</i>

261
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:02,449
She was stupid.

262
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,290
Pathetic.

263
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:08,098
And a junkie.

264
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:24,914
<i>Did your mother leave you anything?</i>

265
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:27,778
<i>Yeah. $11.</i>

266
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:42,388
Tell me something. Why does a shrink need
your Social Security number?

267
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:45,999
I like to have it for my files.

268
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:49,273
You're fuzz, aren't you?

269
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,944
I don't want to lie to you.

270
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:57,412
I am a psychiatrist,
but I also do work for the FBI.

271
00:31:57,515 --> 00:31:59,346
I fucking knew it.

272
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:02,146
It doesn't mean I care any less
for the work we do here.

273
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:07,247
You know, you're wasting your time
because I've got nothing to tell you.

274
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:10,725
In cases like these, there are specific details
that we withhold from the public

275
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:14,889
to separate the serial confessors
from the serial killer.

276
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:18,093
The pattern of your injuries is identical.
Not similar,

277
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:22,539
identical, with another young girl.

278
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,972
A murdered girl, from New Salem.

279
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:28,340
Prove it.

280
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:42,492
Oh, my God.

281
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:46,792
Hello, Mrs. Fleming.

282
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,524
Hey.

283
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:52,034
Hi.

284
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:55,867
I brought some of your things
to make you feel more at home.

285
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:02,010
This is Mr. Gervais.

286
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:10,952
All right.

287
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:15,458
Look, I'm sure you're a very nice woman.
Really. But I don't have a home.

288
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,996
And, yeah, I just want to know
when I get to get out of here.

289
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:24,194
You don't remember Mr. Gervais
and sleeping with him?

290
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,262
Nope.

291
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:33,874
And this is some of your...

292
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:38,481
Some... Some of Aubrey's favorite music,
on that.

293
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,944
Now, where are... Shit.

294
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:45,080
How could I forget the earphones?

295
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:49,492
This was the most important thing in here.

296
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:52,085
You love your music, and, you know,

297
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:55,688
they use music to help
people come out of comas.

298
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,394
Do I look like I'm in a fucking coma?

299
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:08,036
What else you got in the bag?

300
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:10,307
What's that? Is it a picture?

301
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:11,404
Yeah.

302
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:14,916
<i>Dr. Mancuso to the ER.</i>
<i>Dr. Mancuso to the ER.</i>

303
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:16,111
Here.

304
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:22,620
Where...

305
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:25,326
Who gave you this?

306
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:26,993
Is something happening?

307
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:30,164
When I was a little girl, I...

308
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:32,793
You were seven.

309
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,429
We all went to Hawaii for Christmas.

310
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,310
The pictures are almost the same.

311
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:46,114
My bathing suit was different,
the water wasn't blue.

312
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:49,583
It was brown, actually.

313
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:51,848
And my mother took me there

314
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:54,151
as if it was some sort of treat or something

315
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:56,751
to watch freaking garbage float.

316
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,327
What is it, honey?

317
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:09,402
A lot of little girls look alike, I guess.

318
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:15,611
What's this?

319
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:22,276
You've got to understand that we are trying

320
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:24,718
- to help your daughter, Mrs. Fleming.
- This is what you call help?

321
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:27,655
- This isn't help. This is just more torture.
- I have full authority

322
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:29,225
- to conduct this investigation...
- Don't!

323
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:31,352
...in any way I see fit.
- You do not have full authority.

324
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,589
- I'm trying to prevent it happening...
- Hasn't she suffered enough?

325
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:35,393
...to another girl and mother...
- Are you just trying...

326
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,626
...because it will...
...to prolong our pain?

327
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:39,703
...Mrs. Fleming. It will.
- My God, where is your sympathy?

328
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,796
Your daughter is lucky to be alive,
but she will not be safe

329
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:46,809
until whoever did this to her is behind bars.

330
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,203
She's not safe.

331
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:21,608
Dakota, this is Julie Bascombe
and Phil Lazarus.

332
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:25,079
Yeah, I've seen them around.
Two of my prison guards.

333
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:30,487
The security measures are all
for your own comfort, Dakota.

334
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:34,583
Dakota, who cut you?
That's all we want to know.

335
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:40,023
Look, once he finds out you're still alive,
he's gonna come after you.

336
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:42,292
Now, we've done everything we can
to keep this out of the press,

337
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,630
but it's bound to get out sooner or later.

338
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:46,794
So, you're gonna use me as bait,
unless I cooperate.

339
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:48,633
Is that what you're saying?

340
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,770
Dakota, help us, please.
You saw the pictures of Jennifer.

341
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:57,439
The same person who cut her cut you.
You can't deny that.

342
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:02,081
What do you remember
about the past few weeks?

343
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:05,881
Everything.

344
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:09,153
Everything? That's unusual.

345
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,387
Dakota, who did this to you?

346
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:13,889
I don't know.

347
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:17,024
- Were you blindfolded?
- You were locked up?

348
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:19,295
It doesn't matter
if it doesn't make sense to you.

349
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,633
We'll put the pieces together.

350
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,139
All right, so I got this new job. Night shift.

351
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,377
What kind of job?

352
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,182
A hostess.

353
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:39,153
At a gentlemen's club.

354
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:43,425
Don't care how old you really are, kiddo.

355
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:47,657
Your ID says you're 21,
you're fucking 21 to me.

356
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:54,436
<i>An exotic dancer,</i>
<i>that's what the hostess job turned out to be.</i>

357
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:45,213
<i>He could've been there</i>
<i>the first night I danced. I don't know.</i>

358
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:02,679
Everything about him was just...

359
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:06,573
I don't know, was intense.

360
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,110
I never really got to see his face.

361
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,051
How do you know it was the same guy
from the club?

362
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:15,648
- I just knew.
- Was he tall? Thin? Stocky? What?

363
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:21,087
He was wearing blue gloves.

364
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:23,826
- The rubber kind that doctors wear.
- Are you sure?

365
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,425
Look, I'm not sure about anything, okay?

366
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:28,095
What about when he cut you?

367
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:30,271
You didn't see him then?

368
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:35,704
- No.
- Look, he gave you drugs, Aubrey. Okay?

369
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:37,246
To make you watch.

370
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:40,181
To keep you awake,
so you'd have to have seen something.

371
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,376
I don't lie.

372
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,212
If I tell you I didn't see him,
I didn't fucking see him.

373
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:46,346
How do you know it was the same guy
who cut you, then?

374
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:49,051
You're right. I don't know.

375
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:52,754
Aubrey, you have got to
stop playing games with us.

376
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:55,855
Am I making myself clear?
We have to know the truth.

377
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:58,332
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.
You want to know the truth?

378
00:43:58,435 --> 00:44:01,336
Well, what about me? You think I don't?

379
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:03,338
How the fuck would you feel?

380
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,672
Fingers, leg, hand, gone.
I practically fucking died.

381
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:10,975
And now, I'm locked up
in the fucking hospital

382
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:13,049
like a goddamn prisoner!

383
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:44,244
So, what are you saying, Doctor?

384
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:48,444
I don't know.
Usually it's easy to find the inconsistencies,

385
00:44:48,552 --> 00:44:49,746
the holes in the fantasy.

386
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:52,549
Even in the most extreme cases
of posttraumatic stress,

387
00:44:52,656 --> 00:44:56,820
you get a tiny measure
of the original person.

388
00:44:56,927 --> 00:44:59,896
You know what I think, Doctor?
I think we're wasting our time.

389
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:02,591
- I think this kid is lying through her teeth.
- No.

390
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:07,169
She's not lying. She's...

391
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,537
I don't think it's that simple.

392
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:16,135
She was withholding deliberately.

393
00:45:16,246 --> 00:45:17,213
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

394
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:18,941
I thought she just ran out of imagination.

395
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:21,108
Aubrey Fleming is not short on imagination.

396
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,480
- That's for sure.
- Okay.

397
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:27,489
So, she gets to a certain point in her story
and she stops talking. Why?

398
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:31,254
Sometimes people create alter egos
to relay information

399
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:34,728
that their primary personalities
would never reveal.

400
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:37,426
So, why would the alter ego withhold?

401
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,369
I don't know.

402
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:42,636
I think she doesn't tell everybody
the whole story

403
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,935
because she doesn't think
anybody's gonna believe her.

404
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:48,011
I mean, she's not even sure
she believes what happened to her.

405
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:05,051
<i>... unconfirmed reports tonight,</i>
<i>in this News 5 exclusive,</i>

406
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:07,521
<i>that the abducted teen has been found</i>

407
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:11,123
<i>and has been secretly held</i>
<i>at New Salem Hospital for over a week.</i>

408
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:12,930
<i>- News 5 will continue to update you...</i>
- Shit.

409
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:15,231
<i>... on this story as it develops.</i>

410
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,176
No. No!

411
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:06,017
No! Get off, get him off me!

412
00:47:06,123 --> 00:47:09,991
Aubrey! What happened?
Sweetheart, what happened?

413
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:11,287
Honey, what happened?
Who did this to you?

414
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:13,761
- Somebody come in here!
- Get off of me!

415
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:16,230
It's okay, it's Daddy. It's Daddy.
It's okay. It's Daddy.

416
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,858
It's all right.

417
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:21,437
- Calm down and back away, Mr. Fleming.
- Don't you fucking touch me!

418
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:24,996
Somebody came in here and sliced up
my little girl. I want you to find him now!

419
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:28,471
No! No!

420
00:47:54,137 --> 00:47:55,900
I am Aubrey Fleming.

421
00:47:58,575 --> 00:48:00,270
My name is Aubrey Fleming.

422
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:04,177
I enjoy sunsets, long walks on the beach,
and playing the piano.

423
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:07,182
I have never seen the inside of a strip club
or a crack house,

424
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:09,809
and I have never sold my body
to hairy old men with B.O.

425
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,717
Because I am perfect.

426
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:21,163
Say hello to your new state-of-the-art hand.

427
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:31,138
Your nerve impulses get picked up
by sensors

428
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:34,802
that control six different sets of gears
and motors inside the hand,

429
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:38,780
so the movements are incredibly lifelike
and precise.

430
00:48:38,882 --> 00:48:40,474
It's so creepy.

431
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,814
No. It's beautiful.

432
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,582
Once we're sure everything works
the way it's supposed to,

433
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:47,589
we'll fit this over it.

434
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:55,425
Lovely.

435
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:58,033
Step forward.

436
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:03,529
Take your time.

437
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:08,642
Beautiful.

438
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:14,512
You're almost there, you're almost there.

439
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:21,549
Excellent, excellent. You'll be back
on the dance floor in no time, Dakota.

440
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:23,125
It's amazing.

441
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:25,717
- Thank you.
- For?

442
00:49:25,862 --> 00:49:27,727
For calling me Dakota.

443
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,964
Just don't forget to plug it in
when you're not wearing it.

444
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:35,664
If the battery runs down,
it's like dragging around a wooden leg.

445
00:49:35,772 --> 00:49:36,864
Okay.

446
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:54,749
I think we managed
to avoid all those reporters.

447
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,345
Aubrey chose the colors?

448
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:55,442
Yeah. Aubrey. Aubrey chose everything.

449
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:16,731
Thanks for putting me up for a while.
I appreciate it.

450
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:22,639
Well...

451
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:25,911
Looks like we're not the only ones
happy to see you home.

452
00:51:29,653 --> 00:51:31,314
I don't like cats.

453
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:34,488
Okay. Yeah.

454
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:37,856
If you need anything, just...

455
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:47,764
Hold it!

456
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:52,475
- ID, please.
- Yeah, sure.

457
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:58,007
Go on.

458
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:03,048
That's the boyfriend.

459
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:34,948
- Hey.
- Hi.

460
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:36,450
Dakota Moss.

461
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:39,621
Jerrod. Jerrod Pointer.

462
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:45,351
Sorry, I'm not really used to this thing yet.

463
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,923
It's fucked up though, huh?

464
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:53,268
- Thanks for seeing me.
- Yeah, sure.

465
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:56,100
Are those flowers for me?

466
00:52:56,206 --> 00:52:57,298
Yeah.

467
00:52:58,475 --> 00:52:59,669
Thanks.

468
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:03,344
Might as well sit down.

469
00:53:11,254 --> 00:53:12,221
It's upstairs.

470
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:16,956
Just keep forgetting to plug it in at night.

471
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:20,795
I was supposed to protect you.

472
00:53:20,897 --> 00:53:22,797
So, you must be Aubrey's boyfriend.

473
00:53:24,067 --> 00:53:25,159
Yeah.

474
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:28,296
I'm not Aubrey.

475
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:34,574
I'm really not Aubrey.

476
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:47,853
Aubrey wouldn't do that, would she?

477
00:53:56,466 --> 00:53:58,366
Can I get you guys anything?

478
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:02,834
Oh, hi, Mrs. Fleming.

479
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:07,009
We're gonna go upstairs.

480
00:54:10,347 --> 00:54:12,008
- Could you? Thanks.
- Sure.

481
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:25,094
- Well, you coming?
- Yeah.

482
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:32,962
Oh, and Susan, would you mind putting
the blue roses in some water for me?

483
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:34,263
Thanks.

484
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:52,121
There's only one of these,
so we better make it last.

485
00:56:38,428 --> 00:56:40,191
Don't stop! Oh, my God.

486
00:57:04,988 --> 00:57:05,977
Aubrey?

487
00:57:07,023 --> 00:57:08,320
Why are you doing this?

488
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:13,355
Did she ever fuck you like that?

489
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,529
Did she ever fuck you at all?

490
00:57:22,472 --> 00:57:23,996
Do you think she'd start now?

491
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:29,040
Look, if you want me to call you Dakota,
I'll call you Dakota.

492
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:32,808
But if you're not Aubrey,
then how'd you get all cut up?

493
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:38,887
I don't know.

494
00:57:41,357 --> 00:57:43,257
I can't really explain.

495
01:00:22,185 --> 01:00:23,379
Oh, God.

496
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:48,671
I found that heroin ho just like that.

497
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:51,939
What happened to her hand?

498
01:00:52,048 --> 01:00:54,949
Why the hell you asking me?
How should I know?

499
01:00:55,685 --> 01:00:58,119
What happened to your hand, kiddo?

500
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:02,517
I'll be okay.

501
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:04,752
What happened to your hand?

502
01:01:04,861 --> 01:01:06,726
Damn, that bitch lost a lot of blood.

503
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:09,662
You can die from losing that kind of blood.

504
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,990
Dance.

505
01:01:12,101 --> 01:01:13,295
I'm just saying!

506
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:15,430
Dance.

507
01:01:16,272 --> 01:01:20,208
Marlene is out there, and she'll kick my ass
if I go out there while she's on.

508
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:21,970
You go out there.

509
01:01:35,591 --> 01:01:36,615
So?

510
01:01:42,131 --> 01:01:43,689
I was just having a drink out back

511
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:48,066
and I dropped a glass.
Must've cut myself when I picked it up.

512
01:01:50,506 --> 01:01:52,974
How you gonna get to the emergency room?

513
01:01:53,076 --> 01:01:56,341
Hospitals are for rich people. I'll be okay.

514
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:57,811
How you gonna get home?

515
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,239
I will be fine.

516
01:02:01,017 --> 01:02:03,315
You better take an extra towel.

517
01:02:14,997 --> 01:02:16,965
You got to hold it higher.

518
01:02:20,203 --> 01:02:22,398
You got to hold it higher than your heart.

519
01:02:37,687 --> 01:02:40,315
Aren't you gonna ask me what happened?

520
01:02:44,393 --> 01:02:45,917
People get cut.

521
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:48,662
That's life.

522
01:02:56,506 --> 01:02:58,701
People get cut. That's life.

523
01:03:01,244 --> 01:03:02,404
Jesus.

524
01:03:03,212 --> 01:03:04,679
So my finger got cut off,

525
01:03:05,648 --> 01:03:07,172
but nobody did it.

526
01:03:08,317 --> 01:03:10,308
Who's gonna believe that?

527
01:03:12,088 --> 01:03:14,386
Look at you. You don't even believe it.

528
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:15,582
Yeah, I do.

529
01:03:16,759 --> 01:03:18,192
That's because I fucked you.

530
01:03:22,665 --> 01:03:24,633
- What is it?
- My foot.

531
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:29,705
Wrong foot.

532
01:03:31,073 --> 01:03:33,234
It's phantom limb pain.

533
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:38,444
It's enough to make you
believe in ghosts, huh?

534
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:42,075
You know,
maybe that's why ghosts are restless.

535
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:48,318
Because there's nothing left
of what they were except for the pain.

536
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:54,161
I need your help, Jerrod.

537
01:04:15,952 --> 01:04:17,283
Piece of shit.

538
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:21,289
Hey. You got a condom, man?

539
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:23,187
- No!
- What? I'm serious. I'll buy it off you.

540
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:25,055
I'm sorry, kid. I don't have one.

541
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:28,796
Hey, any of you guys got a rubber?

542
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,534
No, I'm... You don't carry rubbers?

543
01:04:33,936 --> 01:04:35,130
Thanks.

544
01:04:42,812 --> 01:04:44,245
Hey, hey!

545
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:48,610
Where you headed, boy?

546
01:04:49,252 --> 01:04:51,277
Just let me through, okay?

547
01:04:52,688 --> 01:04:54,713
- Go ahead, kid.
- Thank you.

548
01:05:04,634 --> 01:05:07,125
We're at the Tolands' house. Here.

549
01:05:10,506 --> 01:05:12,940
- Not so hard.
- Sorry.

550
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:14,873
So, this is it?

551
01:05:14,977 --> 01:05:18,105
- You want me to go in with you?
- No, it's okay.

552
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:20,910
You probably better go back.
They might get suspicious.

553
01:05:32,061 --> 01:05:33,585
- Okay.
- All right.

554
01:05:33,696 --> 01:05:34,754
Bye.

555
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:21,234
Why did you have to come here, Aubrey?

556
01:06:23,546 --> 01:06:26,481
You've still got your life.
Nobody in this house has any left.

557
01:06:27,616 --> 01:06:29,811
And you're not cooperating with the police.

558
01:06:30,086 --> 01:06:33,283
I've heard all about it.
You know, you could help find the monster.

559
01:06:35,057 --> 01:06:36,786
I'm sorry, I can't.

560
01:06:46,068 --> 01:06:49,003
I know you didn't come over here
to upset us.

561
01:06:54,043 --> 01:06:56,011
Just seeing her room would be enough.

562
01:08:20,129 --> 01:08:21,323
Aubrey!

563
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:28,232
This is what they call protecting us?

564
01:08:28,337 --> 01:08:29,668
- Where the hell was Lanny Rierden?
- All right.

565
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:32,002
Daniel, come on. Just calm down.
She's safe.

566
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:34,076
I mean, he's mad because he knows
I'm telling the truth.

567
01:08:34,176 --> 01:08:38,738
- He knows Aubrey's still out there.
- Aubrey, please. Just shut the fuck up.

568
01:08:41,183 --> 01:08:43,208
Latest DNA test came back.

569
01:08:45,321 --> 01:08:48,085
Hello? Julie?
You want to take a look at them?

570
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:50,215
Take a look at this.

571
01:08:50,326 --> 01:08:53,625
I thought I should go over
Aubrey's hard drive one more time, right?

572
01:08:55,498 --> 01:08:58,899
<i>" She wrote down the name</i>
<i>and her real mother's last known address,</i>

573
01:08:59,001 --> 01:09:03,631
"but it was what she saw next that
slammed her in the gut like a celestial fist.

574
01:09:03,739 --> 01:09:07,675
"She stared at the hospital records
in disbelief. It couldn't be true.

575
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:10,267
"But there it was, in black and white.

576
01:09:10,379 --> 01:09:13,143
"Not only did she have a mother
she'd never met,

577
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:15,581
"she also had an identical twin.

578
01:09:16,852 --> 01:09:21,755
"But Virginia Sue Moss had left town
with her twin sister almost 20 years ago.

579
01:09:21,857 --> 01:09:24,587
"How would she ever find her other half?

580
01:09:24,693 --> 01:09:27,856
"She knew only that she had to try.
She had no choice.

581
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:30,792
"To be continued."

582
01:09:32,635 --> 01:09:33,897
Moss.

583
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:35,994
As in Dakota Moss. Yeah.

584
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:39,765
- So this proves that...
- That she's always been

585
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:41,342
and always will be Aubrey Fleming.

586
01:09:41,443 --> 01:09:44,037
I mean, she's living inside a world
she made up.

587
01:09:45,147 --> 01:09:48,412
So the DNA test comparing
Aubrey and Dakota...

588
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:49,643
Came back identical.

589
01:09:50,419 --> 01:09:52,148
Damn right, it did.

590
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:08,936
Higher than your heart.

591
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:22,580
Odd, even.

592
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:26,280
Right, left.

593
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:28,982
Rest, motion.

594
01:10:29,091 --> 01:10:30,752
Peace, war.

595
01:10:32,294 --> 01:10:34,888
Love, hate.

596
01:10:34,997 --> 01:10:36,965
Two halves to everything.

597
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:40,558
Sometimes people get cut.

598
01:10:44,206 --> 01:10:46,606
Sometimes people get cut in half.

599
01:12:33,916 --> 01:12:38,148
<i>Darker than the shadowy depths</i>
<i>of the deepest ocean,</i>

<i>more infinite than the starry universe,</i>
<i>in three meager pounds,</i>

601

603
01:12:52,401 --> 01:12:54,733
<i>The best documented case</i>
<i>of stigmatic twins</i>

604
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:59,667
<i>is that of Joseph K., 35,</i>
<i>and his twin brother, Jacob.</i>

605
01:13:01,176 --> 01:13:05,442
<i>Jacob K. Was a petty thief</i>
<i>with a gambling problem.</i>

606
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:09,347
<i>He owed more than $5,000 to the mob.</i>

607
01:13:09,451 --> 01:13:13,080
<i>Unable to pay off his loan,</i>
<i>Jacob K. Was targeted for assassination</i>

608
01:13:13,188 --> 01:13:16,521
<i>on the night of December 18th, 1944.</i>

609
01:13:19,762 --> 01:13:22,560

610
01:13:22,664 --> 01:13:27,601

611
01:13:27,703 --> 01:13:30,695
<i>Lacking all explanation,</i>
<i>authorities concluded</i>

612
01:13:30,806 --> 01:13:33,900
<i>that Joseph K. 's wound was self-inflicted.</i>

613
01:13:34,009 --> 01:13:37,172
<i>They failed, however,</i>
<i>to address just how he could've known</i>

614
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:40,339
<i>the precise location</i>
<i>of his brother's mortal wound</i>

615
01:13:41,316 --> 01:13:46,185
<i>or how both men happened to die</i>
<i>at the same hour, miles apart.</i>

616
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:51,783
Hey.

617
01:13:51,894 --> 01:13:54,294
I saw the light. You all right?

618
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:57,229
Yeah. I couldn't sleep.

619
01:14:00,169 --> 01:14:03,002
This is a non-smoking house, young lady.

620
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:11,575
And will remain one.

621
01:14:13,982 --> 01:14:17,679
You know, I think that's the first time
I've seen you...

622
01:14:24,927 --> 01:14:27,919
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay. I shouldn't have.

623
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:31,162
I think I'm Aubrey's twin sister.

624
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:34,393
Her identical twin sister.

625
01:14:34,503 --> 01:14:36,937
I mean, hospitals make mistakes.
We could've been separated at birth.

626
01:14:38,607 --> 01:14:41,075
Look at this house,
this life that your daughter had.

627
01:14:41,176 --> 01:14:44,270
Why would I pretend to be some loser
if this was all mine, huh?

628
01:14:45,414 --> 01:14:47,245
It's like a bad dream, sweetie.

629
01:14:48,417 --> 01:14:53,047
And someday very soon,
you're gonna wake up and realize the truth.

630
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:55,385
But it's possible we could be twins, right?

631
01:14:57,860 --> 01:14:59,088
You see?

632
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:04,464
You were all by yourself in there.

633
01:15:06,735 --> 01:15:09,533
No twin sister. Just you.

634
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:17,938
I'm not much of a crier, you know,

635
01:15:19,648 --> 01:15:21,775
but I cried when I saw this.

636
01:15:24,086 --> 01:15:25,678
Daniel and I...

637
01:15:28,156 --> 01:15:29,350
I fell.

638
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:32,186
And

639
01:15:33,795 --> 01:15:37,959
they made me stay in my bed,
flat on my back, for about six weeks.

640
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:42,128
Six weeks towards the end,
but it was worth it.

641
01:15:42,237 --> 01:15:44,899
I mean, there were times when I thought,

642
01:15:45,007 --> 01:15:47,737
"I'm not gonna be able
to stand another moment of this."

643
01:15:48,577 --> 01:15:52,240
But there were also...
There were times when you'd get

644
01:15:52,347 --> 01:15:54,838
real still on me.

645
01:15:56,218 --> 01:16:00,245
And I'd take both my hands,
I'd put them on my belly, and I said,

646
01:16:00,355 --> 01:16:04,086
"Kick. Kick the hell out of me, girl.
Show me what you got."

647
01:16:04,192 --> 01:16:07,252
And you'd kick. Every time.

648
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:11,423
The night you were born. Oh, my God.

649
01:16:12,668 --> 01:16:13,828
It was terrifying.

650
01:16:15,370 --> 01:16:19,033
I barely saw you,
and they took you away from me.

651
01:16:19,141 --> 01:16:22,508
And it was...
It was touch-and-go for two whole days.

652
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:27,139
And then finally,
finally I had you in my arms.

653
01:16:29,184 --> 01:16:30,811
A little miracle.

654
01:16:33,322 --> 01:16:37,156
I'm not trying to prove you wrong,
you know?

655
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:41,256
I'm really just trying to help you see.

656
01:16:49,171 --> 01:16:50,365
I know.

657
01:16:54,242 --> 01:16:56,233
But you don't believe me.

658
01:17:02,384 --> 01:17:05,148
But you don't need me
to believe you, sweetheart.

659
01:17:06,321 --> 01:17:09,222
When I think we'll never be normal again...

660
01:17:13,695 --> 01:17:14,662
I...

661
01:17:15,897 --> 01:17:19,094
I see that about you. That strength.

662
01:17:22,938 --> 01:17:27,932
And I think, you know, we'll be all right.
No matter what.

663
01:17:28,043 --> 01:17:30,375
Different, maybe, but all right.

664
01:17:31,847 --> 01:17:33,474
'Cause you're a kicker, girl.

665
01:17:35,384 --> 01:17:36,817
You go right ahead

666
01:17:36,918 --> 01:17:40,752
and you kick your way
to the other side of this problem.

667
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:46,290
I'm gonna be there every step of the way
if you need me.

668
01:18:30,906 --> 01:18:31,998
Shit.

669
01:18:36,812 --> 01:18:38,302
<i>Dakota.</i>

670
01:20:10,405 --> 01:20:12,134
I know what you did, Daniel.

671
01:20:12,941 --> 01:20:15,239
- Susan's baby died in the incubator.
- She what?

672
01:20:15,343 --> 01:20:17,106
You bought Aubrey
from the crack head down the hall

673
01:20:17,212 --> 01:20:18,236
because she had one to spare.

674
01:20:18,346 --> 01:20:19,313
- You're Aubrey.
- Not me.

675
01:20:19,414 --> 01:20:20,381
- Hey, you're Aubrey.
- Not me, Daniel.

676
01:20:20,515 --> 01:20:21,504
- You were kidnapped...
- I'm not Aubrey.

677
01:20:21,616 --> 01:20:24,210
...and you were hurt, and you're home now.
- Daniel, I'm not Aubrey.

678
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:25,786
I'm her twin. Stop it!

679
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:28,914
I'm her twin.

680
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:31,891
Daniel, you're the only one who knows
that there are really two of us.

681
01:20:31,993 --> 01:20:34,359
- You have to help me.
- I'm trying to help you, honey. I am.

682
01:20:34,462 --> 01:20:36,089
No, I saw the envelopes.

683
01:20:37,232 --> 01:20:38,824
I saw the New Salem postmarks.

684
01:20:40,135 --> 01:20:41,932
A little cash on an ongoing basis.

685
01:20:42,037 --> 01:20:44,096
One hits the jackpot,
the other one gets stuck

686
01:20:44,206 --> 01:20:47,573
- with Virginia Sue Moss.
- Okay, enough, okay? Just...

687
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:51,404
I'm tired of this shit, okay? Just...

688
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:57,950
I'm gonna get you some ice.

689
01:20:58,053 --> 01:21:00,578
So you'd let both of us die
just to keep your secret?

690
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:01,713
No!

691
01:21:07,596 --> 01:21:10,463
She lost this one first. So did I.

692
01:21:13,235 --> 01:21:14,327
Fuck.

693
01:21:59,214 --> 01:22:00,272
Fuck!

694
01:22:39,054 --> 01:22:40,248
Oh, my...

695
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:53,265
Oh, my God.

696
01:22:59,841 --> 01:23:02,332
<i>I always felt like half a person.</i>

697
01:23:02,444 --> 01:23:04,241
<i>You know, half a person with half a soul.</i>

698
01:23:05,313 --> 01:23:08,077
<i>It never occurred to me</i>
<i>that I may possibly have a twin.</i>

699
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:12,818
<i>All I had to go on was a gut feeling</i>
<i>and a New Salem postmark.</i>

700
01:23:26,401 --> 01:23:29,461
Look, Daniel, I know you may not care
about what happened to me.

701
01:23:30,438 --> 01:23:32,429
But what about Aubrey?

702
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:34,838
What about the girl you raised
to be your daughter?

703
01:23:34,943 --> 01:23:37,639
Everything that happens to Aubrey
happens to me.

704
01:23:38,646 --> 01:23:42,047
He still has her, okay?

705
01:23:42,417 --> 01:23:44,317
Now, are you gonna help me find her?

706
01:23:46,821 --> 01:23:48,152
- I can't.
- You can't?

707
01:23:48,256 --> 01:23:51,157
- I can't risk losing this.
- You're pathetic.

708
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:54,988
Go fuck yourself.

709
01:26:19,774 --> 01:26:21,833
"Blue ribbons are for winners.

710
01:26:23,144 --> 01:26:25,305
"Never settle for the red.

711
01:26:26,848 --> 01:26:29,214
"Rest in peace. Douglas."

712
01:26:42,564 --> 01:26:45,089
- It's okay, it's me.
- I know who killed me.

713
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:46,758
You're alive, Dakota, okay? You're not...

714
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:48,130
No, look.

715
01:26:57,545 --> 01:26:59,570
We really shouldn't go up there
without letting somebody know.

716
01:26:59,681 --> 01:27:03,117
- We don't have enough time.
- I know, I know, I know.

717
01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:07,450
<i>Dakota, there's not enough air.</i>

718
01:27:07,555 --> 01:27:09,648
- What is it?
- I can't...

719
01:27:09,757 --> 01:27:11,019
- Hold on. Just breathe.
- No, I can't breathe.

720
01:27:11,125 --> 01:27:12,092
- Breathe. You're having a panic...
- I can't.

721
01:27:12,193 --> 01:27:13,990
- You're having a panic attack. Just breathe.
- I can't breathe.

722
01:27:14,095 --> 01:27:15,221
It's okay. Come on, breathe.

723
01:27:15,330 --> 01:27:17,798
It's okay. It's okay.

724
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:20,959
You need to breathe. Good, good. Breathe.

725
01:27:33,648 --> 01:27:36,378
I should've believed you from the start.

726
01:27:37,919 --> 01:27:39,250
I'm sorry.

01:29:21,189 --> 01:29:26,855
Oh, come on. Just breathe, Aubrey.
Breathe. Slowly.

731
01:32:21,269 --> 01:32:22,531
Fuck you!

01:34:10,344 --> 01:34:11,709
Oh, my God.

733

You should be dead by now.

Why aren't you dead?

How did you get away from me?

744
01:37:57,938 --> 01:37:59,929
How did you get out, huh?

745
01:38:02,343 --> 01:38:07,303
