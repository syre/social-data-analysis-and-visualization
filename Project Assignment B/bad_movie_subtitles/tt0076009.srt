1
00:02:06,484 --> 00:02:09,953
Oh, Father.

2
00:02:17,078 --> 00:02:23,250
Father Merrin, in the valley
of the shadow of death...

3
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:25,969
be at my side.

4
00:03:08,213 --> 00:03:10,881
Why me?

5
00:03:10,882 --> 00:03:13,967
I heal the sick.

6
00:03:13,968 --> 00:03:16,512
Why me?

7
00:04:05,395 --> 00:04:08,780
Okay, 8:00 tomorrow.

8
00:04:51,941 --> 00:04:54,242
Debbie.

9
00:04:54,736 --> 00:04:57,321
Debbie, can you hear it?

10
00:04:57,322 --> 00:04:59,239
No?

11
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,958
I'll turn it up.

12
00:05:02,243 --> 00:05:06,129
Debbie, Debbie.

13
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,958
You can hear it?

14
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:13,178
Debbie. Debbie.

15
00:05:16,424 --> 00:05:18,550
Debbie.

16
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:21,470
Mother's late. She's never on time.

17
00:05:21,471 --> 00:05:24,473
- Hi.
- Hi, Regan! You're right on time.

18
00:05:24,474 --> 00:05:26,983
- For once.
- Yeah.

19
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,928
- Hi.
- Hi.

20
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,061
What's happening?

21
00:06:03,179 --> 00:06:05,564
Not much.

22
00:06:05,682 --> 00:06:09,226
- Any dreams?
- No dreams.

23
00:06:09,227 --> 00:06:11,403
Okay.

24
00:06:14,857 --> 00:06:20,028
- Look, I'm just wasting your time.
- Why do you say that?

25
00:06:20,029 --> 00:06:24,791
- Well, you know why I come here.
- Well, you tell me.

26
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:29,830
- To make my mom feel better.
- Explain that, would you?

27
00:06:29,831 --> 00:06:33,417
- She feels guilty.
- Why?

28
00:06:33,418 --> 00:06:37,004
Divorce, her career...

29
00:06:37,005 --> 00:06:39,598
away all the time.

30
00:06:39,716 --> 00:06:44,720
Regan? Why don't you tell me
the truth? Don't you trust me?

31
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:46,847
But I do. I do.

32
00:06:46,848 --> 00:06:51,435
You keep saying you don't
remember that time in Washington.

33
00:06:51,436 --> 00:06:54,362
I don't know if I believe you.

34
00:06:55,064 --> 00:07:01,661
I remember being very sick and
having nightmares, and that's all.

35
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:07,701
Those bad dreams
are still inside you.

36
00:07:07,702 --> 00:07:11,046
There's nothing wrong with me.

37
00:07:13,249 --> 00:07:18,011
Regan? Regan? I want
to show you something.

38
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:24,259
You see this? This is a
machine we can use together.

39
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:31,016
It can put us in a state of hypnosis.
You'd be very relaxed and comfortable.

40
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:36,563
And then we could look at those bad
dreams together and understand them.

41
00:07:36,564 --> 00:07:40,901
And dissolve them.
You wouldn't be alone, Regan.

42
00:07:40,902 --> 00:07:46,073
- How do you feel about that?
- I don't think you're ready for it.

43
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,160
What does that mean?

44
00:07:50,161 --> 00:07:54,631
You're the doctor. You explain it.

45
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,769
Follow me, please.

46
00:08:30,451 --> 00:08:36,798
Cardinal Jaros, may I present Father
Philip Lamont, Society of Jesus?

47
00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:46,633
Would you care to explain your
refusal to accept this task?

48
00:08:46,634 --> 00:08:52,347
I should be relieved from all pastoral
responsibilities. I'm not worthy.

49
00:08:52,348 --> 00:08:56,685
Father, I have not asked you
to perform another exorcism.

50
00:08:56,686 --> 00:09:03,358
I simply requested that you investigate
the death of Father Merrin.

51
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:08,488
You have performed exorcisms.
You knew Father Merrin.

52
00:09:08,489 --> 00:09:12,534
Furthermore, you were
exposed to his teachings.

53
00:09:12,535 --> 00:09:18,465
I cannot think of anyone more
qualified for this assignment.

54
00:09:20,334 --> 00:09:24,095
Philip, it's so good to see you.

55
00:09:24,338 --> 00:09:30,886
Merrin's, uh, reputation is in jeopardy.
His writings have been impounded.

56
00:09:30,887 --> 00:09:36,391
I'm not surprised. No one in the
church wants to hear about the devil.

57
00:09:36,392 --> 00:09:41,396
Satan has become an embarrassment
to our progressive views.

58
00:09:41,397 --> 00:09:45,275
Merrin was rather more
extreme, I'm afraid.

59
00:09:45,276 --> 00:09:51,406
He argued that the power of evil
threatens to overthrow God himself.

60
00:09:51,407 --> 00:09:55,494
So they found a heresy
to nail him to.

61
00:09:55,495 --> 00:10:00,624
Well, uh, many of the theological
college believe that...

62
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:04,211
he died at the hands of the devil...

63
00:10:04,212 --> 00:10:07,464
during that, uh, American exorcism.

64
00:10:07,465 --> 00:10:12,677
Some, and they are close to
the pontiff, go so far as to suggest...

65
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:17,307
that he was a Satanist.
At the end, I mean.

66
00:10:17,308 --> 00:10:21,144
Perhaps Father Merrin took
a path no one could follow.

67
00:10:21,145 --> 00:10:24,105
But how he inspired us, Philip!

68
00:10:24,106 --> 00:10:29,953
Here. Remember,
Christ is hard to follow too.

69
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:37,452
We were young. Today,
wherever I look, I see only evil.

70
00:10:37,453 --> 00:10:40,672
God has fallen silent.

71
00:10:44,252 --> 00:10:48,672
I cannot move to safeguard
Merrin's testament...

72
00:10:48,673 --> 00:10:54,678
until all the facts about his
last exorcism are clearly known.

73
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:57,681
You will conduct the investigation.

74
00:10:57,682 --> 00:11:02,894
You will act discreetly in all
confidence, reporting to me alone.

75
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,980
But I'm not worthy!

76
00:11:04,981 --> 00:11:09,242
You are a soldier of Christ.
Make yourself worthy.

77
00:11:21,455 --> 00:11:28,177
I want you to concentrate hard on
the name of this color. All right?

78
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:42,726
- Gene Tuskin, Father.
- Lamont, doctor.

79
00:11:42,727 --> 00:11:44,861
Come on in.

80
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:53,153
- Liz, what does he want?
- How would I know, Regan?

81
00:11:53,154 --> 00:11:56,331
He's here about me, isn't he?

82
00:11:56,741 --> 00:11:59,250
Why do you say that?

83
00:12:01,203 --> 00:12:06,791
What about the coroner's report,
the testimony? The file's that thick.

84
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,460
Yes, I know.

85
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:13,923
Unfortunately, it sheds very little
light on Father Merrin's death.

86
00:12:13,924 --> 00:12:17,510
I was hoping to question the girl.

87
00:12:17,511 --> 00:12:20,730
- Why don't you sit down?
- Thank you.

88
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:27,604
Regan suffered a severe
trauma by that experience.

89
00:12:27,605 --> 00:12:32,200
I think the exorcism
made the problem worse.

90
00:12:32,777 --> 00:12:35,820
You must know that three people died.

91
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:40,283
Regan's guilt was so great,
she repressed everything.

92
00:12:40,284 --> 00:12:44,371
I'm sorry, Father. I can't
let you question her.

93
00:12:44,372 --> 00:12:49,918
The shock of recall could
result in self-punishment.

94
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:53,262
I couldn't rule out suicide.

95
00:12:54,298 --> 00:12:59,310
You have a heavy responsibility:
the care of her soul.

96
00:12:59,595 --> 00:13:05,358
The care of her mind and her
body is my responsibility, Father.

97
00:13:08,062 --> 00:13:11,823
You realize what you're
up against, don't you?

98
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,957
- What am I up against, Father?
- Evil.

99
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,665
Mental illness. That's what
we're up against here.

100
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:32,836
Or the casualties of a
diseased society. Evil is not...

101
00:13:32,837 --> 00:13:38,016
Evil is a spiritual being,
alive and living.

102
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:43,972
Perverted and perverting, weaving
its way into the very fabric of life.

103
00:13:43,973 --> 00:13:46,975
- Sorry to disturb you.
- What is it?

104
00:13:46,976 --> 00:13:51,813
I've changed my mind. I'd like
to try that machine after all.

105
00:13:51,814 --> 00:13:54,899
- Fine.
- Could we try it now?

106
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,902
I'm sorry.
I won't intrude any longer.

107
00:13:57,903 --> 00:14:01,781
It's okay, Father.
You can stay if you'd like.

108
00:14:01,782 --> 00:14:06,669
Uh, Regan, this is Father Lamont.
Regan MacNeil.

109
00:14:06,871 --> 00:14:09,706
- Hello.
- How do you do?

110
00:14:09,707 --> 00:14:13,543
Well, we can do it
tomorrow then, Regan. Okay?

111
00:14:13,544 --> 00:14:16,679
Father, maybe you can help me.

112
00:14:18,007 --> 00:14:20,516
- All right, Regan?
- Good.

113
00:14:20,801 --> 00:14:26,931
Experiments show that thought
can transmit across distances.

114
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:31,269
- Here he is, causing a spoon to bend.
- Sharon.

115
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,063
- Not on a stage...
- Look, I can do it.

116
00:14:34,064 --> 00:14:39,986
...but under laboratory controls and
observed by skeptical scientists.

117
00:14:39,987 --> 00:14:43,239
- It's easy.
- Good God, Regan.

118
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,327
...they seem to defy natural laws.
How can that be?

119
00:14:47,328 --> 00:14:51,664
Oh, look, you fool.
You believe everything!

120
00:14:51,665 --> 00:14:53,833
Oh, wait, wait.

121
00:14:53,834 --> 00:14:58,387
...but is merely an illusion:
a projection of the mind.

122
00:14:58,714 --> 00:15:04,177
These are EEG biofeedback electrodes.
They pick up any brain frequency.

123
00:15:04,178 --> 00:15:07,347
They're integrated
with these strobes...

124
00:15:07,348 --> 00:15:11,184
to bring two altered states
into synchronization.

125
00:15:11,185 --> 00:15:13,561
- Are you ready, Regan?
- Yes.

126
00:15:13,562 --> 00:15:17,524
We're going to do this
just the way I showed you.

127
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:20,910
Now, I want you to relax your arms.

128
00:15:27,451 --> 00:15:32,171
Now, I want you to concentrate
on the strobe light.

129
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:36,551
Deeply, relax.

130
00:15:37,461 --> 00:15:41,764
Just let yourself go
and look at the light.

131
00:15:55,437 --> 00:16:00,199
Now, I want you to relax and
make your tone go deeper.

132
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:05,121
Listen to your tone.

133
00:16:05,406 --> 00:16:07,623
Deeper.

134
00:16:14,081 --> 00:16:16,632
Deeper, Regan.

135
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:22,847
Can you hear me, Regan?

136
00:16:23,132 --> 00:16:24,799
Yes.

137
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,804
When you hear the alarm buzzer,
you will wake up and feel fine...

138
00:16:29,805 --> 00:16:35,101
but you will remember nothing
that happened. Do you understand?

139
00:16:35,102 --> 00:16:36,769
Yes.

140
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:43,326
Very good. Now, do you remember
your room in Washington?

141
00:16:44,028 --> 00:16:45,737
Yes.

142
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:50,033
- Can you see your room?
- No.

143
00:16:50,034 --> 00:16:53,202
Then I want you to go deeper.

144
00:16:53,203 --> 00:16:57,665
Go deeper into your memory
until you can see your room.

145
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:01,552
Make your tone go deeper,
and you will see it.

146
00:17:03,714 --> 00:17:06,015
Deeper.

147
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:10,186
Deeper, Regan. Deeper.

148
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:14,774
Can you see it now?

149
00:17:18,312 --> 00:17:20,071
Yes.

150
00:17:24,693 --> 00:17:30,281
I want to come down and be with you.
Do you remember how to help me?

151
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:31,741
Yes.

152
00:17:31,742 --> 00:17:35,119
Good. Bring me down to where you are.

153
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,548
You and I will obey the commands
that Liz and Father Lamont give us.

154
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,293
Do you understand?

155
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:44,220
Yes.

156
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,924
I'm going to turn my light on now.

157
00:17:47,925 --> 00:17:52,311
And you will help me bring
my tone down to yours.

158
00:18:07,111 --> 00:18:09,328
Can you hear me, Gene?

159
00:18:10,114 --> 00:18:12,081
Yes.

160
00:18:12,116 --> 00:18:14,158
Relax then.

161
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:21,082
And let yourself come
down deeper and deeper...

162
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:24,051
to meet my tone.

163
00:18:24,545 --> 00:18:26,379
Relax.

164
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:31,100
Deeper.

165
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,645
Good.

166
00:18:34,763 --> 00:18:40,526
- Doctor, can you see Regan's room?
- Yes.

167
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:49,527
Regan, do you remember the time
Father Merrin came up to you?

168
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,287
Yes.

169
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:56,959
Regan, you will now
respond to Father Lamont.

170
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,170
- Regan?
- Yes?

171
00:19:07,171 --> 00:19:10,006
That time in the room...

172
00:19:10,007 --> 00:19:14,310
try and remember Father
Merrin just before he died.

173
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:20,524
- We're alone.
- Is his heart strong? Resolved?

174
00:19:21,018 --> 00:19:23,194
He is praying.

175
00:19:23,812 --> 00:19:27,740
- Is he in pain?
- Yes.

176
00:19:29,193 --> 00:19:34,663
- Is he casting out the unclean spirit?
- He is praying.

177
00:19:35,324 --> 00:19:39,919
And you, Regan. What are you doing?

178
00:19:57,012 --> 00:19:59,230
Dr. Tuskin?

179
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:03,401
Gene?

180
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:06,612
Gene, wake up!

181
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:12,068
- What's wrong with Gene?
- Her heart, it's fibrillating!

182
00:20:12,069 --> 00:20:16,405
Put that on. You've gotta go
back and find her right now.

183
00:20:16,406 --> 00:20:22,044
I know where she is. Help me to find
and reach her. Liz, put this on.

184
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:31,637
- Liz, help me to reach Dr. Tuskin.
- All right, we'll try.

185
00:20:36,218 --> 00:20:39,478
Relax deeply, watch the light.

186
00:20:48,897 --> 00:20:53,742
That's good.
Let yourself go down deeper.

187
00:20:54,736 --> 00:20:58,372
Listen to your tone,
and make it go deeper.

188
00:20:59,616 --> 00:21:01,584
Deeper.

189
00:21:02,244 --> 00:21:05,921
Deeper. Deeper.

190
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,334
Get thee hence!

191
00:21:51,335 --> 00:21:54,629
She's mine, always.

192
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,297
No!

193
00:21:56,298 --> 00:21:58,390
Always.

194
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,887
Always.

195
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:05,314
Father, please. Bring her back.

196
00:22:08,227 --> 00:22:11,487
Father, can you hear me?

197
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:24,458
Father, please. Bring her back.

198
00:23:28,348 --> 00:23:30,232
In God's name!

199
00:23:34,938 --> 00:23:38,574
Tell Gene she will not remember.

200
00:23:39,067 --> 00:23:44,121
Gene, you will not remember.
Gene, you will not remember.

201
00:24:00,797 --> 00:24:03,591
- What happened?
- Are you all right?

202
00:24:03,592 --> 00:24:07,970
Your heart was fibrillating.
I don't know what went wrong.

203
00:24:07,971 --> 00:24:10,514
I couldn't bring you out of it.

204
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:16,528
Father Lamont had to go into synch to
contact you. He brought you out of it.

205
00:24:17,272 --> 00:24:22,234
- He told you not to remember.
- Do you remember?

206
00:24:22,235 --> 00:24:24,411
No.

207
00:24:28,408 --> 00:24:31,043
Do you remember?

208
00:24:35,082 --> 00:24:37,299
Come on, Regan.

209
00:24:37,834 --> 00:24:40,427
I'll be right back.

210
00:24:46,343 --> 00:24:49,637
I bet they're pretty drawings.
How are you?

211
00:24:49,638 --> 00:24:54,225
Want me to draw a picture?
What would you like me to draw?

212
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:57,945
- A house.
- A house?

213
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:01,615
Why do you want a house?
A house is dull.

214
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:06,078
How about if I draw you a face?

215
00:25:15,205 --> 00:25:18,290
- How do you feel?
- All right. You?

216
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:19,959
Oh, I'm fine.

217
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:25,631
The psychological effects of synching
with another mind last a long time.

218
00:25:25,632 --> 00:25:27,975
It's very powerful.

219
00:25:30,053 --> 00:25:35,850
- Did you see what you wanted to see?
- Evil is gaining.

220
00:25:35,851 --> 00:25:40,813
- Father Merrin was killed.
- By Regan?

221
00:25:40,814 --> 00:25:45,776
She didn't. It did.
It wasn't the mind of a child.

222
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:50,289
It was horrible. Utterly horrible.

223
00:25:51,032 --> 00:25:53,208
And fascinating.

224
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:59,582
We don't know all that much
about synchronized hypnosis yet.

225
00:25:59,583 --> 00:26:05,087
What you saw could have been
a dream, a fantasy, a hallucination.

226
00:26:05,088 --> 00:26:07,173
Not a memory at all.

227
00:26:07,174 --> 00:26:13,228
Names, just names. Better to see
the face than hear the names.

228
00:26:18,435 --> 00:26:22,646
I can't have a discussion now.
I have to do my rounds.

229
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:24,440
Doctor, what I saw...

230
00:26:24,441 --> 00:26:28,619
I'm sorry. It'll have
to wait till tomorrow.

231
00:26:28,695 --> 00:26:30,954
Hi, Amy.

232
00:26:31,948 --> 00:26:37,419
Father, Regan did a picture of you.

233
00:26:39,498 --> 00:26:41,290
What's it mean?

234
00:26:41,291 --> 00:26:45,761
It's you. She draws well.

235
00:26:46,087 --> 00:26:48,263
The flames.

236
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:52,017
Flames.

237
00:27:05,315 --> 00:27:10,736
Doctor. Doctor, the flames.
They're getting bigger.

238
00:27:10,737 --> 00:27:14,573
- We've got to put the fire out.
- Take it easy.

239
00:27:14,574 --> 00:27:19,703
It's probably some post-flashing.
It's an aftereffect of hypnosis.

240
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:23,499
No, you've got to help me.
We may be too late.

241
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:28,804
- Where you going?
- You've got to help me. Her picture.

242
00:27:34,928 --> 00:27:40,816
- Come on, Father. Give me a break.
- No, there's a fire somewhere.

243
00:27:55,615 --> 00:27:58,959
I'll get the fire department.

244
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:24,192
Okay.

245
00:29:09,856 --> 00:29:15,911
You kids can go on in now.
Everything's okay. Go on in now.

246
00:29:17,864 --> 00:29:20,916
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

247
00:29:22,786 --> 00:29:25,204
- Thank you.
- I got it.

248
00:29:25,205 --> 00:29:28,707
Regan's picture, the flames.
She warned us.

249
00:29:28,708 --> 00:29:33,170
That contact between us came
about through your machine.

250
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:36,674
Whatever it was,
it saved the children.

251
00:29:36,675 --> 00:29:41,929
It took a machine. The work you're
doing is incredible. Miraculous!

252
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:46,350
The machine is a device to
penetrate pathological states.

253
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:51,313
No, you're talking about therapy.
You don't realize the importance!

254
00:29:51,314 --> 00:29:55,651
As much as I enjoy recognition,
you're overstating it.

255
00:29:55,652 --> 00:30:00,781
Don't you understand that I was
face to face with the evil in her?

256
00:30:00,782 --> 00:30:05,911
Your machine has proved that there's
an ancient demon within her!

257
00:30:05,912 --> 00:30:09,715
We must fight it, we must help her!

258
00:30:11,167 --> 00:30:16,179
It's all okay now.
You can go on in, all right?

259
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:21,343
I was trying to help her
before you came along.

260
00:30:21,344 --> 00:30:27,024
You must let me synch with Regan!
And that way, you can control things.

261
00:30:28,685 --> 00:30:31,145
Well, I just don't know.

262
00:30:31,146 --> 00:30:35,323
Listen, you can go in now.
It's all clear, okay?

263
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:42,406
I know what concerns you.

264
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:47,161
That Regan will suddenly remember.
That she'll go into shock.

265
00:30:47,162 --> 00:30:51,081
I believe that Regan already
remembers everything.

266
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:54,293
The deaths, the possessions,
the demons.

267
00:30:54,294 --> 00:31:01,266
She's out there, all alone,
trying to deal with this thing.

268
00:31:01,342 --> 00:31:03,143
All by herself.

269
00:31:08,808 --> 00:31:13,779
Regan. Regan.

270
00:31:15,857 --> 00:31:22,070
Regan.

271
00:31:22,071 --> 00:31:26,450
Come, Regan.

272
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:29,995
We're going flying.

273
00:31:29,996 --> 00:31:34,174
Far, far away.

274
00:34:33,054 --> 00:34:35,563
Regan.

275
00:34:37,517 --> 00:34:39,549
Regan?

276
00:34:43,447 --> 00:34:45,480
Regan?

277
00:34:46,442 --> 00:34:49,160
Oh, good morning, Sharon.

278
00:34:57,578 --> 00:34:59,913
What got you up so early?

279
00:34:59,914 --> 00:35:04,384
The doves woke me.
I guess they were hungry.

280
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:09,381
I may not be here when you get home.
Can you let yourself in?

281
00:35:09,382 --> 00:35:12,592
- Will you be all right?
- Where are you going?

282
00:35:12,593 --> 00:35:16,096
- Washington. I'll be back soon.
- Washington?

283
00:35:16,097 --> 00:35:20,559
Some things your mother didn't
do before going on location.

284
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,736
Oh, okay.

285
00:35:23,646 --> 00:35:27,115
Wanna fly, babe? There you go, up.

286
00:36:10,443 --> 00:36:13,236
I'm grateful to you for coming.

287
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:17,199
Mrs. MacNeil wants me
to help you while I can.

288
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,786
She would do anything
for Father Merrin.

289
00:36:20,787 --> 00:36:24,464
She believes he gave
his life for Regan.

290
00:36:28,211 --> 00:36:31,346
Are they gonna make him a saint?

291
00:36:31,672 --> 00:36:35,725
The world doesn't
want any more saints.

292
00:36:35,885 --> 00:36:39,270
This is not an official investigation.

293
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:57,364
When Father Merrin arrived,
how did he prepare himself?

294
00:36:57,365 --> 00:36:59,241
Did he pray?

295
00:36:59,242 --> 00:37:03,670
They couldn't explain it,
the police, could they?

296
00:37:16,259 --> 00:37:19,427
Did Father Merrin
ever name the demon?

297
00:37:19,428 --> 00:37:21,187
No.

298
00:37:21,389 --> 00:37:23,898
It knew him, though.

299
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:29,320
- How do you know that?
- It called his name.

300
00:37:40,241 --> 00:37:43,827
Did the demon seem to
expect Father Merrin?

301
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:45,795
Yes.

302
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:49,966
It feared him, I think.

303
00:38:01,762 --> 00:38:03,521
Was, uh...

304
00:38:04,265 --> 00:38:07,275
Was Father Merrin afraid?

305
00:38:10,104 --> 00:38:13,323
You'd better see where it happened.

306
00:38:17,945 --> 00:38:21,865
What was her condition when
Father Merrin saw her?

307
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:24,618
Hideous. That evil face.

308
00:38:24,619 --> 00:38:29,122
- I couldn't bear to be near her after.
- You're with her now.

309
00:38:29,123 --> 00:38:34,169
Two years I stayed away. Two haunted
years, going out of my mind.

310
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:40,008
And all the time I longed to see her.
Finally, I came back and found that...

311
00:38:40,009 --> 00:38:43,887
when I'm with her is the
only time I'm at peace.

312
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:48,441
Why would that be?
I can't understand. It frightens me.

313
00:38:49,852 --> 00:38:53,271
Have you tried a
psychiatrist or a priest?

314
00:38:53,272 --> 00:38:57,909
- I'm talking to one now, aren't I?
- I'm not here for you.

315
00:39:00,655 --> 00:39:02,413
There.

316
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,041
In there.

317
00:39:10,539 --> 00:39:14,334
Praying. Have you tried praying?

318
00:39:14,335 --> 00:39:16,094
Prayer?

319
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:04,892
I pray for the soul of Father
Merrin, who died in this room.

320
00:40:05,052 --> 00:40:10,724
And for Sharon, who was touched
by the shadow of evil.

321
00:40:10,725 --> 00:40:13,234
And for myself.

322
00:40:13,853 --> 00:40:15,945
For myself.

323
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:29,326
- Next week then, Frank, okay?
- Is there any point going on?

324
00:40:29,327 --> 00:40:33,413
Hey. I'll be in there fighting.

325
00:40:33,414 --> 00:40:36,549
Just as long as you are.

326
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,965
- Hello.
- Hello.

327
00:40:43,966 --> 00:40:46,351
Come on in.

328
00:40:49,472 --> 00:40:51,556
Do you, uh...?

329
00:40:51,557 --> 00:40:55,477
- Do you have children of your own?
- Yes, I do. Two.

330
00:40:55,478 --> 00:40:58,229
A boy and a girl.

331
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:01,316
I'd like to spend
more time with them.

332
00:41:01,317 --> 00:41:04,778
Must be difficult, with all
your responsibilities.

333
00:41:04,779 --> 00:41:09,082
Not to mention the complications
of being divorced.

334
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:15,505
You seem to manage.
Your heart is good.

335
00:41:16,999 --> 00:41:19,509
It's hard to live alone.

336
00:41:21,587 --> 00:41:25,139
Don't you ever need a woman, Father?

337
00:41:26,384 --> 00:41:28,601
Yes.

338
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,309
Telling secrets?

339
00:41:54,954 --> 00:41:58,206
Do you remember dreaming
of Father Merrin?

340
00:41:58,207 --> 00:41:59,874
Yes.

341
00:41:59,875 --> 00:42:02,677
Can you see him now?

342
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:05,596
Yes.

343
00:42:06,006 --> 00:42:08,141
Where is he?

344
00:42:14,974 --> 00:42:20,228
It was long ago when I was
studying the holy men of Africa.

345
00:42:20,229 --> 00:42:23,440
This boy, this young boy...

346
00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:25,700
has very special powers.

347
00:42:26,444 --> 00:42:30,405
They need his help
against the locust swarm.

348
00:42:30,406 --> 00:42:33,074
But perhaps this swarm comes...

349
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:36,043
because of the boy.

350
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:41,257
Does great goodness
draw evil upon itself?

351
00:42:50,593 --> 00:42:54,554
Now, Regan, Father Lamont
is hypnotized too.

352
00:42:54,555 --> 00:42:57,515
I want you to bring him down to you.

353
00:42:57,516 --> 00:42:59,809
Tell him what to do.

354
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,444
Father Lamont?

355
00:43:02,563 --> 00:43:04,113
Yes?

356
00:43:05,566 --> 00:43:07,450
Call me.

357
00:43:08,486 --> 00:43:10,036
Regan.

358
00:43:55,282 --> 00:43:59,669
I am Pazuzu!

359
00:44:01,664 --> 00:44:04,048
Pazuzu!

360
00:44:06,794 --> 00:44:10,304
Call me by my dream name.

361
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,852
Call me.

362
00:44:16,136 --> 00:44:18,855
Pazuzu.

363
00:44:19,265 --> 00:44:22,608
King of the spirits of the air!

364
00:44:23,018 --> 00:44:25,061
Pazuzu!

365
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:28,072
King of the evil spirits of the air!

366
00:44:29,275 --> 00:44:32,318
Spirits of the air!

367
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:12,775
All-powerful God!

368
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:17,030
You gave power to your apostles
to pass through dangers!

369
00:45:17,031 --> 00:45:18,748
Give us strength!

370
00:45:24,371 --> 00:45:27,924
No. God!

371
00:46:02,409 --> 00:46:04,327
Fear not!

372
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:06,663
We are safe inside!

373
00:46:06,664 --> 00:46:10,375
Even Pazuzu with all his legions...

374
00:46:10,376 --> 00:46:13,844
cannot transgress
this holiest of places.

375
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:19,809
Get thee hence, Satan!

376
00:46:20,636 --> 00:46:23,562
Be uprooted!

377
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:27,608
Be expelled from
this creature of God!

378
00:46:27,935 --> 00:46:31,904
I command you to the depths of hell!

379
00:46:51,083 --> 00:46:53,084
- Merrin defeated you.
- No!

380
00:46:53,085 --> 00:46:57,088
In his own place of power,
he gained a little time.

381
00:46:57,089 --> 00:47:02,301
It was because the boy was a healer
that you attacked. Now I see.

382
00:47:02,302 --> 00:47:05,263
- But Merrin saved him!
- Never!

383
00:47:05,264 --> 00:47:08,599
I could claim Kokumo even now.

384
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:11,894
- I'll show you power.
- He's still alive!

385
00:47:11,895 --> 00:47:16,741
- Where is he?
- Shall I take you to him?

386
00:47:17,151 --> 00:47:18,609
Yes.

387
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:21,328
Are you sure?

388
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:25,082
Show me.

389
00:47:33,751 --> 00:47:36,919
Come fly the teeth of the wind.

390
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:40,306
Share my wings.

391
00:49:10,722 --> 00:49:13,724
- What was it?
- A leopard.

392
00:49:13,725 --> 00:49:17,027
He jumped at me.
The boy's still alive.

393
00:49:18,272 --> 00:49:20,398
He frightened Pazuzu.

394
00:49:20,399 --> 00:49:24,118
- Do you remember anything?
- Was it in Africa?

395
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:27,363
Why do you say that?

396
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:31,876
It was like what I saw at
the Natural History Museum.

397
00:49:33,078 --> 00:49:38,340
- But you weren't supposed to remember.
- I know.

398
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:44,597
- Okay, Regan, that's all for today.
- Okay.

399
00:49:58,770 --> 00:50:04,442
Pazuzu showed me that boy. He's a man
now, in a strange mud city in Africa.

400
00:50:04,443 --> 00:50:06,819
Perhaps I can find him.

401
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:11,749
He has a power over evil.
Regan recognized one of those places.

402
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:16,871
But she told us it was something
she remembered from the museum.

403
00:50:16,872 --> 00:50:18,956
Let me ask her.

404
00:50:18,957 --> 00:50:23,802
Just a minute. Take it easy.
I want to take a look at you.

405
00:50:43,815 --> 00:50:45,616
Hi.

406
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:50,454
Hi. Are you waiting
for Doctor Tuskin?

407
00:50:52,074 --> 00:50:55,084
She's very nice, isn't she?

408
00:50:56,703 --> 00:50:59,463
What's the matter with you?

409
00:51:13,178 --> 00:51:18,691
I'm autistic.

410
00:51:19,476 --> 00:51:21,735
How do you mean?

411
00:51:23,021 --> 00:51:28,409
I'm withdrawn.

412
00:51:30,112 --> 00:51:33,114
I can't talk.

413
00:51:33,115 --> 00:51:35,992
But you're talking now.

414
00:51:35,993 --> 00:51:39,295
Yes, you are. I can hear you.

415
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:46,468
- You can hear me?
- Sure!

416
00:51:55,095 --> 00:51:57,013
What's...

417
00:51:57,014 --> 00:51:58,856
the matter with you?

418
00:51:59,641 --> 00:52:02,026
I was possessed by a demon.

419
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:06,280
Oh, it's okay. He's gone.

420
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:12,445
Dr. Tuskin would like Sandra
to visit her voice therapy class.

421
00:52:12,446 --> 00:52:16,457
Hey, Mom. You know
what happened to her?

422
00:52:17,909 --> 00:52:20,794
You're talking!

423
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:23,630
Talking!

424
00:52:24,916 --> 00:52:29,086
Can you hear me, Mother?

425
00:52:29,087 --> 00:52:32,473
She's talking!

426
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:35,718
- God....
- Call Gene.

427
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:38,304
Are you all right?

428
00:52:38,305 --> 00:52:42,274
Mother, it's all right.

429
00:52:44,853 --> 00:52:47,897
- What is it?
- Regan's got Sandra talking!

430
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:50,941
- What?
- I've got to take her home!

431
00:52:50,942 --> 00:52:54,278
Her father's got to
hear before she stops!

432
00:52:54,279 --> 00:52:58,866
- She's not going to stop.
- No, don't stop, baby, no!

433
00:52:58,867 --> 00:53:02,703
- Keep talking!
- Come on in my office.

434
00:53:02,704 --> 00:53:08,501
No! Her father would never forgive me.
I've got to take her home!

435
00:53:08,502 --> 00:53:12,505
All right, take her home.
Liz, you go with them.

436
00:53:12,506 --> 00:53:14,723
Come on.

437
00:53:15,383 --> 00:53:17,935
What did you do?

438
00:53:18,303 --> 00:53:21,972
Nothing. I just started
talking to her.

439
00:53:21,973 --> 00:53:27,528
First she was talking inside,
and then she started talking outside.

440
00:53:28,355 --> 00:53:33,776
Gene, do you think I could start
helping some of your other kids?

441
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:40,249
You know, Regan, it's very dangerous
to fool with other people's heads.

442
00:53:40,367 --> 00:53:43,327
Sandra seems to be all right...

443
00:53:43,328 --> 00:53:45,496
but don't try that again.

444
00:53:45,497 --> 00:53:47,506
- Until...
- Until what?

445
00:53:48,375 --> 00:53:52,010
Well, until you're older.

446
00:53:52,337 --> 00:53:54,338
Okay.

447
00:53:54,339 --> 00:53:56,974
Well, there's Sharon. Bye!

448
00:53:58,927 --> 00:54:03,814
Don't tell Sharon because she'll
just call Mom and worry her. Okay?

449
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:05,850
Gene.

450
00:54:05,851 --> 00:54:10,229
- I don't want to hear any speculation.
- She entered her mind!

451
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:14,650
- Let's stick to science.
- Don't hide behind science.

452
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:19,196
Listen, I'm responsible for Regan
while her mother's away.

453
00:54:19,197 --> 00:54:24,827
- You stay away from her! Cut it out!
- You must fight that demon inside her!

454
00:54:24,828 --> 00:54:28,205
- It keeps her from spiritual power.
- Demons?

455
00:54:28,206 --> 00:54:32,126
We make our own, up here.
You're obsessed with the idea!

456
00:54:32,127 --> 00:54:35,754
I'm not! I'm fascinated,
but I know the dangers.

457
00:54:35,755 --> 00:54:39,675
Father Merrin was afraid
he'd slip into admiration.

458
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:43,020
How about adulation?

459
00:55:23,678 --> 00:55:26,605
Hello, Father.

460
00:55:27,849 --> 00:55:31,193
How did you know I was coming here?

461
00:55:31,603 --> 00:55:33,687
Well, I didn't...

462
00:55:33,688 --> 00:55:35,989
for sure.

463
00:55:38,902 --> 00:55:41,620
I'm not allowed to talk to you.

464
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:44,615
- Doctor's orders.
- Oh.

465
00:55:47,452 --> 00:55:49,495
- Father?
- Mm?

466
00:55:49,496 --> 00:55:55,175
- Do priests believe in ESP?
- Some do.

467
00:55:55,585 --> 00:56:02,258
A French priest thought we'd all come
together in some sort of telepathy.

468
00:56:02,259 --> 00:56:08,097
A kind of world-mind in which
everybody would share.

469
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:11,558
When is that supposed to happen?

470
00:56:11,559 --> 00:56:14,152
I don't know.

471
00:56:14,271 --> 00:56:19,984
Father Merrin believed that, with
modern research, it could happen soon.

472
00:56:19,985 --> 00:56:24,154
I mean the kind of research
Dr. Tuskin is doing.

473
00:56:24,155 --> 00:56:27,708
But if it happens
before we're ready...

474
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:35,632
we may find ourselves pointing in
the wrong direction, toward Satan.

475
00:56:37,294 --> 00:56:40,012
Look, Father.

476
00:56:43,049 --> 00:56:45,642
That's it!

477
00:56:46,261 --> 00:56:49,271
That's where Father
Merrin fought Pazuzu.

478
00:56:50,849 --> 00:56:53,775
You remember Father Merrin?

479
00:56:55,645 --> 00:56:56,854
Yes.

480
00:56:56,855 --> 00:56:59,823
What else do you remember?

481
00:57:00,442 --> 00:57:02,318
Everything.

482
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:05,037
Aren't you afraid?

483
00:57:07,532 --> 00:57:11,501
I wish I could tell you
not to be, but I can't.

484
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:17,132
Why wasn't that man with
the leopard afraid of Pazuzu?

485
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,052
I don't know.

486
00:57:20,628 --> 00:57:25,682
- I'll try to find out.
- His name is Kokumo.

487
00:57:32,307 --> 00:57:35,275
Kokumo....

488
00:57:36,728 --> 00:57:42,157
If he can teach me how
he has survived Pazuzu...

489
00:57:44,235 --> 00:57:47,371
I'll come back and let you know.

490
00:57:49,657 --> 00:57:52,076
I must go to Africa right away!

491
00:57:52,077 --> 00:57:55,962
If I can find this man
Kokumo, it will prove...

492
00:57:56,081 --> 00:57:58,791
that the exorcisms were valid.

493
00:57:58,792 --> 00:58:00,626
But more than that...

494
00:58:00,627 --> 00:58:06,048
remember how Merrin prophesied that
new men would arise to purge evil?

495
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:11,095
They may already be among us.
Kokumo could be one of them.

496
00:58:11,096 --> 00:58:15,857
I saw him in a vision.
I saw his power over evil.

497
00:58:16,351 --> 00:58:21,563
I've asked you to investigate
the exorcisms of Father Merrin...

498
00:58:21,564 --> 00:58:26,693
not to step into his shoes.
You are in dire need of prayer.

499
00:58:26,694 --> 00:58:30,706
- I suggest you make a retreat!
- Why not an advance?

500
00:58:30,949 --> 00:58:37,212
Lamont, you are in open defiance of
the church! I beg you to reconsider!

501
00:58:37,414 --> 00:58:42,126
I have no choice but to relieve
you of your assignment.

502
00:58:42,127 --> 00:58:45,295
You will refrain from
any further action.

503
00:58:45,296 --> 00:58:48,682
We'll speak again after your retreat.

504
00:59:50,778 --> 00:59:53,330
Thank you.

505
01:02:39,530 --> 01:02:41,948
I am in mortal sin...

506
01:02:41,949 --> 01:02:45,160
disobedience, pride...

507
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:47,788
but evil overwhelms us!

508
01:02:47,789 --> 01:02:53,510
I had to disobey!

509
01:03:15,942 --> 01:03:17,609
Where is she?

510
01:03:17,610 --> 01:03:21,871
She's on the roof.
She's always there.

511
01:03:28,037 --> 01:03:31,047
I can't lock her up.

512
01:03:47,849 --> 01:03:52,436
- I wish you'd help Father Lamont.
- What do you mean?

513
01:03:52,437 --> 01:03:55,238
He needs your help.

514
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:58,734
How can I help him? I don't know how.

515
01:03:58,735 --> 01:04:01,286
Yes, you do.

516
01:04:01,612 --> 01:04:04,406
Regan, what are you talking about?

517
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:10,662
Well, you know. Going into synch,
trying to reach him like that.

518
01:04:10,663 --> 01:04:13,999
But you told me he's in Africa.

519
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,043
When you're in synch, it's different.

520
01:04:17,044 --> 01:04:20,672
I mean, it doesn't
matter where you are.

521
01:04:20,673 --> 01:04:22,758
You can find them.

522
01:04:22,759 --> 01:04:24,843
You know...

523
01:04:24,844 --> 01:04:27,145
help them.

524
01:04:27,597 --> 01:04:31,266
Is that why you haven't
been coming to see me?

525
01:04:31,267 --> 01:04:36,321
- Because I won't let you go into synch?
- Yes.

526
01:04:40,067 --> 01:04:42,786
I can't.

527
01:04:49,786 --> 01:04:53,838
I have to do what I
think is best for you.

528
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:01,755
Is there anyone who would
remember Father Merrin?

529
01:05:01,756 --> 01:05:05,725
Perhaps the abbot. I can ask him.

530
01:05:20,316 --> 01:05:24,027
He knew Father Merrin.
He says he was very holy.

531
01:05:24,028 --> 01:05:27,205
Did he know Kokumo?

532
01:05:30,535 --> 01:05:35,547
Merrin came up here once
with a boy who was very sick.

533
01:05:36,791 --> 01:05:39,251
There was an accident.

534
01:05:39,252 --> 01:05:42,170
A wind, what did he say...?
A devil wind.

535
01:05:42,171 --> 01:05:45,557
And a monk fell to his death.

536
01:05:45,716 --> 01:05:51,763
The big wind raised much dust,
and the body was never found.

537
01:05:51,764 --> 01:05:55,567
They searched all over, everywhere.

538
01:06:00,064 --> 01:06:05,160
He didn't fall there. He bounced
on that ledge and fell there.

539
01:06:05,361 --> 01:06:08,079
I'll show you!

540
01:06:17,874 --> 01:06:19,966
Be careful!

541
01:06:22,670 --> 01:06:24,721
Wait! Wait for me!

542
01:07:30,863 --> 01:07:32,530
Over there!

543
01:07:32,531 --> 01:07:35,875
In the cleft of that rock over there.

544
01:08:00,685 --> 01:08:05,939
- How did you know the body was here?
- He was killed by the demon Pazuzu!

545
01:08:09,276 --> 01:08:11,786
Pazuzu?

546
01:08:12,279 --> 01:08:15,331
I flew with Pazuzu in a trance!

547
01:08:19,453 --> 01:08:24,249
It's difficult to explain.
I was under hypnosis.

548
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:28,219
No, Father! Please wait!

549
01:08:31,132 --> 01:08:33,683
Stop, Father, wait!

550
01:08:36,137 --> 01:08:38,346
Father!

551
01:08:38,347 --> 01:08:39,939
Please!

552
01:08:41,058 --> 01:08:42,608
No!

553
01:08:42,727 --> 01:08:46,362
Father Abbot! Listen to me!

554
01:08:47,523 --> 01:08:50,900
He will not speak to
a devil-worshiper!

555
01:08:50,901 --> 01:08:53,745
I am not a devil-worshiper!

556
01:10:09,772 --> 01:10:13,991
Please don't drug me.
Don't put me under, Gene.

557
01:10:14,902 --> 01:10:17,821
I'm okay now.

558
01:10:17,822 --> 01:10:22,283
- It'll make you sleep.
- But it will stop me from dreaming.

559
01:10:22,284 --> 01:10:25,837
Maybe that will be good for a while.

560
01:10:30,417 --> 01:10:33,294
But he needs me.

561
01:10:33,295 --> 01:10:35,346
I've got to find him.

562
01:10:36,257 --> 01:10:39,892
You'll be fine. You'll be just fine.

563
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:44,814
You're trying to kill my....

564
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:48,985
My soul.

565
01:11:03,951 --> 01:11:07,871
A Muslim city with mud walls, golden.

566
01:12:04,261 --> 01:12:07,805
Mud city with golden walls?
Sounds like Jepti.

567
01:12:07,806 --> 01:12:11,684
- You know it?
- I know every holy place in Africa.

568
01:12:11,685 --> 01:12:14,020
Religion's my business.

569
01:12:14,021 --> 01:12:19,692
Plastic saints, icons,
Buddhas, voodoo gris-gris....

570
01:12:19,693 --> 01:12:23,738
Edwards' my name.
Ecumenical Edwards, they call me.

571
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:27,416
Philip Lamont, archeologist.

572
01:12:28,244 --> 01:12:31,379
It's nice to know you, Father.

573
01:12:49,723 --> 01:12:51,808
What now?

574
01:12:51,809 --> 01:12:53,776
Locusts!

575
01:12:54,687 --> 01:12:57,146
Spraying for locusts!

576
01:12:57,147 --> 01:13:00,650
This is the traditional
route of the plague!

577
01:13:00,651 --> 01:13:05,788
They think they can
stop them with DDT!

578
01:13:05,990 --> 01:13:10,251
- I've flown this route before!
- When was that?

579
01:13:12,037 --> 01:13:13,913
It was...

580
01:13:13,914 --> 01:13:16,841
It was on the wings of a demon!

581
01:13:20,713 --> 01:13:24,140
Did he take you to Jepti?

582
01:13:24,341 --> 01:13:27,268
Yes, he did.

583
01:14:19,104 --> 01:14:20,821
Kokumo?

584
01:14:23,859 --> 01:14:28,120
Kokumo? No, no.

585
01:14:36,914 --> 01:14:38,422
Kokumo?

586
01:15:05,859 --> 01:15:10,037
Kumo? Kumo?

587
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:31,976
- Kokumo. Kokumo.
- Kokumo.

588
01:17:39,805 --> 01:17:42,682
Almighty God...

589
01:17:42,683 --> 01:17:45,017
help me.

590
01:17:45,018 --> 01:17:48,145
I must find Kokumo.

591
01:17:48,146 --> 01:17:54,618
I have resisted. I have
not called on Pazuzu.

592
01:17:55,445 --> 01:17:57,955
Help me.

593
01:18:00,033 --> 01:18:02,334
Call me.

594
01:18:04,413 --> 01:18:06,922
Regan.

595
01:18:09,835 --> 01:18:13,596
Call me by my dream name.

596
01:18:18,385 --> 01:18:21,520
Call me.

597
01:18:24,141 --> 01:18:29,695
Pazuzu, prince of the evil spirits
of the air, take me to Kokumo.

598
01:18:30,397 --> 01:18:39,538
Kokumo. Kokumo.

599
01:18:39,906 --> 01:18:42,416
Kokumo.

600
01:18:43,619 --> 01:18:46,462
Kokumo.

601
01:18:47,122 --> 01:18:53,594
Kokumo.

602
01:18:54,713 --> 01:18:58,007
Kokumo.

603
01:19:19,071 --> 01:19:24,500
I call upon you in the name
of Father Lankester Merrin.

604
01:19:26,703 --> 01:19:29,080
How did you find me?

605
01:19:29,081 --> 01:19:33,676
I saw you in the mind of a girl
who was possessed by Pazuzu.

606
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:39,264
- She is still in danger of dreams.
- How can I help her?

607
01:19:41,968 --> 01:19:44,512
Which girl would you help?

608
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:49,274
The one possessed by Pazuzu or
the one held by Father Merrin?

609
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:53,187
You must pluck out her evil heart...

610
01:19:53,188 --> 01:19:56,732
but Pazuzu has brushed
you with his wings.

611
01:19:56,733 --> 01:19:59,735
You called on Pazuzu to reach me.

612
01:19:59,736 --> 01:20:03,572
You've lost faith in your God.
You do not believe.

613
01:20:03,573 --> 01:20:08,285
I do believe! I'll do anything
to help Regan! Anything!

614
01:20:08,286 --> 01:20:11,463
Then prove your faith. Cross over.

615
01:20:16,503 --> 01:20:20,973
My faith is in Jesus Christ, reborn.

616
01:20:22,342 --> 01:20:26,103
Prove it. Cross over!

617
01:20:26,430 --> 01:20:29,390
Step out of your despair.

618
01:20:29,391 --> 01:20:33,694
If Pazuzu comes for you,
I will spit a leopard.

619
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:33,879
Can I help you?

620
01:21:36,166 --> 01:21:39,510
I fell. I failed!

621
01:21:41,379 --> 01:21:45,466
The heat, perhaps.
Come inside, it's cooler.

622
01:21:45,467 --> 01:21:48,052
- Who are you?
- My name is Kokumo.

623
01:21:48,053 --> 01:21:51,555
- Did you know Father Lankester Merrin?
- Yes.

624
01:21:51,556 --> 01:21:55,059
When I was young, in Ethiopia.
Wonderful man.

625
01:21:55,060 --> 01:21:59,647
He died while exorcising the
demon Pazuzu from a young girl.

626
01:21:59,648 --> 01:22:03,818
- Were you ever....?
- Possessed by Pazuzu?

627
01:22:03,819 --> 01:22:06,153
That's what my mother
used to tell me.

628
01:22:07,364 --> 01:22:10,032
- Locusts?
- Yes!

629
01:22:10,033 --> 01:22:12,034
Let me show you!

630
01:22:12,035 --> 01:22:17,047
This is one of the main control
stations in equatorial Africa.

631
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:22,261
The key factor is the
brushing of the wings.

632
01:22:22,879 --> 01:22:24,964
When it is dry...

633
01:22:24,965 --> 01:22:29,134
the grasshoppers go their
own way, happy individuals.

634
01:22:29,135 --> 01:22:33,055
When a heavy rain hatches
them in large numbers...

635
01:22:33,056 --> 01:22:37,643
they crowd together. Their wings
brush against each other.

636
01:22:37,644 --> 01:22:41,029
The agitation transforms them.

637
01:22:44,985 --> 01:22:49,371
Here, you see them
in their various forms.

638
01:23:03,712 --> 01:23:09,049
Most importantly, the brushing of
the wings changes their personality.

639
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:14,897
They become a destructive, voracious,
marauding swarm, with a single mind.

640
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:22,321
A locust mind, if you will.

641
01:23:31,239 --> 01:23:36,911
The evil swarm sweeps over the earth,
possessing all that it touches.

642
01:23:36,912 --> 01:23:40,881
Evil breeding evil by contact.

643
01:23:41,833 --> 01:23:46,086
Is there no hope once the
wings have brushed you?

644
01:23:46,087 --> 01:23:48,339
We try.

645
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:50,799
With the help of science.

646
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:53,393
Look at this young female.

647
01:23:53,970 --> 01:23:58,599
She has been evolved to resist
the brushing of the wings.

648
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:00,976
At least, that is our hope.

649
01:24:00,977 --> 01:24:04,613
We like to call her the Good Locust.

650
01:24:06,524 --> 01:24:10,486
Her children will be our
agents in the swarm.

651
01:24:10,487 --> 01:24:12,696
Breaking the chain reaction.

652
01:24:12,697 --> 01:24:17,326
Remaining forever
happy-go-lucky grasshoppers.

653
01:24:17,327 --> 01:24:20,087
Let us pray it succeeds.

654
01:24:21,331 --> 01:24:23,882
The Good Locust?

655
01:25:11,506 --> 01:25:15,559
- Where do you think you're going?
- It's okay.

656
01:25:40,368 --> 01:25:43,370
I can't get you out of the bath.

657
01:25:45,665 --> 01:25:48,508
Oh, I lost the soap!

658
01:25:53,214 --> 01:25:55,257
You got me all wet!

659
01:25:55,258 --> 01:25:58,969
Call back tomorrow.
You got me all wet, look!

660
01:26:02,474 --> 01:26:04,232
Hello?

661
01:26:07,479 --> 01:26:09,237
When?

662
01:26:12,817 --> 01:26:15,619
Does Dr. Tuskin know?

663
01:26:17,072 --> 01:26:18,655
Well, where is the doctor?

664
01:26:19,866 --> 01:26:22,292
Hold on, that could be Regan.

665
01:26:27,332 --> 01:26:29,091
You!

666
01:26:30,502 --> 01:26:34,713
It's all your fault.
Regan's sick. You stirred it up.

667
01:26:34,714 --> 01:26:38,675
She's left the hospital.
God knows where she is!

668
01:26:38,676 --> 01:26:42,054
- I have to see her.
- You have some nerve!

669
01:26:42,055 --> 01:26:45,974
Please. I can help her.
Only I can help her...

670
01:26:45,975 --> 01:26:48,143
Leave us alone!

671
01:26:48,144 --> 01:26:52,898
We don't wanna hear about
demons or God or anything!

672
01:26:52,899 --> 01:26:54,950
Just get out of here!

673
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,653
They put you in a hospital.

674
01:27:39,654 --> 01:27:42,789
Dr. Tuskin doesn't understand.

675
01:27:46,661 --> 01:27:51,131
- Did you find the man with the leopard?
- I did.

676
01:27:53,168 --> 01:27:56,761
Did he tell you how to fight Pazuzu?

677
01:27:56,963 --> 01:27:59,473
He told me...

678
01:27:59,591 --> 01:28:03,435
good and evil are
struggling within you.

679
01:28:04,429 --> 01:28:06,563
We must fight it.

680
01:28:08,183 --> 01:28:10,734
I brought this with me.

681
01:28:11,978 --> 01:28:14,279
The synchronizer?

682
01:28:15,773 --> 01:28:18,658
Why don't you phone the police?

683
01:28:20,695 --> 01:28:22,362
No.

684
01:28:22,363 --> 01:28:25,540
Gary? Linda?

685
01:28:25,742 --> 01:28:29,286
Get your things.
I'll drop you at Miss Billing's.

686
01:28:29,287 --> 01:28:31,330
That's no fair, Mom.

687
01:28:31,331 --> 01:28:35,250
- I know, but I have to.
- What are you gonna do?

688
01:28:35,251 --> 01:28:37,844
Find her myself.

689
01:28:37,921 --> 01:28:40,138
And him too.

690
01:29:09,535 --> 01:29:12,246
- Do you remember Sandra?
- Yes.

691
01:29:12,247 --> 01:29:14,965
She's still talking.

692
01:29:15,667 --> 01:29:20,053
You have a great gift.
Keep it from evil.

693
01:29:35,395 --> 01:29:38,947
Pazuzu will brush me with his wings.

694
01:29:39,274 --> 01:29:41,866
Don't be afraid.

695
01:29:42,068 --> 01:29:45,412
Father Merrin will help us.

696
01:29:59,335 --> 01:30:01,545
All right, Regan.

697
01:30:01,546 --> 01:30:05,015
I'm ready. Bring me down.

698
01:30:07,885 --> 01:30:10,437
He is with me.

699
01:30:11,472 --> 01:30:13,648
Come down.

700
01:30:14,392 --> 01:30:17,152
Down, Father.

701
01:30:17,603 --> 01:30:20,238
To meet me.

702
01:30:41,210 --> 01:30:44,921
You're dying, Merrin, dying!

703
01:30:44,922 --> 01:30:49,017
And your hopes die with you!

704
01:30:57,977 --> 01:31:03,523
Not only Kokumo, but others like him,
began to appear in the world.

705
01:31:03,524 --> 01:31:06,109
I found them where I could...

706
01:31:06,110 --> 01:31:09,663
and tried to protect
them against evil.

707
01:31:11,783 --> 01:31:16,753
So Satan has sent Pazuzu
to destroy this goodness.

708
01:31:16,829 --> 01:31:18,705
Why me?

709
01:31:18,706 --> 01:31:20,840
I heal the sick.

710
01:31:24,754 --> 01:31:28,507
Philip, you must take my place.

711
01:31:28,508 --> 01:31:35,105
She is precious, and I
entrust her to you.

712
01:32:10,466 --> 01:32:13,593
Father? Fa... Father?

713
01:32:13,594 --> 01:32:19,649
Father? Father? Father?

714
01:32:20,685 --> 01:32:22,652
What's...?

715
01:32:26,149 --> 01:32:30,577
Father, wait! Father,
where are you going?

716
01:32:32,572 --> 01:32:34,948
- Why would they come here?
- The synchronizer.

717
01:32:34,949 --> 01:32:36,199
The what?

718
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:40,495
- It's gone! She's way ahead of us.
- I know she is.

719
01:32:40,496 --> 01:32:44,507
- Any news?
- Regan's taken the synchronizer.

720
01:32:55,011 --> 01:32:57,262
Father.

721
01:32:57,263 --> 01:32:59,314
See me.

722
01:32:59,724 --> 01:33:02,275
Please, see me.

723
01:33:37,220 --> 01:33:39,813
Gene, it's her. Line two.

724
01:33:41,140 --> 01:33:46,019
- Regan?
- Gene, look, I took the synchronizer.

725
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:49,022
I'm sorry, but I had to. I needed it.

726
01:33:49,023 --> 01:33:52,075
I left it at the
Dixie Hotel, room 27.

727
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:55,445
- Where are you?
- Penn Station.

728
01:33:55,446 --> 01:33:58,240
- Is he with you?
- Yes.

729
01:33:58,241 --> 01:34:01,576
He's going to Washington,
isn't he? To the house?

730
01:34:01,577 --> 01:34:04,788
- Yes.
- Regan, don't go with him.

731
01:34:04,789 --> 01:34:08,833
I have to. It's my fault.
He's doing it for me.

732
01:34:08,834 --> 01:34:12,971
Regan, listen to me.
You're in terrible danger.

733
01:34:14,549 --> 01:34:17,725
Gene, I gotta go. I'm sorry. Bye.

734
01:34:23,724 --> 01:34:25,900
Where is she?

735
01:34:26,269 --> 01:34:28,152
Penn Station.

736
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:38,329
Hey, stop that!

737
01:34:42,994 --> 01:34:45,712
Stupid bitch!

738
01:34:45,997 --> 01:34:48,540
- Where are you going?
- Washington.

739
01:34:48,541 --> 01:34:53,636
- I'm going with you.
- Call my kids. I'll be in touch.

740
01:35:12,106 --> 01:35:16,326
Father. Father.

741
01:35:17,612 --> 01:35:20,280
Father, tickets!

742
01:35:20,281 --> 01:35:22,832
Do you have any money?

743
01:35:34,295 --> 01:35:37,839
No, I'm with him! He's sick.

744
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:41,259
They... They gave him an injection.

745
01:35:41,260 --> 01:35:44,938
Leave her alone. She belongs to me!

746
01:35:55,107 --> 01:35:57,025
It's an accident.

747
01:35:57,026 --> 01:35:59,118
Doctor!

748
01:36:00,196 --> 01:36:03,289
I need a doctor!

749
01:36:04,283 --> 01:36:08,503
Drive on. Someone must
have called an ambulance.

750
01:36:21,217 --> 01:36:24,352
Well, Regan can wait, I guess.

751
01:36:26,597 --> 01:36:30,191
Wait! I'm a doctor. I'll help you.

752
01:36:30,351 --> 01:36:32,435
Let me see.

753
01:36:32,436 --> 01:36:34,570
Hold still.

754
01:36:42,905 --> 01:36:44,864
The power.

755
01:36:44,865 --> 01:36:49,585
It's getting nearer.
Can't you feel it?

756
01:36:50,329 --> 01:36:54,590
The power is immense. It fills me.

757
01:36:54,792 --> 01:36:57,510
I can do anything.

758
01:36:58,129 --> 01:37:00,013
Gene....

759
01:37:00,297 --> 01:37:02,932
You called Gene, didn't you?

760
01:37:28,325 --> 01:37:31,210
Father?

761
01:37:31,495 --> 01:37:35,256
Father, please don't be lost to me.

762
01:37:49,597 --> 01:37:53,399
- Why don't you loosen your tie?
- Thank you.

763
01:37:59,982 --> 01:38:03,201
Why are you looking at me like that?

764
01:38:05,362 --> 01:38:07,789
The power.

765
01:38:08,407 --> 01:38:10,917
I must take you there.

766
01:38:11,327 --> 01:38:14,670
Did Kokumo tell you that?

767
01:38:15,623 --> 01:38:17,632
He said...

768
01:38:18,292 --> 01:38:20,927
the Good Locust....

769
01:38:24,381 --> 01:38:27,759
- We'll get a taxi. Quick, hurry!
- Yes.

770
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:29,969
Taxi! Taxi!

771
01:38:29,970 --> 01:38:32,388
- There's one!
- Hey, lady!

772
01:38:32,389 --> 01:38:34,808
Lady, that's my taxi!

773
01:38:34,809 --> 01:38:36,567
Animals!

774
01:38:36,811 --> 01:38:38,986
- Sorry about that.
- People!

775
01:38:54,245 --> 01:38:56,162
Where to?

776
01:38:56,163 --> 01:38:58,422
Give him the address.

777
01:38:58,749 --> 01:39:02,218
Georgetown. 8 Prospect Street.

778
01:39:02,336 --> 01:39:06,806
- 8 Prospect Street?
- Yes! Come on, let's go!

779
01:39:19,228 --> 01:39:22,446
Get going! The girl has to get home!

780
01:39:30,531 --> 01:39:32,874
What now?

781
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:36,002
I'm gonna see about this!

782
01:39:38,122 --> 01:39:41,374
- It won't do no good.
- She's a doctor.

783
01:39:41,375 --> 01:39:46,095
- This is Washington.
- Someone's dying.

784
01:39:50,759 --> 01:39:53,102
Father, no!

785
01:40:20,706 --> 01:40:23,424
Father? Father?

786
01:40:28,005 --> 01:40:30,006
Father, wait!

787
01:40:30,007 --> 01:40:32,934
Driver, please hurry!

788
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:51,118
Come on!

789
01:40:56,992 --> 01:40:59,835
This is Prospect Street now.

790
01:41:13,592 --> 01:41:15,893
There's the house.

791
01:41:30,401 --> 01:41:32,535
I can't control it!

792
01:41:35,614 --> 01:41:37,999
It's going crazy!

793
01:41:45,624 --> 01:41:47,591
Oh, my God!

794
01:42:26,165 --> 01:42:31,302
Father.

795
01:42:31,587 --> 01:42:34,722
Let me reach you.

796
01:42:55,903 --> 01:42:57,779
Sharon?

797
01:42:57,780 --> 01:43:00,740
Get me out of here!

798
01:43:00,741 --> 01:43:03,409
Help me!

799
01:43:03,410 --> 01:43:04,952
Sharon!

800
01:43:04,953 --> 01:43:07,663
We've got to help Regan!

801
01:43:07,664 --> 01:43:10,758
Sharon!

802
01:43:14,254 --> 01:43:17,014
Sharon?

803
01:43:24,098 --> 01:43:27,183
At least help Regan!

804
01:43:27,184 --> 01:43:31,020
- To do what?
- To fight this thing!

805
01:43:31,021 --> 01:43:32,863
Name it.

806
01:43:34,525 --> 01:43:36,867
Pazuzu.

807
01:43:37,277 --> 01:43:39,203
Sharon.

808
01:44:20,237 --> 01:44:22,697
I've got to get inside.

809
01:44:22,698 --> 01:44:25,249
Let me inside!

810
01:44:27,202 --> 01:44:29,753
Sharon.

811
01:44:36,628 --> 01:44:38,804
Regan....

812
01:44:42,301 --> 01:44:46,220
No! Father Lamont, help me!

813
01:44:46,221 --> 01:44:49,849
Kokumo! Remember Father Merrin?

814
01:44:49,850 --> 01:44:51,609
No!

815
01:44:52,561 --> 01:44:56,314
He's mine. He's chosen me.

816
01:44:56,315 --> 01:45:01,327
Pazuzu's Regan is the only Regan!

817
01:45:06,491 --> 01:45:09,210
Be joined with us, Father.

818
01:45:09,328 --> 01:45:11,128
No.

819
01:45:17,553 --> 01:45:21,138
No. Please.

820
01:45:21,340 --> 01:45:23,766
Kill her.

821
01:45:29,223 --> 01:45:31,774
No!

822
01:45:42,069 --> 01:45:47,831
No. No. No.

823
01:45:49,618 --> 01:45:52,336
Sharon!

824
01:45:53,413 --> 01:45:56,415
The wings. The wings are brushing me!

825
01:45:56,416 --> 01:46:00,302
The wings are brushing me!
I must! I must!

826
01:46:00,754 --> 01:46:03,756
We like to call her the Good Locust.

827
01:46:03,757 --> 01:46:07,935
She was evolved to resist
the brushing of the wings.

828
01:46:08,595 --> 01:46:13,440
No! Once the wings have brushed
you, you're mine forever!

829
01:46:13,934 --> 01:46:16,852
She will break the chain reaction.

830
01:46:16,853 --> 01:46:19,446
Kill her! We command you!

831
01:46:26,613 --> 01:46:29,748
Why me? Why me?

832
01:46:48,677 --> 01:46:52,855
You must tear out her evil heart.

833
01:47:06,695 --> 01:47:09,322
Regan!

834
01:47:09,323 --> 01:47:12,124
Pazuzu!

835
01:47:24,171 --> 01:47:27,014
Sharon!

836
01:47:28,675 --> 01:47:31,435
Sharon!

837
01:47:36,266 --> 01:47:38,275
Help!

838
01:47:39,102 --> 01:47:42,521
Help! Help, somebody!

839
01:47:42,522 --> 01:47:46,909
Help me, somebody! Help me!

840
01:48:22,396 --> 01:48:26,107
Regan!

841
01:49:45,312 --> 01:49:49,156
Regan!

842
01:52:30,018 --> 01:52:32,353
I...

843
01:52:32,354 --> 01:52:34,905
chose...

844
01:52:35,732 --> 01:52:38,033
evil.

845
01:52:39,069 --> 01:52:40,569
No.

846
01:52:40,570 --> 01:52:44,790
Sharon, your hunger for
belief was your truth.

847
01:52:56,628 --> 01:52:59,763
Sharon.

848
01:53:01,049 --> 01:53:04,017
Regan.

849
01:53:21,820 --> 01:53:24,329
The time has come.

850
01:53:24,614 --> 01:53:27,708
Now we are saved and made strong.

851
01:53:27,742 --> 01:53:30,585
The enemy of the human race...

852
01:53:32,622 --> 01:53:34,756
is subdued.

853
01:53:52,392 --> 01:53:55,569
Regan. I'm sorry.

854
01:53:58,022 --> 01:54:00,615
I understand now.

855
01:54:00,942 --> 01:54:03,326
The world won't.

856
01:54:03,695 --> 01:54:05,245
Not yet.

857
01:54:14,372 --> 01:54:17,090
You have to go.

858
01:54:17,292 --> 01:54:19,801
Take care of her.

859
01:54:45,737 --> 01:54:49,364
- What happened?
- Oh, my God! How awful!

860
01:54:49,365 --> 01:54:52,542
In God's name, what happened?

861
01:54:52,744 --> 01:54:56,205
- Was anybody in the building?
- Gangway, please.

862
01:54:56,206 --> 01:54:59,416
You witnessed what went on here?

863
01:54:59,417 --> 01:55:02,135
Was anyone inside?

864
01:55:03,922 --> 01:55:06,515
Lady, are you okay?
