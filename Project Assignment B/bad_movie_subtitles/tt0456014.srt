1
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,238
Okay. Lacrosse season
is already over, right?

2
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,823
And you've already got
a scholarship to Maryland.

3
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:34,535
So, check this.
I made the call.

4
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:36,787
There's a club team
in Laguna Beach

5
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,288
that you can play on to stay sharp.

6
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,915
Huh? Huh?

7
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,917
Wow.

8
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:44,044
Come on, honey,
it's only 6 months, right?

9
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:47,297
Yeah... the last 6 months
of senior year.

10
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:51,593
Come on, honey.
It's California.

11
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:56,723
Isn't it just possible to have
a great senior year in California?

12
00:00:56,807 --> 00:01:00,352
Dude. Buy you a surfboard, dude.

13
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,270
Hey, Barney.

14
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,813
Didn't they teach you in Mary-land

15
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:46,607
not to play with your stick in public?

16
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,901
Yeah, Fred, stop shooting
all over our wall.

17
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:51,111
That dude's like... whoa.

18
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:53,071
Roach. Roach!

19
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:55,324
Well, he's got,
like, a stick, man.

20
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:56,658
Roach!

21
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:58,243
Little snogger.

22
00:01:58,327 --> 00:01:59,328
Roach, enough!

23
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:01,246
Yeah, dude.
You're fried. Remember?

24
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,415
Whoa. Yeah.

25
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,001
Hey, you want to try a real sport?
Let us know.

26
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:09,421
Yeah. We use our sticks
for more important things on this coast.

27
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:13,884
Surfing is... god.

28
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:14,968
Right?

29
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,179
Tyler.

30
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,680
You get in any more trouble,

31
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:20,182
you're not going to Costa Rica
for senior trip.

32
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,977
I'll see you later...

33
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:25,187
Mary.

34
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,107
Let's go.

35
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:30,484
What, is it over?

36
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:34,029
Yeah, it's over.
Let's go.

37
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,201
He sure is good with his stick.

38
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:42,037
Get your own stick, sweetie.

39
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,372
He's mine.

40
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,752
Hey, yo, yo.

41
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,879
East Coast, what's up?
Name's Taz.

42
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,382
- Like, uh, Tasmanian devil?
- Yeah.

43
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,716
That's cool.

44
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:58,011
So I heard Tyler and his ass clowns
gave you the Laguna welcome.

45
00:02:58,095 --> 00:02:59,972
Oh, yeah. Nice guys.

46
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:02,224
O, Father who art in heaven,

47
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:03,892
please show mercy
on the virgin Larry

48
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:06,311
and allow him to get laid

49
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:08,939
before he dies of
crotch rot or worse!

50
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,233
Larry's the only senior virgin.

51
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:14,278
The virgin Larry.

52
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,405
Yeah. Watch this.

53
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,157
Get the hell out, man.

54
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:22,536
Whoa. Ugly little freak.
Don't you have a circus to join?

55
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,163
Ah, and here comes Mary.

56
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,957
Don't you have
a stick to play with?

57
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,751
Go hug your board, Tyler.

58
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:31,879
I'm sure if you drilled
a small enough hole in it,

59
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:33,255
you two could be very happy.

60
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:35,007
Whoa.

61
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,717
I love my board, man.

62
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,636
Totally... hot.

63
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,892
Okay. Fine.

64
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:46,518
You can have your virgin Larry.

65
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:49,563
I'm sure you girls will have
plenty of time to bond...

66
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,900
while we're partying in Costa Rica.

67
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,447
Roach.

68
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,075
Is it over?

69
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,036
Yeah, Roach, it's over.

70
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,078
Dude.

71
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,250
I hope those ass clowns
die in Costa Rica.

72
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:14,087
Stupid High School
Surfing Championship.

73
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:17,257
I dreamed about monkeys last night.

74
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:19,343
They have monkeys in Costa Rica.

75
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:22,888
I dreamed that, you know,
I made friends with one on the senior trip.

76
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,518
Okay. Larry, you've got to stop
with these gay-ass dreams.

77
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:28,894
Seriously.

78
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,772
Look, have you been reading
those {y:i}Hustlers I gave you?

79
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:34,149
A lot of the pages are stuck together.

80
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,235
Yeah, they do that.

81
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:37,819
Uh, humidity.

82
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:40,030
Hey. Who's that?

83
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,573
Oh, that's my boy Mo.

84
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:43,033
Yeah. Ah, he's cool.

85
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,328
Tyler's always trying to suck up to him,
but he likes us.

86
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,372
Yeah?
And the hottie?

87
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,456
That's Chika,

88
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,708
the new Japanese exchange student.

89
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,335
Ah, she can't speak a word of English,

90
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:55,587
but, uh, Mo's waiting on her.

91
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:57,172
What's up, Taz?
All right.

92
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:58,966
Hey, we got East Coast.
What's up, man?

93
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:02,845
Hey, man, how's that song coming?

94
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:04,638
This guy, he's... he's incredible.

95
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,849
Not really feeling
the flow lately, man.

96
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,475
I need something to make it pop.

97
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,186
Whoa!

98
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:12,479
Hey, come on, dude.

99
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:14,189
Hey, hey.
This girl freaks me out.

100
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:16,275
She's, like, possessed or something.

101
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,069
I call her Po, but her name's Doris.

102
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,071
"Po" for potential.

103
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:26,076
Telling you, up under that
depressed-ass body is, like, BeyoncÃ©.

104
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:29,663
Yeah? Hey. I'm, uh...

105
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,540
Oh. Don't worry about old East Coast.

106
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:32,916
He don't really know.

107
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,002
She don't like nobody talking to her.

108
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:40,299
So I'm hearing the senior trip
is invitation only?

109
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,259
What is that?

110
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:45,053
I mean, come on, this is our class, too.

111
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:47,472
We can't just sit here while they party
in Costa Rica.

112
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:48,765
Right?

113
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,017
Uh... yeah, we can.

114
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,768
We ain't going nowhere.

115
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:07,659
Surf school?

116
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:09,119
Brothers don't surf.

117
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:12,247
Look, the senior trip is the second week
of Easter break.

118
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:16,126
So, go down a week early,
we learn to surf,

119
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:17,920
pull the biggest upset in history,

120
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:20,130
and then we party our
asses off like heroes.

121
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,216
East Coast,
what kind of shit you smoking?

122
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:23,842
Maybe he's right.
I mean...

123
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:27,179
I dreamed about that
Costa Rican monkey again.

124
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:30,349
Larry, you need to be spanking the monkey,
not dreaming about it.

125
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:33,602
I already found someplace
to stay... dirt cheap.

126
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:35,521
I mean, come on.

127
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,856
We get one chance at senior year.

128
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,316
I mean, let's go for it.

129
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,734
Hey, man, you know,

130
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,110
East Coast might have something here.

131
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:45,948
I'll get Chika to go with us
on this little road trip.

132
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,491
Get my sushi to go.

133
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:48,784
There you go.

134
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:51,119
I'm down.
Let's do it.

135
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:53,872
What about the rest of you guys?

136
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,292
Now we're talking.

137
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:01,255
See you ladies in Costa Rica.

138
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,801
Hi, Doris. Do you like
my new princess outfit?

139
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:09,304
I got you this pink cap for your trip.

140
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:14,017
Now, you know,
I spoke to your folks in Tokyo.

141
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,727
And you got to be crazy
if you think

142
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:17,771
we gonna let your cute little booty
go to Costa Rica.

143
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:20,607
And that brother
you been hanging out with?

144
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:24,653
His chopstick better not go near
that little sushi of yours.

145
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:26,196
You understand?

146
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:31,910
- I promise.
- Uh-huh.

147
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:33,954
- I shread.
- I shread?

148
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,539
I heard.

149
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,374
You're gonna shread
right hear in Laguna.

150
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,711
Now, it's very humid in Costa Rica,

151
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,547
so you are going to have to change
your underpants at least twice a day.

152
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,883
Now, Lawrence,

153
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:50,262
I know there are going to be lots
of pretty young girls there.

154
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,598
What do we think of pretty young girls?

155
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:54,183
Satan's spawn, Mother.

156
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,143
- Satan's spawn, Mother...
- Darling.

157
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,895
And what else, baby boy?

158
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,229
Beelzebub's bitches.

159
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:00,355
Yes! And?

160
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:01,607
Lucifer's lusty lasses?

161
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,733
Yes! And?

162
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,318
Daughters of the Antichrist.

163
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,360
Yes. And?

164
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:07,863
- The devil's dogs.
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

165
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:12,201
Oh, my beautiful Lawrence Horatio Bates,

166
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:16,163
{y:i}Home Economics magazine's
teen of the year.

167
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,378
Come on, now. You don't need
to search my bag, do you?

168
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:30,010
Uh, yeah. I heard there's this Costa Rican
Halloween holiday, so...

169
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:41,605
My dentist recommended that.
I have a... underbite.

170
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,238
Mommy, what's that?

171
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,075
Ah... ah, honey, that's just a toy.

172
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,785
Can I get a toy like that?

173
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,286
You can borrow mine.

174
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:17,933
Wow. I just saw
my first real monkey. Look.

175
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:20,602
Larry, forget about the real monkeys.

176
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:23,146
You're here to get that monkey
off your back, all right?

177
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:26,108
The only word I want to hear
out of your mouth is "beaver," got it?

178
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,401
Let's go. Come on.

179
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:30,904
Man, it's hot.
Rock and roll.

180
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:31,947
Hey, Taz, do you want any sunscreen?

181
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,782
No way, man.
I want to burn!

182
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:37,661
Mother says the tropical sun
can be very dangerous.

183
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,913
Man! I feel like myself again
getting out there!

184
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:42,708
Whoo! Let's go to the beach.
You know what time it is?

185
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,169
You seen my Ritalin?

186
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,171
Let's go.
What are we waiting on?

187
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,797
What do you guys want to do?
Come on.

188
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:49,965
Let's go to the beach.

189
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,008
Rock and roll.

190
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,262
Larry, you, uh, missed a few spots.

191
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:56,597
Where?

192
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,557
Everywhere.

193
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:18,493
It's like a brother's buffet.

194
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,245
Oh. Oh, yeah.

195
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:22,497
GarÃ§on,

196
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:27,336
I'll have the pink.
I'll take the blue.

197
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:30,047
Oh. Oh, I could write a song
about that thong.

198
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,340
Yummy.

199
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:35,636
Hold the phone.

200
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,013
Check, please.

201
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:39,806
I'll take those three to go.

202
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,021
From what I saw on the Internet,
this place is off the hook.

203
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:48,607
Larry, there are a ton of monkeys.

204
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,692
Don't even get me started on the chicks.

205
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:57,533
Okay, guys, just stay calm.

206
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:59,743
I'm sure there's an explanation.

207
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,370
Look, man, I got your explanation.

208
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:04,957
See, she got, like, three booties
mashed into one.

209
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:08,877
Okay!

210
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:11,046
That's right, cowards.
Be afraid.

211
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,090
Try to even undress her with your eyes,

212
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:16,844
and I will cut you
like Siberian seal, alive.

213
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:18,887
Okay. Take it easy, Tarzan.

214
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:21,473
- Undress who?
- Who?

215
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:23,767
Don't mock me, jocko.

216
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:28,021
We both know the object
of your teenage lust.

217
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:29,189
Who?

218
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,860
My little babushka.

219
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:34,862
Here, kitty cat.

220
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:36,405
Come on, my little kitty cat.
That's good.

221
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:40,701
Look at those buns.

222
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:43,245
Oh! Hey! Groovy!

223
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:44,746
The kids are here!

224
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,416
What are you waiting for?
Come on in, you little hipsters!

225
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:50,878
Welcome to commune.

226
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:54,047
Darling, I'll meet you at check-in.

227
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:56,091
Very well, my delight.

228
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:58,802
Now, look.
Look at that.

229
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:01,263
You tell me that is not art.

230
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:04,600
Um, yeah.

231
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:07,477
Go.

232
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:14,943
I like people.

233
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:17,404
I am people person.

234
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,537
Check this out.

235
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:28,624
This is something.

236
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:34,046
I'm gonna lap you up like cherry soda,
do you know that?

237
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:36,632
Did you put on that g-string
that I give for you?

238
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:39,009
Lover, I put it on this morning,
but now I can't find it.

239
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,054
East Coast, I can't stay here.
This is disgusting.

240
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:44,014
Oh. Relax.
They'll stop.

241
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:49,228
Eventually.

242
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:52,606
JFK, MLK, RFK.
Are those bands?

243
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:55,400
No, it's John F. Kennedy,
Robert F. Kennedy,

244
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:56,652
Martin Luther King, Jr.

245
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,779
Greatest heroes of the Sixties?
Don't you remember?

246
00:12:58,862 --> 00:12:59,863
No. Who?

247
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:01,448
Come on.
You sat right next to me

248
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:03,242
in Ms. Lipschitz's
American history class.

249
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:06,662
Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Lopsided Lipschitz, yeah.

250
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,997
Yeah, she was cool.
She gave me my first D-minus.

251
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:11,166
My mom had that on the fridge
for, like, months.

252
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,586
Oh. Kids.

253
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,508
Nice to start up close and personal.

254
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:21,385
I'm Tilly Jones.

255
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:24,763
And I'm Boris Ilnayitch Jones.

256
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:27,641
And I am the eternally stiff
lover of this woman.

257
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:28,934
Look at you, honey.

258
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,811
Look how nice you look
in this light, huh?

259
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:32,771
Why do you look so nice
in the light, huh?

260
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:34,273
Sugarbuns.

261
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:35,899
I may never get another boner again.

262
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:37,693
Aw, that's just wrong.

263
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,904
That's it! Who's my champion?
Who's my champion?

264
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,827
Children in the room.

265
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:51,790
It's so hard for me
because I like the girl.

266
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:55,794
Larry! Larry!
Beaver alert.

267
00:13:55,878 --> 00:13:57,713
Check it out, Larry.

268
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,923
{y:i}Hola, senorita.

269
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:07,723
Thank you, Veronique.

270
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:13,937
Damn. I heard French chicks
don't shave, but...

271
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:21,445
So, what brings you kids
to the commune?

272
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:24,323
It's kind of our senior trip.

273
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:25,991
Only, the other seniors
don't really want us here.

274
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,243
All right.
Taking it to the man.

275
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:29,328
Yeah.

276
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:30,579
Well, here at the commune,

277
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:32,873
we take a personal interest
in our guests.

278
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:35,459
We believe the spirit of the Sixties
should... live on.

279
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,085
Right on.

280
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:40,339
Let's see how much you kids really do
need to learn, hmm?

281
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:45,594
Oh, my skirt's a little... short.

282
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:51,016
Who is this?

283
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,976
That's the dude
from the first {y:i}Batman.

284
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,937
Yeah, that's that guy,
that old dude

285
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:57,856
that's got courtside tickets
to all the Lakers games.

286
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,567
Ding, ding, ding.
That would be wrong. Okay.

287
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:03,779
No, this, sweetie,
is not Jack Nicholson.

288
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:05,989
Does Richard Nixon ring a bell?

289
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:07,783
He was the first President to resign.

290
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,159
It was over Watergate.

291
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:11,662
Nixon was a symbol of everything

292
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,831
that was wrong with
America in the Sixties.

293
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:17,125
Flashing peace symbols to the crowd

294
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:19,670
then dropping bombs on
third-world countries?

295
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,004
Aren't we still doing that?

296
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,130
Yeah.

297
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:33,809
So you are the virgin boy.

298
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:37,354
Uh... yeah.

299
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:41,149
You are sacred in our culture.

300
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:44,361
It is the highest honor for a woman

301
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:50,117
to be the first with a virgin boy.

302
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,496
Wow. Okay.

303
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:57,374
Oh, hi, Veronique.

304
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:01,170
Can't you find a tree to swing from?

305
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:03,463
I'll see you later, virgin boy.

306
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:15,809
Thanks, Veronique.

307
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:18,937
I don't know if you understand English,
but you were in my dreams.

308
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:25,944
Supposed to be
a state-of-the-art facility.

309
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:28,697
Nah, man, this look like
the ghetto side of the beach.

310
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,741
This is surf school?

311
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:33,493
I don't see any desks
or pencil sharpeners.

312
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:35,120
And where's our teacher?

313
00:16:35,204 --> 00:16:37,956
Aw, man, somebody's wasted him.

314
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,958
No, he's just smashed.

315
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:42,419
That's it, little dolphin.

316
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:43,879
Back it up.

317
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:48,717
Back that blowhole up.
Dirty blowhole.

318
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:54,890
Whoa, whoa. Free Willy.
Free Willy!

319
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:56,266
Hey, Rip! Rip!

320
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,393
Rip! Rip! Wake up!

321
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:00,062
Hey. Hey.

322
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:01,897
It's the guys form Laguna, you know?

323
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:04,233
The ones that sent you the deposit.

324
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:06,860
Ah. Groovy, man. I can...

325
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:09,780
I can dig it.

326
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:12,616
Uh... look.
I don't know what you're, ah...

327
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,743
your mothers told you, but, uh...

328
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:18,288
I can explain the, uh,
child welfare payments.

329
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:20,249
We're not your kids!

330
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,376
We're the guys who sent you
the deposit for surf school.

331
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:25,879
That makes a little more sense.
All right.

332
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:28,590
You, uh...
you got the balance? Huh?

333
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:30,050
I take traveler's checks.

334
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,886
You don't get nothing till
you turn us into pros.

335
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,013
Who said pros?

336
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:38,767
Your ad.
Remember?

337
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:42,563
Man, we just wasting our time.
Let me out of here.

338
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:44,606
No. He's gonna teach us to surf.

339
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,650
Hey.

340
00:17:46,692 --> 00:17:49,820
Look, you want to drink yourself to death,
that's your choice.

341
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:52,739
But this week,
you're gonna teach us to surf.

342
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:56,118
Okay, hairdo.

343
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:59,580
I appreciate the incentive.

344
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:03,959
But you've got to understand that the old
Ripster's been down a long time.

345
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:06,295
It's got to be, what...

346
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:09,131
1974? Huh?

347
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:11,300
'75?

348
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:14,469
'76?

349
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:17,514
Well, it can't be 1977.

350
00:18:17,556 --> 00:18:19,558
It's 2005.

351
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:23,937
Okay. That's not helping.

352
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:28,358
I should know the date
by at least 30 years, right?

353
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:30,611
But... what the hell?

354
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:33,197
You're here!

355
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,367
Why doesn't old Ripster
whip you up some mahi-mahi?

356
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:38,660
Huh?

357
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:40,370
You guys want to eat?

358
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:43,207
I'll make some nice
pan-shaped mahi-mahi.

359
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:46,460
That would be real...
sh-shweet!

360
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,431
Peace, sister.

361
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:04,228
I like to sit in corners
when it rains, too.

362
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,232
{y:i}The Bell Jar.

363
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:10,400
I read that once.

364
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:12,736
It affected me deeply.

365
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:16,698
Uh, maybe... maybe someday

366
00:19:16,782 --> 00:19:18,742
you'd like to help me
paint one of these.

367
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:24,957
Or... or we could play beauty parlor.

368
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,377
Do each other's nails, hair.

369
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:30,462
Or not.

370
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:35,384
Okay. I got to run.
Thanks for the girl talk.

371
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:43,892
Man, these tropical storms are intense.

372
00:19:58,282 --> 00:20:00,576
We love the rain.

373
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:03,620
We love to get wet.

374
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:07,875
Are you American surf boys?

375
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:13,463
We love American surf boys.

376
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:18,886
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

377
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,515
Those chicks were so hot,
they melted our brains.

378
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:25,184
They love American surfers.

379
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:31,231
I can't believe we didn't get into
Surfer's Paradise,

380
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:32,941
but I guess we are Barneys.

381
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:35,194
Not for long.

382
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:36,695
Please come into my club.

383
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:37,946
In 4 days, no one.

384
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:40,157
Please...

385
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,243
El Pescado Muerto.

386
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:45,120
Does that mean "dead fish"?

387
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:47,664
{y:i}El pescado muertol
{y:i}SÃ­I

388
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:50,292
That is cool, huh?

389
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,419
Ah, no.

390
00:20:52,503 --> 00:20:54,546
You, uh, get any hot chicks here?

391
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,673
Course!
Don't you see my sister?

392
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:58,967
Where is she?

393
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:01,887
Right there.

394
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,724
Berthita, a smile for the American boys.

395
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,977
Hot, huh?

396
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:10,979
Okay. Screw this.
I'm going home.

397
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:13,398
No. Hey. Taz?

398
00:21:13,482 --> 00:21:16,109
Guys, we're not going anywhere.

399
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:18,195
We came here to have the time of our lives,
and we're gonna have it.

400
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:22,282
And we're gonna make the party right here
at the, uh... Dead Fish.

401
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:28,330
Guys, when we start surfing,

402
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:29,665
they're gonna see that we're
the real deal,

403
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:31,250
and I would, uh...

404
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:34,670
Well, I would guess that they're gonna
want to party with us.

405
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:36,338
You know?

406
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:37,548
I mean, they're gonna know
that we're...

407
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:39,591
obviously the coolest.

408
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:41,635
The party's gonna come to us.

409
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:42,928
I don't know about you guys,

410
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:45,806
but I'm feeling a heck of a lot
better about Rip, aren't you?

411
00:21:48,976 --> 00:21:50,853
Ghost Babe.

412
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:54,147
Uh, come back.

413
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:56,483
Come back, Ghost Babe.

414
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:59,194
Hey, Rip.

415
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:00,654
It's time for surf school.

416
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:03,073
Do I know you, man?

417
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:08,328
Surf school is open, hairdo.

418
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:17,462
Now, what do you think real surfers
would call you three?

419
00:22:17,546 --> 00:22:21,508
That's easy.
Barneys, Freds, Wallys...

420
00:22:21,592 --> 00:22:23,719
geeks, dorks, wannabes, posers,

421
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:25,721
Gilligans, weeds,

422
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:27,264
Darryls, Deweys, Kahuna Tunas...

423
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:29,766
Okay. That's good.
Thanks.

424
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:31,768
Very good.

425
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:39,610
Poindexter, write this down, man.

426
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:41,904
You may see a wave out there,

427
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:45,324
but real surfers,
they see an A-frame,

428
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:47,409
a steakhouse, curly fries.

429
00:22:47,451 --> 00:22:49,912
Pennsylvania pencil cases.

430
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:51,705
A Mongolian bastard baby.

431
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:54,208
Delta Burke's asshole.
A monkey tail.

432
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:56,752
A Chinese roasted baby koala, man.

433
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:59,463
An onion bun covered
with garlic butter.

434
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:01,965
A flamingo tit, man!

435
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:03,884
Uh, is there a hyphen in "flamingo tit"?

436
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:05,552
Shut up, Larry!

437
00:23:05,636 --> 00:23:06,970
Sorry.

438
00:23:07,054 --> 00:23:09,431
Come on, get on your boards!

439
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:14,186
I want to see you on your... boards.

440
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:16,688
It's all about touch, Larry.

441
00:23:16,772 --> 00:23:19,191
You've got to feel that wave, man.

442
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:22,444
You got to reach out there
and find its G-spot

443
00:23:22,528 --> 00:23:25,906
and touch it like it's your...
your dirty little girlfriend.

444
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:28,158
Waves are like women.

445
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:30,452
They got lots of curves,

446
00:23:30,536 --> 00:23:32,579
they're slippery when they're wet,

447
00:23:32,663 --> 00:23:34,289
and if you don't
ride them the right way,

448
00:23:34,373 --> 00:23:36,500
they're gonna pound you, man.

449
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,252
They got big jugs, right?

450
00:23:39,962 --> 00:23:42,172
You know.

451
00:23:42,256 --> 00:23:44,216
Look. Larry...

452
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:46,677
if you're gonna rip with the big boys,

453
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,804
you got to learn to understand women.

454
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:52,599
Uh, not the best advice, Ripster.
Dude's a total virgin.

455
00:23:52,683 --> 00:23:56,270
Yeah, man. The only booty call
he's ever seen starred Jamie Foxx.

456
00:23:56,353 --> 00:23:58,814
Is that true, Larry?

457
00:23:58,856 --> 00:24:00,524
No. Actually I didn't catch {y:i}Booty Call.

458
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:02,901
I had an S.A.T. Review course.

459
00:24:02,985 --> 00:24:05,070
And Mother thinks
Jamie Foxx is a pottymouth.

460
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:08,282
Larry, are you a virgin, man?

461
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:11,326
- Yes.
- Wow, man.

462
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:13,161
I haven't seen one of you around here

463
00:24:13,245 --> 00:24:16,748
since "Grinder Teeth" Mary
took out little Jimmy McGee

464
00:24:16,832 --> 00:24:20,794
behind the dumpster
at the pomegranate hut.

465
00:24:20,878 --> 00:24:23,338
How'd you become
a washed-up, old wino?

466
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:27,551
Taz? We, uh...
we looked you up.

467
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:29,595
You won the world championship, 1989,

468
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:32,848
and you just disappeared.

469
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:35,934
You Barneys don't know
about the legend of...

470
00:24:36,018 --> 00:24:37,603
Ghost Babe.

471
00:24:37,686 --> 00:24:40,564
Dead babe?

472
00:24:40,606 --> 00:24:44,902
Oh, I'm afraid she is quite alive...

473
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:47,613
to me,

474
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:49,865
my young understudy.

475
00:24:49,948 --> 00:24:51,241
Was she was, like, hotter
than Pam Anderson?

476
00:24:51,325 --> 00:24:56,371
Mm-hmm! Just a few thousand
degrees hotter... brah!

477
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:03,378
So there I am, the surf god,
surrounded by my disciples,

478
00:25:03,462 --> 00:25:05,589
when all of a sudden... pow!

479
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:09,259
She floats right by me like on a cloud.

480
00:25:09,343 --> 00:25:15,474
And all I can remember is that soft,
intoxicating breeze she left behind.

481
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:20,562
It looked like the good Lord himself
had baked those hot buns.

482
00:25:22,356 --> 00:25:26,151
Her breasts had perfect alignment...

483
00:25:26,235 --> 00:25:30,405
exactly the same size.

484
00:25:30,489 --> 00:25:32,991
They were nothing short of...

485
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:37,955
sh-sh-sh... shweet.

486
00:25:39,373 --> 00:25:41,792
Shweet.

487
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:46,588
Well, we made love
every minute of every day.

488
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:51,385
She gave me foot massages.

489
00:25:55,931 --> 00:25:58,058
She brushed my hair.

490
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:02,646
She made my clothes.

491
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:06,525
And in between,
she would feed me grapes...

492
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:09,152
make me mai tais...

493
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:11,780
feed me quarter pounders with cheese

494
00:26:11,822 --> 00:26:14,032
Sounds like a keeper.

495
00:26:15,993 --> 00:26:17,911
How does it end?

496
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:20,747
Some surfers were hanging
out down on the beach.

497
00:26:20,831 --> 00:26:23,375
So I walked over and...

498
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:24,918
And what?

499
00:26:25,002 --> 00:26:27,462
And then they laughed at me.

500
00:26:29,131 --> 00:26:31,592
They had no idea who I was.

501
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:37,806
I had vanished for...
10 years.

502
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:41,268
But why would they laugh at you
just because you disappeared?

503
00:26:46,023 --> 00:26:47,107
No reason, man.

504
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:51,111
Just, you know, nervous,
uh, giggles and stuff.

505
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:54,239
- Ghost Babe.
- Ghost Babe.

506
00:27:03,415 --> 00:27:05,459
Ohh.

507
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:07,669
Natural spirit,

508
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:11,048
Father sun, sister moon,

509
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:16,970
reach your hand down to us and touch us
with your loving light.

510
00:27:17,054 --> 00:27:19,223
Touch our souls deeply.

511
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:22,392
Boris, I swear, Tilly's off limits.

512
00:27:22,476 --> 00:27:24,686
We accept that. But, uh...

513
00:27:24,728 --> 00:27:26,438
the Swedish chicks?

514
00:27:26,522 --> 00:27:30,275
Swedish girl is caviar of girl.

515
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:32,653
Go.

516
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:36,490
Let us feel the warmth.

517
00:27:36,573 --> 00:27:38,200
Larry.

518
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:39,826
I can just take a peep.

519
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,787
No peep.

520
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:44,581
No peeping for my boychik.

521
00:27:44,665 --> 00:27:50,462
Thank you for sharing this
lovely light and love time.

522
00:27:50,546 --> 00:27:51,713
We are finished.

523
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:54,258
Om.

524
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:57,177
Ready?

525
00:27:57,261 --> 00:27:58,512
- {y:i}Ja.
- {y:i}Ja.

526
00:27:58,595 --> 00:27:59,680
We hold hands, {y:i}ja?

527
00:27:59,763 --> 00:28:00,848
{y:i}Ja.

528
00:28:04,393 --> 00:28:06,103
Oh, fellas, hi!

529
00:28:08,772 --> 00:28:10,315
Do I look fat in this?

530
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,234
Oh, God! Oh!
Oh! Oh!

531
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:14,486
I can tell that peeping is happening.

532
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:16,822
It's okay, Boris.
They wouldn't.

533
00:28:16,905 --> 00:28:19,408
You're a good boy.
I like you.

534
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:22,619
That is why I am so happy
to put you onto the road to manhood

535
00:28:22,703 --> 00:28:24,955
like my father
put me onto that road.

536
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:26,331
Do you have father?

537
00:28:26,415 --> 00:28:28,625
No.

538
00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:30,669
Mother says
he was Beelzebub's brother.

539
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,800
She like you, Larry.

540
00:28:38,177 --> 00:28:41,722
Can't you find a tree to swing from?

541
00:28:42,848 --> 00:28:49,354
Milk from a virgin cow for my virgin boy.

542
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:56,069
Gracias.

543
00:28:56,153 --> 00:28:59,114
{y:i}Mucho gusto.

544
00:29:00,449 --> 00:29:03,327
I will see you at the sing-along.

545
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:04,953
The sing-along?

546
00:29:05,037 --> 00:29:07,831
Drink that milk.
It's good.

547
00:29:07,915 --> 00:29:09,124
Good milk.

548
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:13,295
Fear's the way we die

549
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:16,256
Sometimes you are so scared
that you've got to die.

550
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:19,051
You can make the mountains ring

551
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:22,513
Or make the angels cry

552
00:29:22,596 --> 00:29:25,807
Why is it that the angels
continue to cry like that?

553
00:29:25,849 --> 00:29:29,102
Though the bird is on the wing

554
00:29:29,186 --> 00:29:32,064
And you may not know why

555
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:34,483
Why is it that birds fly?

556
00:29:34,525 --> 00:29:36,610
Come on, people, now

557
00:29:36,693 --> 00:29:37,986
Smile on your brother

558
00:29:38,028 --> 00:29:39,905
Everybody get together

559
00:29:39,988 --> 00:29:44,076
Try to love one another right now

560
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,078
One more time.

561
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:50,832
Just my beautiful, sweet
Helga, Belga, and Selga.

562
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:53,085
Come on, people, now

563
00:29:53,168 --> 00:29:55,045
Smile on your brother

564
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:57,381
Everybody get together

565
00:29:57,464 --> 00:30:01,426
Try to love one another right now

566
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,470
- {y:i}Ja.
- {y:i}Jal

567
00:30:03,554 --> 00:30:06,598
Oh! This is my favorite verse.

568
00:30:06,682 --> 00:30:08,851
Who wants to try it?

569
00:30:08,892 --> 00:30:12,813
Who wants to serenade Mama Tilly?

570
00:30:21,947 --> 00:30:23,699
You're loved here.

571
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:40,174
If you hear the song I sing

572
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:44,511
You will understand

573
00:30:47,097 --> 00:30:52,853
You hold the key to love and fear

574
00:30:52,936 --> 00:30:58,358
All in your trembling hand

575
00:30:58,442 --> 00:31:03,113
Just one key unlocks them both

576
00:31:03,197 --> 00:31:06,950
It's there at your command

577
00:31:07,034 --> 00:31:09,786
Come on, people, now

578
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,788
Smile on your brother

579
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:15,167
Everybody get together

580
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:20,339
Try to love one another right now

581
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,602
What about Doris, though?

582
00:31:33,644 --> 00:31:36,647
She was, like, definitely handling
that business last night.

583
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:39,149
Total potential.
That's that jump-off girl.

584
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:40,192
That's what I was trying to tell you about.

585
00:31:40,275 --> 00:31:42,152
Yeah, she was, uh...
cool.

586
00:31:43,612 --> 00:31:46,323
Check it out.

587
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:47,824
The spot, guys.

588
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:52,829
How sweet.

589
00:31:52,913 --> 00:31:55,165
You ladies must be
on your honeymoon.

590
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:58,585
Yeah, looks like
four brides to be.

591
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:01,505
Barney goes to Costa Rica.

592
00:32:01,547 --> 00:32:04,800
Do you Gilligans actually think
you have a chance in this contest?

593
00:32:04,842 --> 00:32:06,426
I know we do.

594
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:09,012
Whoa.

595
00:32:09,096 --> 00:32:13,100
That dude is...
intense, man.

596
00:32:13,183 --> 00:32:15,102
Shut up, Roach.

597
00:32:16,562 --> 00:32:19,439
Yeah, well, it's all good, bro.

598
00:32:19,523 --> 00:32:22,067
But don't you think it's time you dropped
the whole affirmative-action thing

599
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:24,444
and come kick it with the real playas?

600
00:32:24,528 --> 00:32:26,697
Come on.

601
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,907
- Play with that.
- Bam!

602
00:32:30,033 --> 00:32:32,077
Total dis, man.

603
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,203
Roach, shut up.

604
00:32:33,287 --> 00:32:36,206
Bam! That's cool, man.

605
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:39,084
Total dis, man.
Bam!

606
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:41,211
Roach, shut up.

607
00:32:41,295 --> 00:32:42,296
Bam!

608
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:44,131
Yeah.

609
00:32:44,214 --> 00:32:45,841
See you in the water, Tyler.

610
00:32:45,883 --> 00:32:47,801
That's fine.

611
00:32:47,885 --> 00:32:51,180
You losers want more humiliation?

612
00:32:51,221 --> 00:32:52,598
You got it.

613
00:32:52,681 --> 00:32:55,184
At least you brought your own pussy.

614
00:32:56,268 --> 00:32:57,895
You start it, I'll finish it, bro.

615
00:32:57,978 --> 00:33:01,648
Consider it started...
brah.

616
00:33:12,868 --> 00:33:14,995
Whoa. Peace, dude.

617
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:19,791
You good?

618
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:21,710
Is it over yet, man?

619
00:33:21,752 --> 00:33:24,546
Nah, dude, it's not over.

620
00:33:25,964 --> 00:33:27,674
You guys ready to learn to surf?

621
00:33:27,758 --> 00:33:29,009
Hell, yeah.

622
00:33:29,092 --> 00:33:32,804
You see all the honeys
over at Surfer's Paradise, bro?

623
00:33:32,888 --> 00:33:34,806
Well, you're not riding
any of them honeys

624
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:36,975
till you ride this honey right here.

625
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:39,937
So the only honey you need to be
focused on right now

626
00:33:39,978 --> 00:33:41,980
is that honey right there,
Winnie the Pooh.

627
00:33:42,064 --> 00:33:44,233
Sauce with those wings, brah?

628
00:33:44,274 --> 00:33:46,443
All right.
Don't forget, brahs.

629
00:33:46,527 --> 00:33:49,613
You got to crest that wave
like a soggy monkey, man.

630
00:33:51,031 --> 00:33:52,991
Stroke, stroke, stroke.

631
00:33:53,075 --> 00:33:54,701
Come on!

632
00:33:54,785 --> 00:33:57,120
Hey, uh, Rip.

633
00:33:57,162 --> 00:33:58,247
Just got a little warmer over here.

634
00:33:58,288 --> 00:33:59,665
Did Josh just take a piss?

635
00:33:59,748 --> 00:34:01,959
No, that was me, brah.
Sorry.

636
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:06,129
Well, look at you.
Up and floating.

637
00:34:06,213 --> 00:34:08,757
Hey, Larry, you dry humping, man?

638
00:34:08,841 --> 00:34:12,010
You're getting the hang of it, hairdo.

639
00:34:12,094 --> 00:34:14,137
Oh, yeah! Taz!

640
00:34:14,221 --> 00:34:16,265
You shred! You shred... oh!

641
00:34:16,348 --> 00:34:20,519
Oh! Sh-sh-sh... shweet!

642
00:34:22,396 --> 00:34:24,439
...maybe loosen up your grip a little
bit on the board.

643
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:27,276
And then maybe you get enough
confidence to, uh...

644
00:34:28,861 --> 00:34:30,904
Is that what love looks like?

645
00:34:30,988 --> 00:34:33,198
No, servant boy.

646
00:34:33,282 --> 00:34:34,825
I am the Queen of Siam.
The king...

647
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:36,743
I'm not really sure what that looks like.

648
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:38,620
Oh, Gonga.

649
00:34:38,704 --> 00:34:41,081
Oh, Gonga, we have company.

650
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:43,166
Boychik, I've been looking for you.

651
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,919
Let's go.
We have work to do.

652
00:34:46,003 --> 00:34:47,754
You know how difficult it is for me
to leave you like this?

653
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:49,506
- Go.
- Breaks my heart.

654
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,632
He needs you.

655
00:34:51,633 --> 00:34:54,887
Have you, uh, touched a woman?

656
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:57,890
Like my mom?

657
00:34:58,891 --> 00:35:01,727
You want to...
touch your mommy?

658
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,353
God, no.

659
00:35:03,437 --> 00:35:05,856
Good. That's good.

660
00:35:05,898 --> 00:35:07,649
I can help you.

661
00:35:39,264 --> 00:35:41,475
Hey, you were amazing last night.

662
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,312
I mean...
your voice is...

663
00:35:47,272 --> 00:35:48,815
it's perfect.

664
00:35:50,234 --> 00:35:54,196
You and Mo could probably team up
and really rock the mike.

665
00:35:56,406 --> 00:35:58,575
You know...

666
00:35:58,659 --> 00:36:01,703
before I moved to Laguna,

667
00:36:01,745 --> 00:36:04,706
I kind of had it made
at my old school.

668
00:36:04,748 --> 00:36:09,253
Me and my boys, we were in the show.
We were Tyler.

669
00:36:09,336 --> 00:36:11,630
Well...

670
00:36:11,713 --> 00:36:14,758
Not a dick like Tyler, but...

671
00:36:14,842 --> 00:36:18,846
You know, people like
Larry and Taz...

672
00:36:20,347 --> 00:36:23,058
People like you.

673
00:36:23,141 --> 00:36:25,894
I guess I noticed you guys
out on the fringes, but...

674
00:36:28,397 --> 00:36:30,357
I guess I didn't really notice.

675
00:36:31,775 --> 00:36:34,069
I spent too much time

676
00:36:34,152 --> 00:36:38,532
worrying about my biceps
and holding a lacrosse stick, I guess.

677
00:36:38,615 --> 00:36:42,244
Well, I came out here, and...

678
00:36:42,286 --> 00:36:44,413
I know how that feels.

679
00:36:45,455 --> 00:36:48,750
So, uh...

680
00:36:48,834 --> 00:36:51,044
If you ever want to talk...

681
00:36:53,797 --> 00:36:55,591
Well...

682
00:36:57,134 --> 00:37:00,304
you have an amazing voice.

683
00:37:12,065 --> 00:37:14,067
Oh, and, uh...

684
00:37:14,151 --> 00:37:16,195
nice t-shirt.

685
00:37:23,118 --> 00:37:24,077
Check it out.

686
00:37:24,161 --> 00:37:26,121
These European girls,

687
00:37:26,163 --> 00:37:28,040
they're totally cool with their titties.

688
00:37:28,123 --> 00:37:29,666
I'd be cool with their titties, man.

689
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:30,834
Got to give them some of your lines.

690
00:37:30,918 --> 00:37:32,085
I got to see those hooters.

691
00:37:32,169 --> 00:37:34,713
Calm down, man.
Y'all white boys rush too much.

692
00:37:34,796 --> 00:37:36,882
You got to be like a brother.
You got to ease in.

693
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:39,343
Let the vibe do all the work.
Watch this.

694
00:37:43,847 --> 00:37:45,974
Love this music.

695
00:37:46,058 --> 00:37:49,102
{y:i}Ja. Me, too.
Love it.

696
00:37:49,186 --> 00:37:51,772
Well, then, maybe we should
join the party.

697
00:37:51,855 --> 00:37:53,315
Yeah, you can sit.

698
00:37:53,357 --> 00:37:56,443
Thank you, Lord.
Oh, yeah.

699
00:37:56,527 --> 00:37:59,488
I think it's really cool the way
you European girls are so...

700
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:01,281
free with your bodies.

701
00:38:01,365 --> 00:38:03,367
Yeah, American chicks are all uptight
with their hooters.

702
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:05,619
They won't even show them unless
they have, like...

703
00:38:05,702 --> 00:38:09,414
a full-access web page
and being filmed for... {y:i}Girls Gone Wild.

704
00:38:09,498 --> 00:38:12,876
The breasts are no big deal.
Just skin.

705
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,630
{y:i}Ja. We have nipples.
You have nipples.

706
00:38:16,713 --> 00:38:20,425
American men seem to get
so crazy over breasts.

707
00:38:20,509 --> 00:38:22,594
Well, we're... we're not, uh,

708
00:38:22,678 --> 00:38:24,221
your typical American men.

709
00:38:24,304 --> 00:38:26,515
I mean, we barely
even noticed your...

710
00:38:26,557 --> 00:38:29,768
perfect, symmetrical, mouth-watering,

711
00:38:29,852 --> 00:38:32,521
perky...

712
00:38:32,604 --> 00:38:36,692
Um, yeah, we're... we're very European
when it comes to that.

713
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:38,235
We, uh... you know.

714
00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:39,736
You could...
you could whip them out

715
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,698
and smack them in us...
me in the face with them right now,

716
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:44,867
and I... I wouldn't notice.
Would you? No.

717
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:48,620
Good. We can be free
with you and not worry.

718
00:38:54,501 --> 00:38:56,420
How's it going, brahs?

719
00:38:56,503 --> 00:38:57,754
Board?

720
00:38:57,838 --> 00:38:59,590
Yeah, man, the board.

721
00:38:59,673 --> 00:39:02,217
I cut it myself.
It's a 6-footer.

722
00:39:04,678 --> 00:39:07,431
It's got some tasty curves.

723
00:39:07,514 --> 00:39:10,434
It's kind of firm,

724
00:39:10,517 --> 00:39:13,562
but yet it feels real nice in the hand.

725
00:39:13,604 --> 00:39:16,106
You got to make sure you...

726
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:18,442
you treat it like a lady.

727
00:39:18,525 --> 00:39:20,569
Stimulate it,

728
00:39:20,652 --> 00:39:22,905
make sure the nipple
doesn't get dirty.

729
00:39:22,946 --> 00:39:24,489
- Move the damn board.
- Yeah.

730
00:39:24,573 --> 00:39:27,326
You want to be able to caress it

731
00:39:27,409 --> 00:39:29,912
and call it names like...

732
00:39:29,995 --> 00:39:33,957
Hello, Sally.
How are you today?

733
00:39:33,999 --> 00:39:36,460
Hey, you, uh...

734
00:39:36,502 --> 00:39:39,671
you girls want to come
for some mahi-mahi?

735
00:39:39,755 --> 00:39:41,507
- Mahi-mahi?

736
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:44,051
I'll see you
at church, fellas.

737
00:39:46,136 --> 00:39:47,346
Thanks.

738
00:39:47,429 --> 00:39:49,097
We go bikini shopping now.

739
00:39:49,181 --> 00:39:50,641
Want to come?

740
00:39:50,724 --> 00:39:51,975
Come on, six pack.

741
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:54,269
You got to loosen up!

742
00:39:54,353 --> 00:39:56,897
It's like you're blow-drying your hair
and you got to set it free.

743
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:59,358
It's Kenny G time, man.

744
00:40:00,776 --> 00:40:04,279
Whoa. Great movement.

745
00:40:04,363 --> 00:40:06,448
What kind of conditioner
you using, man?

746
00:40:06,532 --> 00:40:07,991
Do you like?

747
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:09,910
Oh, yeah.

748
00:40:09,993 --> 00:40:12,913
Hey, you guys want to see
a triple-fart bubble?

749
00:40:12,996 --> 00:40:14,873
Could you boys spray us?

750
00:40:14,957 --> 00:40:16,667
Spray you?

751
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,418
Ooh, that was a nice one.

752
00:40:18,502 --> 00:40:21,004
You take Helga. I'll take Selga.
We'll split Belga.

753
00:40:22,673 --> 00:40:24,716
{y:i}Ja.
Feels so hot.

754
00:40:28,762 --> 00:40:32,099
Come on! Paddle like an altar boy
at a private communion.

755
00:40:32,182 --> 00:40:34,977
I love that game American boys
and girls play.

756
00:40:35,018 --> 00:40:36,311
What is it called?

757
00:40:36,395 --> 00:40:37,437
Volleyball?

758
00:40:37,521 --> 00:40:39,356
Strip poker.

759
00:40:42,609 --> 00:40:46,488
That's it, zero body fat.
Stand and deliver.

760
00:40:50,534 --> 00:40:52,995
Oh, yeah, that's my Tazzy.

761
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:54,997
Ace high.

762
00:40:58,125 --> 00:41:01,170
In the water.
Come on, pansy boy.

763
00:41:04,173 --> 00:41:06,216
Okay, hairdo. Steady.

764
00:41:09,928 --> 00:41:11,847
They'll think I have a nice ass, right?

765
00:41:11,889 --> 00:41:13,390
I'm not looking, man.

766
00:41:13,432 --> 00:41:15,475
S- shweet!

767
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:19,021
You fellas believe in fairy tales?

768
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:24,484
'Cause I think we got a real
Cinderella story happening here.

769
00:41:24,568 --> 00:41:28,322
My boy Taz,
you can really shred, brother,

770
00:41:28,405 --> 00:41:30,908
and I'm not talking about
spoon-size shredded wheat.

771
00:41:30,991 --> 00:41:34,161
I'm talking about this cat
soaking up all the milk.

772
00:41:34,244 --> 00:41:36,371
And you there, hairdo...

773
00:41:36,455 --> 00:41:39,041
if you could just loosen up
just a little bit,

774
00:41:39,082 --> 00:41:41,960
that would be real...

775
00:41:42,044 --> 00:41:44,713
shweet.

776
00:41:44,796 --> 00:41:49,009
My brother...
oh, my dear brother...

777
00:41:49,092 --> 00:41:52,221
you are one juicy water wing away

778
00:41:52,262 --> 00:41:54,473
from getting the whole thing.

779
00:41:54,556 --> 00:41:56,016
Larry...

780
00:41:56,099 --> 00:41:58,810
your balls are so dried up,

781
00:41:58,894 --> 00:42:03,732
I can see them swinging off
my rearview mirror halfway to Turkey.

782
00:42:03,774 --> 00:42:06,360
Boris says he has
big plans for me tonight.

783
00:42:06,443 --> 00:42:07,653
Yeah.

784
00:42:07,736 --> 00:42:09,154
Well, he better.

785
00:42:09,238 --> 00:42:11,198
The competition starts tomorrow.

786
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:14,326
All I want to know is,
after we kick major ass out there,

787
00:42:14,409 --> 00:42:15,827
is Ghost Babe gonna show up?

788
00:42:15,911 --> 00:42:18,914
Ghost Babe.

789
00:42:22,626 --> 00:42:24,378
Get out of here while I...

790
00:42:26,088 --> 00:42:27,714
...finish wiping.

791
00:42:27,798 --> 00:42:30,467
Well, you boys, uh...

792
00:42:30,551 --> 00:42:34,763
you want to come by
for some sushi tonight, hmm?

793
00:42:34,847 --> 00:42:37,641
I hand-make it, put all the little
pieces together.

794
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:40,477
How about some nice mahi-mahi?

795
00:42:40,561 --> 00:42:42,521
Oh. That's a dingleberry.

796
00:42:42,604 --> 00:42:44,356
Well, as you know,

797
00:42:44,439 --> 00:42:48,819
every revolution requires a secret mission
or two to level the battlefield,

798
00:42:48,861 --> 00:42:50,821
so Boris and I whipped up
a little something

799
00:42:50,863 --> 00:42:53,699
that might even the odds tomorrow.

800
00:42:55,033 --> 00:42:56,034
What is this?

801
00:42:56,118 --> 00:42:58,120
Microscopic crabs.

802
00:42:58,203 --> 00:43:00,873
Kind of tough to focus on your surfing

803
00:43:00,956 --> 00:43:04,668
when you got those cute little critters
dancing in your shorts.

804
00:43:04,751 --> 00:43:08,172
In 1971, I put the crabs like that

805
00:43:08,213 --> 00:43:10,757
into the jockstrap of President Nixon.

806
00:43:10,841 --> 00:43:14,553
I was towel boy in racquet club,

807
00:43:14,636 --> 00:43:19,558
and there is famous film of Nixon
shaking the hand of Chinese premier,

808
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:23,854
and then immediately,
he scratches his balls.

809
00:43:23,937 --> 00:43:28,483
Those are my crabs on his balls.

810
00:43:28,567 --> 00:43:30,027
And on that note...

811
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:32,154
I'm in!

812
00:43:35,365 --> 00:43:37,618
Start scratching, Tyler.

813
00:43:37,701 --> 00:43:40,287
Nice skid marks, Stoop.

814
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:43,957
I want you to wear these gloves
when you spank Larry

815
00:43:44,041 --> 00:43:46,168
because they are clean and simple

816
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:47,711
and good, and so is Larry.

817
00:43:47,753 --> 00:43:50,923
I will!

818
00:43:51,006 --> 00:43:52,716
Thank you, Mr. Boris.

819
00:43:52,799 --> 00:43:54,593
Now, kiss my pinky.

820
00:44:00,349 --> 00:44:02,851
Foolish girl!

821
00:44:02,935 --> 00:44:05,312
He could never love you.

822
00:44:07,189 --> 00:44:10,692
I will not let you
disrupt this sacred act!

823
00:44:12,903 --> 00:44:15,531
I've had it with you!

824
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:21,203
Okay, you little carpet munchers,

825
00:44:21,286 --> 00:44:23,121
I wish I could go with you.

826
00:44:26,917 --> 00:44:29,545
That should do most
of the competition.

827
00:44:29,586 --> 00:44:33,131
Right next to daddy, and what does
that little piggy sleep in?

828
00:44:33,215 --> 00:44:34,383
It sleeps in daddy's bed.

829
00:44:34,424 --> 00:44:37,427
I can't take this anymore, you guys.
I'm serious!

830
00:44:37,511 --> 00:44:39,137
Hey, Boris, what's up with Larry?

831
00:44:39,221 --> 00:44:43,350
Boychik is becoming a man right now.

832
00:44:43,433 --> 00:44:46,061
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Are you serious? Full-on bonin'!

833
00:44:46,103 --> 00:44:47,855
We go slowly.

834
00:44:47,938 --> 00:44:51,525
We like to begin with erotic spanking.

835
00:44:51,608 --> 00:44:53,068
Oh, yeah.

836
00:44:56,321 --> 00:45:00,075
Oh, God, your touch feels so good,

837
00:45:00,117 --> 00:45:03,287
almost otherworldly.

838
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:07,416
Almost like I've waited my
whole life for this moment.

839
00:45:07,499 --> 00:45:08,917
You're my dream come true.

840
00:45:14,798 --> 00:45:19,595
You're a goddess.
You're my goddess, yeah.

841
00:45:19,636 --> 00:45:23,390
Spank it! Spank it! Yeah!

842
00:45:27,227 --> 00:45:30,439
That's right!
We're wild animals! Yeah!

843
00:45:34,276 --> 00:45:37,196
Mr. Boris,
I've been looking all over for you.

844
00:45:37,279 --> 00:45:38,530
She is a pig!

845
00:45:38,614 --> 00:45:40,115
Tell me who is pig.

846
00:45:43,911 --> 00:45:46,747
Yeah! My brothers!

847
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:49,291
Say hello to your little friend.

848
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:51,585
Big B, you the man.

849
00:45:51,668 --> 00:45:53,712
Mariana was amazing.

850
00:45:53,795 --> 00:45:55,672
You were amazing, {y:i}mi amor.

851
00:45:55,714 --> 00:45:57,674
You set me free.

852
00:45:57,716 --> 00:45:59,051
I'm a man.

853
00:45:59,134 --> 00:46:01,803
But, virgin boy, it cannot be.

854
00:46:01,887 --> 00:46:05,724
I have not yet begun the sacred act.

855
00:46:05,807 --> 00:46:10,312
What? Well, then who was the honey
wearing the silk gloves?

856
00:46:10,354 --> 00:46:13,357
Who is that that you give
the silk gloves to?

857
00:46:33,043 --> 00:46:34,586
I guess you got the itches, too.

858
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:38,006
Itches?
You mean crabs.

859
00:46:38,048 --> 00:46:41,093
You skank, who were
you with last night?

860
00:46:47,891 --> 00:46:51,103
Something's burning my balls.

861
00:46:54,356 --> 00:46:56,233
Hey, baby.

862
00:46:57,818 --> 00:46:59,945
You were warned.

863
00:47:05,576 --> 00:47:07,452
Oh, God.

864
00:47:07,536 --> 00:47:11,790
Whoa.
Dude went large.

865
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:15,002
{y:i}Hola, beautiful people.

866
00:47:15,085 --> 00:47:20,716
I am Roberto Federico Maria Francesca
Ernesto Alonzo Maximo de la Sosa Minara,

867
00:47:20,799 --> 00:47:23,385
and welcome
to beautiful Costa Rica

868
00:47:23,468 --> 00:47:29,099
for the 2005 International High School
Surfing Championships!

869
00:47:29,183 --> 00:47:31,852
I just want to say before we get started

870
00:47:31,935 --> 00:47:34,438
that all of you are looking
so beautiful today

871
00:47:34,521 --> 00:47:37,441
and I'm so glad that you're all here to see me
looking so cute in this outfit.

872
00:47:37,482 --> 00:47:38,483
I know.

873
00:47:38,567 --> 00:47:40,444
Hey, Larry.

874
00:47:40,527 --> 00:47:42,988
Heard you had a wild night last night.

875
00:47:43,071 --> 00:47:46,033
She pick the fleas
from your pubes, too?

876
00:47:46,116 --> 00:47:48,035
Keep on scratching, Tyler.

877
00:47:48,118 --> 00:47:50,204
Well, ladies, the final humiliation begins.

878
00:47:50,287 --> 00:47:52,998
Humiliation, man.

879
00:47:53,081 --> 00:47:55,292
Now you better hope
when this is all over

880
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:58,837
that Larry's new girlfriend has friends.

881
00:47:58,921 --> 00:48:02,424
Oh. It's the old washed-up wino.

882
00:48:04,968 --> 00:48:06,887
I knew a little surfer rebel
like you once.

883
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:09,640
- Yeah?
- Duke Kowalski.

884
00:48:09,723 --> 00:48:12,434
You know what I did to him?

885
00:48:12,476 --> 00:48:17,940
I superglued his nut sac
to the back of a mahi-mahi.

886
00:48:17,981 --> 00:48:20,400
You know what that
does to a nut sac, son,

887
00:48:20,484 --> 00:48:23,195
bouncing up and down
on the waves?

888
00:48:23,278 --> 00:48:27,449
One day, you're like a little
19-year-old peach sac.

889
00:48:27,491 --> 00:48:32,913
The next day, you're an
80-year-old mango sac.

890
00:48:32,996 --> 00:48:35,707
You know what kind
of pain that is, son?

891
00:48:35,791 --> 00:48:37,501
That's like sitting in a dark corner,

892
00:48:37,584 --> 00:48:41,463
seeing how many onion rings
you can stack on your shaft...

893
00:48:41,505 --> 00:48:45,467
except you forgot to
let them cool off first.

894
00:48:45,551 --> 00:48:49,680
Now legend has it,
on a hot summer night

895
00:48:49,763 --> 00:48:51,974
when the moon's just right,

896
00:48:52,015 --> 00:48:55,727
you can here old Duke
screaming in the dark

897
00:48:55,811 --> 00:48:59,064
while the mahi-mahi's laughing.

898
00:49:04,278 --> 00:49:06,280
All right, you old wino, enough!

899
00:49:08,365 --> 00:49:09,950
Larry,

900
00:49:10,033 --> 00:49:12,494
it happens to the best of us.

901
00:49:15,205 --> 00:49:18,500
Did I ever tell you, son, that I used to
be a sheep farmer?

902
00:49:18,542 --> 00:49:21,128
Adolph Schnitzel!

903
00:49:21,211 --> 00:49:23,672
Oh, that's right.
Oh, baby!

904
00:49:23,755 --> 00:49:26,258
I think I have a couple
of buns for that schnitzel.

905
00:49:26,341 --> 00:49:29,678
Oh! I'm so crazy today.
I'm on fire.

906
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:30,971
I'm on fire.
Put me out.

907
00:49:31,054 --> 00:49:34,683
You better go talk
to your troops, captain.

908
00:49:39,771 --> 00:49:43,984
You know, guys,
I had a little something-something

909
00:49:44,067 --> 00:49:45,569
planned to say to you guys,

910
00:49:45,652 --> 00:49:49,406
but I think if we learned anything
from Tilly and Boris

911
00:49:49,489 --> 00:49:54,036
it's that history is where it's at.

912
00:49:54,077 --> 00:49:56,121
Because I don't know
about you guys,

913
00:49:56,205 --> 00:49:59,291
but I don't want to look back on today

914
00:49:59,374 --> 00:50:02,753
many a years from now...

915
00:50:02,836 --> 00:50:04,922
and be thinking to myself

916
00:50:05,005 --> 00:50:08,717
that I would trade all the days

917
00:50:08,759 --> 00:50:12,346
from this day to that for one chance,

918
00:50:12,429 --> 00:50:14,765
just one chance

919
00:50:14,848 --> 00:50:16,642
to come back here to this beach

920
00:50:16,725 --> 00:50:19,144
and tell these arse clowns

921
00:50:19,228 --> 00:50:22,231
that they may try to take our pride,

922
00:50:22,314 --> 00:50:26,860
but they will never take our spirit!

923
00:50:26,944 --> 00:50:28,445
Yes!

924
00:50:36,286 --> 00:50:38,539
Pretty decent {y:i}Braveheart there.

925
00:50:38,622 --> 00:50:41,166
Jordan. Jordan, I know you're on an
inspirational roll,

926
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:43,001
but I don't think this
is gonna work with me.

927
00:50:43,085 --> 00:50:46,380
I had my first erotic spanking
from a chimp last night,

928
00:50:46,463 --> 00:50:48,590
and everybody
on this beach knows it.

929
00:50:48,674 --> 00:50:50,342
Even their mothers know it.

930
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,684
Oh. We best not disturb him.

931
00:50:58,767 --> 00:51:00,519
Hello, Larry.

932
00:51:00,602 --> 00:51:03,272
Why does he hate me?
He hates me now.

933
00:51:03,313 --> 00:51:05,524
Oh, come on, precious pants.

934
00:51:05,607 --> 00:51:06,942
He just needs a little time.

935
00:51:06,984 --> 00:51:10,445
And now our defending champions

936
00:51:10,487 --> 00:51:12,614
from the United States of America,

937
00:51:12,698 --> 00:51:16,910
the country bringing democracy to the world
one invasion at a time,

938
00:51:16,994 --> 00:51:21,206
ladies and gentlemen, from California's
Laguna Beach High School,

939
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:26,712
let's give it up for Tyler Masters!

940
00:51:29,131 --> 00:51:32,301
Larry, you're gonna be my understudy.

941
00:51:32,384 --> 00:51:35,429
If anything happens to any one
of these fellas,

942
00:51:35,512 --> 00:51:37,472
you're going in.

943
00:51:37,556 --> 00:51:42,895
If somebody breaks a leg,
twists an ankle, blows a spleen,

944
00:51:42,978 --> 00:51:46,982
I'm talking about someone getting
their buck teeth caught on a Ferris wheel,

945
00:51:47,065 --> 00:51:48,942
you're going in there,
little hedgehog.

946
00:51:49,026 --> 00:51:51,278
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, sir.

947
00:51:51,361 --> 00:51:53,572
- Larry, I don't hear you!
- Yes, sir!

948
00:51:53,655 --> 00:51:55,991
Beautiful boys,

949
00:51:56,033 --> 00:52:00,078
we run our delicious,
sculpted male bodies on the horn.

950
00:52:00,162 --> 00:52:04,499
Ready, set, blow!

951
00:52:05,751 --> 00:52:08,170
Oh, look at them run,
look at them run.

952
00:52:08,212 --> 00:52:09,880
Oh, beautiful.

953
00:52:18,555 --> 00:52:21,266
Watch and learn, Mary.

954
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,150
It looks like the cute Costa Rican

955
00:52:30,234 --> 00:52:34,196
is giving my beloved homeland
an early jump on the competition.

956
00:52:34,238 --> 00:52:37,115
Very beautiful, my brother.

957
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:40,536
I definitely sense something between those
two beautiful Americans.

958
00:52:40,577 --> 00:52:42,871
It does not look like love.

959
00:52:45,123 --> 00:52:48,168
Laguna "Ace" Masters
takes the first wave.

960
00:52:48,252 --> 00:52:52,297
Oh, he's so beautiful
in that rough American way!

961
00:52:54,091 --> 00:52:57,094
Now we're only waiting
on Laguna B's Sullivan

962
00:52:57,177 --> 00:52:59,179
to shake what his mama gave him.

963
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:01,223
What is he waiting for?

964
00:53:01,265 --> 00:53:03,392
Don't be shy, baby!
Be beautiful.

965
00:53:03,475 --> 00:53:06,270
It's okay. I believe in you.

966
00:53:06,353 --> 00:53:08,605
Shweet, shweet, shweet.

967
00:53:08,689 --> 00:53:10,232
Come on, Jordan.
Go for it!

968
00:53:14,403 --> 00:53:17,614
And beautiful Jordan
is up and standing.

969
00:53:17,698 --> 00:53:21,869
He's going, going, and gone!
Wipe out!

970
00:53:21,952 --> 00:53:24,329
Not so sh-shweet.

971
00:53:24,413 --> 00:53:26,707
Poor baby, life is not fair.

972
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:29,751
Oh, come on, little hedgehog.

973
00:53:29,793 --> 00:53:33,714
I told you you're the man if anything
happens out there, right, huh?

974
00:53:33,797 --> 00:53:36,049
If somebody gets sick, you're in, man.

975
00:53:36,133 --> 00:53:39,261
Aw, cheer up,
Larry, man.

976
00:53:39,344 --> 00:53:41,930
Hey. You ever play
snap the sponge cake?

977
00:53:49,229 --> 00:53:53,567
Yes. It seems very difficult
for the new boys from Laguna B.

978
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:55,277
I hear that they just learned to surf.

979
00:53:57,654 --> 00:53:59,615
They're trying so hard.

980
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:07,873
Oh, biggity-boy-oh-boy!
What a first day of competition.

981
00:54:07,956 --> 00:54:09,917
{y:i}Pura vidal

982
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,919
All of you boys were just so...

983
00:54:12,002 --> 00:54:13,670
Oh. What is the word
I'm looking for?

984
00:54:13,754 --> 00:54:15,797
Beautiful!

985
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:17,341
Now let's clap for the beautiful boys.

986
00:54:17,424 --> 00:54:20,052
Come on. Hey. I don't see
you clapping, {y:i}papi.

987
00:54:20,135 --> 00:54:21,303
What's the deal?

988
00:54:21,345 --> 00:54:23,055
When I say clap, you clap, okay?

989
00:54:23,138 --> 00:54:24,556
Simon Says.
This is Simon.

990
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:25,641
All right, all right, all right.

991
00:54:29,144 --> 00:54:30,979
Okay. Let's go, guys.

992
00:54:32,814 --> 00:54:34,983
Now let's check out the scoreboard.

993
00:54:35,067 --> 00:54:36,860
It looks like the very most beautiful

994
00:54:36,944 --> 00:54:38,737
and currently in first place team

995
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:43,158
is none other than defending champion
Laguna Beach A.

996
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:50,541
Will Laguna Beach A hang on for
a second straight title?

997
00:54:50,582 --> 00:54:52,668
Will they look sexy doing it?

998
00:54:52,751 --> 00:54:55,337
Will Batman escape
the clutches of the Penguin

999
00:54:55,379 --> 00:54:57,548
and run off with his crazy
boyfriend Robin?

1000
00:54:57,631 --> 00:54:59,383
I don't know.

1001
00:54:59,466 --> 00:55:01,468
We'll just have to see
the answer tomorrow.

1002
00:55:12,896 --> 00:55:14,773
So until tomorrow,

1003
00:55:14,857 --> 00:55:20,237
this is Roberto Federico Maria Francesca
Maximo de la Sosa Minara

1004
00:55:20,279 --> 00:55:23,490
saying stay beautiful!

1005
00:55:26,994 --> 00:55:28,912
Come on, you guys, huh?

1006
00:55:28,996 --> 00:55:31,206
The way I see it,
you got two choices here.

1007
00:55:31,248 --> 00:55:34,042
You can sit around all mopey-faced

1008
00:55:34,084 --> 00:55:39,548
like your grandmother just got her ass cheek
ripped off by a hammerhead shark,

1009
00:55:39,631 --> 00:55:42,134
or you can hope that tomorrow
the surf gods grant you

1010
00:55:42,217 --> 00:55:44,595
a tasty curl out there, all right?

1011
00:55:44,636 --> 00:55:47,139
Everybody in, right now.

1012
00:55:47,222 --> 00:55:48,557
Come on!

1013
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:50,267
Oh, no, no, no.

1014
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:51,810
We're gonna win this thing.

1015
00:55:51,894 --> 00:55:54,855
I'm talking about a big wave.

1016
00:55:54,938 --> 00:55:56,273
Come on. Big wave.

1017
00:55:56,315 --> 00:55:57,608
Yeah!
Yeah!

1018
00:55:57,691 --> 00:56:02,070
Big... wave.

1019
00:56:02,112 --> 00:56:05,240
Yeah.

1020
00:56:05,282 --> 00:56:08,327
Well, the Laguna Barneys
managed not to drown.

1021
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:10,412
That's impressive.

1022
00:56:10,454 --> 00:56:14,082
So make sure you guys come
to the Dead Fish tonight to celebrate.

1023
00:56:14,124 --> 00:56:16,335
Berthita's giving lap dances.

1024
00:56:18,545 --> 00:56:19,922
Better than a chimp.

1025
00:56:21,465 --> 00:56:26,136
Well, well, well, if it isn't old
Southern Cali again.

1026
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:31,225
Aren't you, uh, running a little late
for your spray-on tan appointment?

1027
00:56:31,308 --> 00:56:35,646
The old Ripter's got a little
beach recipe for you.

1028
00:56:35,729 --> 00:56:39,191
First, you add a little take a hike,

1029
00:56:39,274 --> 00:56:41,735
and you blend in a little asshole.

1030
00:56:41,818 --> 00:56:44,279
You know what I call it?

1031
00:56:44,321 --> 00:56:46,406
Take a hike, asshole.

1032
00:56:52,996 --> 00:56:54,623
Let's go, dumb nuts.

1033
00:56:58,126 --> 00:57:01,839
The boys will need a special support
tonight, yeah?

1034
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,805
Tonight, we have
a special entertainment

1035
00:57:51,889 --> 00:57:54,308
to celebrate your victory tomorrow!

1036
00:57:54,391 --> 00:57:55,809
Yeah, right.

1037
00:57:59,563 --> 00:58:02,941
Oh, my God!
It almost looks like Doris.

1038
00:58:03,025 --> 00:58:07,404
It is Doris. What did I tell you?
Po-ten-tial!

1039
00:58:07,446 --> 00:58:11,074
Wow! It really is you.

1040
00:58:11,158 --> 00:58:12,159
What happened?

1041
00:58:12,242 --> 00:58:13,452
You guys happened.

1042
00:58:13,535 --> 00:58:17,581
I, uh, I figured you guys needed

1043
00:58:17,664 --> 00:58:20,375
a little pick-me-up for tomorrow

1044
00:58:20,459 --> 00:58:23,086
unless you want to do nude
yoga with Tilly and Boris.

1045
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:26,590
No, no. No.
Please. No. Stay.

1046
00:58:26,673 --> 00:58:27,841
What you gonna do?

1047
00:58:27,925 --> 00:58:30,385
I'm gonna rock the house,

1048
00:58:30,469 --> 00:58:34,014
and then you guys are gonna rock those
ass clowns tomorrow.

1049
00:58:34,097 --> 00:58:36,391
Understand?

1050
00:58:36,433 --> 00:58:39,603
Come on, Mo.
We got some rehearsing to do.

1051
00:58:39,686 --> 00:58:43,315
I'm gonna introduce you guys to someone
who's inspired us all,

1052
00:58:43,398 --> 00:58:44,858
my jump-off girl.

1053
00:58:44,942 --> 00:58:46,985
Give it up for Doris.

1054
00:58:52,574 --> 00:58:57,579
This song is dedicated
to my favorite surf team:

1055
00:58:57,663 --> 00:59:00,666
The Laguna Beach Bs.

1056
00:59:00,749 --> 00:59:04,753
Now some of you guys may think
the "B" stands for Barney,

1057
00:59:04,795 --> 00:59:08,215
but I think it stands for...

1058
00:59:08,298 --> 00:59:13,387
brilliant and brave...

1059
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:15,597
and ballsy.

1060
00:59:15,681 --> 00:59:18,183
This one's for my freaks.

1061
00:59:20,143 --> 00:59:24,523
Love is but a song we sing

1062
00:59:24,606 --> 00:59:27,985
Fear's the way we die

1063
00:59:28,026 --> 00:59:32,155
You can make the mountains ring

1064
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:37,661
Or make the angels cry

1065
00:59:37,703 --> 00:59:41,999
Though the bird is on the wing

1066
00:59:42,082 --> 00:59:46,128
And you may not know why

1067
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:47,421
Come on...

1068
00:59:47,504 --> 00:59:48,463
Oh, you really proved your point.

1069
00:59:48,547 --> 00:59:51,967
I mean, you're not gonna win,
but you're here.

1070
00:59:52,009 --> 00:59:54,011
Everybody get together

1071
00:59:54,052 --> 00:59:58,307
Try to love one another right now

1072
00:59:58,390 --> 01:00:02,019
You know, when we get back,
you should hang out with us.

1073
01:00:02,102 --> 01:00:06,023
I mean, you're almost finished
with your charity work here.

1074
01:00:06,064 --> 01:00:08,817
We are but a moment's sunlight

1075
01:00:09,693 --> 01:00:12,446
I mean, you're just new.
We didn't know how cool you were.

1076
01:00:12,529 --> 01:00:16,825
Well, I knew.

1077
01:00:16,867 --> 01:00:19,411
So what do you say we go for a walk
on the beach and talk some more?

1078
01:00:19,494 --> 01:00:23,874
Try to love one another right now

1079
01:00:23,916 --> 01:00:26,877
I don't think so.

1080
01:00:26,919 --> 01:00:31,006
See, um, I'm gonna go hang out
with the other freaks.

1081
01:00:31,089 --> 01:00:33,050
Let's get together

1082
01:00:33,091 --> 01:00:38,305
Try to love one another right now

1083
01:00:38,388 --> 01:00:39,848
Oh, no

1084
01:00:48,106 --> 01:00:49,566
What?

1085
01:00:56,406 --> 01:01:00,202
Doris live in Costa Rica.

1086
01:01:03,205 --> 01:01:06,625
You were amazing...

1087
01:01:06,708 --> 01:01:08,585
actually.

1088
01:01:11,797 --> 01:01:17,594
You know, um, I'm not so amazing.

1089
01:01:17,678 --> 01:01:21,265
You see, even if I hadn't of taken
that vow of silence,

1090
01:01:21,348 --> 01:01:23,559
I don't think I would have given you
the time of day.

1091
01:01:26,895 --> 01:01:30,858
You would have been just another
stupid, shallow jock.

1092
01:01:35,153 --> 01:01:37,614
Wow.

1093
01:01:37,698 --> 01:01:39,908
That's pretty cold.

1094
01:01:39,992 --> 01:01:43,829
And, um, what about now?

1095
01:01:46,999 --> 01:01:53,422
Well, now I realized how stupid
and shallow I was.

1096
01:01:55,632 --> 01:02:00,846
I realized that the day that you came
and talked to me at the beach.

1097
01:02:00,929 --> 01:02:05,058
You cared,

1098
01:02:05,142 --> 01:02:08,437
and I was... I was wrong about you.

1099
01:02:11,815 --> 01:02:15,819
You know, I, uh, I respect a woman

1100
01:02:15,903 --> 01:02:19,990
who can admit her mistakes,

1101
01:02:20,073 --> 01:02:21,867
especially when she looks like you.

1102
01:02:24,494 --> 01:02:26,371
Did I say that you weren't shallow?

1103
01:02:26,455 --> 01:02:28,832
No.

1104
01:02:28,916 --> 01:02:32,503
No. No. I think... I think you said

1105
01:02:32,586 --> 01:02:36,548
you're glad you've become wise enough
to give me the time of day.

1106
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:42,095
And, um,

1107
01:02:42,179 --> 01:02:44,806
guess what time it is?

1108
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:47,226
Um...

1109
01:02:47,309 --> 01:02:48,977
what time is it?

1110
01:03:15,546 --> 01:03:18,841
Where are you taking me?

1111
01:03:18,924 --> 01:03:22,219
Where every man in this bar
dreams of going.

1112
01:03:22,302 --> 01:03:23,720
There's no use fighting.

1113
01:03:23,762 --> 01:03:26,223
You are ours tonight!

1114
01:03:36,942 --> 01:03:39,278
No more. I can't.

1115
01:03:39,361 --> 01:03:40,696
Really, I can't.

1116
01:03:40,737 --> 01:03:43,115
- You can.
- You will!

1117
01:03:43,198 --> 01:03:45,868
Yeah. Lucky bastard.

1118
01:03:45,909 --> 01:03:47,619
Come on.

1119
01:03:47,703 --> 01:03:49,204
Really, I can't.

1120
01:03:49,288 --> 01:03:50,289
You must!

1121
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:58,130
Oh, my God.

1122
01:04:02,467 --> 01:04:05,053
This has been very hard on her.

1123
01:04:05,137 --> 01:04:08,473
She's a hot chimp.
She'll find someone else, right?

1124
01:04:08,557 --> 01:04:11,435
That Larry's a big pimp.

1125
01:04:11,518 --> 01:04:16,481
You know, Larry, becoming a man
has nothing to do with down there.

1126
01:04:16,565 --> 01:04:18,233
It doesn't?

1127
01:04:18,275 --> 01:04:21,570
No. If that was what we needed most,

1128
01:04:21,653 --> 01:04:25,657
we could take care of that ourselves.

1129
01:04:25,741 --> 01:04:30,329
Oh. I think Taz has that model.

1130
01:04:30,412 --> 01:04:35,083
No. See, most American men
don't know what a man is.

1131
01:04:35,167 --> 01:04:40,088
The kind of man we want is here.

1132
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:41,757
You are Eagle Scout, {y:i}ja?

1133
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,050
{y:i}Ja.

1134
01:04:43,133 --> 01:04:45,928
You score 1,600 on your S.A.T., {y:i}ja?

1135
01:04:45,969 --> 01:04:47,763
{y:i}Ja.

1136
01:04:47,804 --> 01:04:50,057
Even {y:i}Home Economic teen of year, {y:i}ja?

1137
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:52,351
{y:i}Ja.

1138
01:04:52,434 --> 01:04:56,021
This is great man.

1139
01:04:56,104 --> 01:04:59,066
I want you to go in there winners today,

1140
01:04:59,149 --> 01:05:03,111
boards high, shorts low, big love!

1141
01:05:03,153 --> 01:05:04,571
Hope I'm not overdressed.

1142
01:05:06,448 --> 01:05:08,200
I could change.

1143
01:05:08,283 --> 01:05:11,078
I feel like my IQ has dropped
100 points in this thing.

1144
01:05:11,161 --> 01:05:12,996
Your IQ looks amazing in this.

1145
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:15,624
I thought you guys needed at least
one groupie.

1146
01:05:15,707 --> 01:05:17,584
So you're the one.

1147
01:05:19,378 --> 01:05:21,839
{y:i}Hola, beautiful people,

1148
01:05:21,922 --> 01:05:25,175
and welcome to the second
and final day of competition

1149
01:05:25,259 --> 01:05:28,512
here at the International High School
Surfing Championships.

1150
01:05:28,595 --> 01:05:32,516
Whoa. Doris.

1151
01:05:34,601 --> 01:05:36,061
That can't be her.

1152
01:05:36,144 --> 01:05:38,313
Oh, that's her, honey.

1153
01:05:41,191 --> 01:05:44,027
Hi. I love you.

1154
01:05:44,111 --> 01:05:46,321
Hey, Rip.
Remember us?

1155
01:05:46,363 --> 01:05:48,991
No. Go away.

1156
01:05:49,074 --> 01:05:52,202
I think I'll give you guys some space.

1157
01:05:52,286 --> 01:05:54,621
Will Laguna A be able to hold on,

1158
01:05:54,705 --> 01:05:59,418
or is an upset brewing in the chunky soup
of the Pacific Ocean?

1159
01:05:59,501 --> 01:06:02,087
There's only one way to tell,
so ladies and gentlemen,

1160
01:06:02,171 --> 01:06:04,339
are you ready to shred?

1161
01:06:04,423 --> 01:06:06,758
That's right!

1162
01:06:09,136 --> 01:06:13,098
You know what would
make me so happy?

1163
01:06:13,182 --> 01:06:16,059
If you thought about me
while you were out there.

1164
01:06:16,143 --> 01:06:18,854
Whoa.

1165
01:06:18,896 --> 01:06:21,064
- Okay, Roach?
- Doris.

1166
01:06:24,359 --> 01:06:27,529
Whoa.

1167
01:06:27,613 --> 01:06:29,781
Oh, ho!
I got hit by a wave like that once,

1168
01:06:29,865 --> 01:06:31,491
except its name was Frank.

1169
01:06:31,575 --> 01:06:35,913
Whoa. That is a wipe out
for Laguna A's Roach.

1170
01:06:35,996 --> 01:06:37,706
And how are you?

1171
01:06:42,711 --> 01:06:44,546
Yeah! Taz!

1172
01:06:44,588 --> 01:06:47,841
Whoa! It's the little,
sexy Oompa-Loompa.

1173
01:06:47,925 --> 01:06:52,679
It's the 360.
Perfecto!

1174
01:06:52,763 --> 01:06:57,434
Laguna B is really being beautiful
out there today.

1175
01:06:57,518 --> 01:06:58,560
Bring it home to mama!

1176
01:06:58,602 --> 01:07:00,437
It's Taz time, baby!

1177
01:07:00,521 --> 01:07:03,649
Big wave!
Big wave!

1178
01:07:03,732 --> 01:07:06,735
And the Laguna A's Stoop is up.

1179
01:07:06,818 --> 01:07:10,155
- You are my warrior.
- I don't like this guy.

1180
01:07:10,239 --> 01:07:11,240
I don't like that guy.

1181
01:07:11,281 --> 01:07:15,619
He is up, and he is also down!

1182
01:07:15,702 --> 01:07:17,412
And look at what we have here.

1183
01:07:17,454 --> 01:07:19,456
It's Jordan Sullivan!

1184
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:22,084
It's the new Jordan!
Oh, my Lord!

1185
01:07:22,125 --> 01:07:24,878
Look at him!
So handsome!

1186
01:07:24,962 --> 01:07:27,005
Oh, he's moving so nice,
and lookie...

1187
01:07:27,089 --> 01:07:31,468
Oh, shweet, shweet...

1188
01:07:31,552 --> 01:07:33,971
sh-sh-shweet.

1189
01:07:34,054 --> 01:07:36,431
Laguna B's Jordan Sullivan

1190
01:07:36,473 --> 01:07:39,518
plays that powder for big,
beautiful points!

1191
01:07:39,601 --> 01:07:40,978
Look at him go!

1192
01:07:41,061 --> 01:07:43,730
I could cry it's so beautiful!

1193
01:07:43,814 --> 01:07:46,859
I am crying.

1194
01:07:46,942 --> 01:07:49,611
But for the rest of the competition,

1195
01:07:49,695 --> 01:07:51,697
it is wipe-out city today.

1196
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:54,157
Yes. They all fall down.

1197
01:07:54,199 --> 01:07:56,994
Only Laguna B is looking very beautiful.

1198
01:07:57,077 --> 01:07:58,996
What a beautiful comeback.

1199
01:07:59,079 --> 01:08:02,624
I suck at this.

1200
01:08:02,666 --> 01:08:04,001
You need to find a sub for me.

1201
01:08:04,084 --> 01:08:06,044
Now wait a minute, man.

1202
01:08:06,128 --> 01:08:08,422
Nobody gets subbed out
unless they're hurt, Mo.

1203
01:08:08,505 --> 01:08:11,383
Jordan, if I go back out there,
we're gonna lose.

1204
01:08:11,466 --> 01:08:14,970
Well, we need
somebody to surf, right?

1205
01:08:15,012 --> 01:08:17,931
Wait, wait, wait!

1206
01:08:18,015 --> 01:08:20,851
I shred. I shred!

1207
01:08:20,934 --> 01:08:23,061
Chika, baby, how'd you get here?

1208
01:08:23,145 --> 01:08:27,149
I come to help.
I shred. I shred!

1209
01:08:27,232 --> 01:08:28,275
Mo, we don't have
time for this, man.

1210
01:08:31,111 --> 01:08:34,031
Okay. Okay.
I got it, dudes.

1211
01:08:37,576 --> 01:08:40,245
You... got...

1212
01:08:42,247 --> 01:08:45,334
a baby... turtle...

1213
01:08:46,752 --> 01:08:50,964
in your underpants?

1214
01:08:51,048 --> 01:08:54,593
You speak Japanese?

1215
01:08:54,676 --> 01:08:57,054
No, man.

1216
01:08:57,095 --> 01:09:04,019
I, um, best chick surfer Japan.

1217
01:09:04,102 --> 01:09:07,189
Oh, okay.

1218
01:09:07,272 --> 01:09:14,530
"I best chick surfer Japan," man.

1219
01:09:14,571 --> 01:09:18,116
Yeah, I got that.

1220
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:19,326
So you're telling us you surf?

1221
01:09:19,409 --> 01:09:20,869
Wait a minute.
You really shred?

1222
01:09:20,953 --> 01:09:23,580
I really shred!

1223
01:09:23,664 --> 01:09:26,083
Well, let's get her in there then.

1224
01:09:26,166 --> 01:09:27,793
Yeah, man.

1225
01:09:30,879 --> 01:09:33,257
Damn, baby!
You been holding out on us.

1226
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:34,967
Hold this, player.

1227
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:37,636
Give me your shirt.

1228
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:40,931
What a joke.

1229
01:09:41,014 --> 01:09:44,017
Yeah. Now that's some tasty sushi.

1230
01:09:44,101 --> 01:09:47,104
Fresh... ahi.

1231
01:09:47,187 --> 01:09:50,315
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a very
important announcement, okay?

1232
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:52,401
All right.

1233
01:09:52,484 --> 01:09:53,569
Let's go, Chika!

1234
01:09:53,652 --> 01:09:56,446
Mr. Mo Peterson from Laguna B

1235
01:09:56,530 --> 01:09:59,741
has seemed to have suffered
a terrible groin pull.

1236
01:09:59,783 --> 01:10:02,411
Oh, my poor chocolate babies.

1237
01:10:02,452 --> 01:10:04,997
I have to go over there
later and fix it for him.

1238
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:08,125
But it says here that Mr. Mo Peterson

1239
01:10:08,208 --> 01:10:14,965
shall be replaced by a very beautiful
Asian baby Chika Mastsumoto.

1240
01:10:15,048 --> 01:10:16,425
I love Asian people, you know?

1241
01:10:16,466 --> 01:10:18,844
I find them really beautiful.

1242
01:10:18,927 --> 01:10:22,681
I remember my first summer in Bangkok,
oh, with Mr. Quan,

1243
01:10:22,764 --> 01:10:25,142
but, you know, this is not
the time, this is not the place,

1244
01:10:25,184 --> 01:10:26,894
this is not the outfit.

1245
01:10:26,977 --> 01:10:30,022
Whoa, man.
She can shled, man.

1246
01:10:30,105 --> 01:10:32,232
She can really, really shled.

1247
01:10:32,316 --> 01:10:34,276
Look at the way
she cut through that water.

1248
01:10:34,359 --> 01:10:37,029
It's like Godzilla is chasing her.

1249
01:10:37,112 --> 01:10:39,656
Do you have a prom date?

1250
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:42,826
Whoa. Prom?

1251
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:47,915
Laguna B's Chika is making chop suey
out of the competition.

1252
01:10:47,998 --> 01:10:50,792
Let's go, man.
We need this.

1253
01:10:50,834 --> 01:10:53,629
Oh, color me crazy,
but I think we have

1254
01:10:53,670 --> 01:10:57,424
a very beautiful contest
on our hands here today.

1255
01:11:03,847 --> 01:11:05,849
Prom.

1256
01:11:09,645 --> 01:11:13,106
Doris.

1257
01:11:13,190 --> 01:11:15,651
Well, amigos, it comes down
to our final set

1258
01:11:15,734 --> 01:11:18,153
to determine our new champions.

1259
01:11:18,195 --> 01:11:22,282
Can Laguna A's hunky captain
Tyler Masters hold on?

1260
01:11:22,366 --> 01:11:24,159
And for our underdogs Laguna B,

1261
01:11:24,243 --> 01:11:29,289
their beautiful leader Jordan Sullivan
is looking for the ride of his life.

1262
01:11:32,334 --> 01:11:34,378
It's all on you, East Coast.

1263
01:11:34,461 --> 01:11:36,672
Yeah. Kick some ass out there, man.

1264
01:11:39,550 --> 01:11:42,135
Excuse me.
I believe I'm still on the roster.

1265
01:11:42,219 --> 01:11:43,178
Larry?

1266
01:11:43,262 --> 01:11:45,097
I'm ready to rip.

1267
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:46,682
What y'all put up in my boy?

1268
01:11:46,765 --> 01:11:49,560
Nothing that wasn't already there.

1269
01:11:49,643 --> 01:11:51,520
Listen, guys.

1270
01:11:51,562 --> 01:11:54,940
I was everybody's whipping boy
for the last 17 years,

1271
01:11:55,023 --> 01:11:57,693
but, see, all along,
I've been the man.

1272
01:11:57,734 --> 01:12:00,904
Straight A's since first
grade, an Eagle Scout,

1273
01:12:00,988 --> 01:12:03,448
1,600 on my S.A.T. S,

1274
01:12:03,532 --> 01:12:06,702
the {y:i}Home Economics
teen of the year,

1275
01:12:06,785 --> 01:12:09,538
and still it took me 17 years

1276
01:12:09,621 --> 01:12:12,916
for me to finally accept
that I am the man.

1277
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,126
{y:i}Ja. He is.

1278
01:12:14,209 --> 01:12:16,378
So welcome to my coming out party.

1279
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:18,213
Surfs up, brahs.

1280
01:12:22,176 --> 01:12:23,969
You're the man, Larry.

1281
01:12:24,052 --> 01:12:25,179
Thanks, Jordan.

1282
01:12:25,262 --> 01:12:26,555
Ladies and gentlemen,

1283
01:12:26,638 --> 01:12:29,099
we have a very surprising substitution.

1284
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:32,311
It's so over.

1285
01:12:32,394 --> 01:12:34,313
Complete annihilation.

1286
01:12:34,396 --> 01:12:37,232
Don't worry about it.

1287
01:12:37,274 --> 01:12:40,152
Larry, I know that you are man!

1288
01:12:40,235 --> 01:12:44,448
Go. Inhale. Inhale.

1289
01:12:44,531 --> 01:12:46,867
Concentrate, Larry.

1290
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:49,786
You're so history, virgin Larry.

1291
01:12:49,870 --> 01:12:53,081
Having a little sushi party
at my house tonight.

1292
01:12:53,123 --> 01:12:54,499
You girls in, huh?

1293
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:56,210
A little mahi-mahi?

1294
01:12:56,293 --> 01:12:58,128
You know, Tyler, if I'm correct,

1295
01:12:58,212 --> 01:13:01,131
the only "A" you've ever gotten
in your entire academic life

1296
01:13:01,215 --> 01:13:02,966
was in ninth grade American literature.

1297
01:13:04,051 --> 01:13:06,512
So?
Like that matters here.

1298
01:13:06,595 --> 01:13:08,680
It means that the only reason
you got that "A"

1299
01:13:08,764 --> 01:13:12,184
was because you forced me to do
your term paper on James Fenimore Cooper.

1300
01:13:12,267 --> 01:13:15,187
- Who?
- Right.

1301
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:17,648
But most of all, it means that in the past,

1302
01:13:17,731 --> 01:13:21,276
your greatest success was totally
dependent on me providing it for you.

1303
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:23,612
See, whether you realize it or not,

1304
01:13:23,695 --> 01:13:25,822
that dependence is embedded
in your psyche.

1305
01:13:26,198 --> 01:13:29,243
What's he doing?

1306
01:13:29,326 --> 01:13:31,411
He's playing with his mind.

1307
01:13:31,495 --> 01:13:33,622
Deep down, you know
you're not worthy.

1308
01:13:33,664 --> 01:13:36,291
Underneath that cool surfer exterior,

1309
01:13:36,333 --> 01:13:39,086
you know the ego-deflating truth.

1310
01:13:39,169 --> 01:13:41,129
You can't compete with me.

1311
01:13:41,213 --> 01:13:44,550
You never could on land or at sea.

1312
01:13:44,633 --> 01:13:46,718
You see, Tyler, you're a complete idiot,

1313
01:13:46,802 --> 01:13:48,470
and it's payback time,

1314
01:13:48,554 --> 01:13:50,806
and payback is hell.

1315
01:13:52,558 --> 01:13:55,143
Please. After you.

1316
01:14:04,069 --> 01:14:05,654
Larry, concentrate.

1317
01:14:05,737 --> 01:14:08,198
Larry, don't get psyched out.

1318
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:10,742
And Masters takes the first wave.

1319
01:14:10,826 --> 01:14:12,828
I don't like that guy.

1320
01:14:12,870 --> 01:14:16,164
That guy has eyebrows of Russian.

1321
01:14:16,248 --> 01:14:18,542
You little fat bulldog-pig.

1322
01:14:18,625 --> 01:14:20,544
What's he doing?

1323
01:14:22,546 --> 01:14:26,258
Whoa! Masters plays it
very safe on that one.

1324
01:14:26,341 --> 01:14:28,844
Not very beautiful at all.

1325
01:14:28,886 --> 01:14:31,054
I don't think that will impress
the judges too much at all,

1326
01:14:31,138 --> 01:14:33,223
even this one, a complete idiot.

1327
01:14:33,307 --> 01:14:35,976
You call that surfing, Tyler?

1328
01:14:36,059 --> 01:14:41,190
Maybe for dessert, we can play a little
snap the sponge cake, hmm?

1329
01:14:41,231 --> 01:14:43,859
Snap the sponge cake, girls?

1330
01:14:43,901 --> 01:14:48,280
So now it's all up to Laguna B's
Lawrence Horatio Bates,

1331
01:14:48,363 --> 01:14:51,617
who appears to be
meditating or something.

1332
01:14:53,952 --> 01:14:56,580
We're not gonna have sex, are we?

1333
01:14:56,663 --> 01:14:59,750
You are a man without sex.

1334
01:14:59,833 --> 01:15:05,380
But we will do what you want.

1335
01:15:05,464 --> 01:15:09,927
I want...

1336
01:15:10,010 --> 01:15:12,429
a rematch at Twister.

1337
01:15:15,849 --> 01:15:17,809
And Lawrence Horatio Bates is off.

1338
01:15:17,893 --> 01:15:19,520
Oh, my God!

1339
01:15:19,603 --> 01:15:22,981
He is amazing!
Beautiful!

1340
01:15:23,065 --> 01:15:24,191
Larry, concentrate.

1341
01:15:25,275 --> 01:15:29,238
Yeah! Ride 'em, Larry!
Yeah!

1342
01:15:31,698 --> 01:15:33,909
- Yeah!
- Go!

1343
01:15:37,037 --> 01:15:39,831
That's right.

1344
01:15:39,915 --> 01:15:41,542
- Awesome.
- What?

1345
01:15:41,625 --> 01:15:43,460
Larry shreds?

1346
01:15:43,544 --> 01:15:46,088
Yes! Larry shreds!

1347
01:15:46,171 --> 01:15:48,257
It is a miracle.

1348
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:50,384
He rides this wave
like the king of the sea.

1349
01:15:50,467 --> 01:15:52,302
Shweet!

1350
01:15:52,386 --> 01:15:54,429
I'm so crazy over this. Okay.

1351
01:15:54,513 --> 01:15:56,682
Big wave!

1352
01:15:56,765 --> 01:15:58,642
The judges, who are so pretty,

1353
01:15:58,725 --> 01:16:00,477
have tallied the final scores,

1354
01:16:00,561 --> 01:16:01,895
so here we go.

1355
01:16:01,979 --> 01:16:04,231
I'll tell you the winner.

1356
01:16:04,314 --> 01:16:05,774
I'm so nervous,
I'm so nervous.

1357
01:16:05,816 --> 01:16:08,610
I can't do it.

1358
01:16:08,652 --> 01:16:14,241
And the new 2005 International
High School Surfing Champion

1359
01:16:14,324 --> 01:16:17,619
is none other than everybody's
favorite underdogs

1360
01:16:17,661 --> 01:16:19,413
Laguna B, baby!

1361
01:16:24,084 --> 01:16:26,170
I'm so proud of you, boychik.

1362
01:16:26,253 --> 01:16:27,671
I'm proud.

1363
01:16:27,754 --> 01:16:31,008
That's right!
Beautiful!

1364
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:35,429
Nice ride.

1365
01:16:35,512 --> 01:16:37,306
Thanks.

1366
01:16:48,984 --> 01:16:50,527
Shweet!

1367
01:16:50,611 --> 01:16:52,946
Nice work, man.

1368
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:55,365
Oh, I knew you were
the one that liked me.

1369
01:16:55,407 --> 01:16:58,035
I thought it was you.
Let's go steady.

1370
01:16:59,995 --> 01:17:02,206
So what's up, Larry?
Where are we going tonight, you know?

1371
01:17:02,289 --> 01:17:03,999
Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa, Tazzie.

1372
01:17:04,041 --> 01:17:06,543
This is my shizzle.

1373
01:17:06,585 --> 01:17:08,879
Yeah. That's cool.
Bye.

1374
01:17:15,928 --> 01:17:17,971
Someone deserves a kiss!

1375
01:17:22,351 --> 01:17:24,853
Your brother sucks ass.

1376
01:17:32,027 --> 01:17:33,695
It's Taz time, baby.

1377
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:59,972
Another game of Twister?

1378
01:18:00,055 --> 01:18:02,724
No, Lawrence.
We'll make love to you.

1379
01:18:02,808 --> 01:18:05,102
All day.

1380
01:18:05,185 --> 01:18:07,479
All night.

1381
01:18:07,563 --> 01:18:09,731
You will be a great man in bed, {y:i}ja?

1382
01:18:09,773 --> 01:18:13,694
{y:i}Ja.

1383
01:18:13,777 --> 01:18:16,321
From virgin to god.

1384
01:18:16,405 --> 01:18:18,907
You know, Jordan, I think this trip
has been really good for me.

1385
01:18:18,991 --> 01:18:20,659
I don't need my Ritalin anymore.

1386
01:18:20,742 --> 01:18:22,286
I feel...
I don't know...

1387
01:18:22,369 --> 01:18:23,704
I feel like a...
like a new man.

1388
01:18:29,668 --> 01:18:31,295
Ghost Babe.

1389
01:18:31,378 --> 01:18:33,589
I told you.

1390
01:18:34,798 --> 01:18:37,301
She appears before champions

1391
01:18:37,384 --> 01:18:39,136
and then leads them to ruin, brah.

1392
01:18:39,219 --> 01:18:41,263
You're lucky I warned you.

1393
01:18:41,346 --> 01:18:44,725
So it actually seemed like you were shagging
on the hammock 24/7

1394
01:18:44,808 --> 01:18:47,227
for a decade, though, right?

1395
01:18:51,982 --> 01:18:55,694
Yeah. That's what it seemed like.

1396
01:18:55,777 --> 01:18:57,779
I'll see you guys in 2015!

1397
01:18:57,821 --> 01:18:59,948
No!

1398
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:01,783
No, little shredder!

1399
01:19:01,867 --> 01:19:04,244
No!

1400
01:19:04,328 --> 01:19:06,663
You're gonna get poltergeist cock!

1401
01:19:20,677 --> 01:19:24,306
I'm gonna miss that horny little devil.

1402
01:19:24,348 --> 01:19:25,974
You got a moment, brah?

1403
01:19:26,016 --> 01:19:27,768
Oh, yeah.

1404
01:19:27,851 --> 01:19:29,520
I'll meet you by the tent.

1405
01:19:29,603 --> 01:19:31,522
Okay.

1406
01:19:37,653 --> 01:19:39,863
I'm gonna follow that a...

1407
01:19:39,947 --> 01:19:41,698
your girlfriend.

1408
01:19:41,782 --> 01:19:42,741
I'll be over here, man.

1409
01:19:42,824 --> 01:19:44,326
All right, man.

1410
01:19:46,036 --> 01:19:49,414
Uh, listen, brah.

1411
01:19:49,498 --> 01:19:52,709
There's a...
there's an old saying

1412
01:19:52,793 --> 01:19:57,381
us... us surfers use
when somebody helps

1413
01:19:57,464 --> 01:19:59,508
pull you out of rough water.

1414
01:19:59,591 --> 01:20:07,015
It's, uh, oma kamawa imiwawa sema.

1415
01:20:07,057 --> 01:20:08,183
Wow. That's...

1416
01:20:08,225 --> 01:20:10,978
Ah woka miaaa sum kai

1417
01:20:11,061 --> 01:20:14,565
sema wa ya da.

1418
01:20:14,648 --> 01:20:17,693
Thanks. L...

1419
01:20:17,734 --> 01:20:20,696
Ya oh mamai smuma maia.

1420
01:20:20,737 --> 01:20:26,618
Oh ai ah neskwa.

1421
01:20:26,702 --> 01:20:28,912
Uh, what does that mean?

1422
01:20:30,873 --> 01:20:36,378
It means, uh, thanks, brah.

1423
01:20:38,088 --> 01:20:39,506
Big wave.

1424
01:20:46,263 --> 01:20:49,057
I got to go.

1425
01:20:49,099 --> 01:20:51,018
- Ghost Babe!
- Rip!

1426
01:20:56,231 --> 01:20:57,316
Thank you for helping me.

1427
01:20:57,399 --> 01:20:59,818
Oh. My pleasure, baby.

1428
01:20:59,902 --> 01:21:01,904
Thank you for helping them.

1429
01:21:01,987 --> 01:21:04,448
Boychik,

1430
01:21:04,489 --> 01:21:08,285
I want you to know
that you are so loved in my heart,

1431
01:21:08,368 --> 01:21:10,913
and you will always
be great man, always.

1432
01:21:10,954 --> 01:21:12,372
Thank you, Boris.

1433
01:21:12,456 --> 01:21:15,918
By any means necessary,
my brother.

1434
01:21:16,001 --> 01:21:18,378
{y:i}Sayonara, sweetie.

1435
01:21:18,462 --> 01:21:21,006
Right back at you.

1436
01:21:21,089 --> 01:21:23,342
My sweet jock,

1437
01:21:23,425 --> 01:21:25,469
thank you for coming.

1438
01:21:25,552 --> 01:21:27,554
Thank you for making this happen.

1439
01:21:27,638 --> 01:21:33,185
Thank you all for restoring our faith
in America's youth.

1440
01:21:33,268 --> 01:21:36,897
You all have the spirit of
the Sixties living in you,

1441
01:21:36,980 --> 01:21:39,566
even if you didn't want
to blow anything up.

1442
01:21:39,650 --> 01:21:40,984
You stood up to the man.

1443
01:21:41,068 --> 01:21:42,986
You made the world a better place.

1444
01:21:43,070 --> 01:21:46,240
- We are so proud of you.
- Yeah.

1445
01:21:46,323 --> 01:21:48,617
So please, you come back

1446
01:21:48,659 --> 01:21:50,202
and you see us real soon,
you hear me?

1447
01:21:50,285 --> 01:21:52,120
You come visit us, too.

1448
01:21:52,162 --> 01:21:54,122
That will not be possible.

1449
01:21:54,164 --> 01:21:57,292
We were a little more destructive
than you kids.

1450
01:21:57,334 --> 01:21:58,335
Yeah.

1451
01:21:58,377 --> 01:22:00,629
We possibly have
a few outstanding warrants

1452
01:22:00,712 --> 01:22:02,172
waiting for us, stuff like that.

1453
01:22:02,256 --> 01:22:03,382
Big time.

1454
01:22:03,465 --> 01:22:04,758
Well, our lips are sealed.

1455
01:22:04,842 --> 01:22:06,927
Zip. Bing.

1456
01:22:26,697 --> 01:22:30,784
So after this, we get to shag
on the hammock 24/7, right?

1457
01:22:33,287 --> 01:22:35,038
Cool.

1458
01:22:35,122 --> 01:22:37,165
Knock yourself out, shorty.

1459
01:22:41,336 --> 01:22:44,840
Ghost Babe.
Come back.

1460
01:22:48,177 --> 01:22:50,345
Come on, people, now

1461
01:22:50,387 --> 01:22:52,014
Smile on your brother

1462
01:22:52,097 --> 01:22:54,641
Everybody get together

1463
01:22:54,725 --> 01:23:00,898
Try to love one another right...

1464
01:23:02,691 --> 01:23:04,526
Come on, people, now

1465
01:23:04,610 --> 01:23:06,278
Smile on your brother

1466
01:23:06,361 --> 01:23:08,447
Everybody get together

1467
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:12,492
Try to love
one another right now

1468
01:23:12,576 --> 01:23:14,620
Oh, no

1469
01:23:14,703 --> 01:23:16,788
Oh, {y:i}ja.

1470
01:23:16,872 --> 01:23:18,415
And I say...

1471
01:23:18,498 --> 01:23:20,417
Come on, people, now

1472
01:23:20,459 --> 01:23:22,419
Smile on your brother

1473
01:23:22,503 --> 01:23:25,923
Everybody get together

1474
01:23:25,964 --> 01:23:32,012
Try to love
one another right now, baby

1475
01:23:32,095 --> 01:23:34,765
What the hell is going on?

1476
01:23:34,848 --> 01:23:37,100
Come on, people, now

1477
01:23:37,184 --> 01:23:38,727
Smile on your brother

1478
01:23:38,810 --> 01:23:41,271
Everybody get together

1479
01:23:41,313 --> 01:23:47,402
Try to love
one another right now

1480
01:23:47,444 --> 01:23:49,738
Mark.

1481
01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:52,699
I'd just macked my first curly fry
with a waffle cone,

1482
01:23:52,783 --> 01:23:54,910
twisted around
with a double-header,

1483
01:23:54,993 --> 01:23:56,703
a double-bubble, a mack cake,

1484
01:23:56,787 --> 01:23:59,206
and a 3-pound thunder blaster

1485
01:23:59,289 --> 01:24:01,416
and clinched my first world title.

1486
01:24:05,254 --> 01:24:09,424
Little hedgehog, mahi-mahi right here
on the beach.

1487
01:24:09,466 --> 01:24:12,553
How about you there,
sea urchin, mahi-mahi, hairdo?

1488
01:24:12,636 --> 01:24:15,597
You like fresh fish?

1489
01:24:15,639 --> 01:24:19,184
I form it real sweet like
with my own hands.

1490
01:24:22,354 --> 01:24:24,648
Hold it.

1491
01:24:24,731 --> 01:24:26,900
A little something-something.

1492
01:24:26,984 --> 01:24:30,737
You want to get it?
You want to get some?

1493
01:24:33,866 --> 01:24:35,826
Damn it! I'm sorry.

1494
01:24:35,909 --> 01:24:38,620
Marker.

1495
01:24:38,704 --> 01:24:41,582
That's it.

1496
01:24:41,665 --> 01:24:45,294
Who's my champion?
Who's my champion? Who?

1497
01:25:02,436 --> 01:25:04,980
You guys, it's not a porno.

1498
01:25:05,063 --> 01:25:08,150
You liked it, eh?
