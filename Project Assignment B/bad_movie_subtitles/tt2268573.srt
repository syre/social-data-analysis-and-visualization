00:17:18,647 --> 00:17:22,284
I I've never seen anything like. Kind of shaped cell structure
old, </ i>

159
00:17:22,285 --> 00:17:24,225
I being reproduced in an incredible pace. </ I>

160
00:17:24,226 --> 00:17:25,551
What?

161
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:29,907
I have a sample there. Running tests,
see what you find.

162
00:18:25,993 --> 00:18:30,578
Here ARK monthly basis, Colonel
Brauchman, to base. Answer!

163
00:18:30,763 --> 00:18:34,154
Madsen? Are you there?
You hear me?

164
00:18:35,117 --> 00:18:40,405
Madsen, if you can hear me, I closed
whole mining operations.

165
00:18:40,406 --> 00:18:43,237
I currently used only for emergency lights. </ I>

166
00:18:43,238 --> 00:18:46,197
I Confirms please
receipt for the escape pod. </ I>

167
00:18:50,103 --> 00:18:56,353
Here  U.S. monthly basis ARK Colonel
Brauchman, to base. Answer!

168
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,989
A was passed through three different tests,
all with identical results.

169
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:16,187
Waxed
meteor can reproduce without carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen.

170
00:19:16,193 --> 00:19:18,136
Looks like a
triggers exposure to light.

171
00:19:18,137 --> 00:19:23,424
Yo, bro, if you tell them what it is,
I just entered a science fiction film.

172
00:19:23,441 --> 00:19:26,233
I can multiply and produce
nutrients by themselves. </ I>

173
00:19:26,441 --> 00:19:29,213
- As bacteria?
- Just that much intelligence.

174
00:19:29,241 --> 00:19:33,490
Spores are dormant codes, but nobody knows how show
multiply.

175
00:19:33,769 --> 00:19:36,849
Might turn total,
change, develop...

176
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,453
Developed what?

177
00:19:39,071 --> 00:19:42,522
Who knows? But the growth rate
is absolutely extraordinary.

178
00:19:42,523 --> 00:19:45,911
a hundred times faster
like any cell in the human body.

179
00:19:48,752 --> 00:19:50,126
Are you okay?

180
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,114
Yes.

181
00:19:54,089 --> 00:19:58,633
I feel a bit of nausea.
I'm going to lie down.

182
00:19:58,935 --> 00:20:00,440
Good.

183
00:21:06,851 --> 00:21:09,853
Easy... Take it easy.

184
00:21:17,258 --> 00:21:18,458
Where am I?

185
00:21:22,944 --> 00:21:24,617
The infirmary.

186
00:21:25,579 --> 00:21:29,342
Why you're all here?
What happened?

187
00:21:35,858 --> 00:21:38,598
- No, It's okay...
- What do I do?

188
00:21:38,606 --> 00:21:41,059
- Relax, Ava...
- What is happening?

189
00:21:41,173 --> 00:21:43,586
- Jesus...!
- Cover it!

190
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:46,135
Come Johns.
Now the hall.

191
00:21:46,154 --> 00:21:47,692
Need to breathe...

192
00:21:49,296 --> 00:21:52,207
Look at me, right?
Listen...

193
00:21:52,368 --> 00:21:57,371
You gotta breathe, breathe...
Slowly but calm down, okay?

194
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:03,498
I'm here.
Ava, you listen to me now, right?

195
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:06,534
A and A. ..

196
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:11,292
You
what appears to be an extremely accelerated.

197
00:22:11,704 --> 00:22:13,377
So, Ava...

198
00:22:13,843 --> 00:22:18,050
I can not explain. Simply
can not be that fast.

199
00:22:19,451 --> 00:22:22,168
- You can not.
- Good...

200
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,419
I argue that on the </ i>

201
00:22:28,655 --> 00:22:29,918
What...?

202
00:22:30,606 --> 00:22:35,338
Gerard
just more cautious than normal. Yes...?

203
00:22:36,114 --> 00:22:38,843
I have to give the country and nationality
end, I promise.

204
00:22:39,273 --> 00:22:41,864
Do not worry.
You need to rest.

205
00:22:44,576 --> 00:22:46,086
Good...?

206
00:22:47,221 --> 00:22:49,864
- I have to go now.
- Do not go.

207
00:22:49,987 --> 00:22:53,833
Right back.
You're safe here. It's okay.

208
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:07,944
Wants to close.

209
00:23:08,469 --> 00:23:11,653
Lance, should be quarantined.
I have to side at this stage THII.

210
00:23:11,668 --> 00:23:13,302
The form
accelerated growth.

211
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:15,915
Without functional equipment,
I can not diagnose correctly.

212
00:23:16,052 --> 00:23:18,319
- You guys have done that...?
- Oh, come on, man...

213
00:23:18,335 --> 00:23:21,230
Six months pregnant in 24 hours, you let me?

214
00:23:21,245 --> 00:23:24,644
Has a reaction to chemical exposure.
Must have access to treat.

215
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:27,778
Goes to isolation.
Do not risk safety stations.

216
00:23:27,796 --> 00:23:31,364
You can not close, dom 'colonel.
Requires constant medical supervision.

217
00:23:31,388 --> 00:23:36,523
E infection, according to the protocol enters
48 hours in isolation under surveillance.

218
00:23:36,692 --> 00:23:37,997
What if he dies there?

219
00:23:40,383 --> 00:23:45,362
You will have access surveillance.
But that hatch remains closed.

220
00:24:46,153 --> 00:24:48,112
I Access denied. </ I>

221
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:54,210
Colonel protocol is unacceptable.
Must have access to Ava 24/7.

222
00:24:55,433 --> 00:24:57,383
Colonel, can you hear me?

223
00:24:58,428 --> 00:25:01,779
'm Just worried for Cameron as you.

224
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:05,095
But as commander,
are bound by regulation.

225
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:09,416
Remain in isolation.
You will have access to it when needed, just give me the news story.

226
00:25:09,442 --> 00:25:11,106
Well how about now?

227
00:25:21,141 --> 00:25:23,778
Well not a doctor, but according
and they have your

228
00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:28,071
is already in the last quarter, when the child
organs are almost fully developed?

229
00:25:28,494 --> 00:25:30,234
How to be?

230
00:25:30,983 --> 00:25:34,807
Rational diagnosis is that it would be a kind of cyst.

231
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:39,284
But even so, an accelerated cancer
imitating pregnancy is exaggerated.

232
00:25:39,845 --> 00:25:43,029
But if spores that have infected her
in any way?

233
00:25:44,738 --> 00:25:46,678
When we were in shit
up to his neck.

234
00:26:52,418 --> 00:26:53,663
Ava!

235
00:27:06,013 --> 00:27:09,539
- Jesus...
- I touch!

236
00:27:09,568 --> 00:27:12,642
Dies, brother...
Cameron, come on.

237
00:27:12,676 --> 00:27:17,182
Ava, wake up!
Come hear me?

238
00:27:21,408 --> 00:27:23,308
What the hell is all this?

239
00:27:27,236 --> 00:27:32,003
Dom 'Colonel, I need light! Return
get your Bruce, illuminated here.

240
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:36,650
- What happened?
- Come out at what caused the swelling.

241
00:27:37,193 --> 00:27:40,976
Got internal bleeding,
methylergometrine on the top shelf.

242
00:27:43,485 --> 00:27:47,617
- Gentlemen, you must leave.
- Die if we do something!

243
00:27:47,639 --> 00:27:51,100
- Is now officially in the quarantine room!
- Can not you close here!

244
00:27:51,122 --> 00:27:54,506
- Reach out. Ava, let me help you.
- I never leave here.

245
00:27:54,531 --> 00:27:57,537
Why do you want me  lock?
What's wrong with you?

246
00:27:59,715 --> 00:28:01,434
Go on, Bruce.
I stop the bleeding.

247
00:28:01,435 --> 00:28:04,208
Colonel, you do not have jurisdiction here,
I am Dr. stations.

248
00:28:04,848 --> 00:28:07,469
Infirmary is yours.
Report to me when you're done.

249
00:28:07,493 --> 00:28:09,721
You have to pay your me,
bastard!

250
00:28:09,832 --> 00:28:11,330
Bastards!

251
00:28:16,302 --> 00:28:18,200
E infection,
Now you could be and you!

252
00:28:18,227 --> 00:28:20,710
And risked his life for us, so
-I thank you?

253
00:28:20,711 --> 00:28:22,930
Focus on communication equipment repair,

254
00:28:22,943 --> 00:28:25,898
basis will tell you what to do with it.
Until then, follow my orders!

255
00:28:25,907 --> 00:28:29,342
Sure... Sure!
So right?

256
00:29:03,731 --> 00:29:06,025
I'm afraid it took less
everybody claustrophobia.

257
00:29:06,026 --> 00:29:08,204
Perhaps
from carbon monoxide intoxication.

258
00:29:08,211 --> 00:29:11,173
"El Capitan"
closure ordered Ava and I. ..

259
00:29:11,439 --> 00:29:16,977
Maybe spores that infected a
created... you some weird stuff.

260
00:29:17,131 --> 00:29:20,153
And I still need to figure out what.

261
00:29:21,615 --> 00:29:26,066
Heater is off by seven hours. Began to feel the thrill.

262
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:30,012
But... Back to work.

263
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:34,355
Chief engineer Bruce Johns,
ARK monthly basis.

264
00:30:16,085 --> 00:30:17,568
Ava, do you?

265
00:30:26,112 --> 00:30:27,434
Ava!

266
00:30:30,137 --> 00:30:31,440
Ava!

267
00:30:33,116 --> 00:30:34,604
Ava! Ava!

268
00:30:34,621 --> 00:30:36,838
- Go ahead!
- Calm down.

269
00:30:37,055 --> 00:30:38,891
S stretches her bed.

270
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,733
- Ava, calm down.
- Hold it!

271
00:30:44,406 --> 00:30:47,175
- What the hell happened to you?
- Calm down!

272
00:30:48,084 --> 00:30:50,819
Johns,
we need your help!

273
00:30:53,733 --> 00:30:57,026
- I was bitten!
- What the hell are you talking about?

274
00:30:57,099 --> 00:31:00,226
- I was bitten...
- Okay, ready...

275
00:31:01,736 --> 00:31:03,445
There was something here!

276
00:31:07,266 --> 00:31:09,121
There was something here.

277
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,899
There's nothing here.

278
00:31:16,929 --> 00:31:21,215
Yeah, well something has taken a bite out of my leg that
!

279
00:31:21,648 --> 00:31:23,965
- Look!
- Bruce, listen.

280
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:28,759
You probably cut
cabinet or any shard of broken glass. There is nothing...

281
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:34,416
No, listen. There was something here.
Right there. I swear. Take a look!

282
00:31:34,637 --> 00:31:36,362
Come on, forget it!

283
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:40,818
Close my room.
Let me know when you're done here.

284
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:44,776
Consulted him on it and has the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning
.

285
00:31:53,727 --> 00:31:57,151
There was something on me.

286
00:31:57,667 --> 00:32:00,952
I felt weight on his chest, right?

287
00:32:02,044 --> 00:32:06,487
Thing, this creature,
feed my bosom.

288
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:12,450
Was not real. Nothing, Ava.
There's nothing here.

289
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:16,079
You understand ?
You had hallucinations.

290
00:32:16,853 --> 00:32:21,833
A and A. Go to sleep again.
Need to look at the cut of Bruce. Be right back.

291
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:27,345
Bruce, come into the dining room to see your
cuts.

292
00:32:35,239 --> 00:32:38,005
I know that was something here,
with me.

293
00:32:43,452 --> 00:32:45,971
I know and you've seen.

294
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:50,628
Is possible for me to have given birth to something?

295
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:53,995
Not know.

296
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:54,562
If you close your eyes, it's about 25 years old
whiskey. There, God!

297
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:58,010
Bottle you cut deep enough.

298
00:33:58,377 --> 00:34:00,175
M has bitten something.

299
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:05,065
Quit that good?
You do not help.

300
00:34:05,446 --> 00:34:08,671
Listen,
I swear I saw something there.

301
00:34:11,402 --> 00:34:13,315
You hear stuff?

302
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:19,157
- Do not believe me...
- No, you and Ava have the same symptoms.

303
00:34:19,635 --> 00:34:25,535
Yeah, well... If something used
Ava to reproduce?

304
00:34:26,319 --> 00:34:28,905
A creature that has no DNA.

305
00:34:31,271 --> 00:34:35,971
- And I'll endeavors to enhance the mind?
- Come on, unaware that it is possible.

306
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:43,153
Only when you have the opportunity to examine the fluid
Ava will be able to determine precisely.

307
00:34:43,257 --> 00:34:48,483
But until then, the most logical and rational
rash remains a fibroid.

308
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:52,400
There was nothing in that room
which to prove otherwise.

309
00:34:53,217 --> 00:34:54,727
Now...

310
00:34:54,903 --> 00:34:57,955
I want to go get some rest, and
That's an order.

311
00:34:58,005 --> 00:35:03,332
Yes, Colonel wants to communicate again.

I had to defend myself, right?
I'm not crazy!

414
00:53:30,164 --> 00:53:32,570
Why did you hide such a thing from me?

430
00:57:11,168 --> 00:57:13,129

- What happened?
- Bruce came.

434
00:57:36,213 --> 00:57:38,118
He tried to kill me.

435
00:57:40,656 --> 00:57:44,034
- When?
- Now, a few seconds!

436
00:57:45,487 --> 00:57:49,746
- Bruce is dead.
- Impossible was just here.

437
00:57:50,209 --> 00:57:55,748
No matter what you think you saw,
May Think about it, because there was Bruce.

438
00:57:56,669 --> 00:57:58,072
Colonel...

439
00:57:58,628 --> 00:58:01,614
Is there anything to do with us to the resort.

440
00:58:02,347 --> 00:58:07,408
Incubated in
Ava and now turned into a copy of Bruce.

441
00:58:07,427 --> 00:58:10,117
Both were infected spores!

442
00:58:12,139 --> 00:58:16,027
Vent wells was used
to move.

443
00:58:18,261 --> 00:58:20,577
When you have to kill him.

444
00:58:23,071 --> 00:58:25,606
And
Ava we need to help us.

445
00:58:47,103 --> 00:58:48,557
Ava...

446
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:51,852
Bruce is dead.

447
00:58:53,503 --> 00:58:55,196
How do you know that?

448
00:58:57,530 --> 00:59:00,272
Making sense.

449
00:59:02,607 --> 00:59:06,836
Ava, we need your help.
You could be the only one who can control.

450
00:59:07,142 --> 00:59:08,874
And I do not now. </ I>

451
00:59:09,862 --> 00:59:13,735
Mo used to be is born, but now
are a threat to him, and as you.

452
00:59:15,938 --> 00:59:20,825
Suppose
took a sample of his DNA to Bruce when bitten.

453
00:59:21,276 --> 00:59:23,607
And I realized that a male is stronger physically
,

454
00:59:23,608 --> 00:59:26,752
so in one copy,
to survive.

455
00:59:28,931 --> 00:59:33,486
But we still need your help.
Can we trust you?

456
00:59:35,014 --> 00:59:36,769
You can trust me.

461
01:00:12,577 --> 01:00:14,317
Looks damn
decided to kill us.

462
01:00:14,318 --> 01:00:16,516
Took human form
should be easier to find.

463
01:00:16,517 --> 01:00:18,196
Something is not right.

01:00:19,554 --> 01:00:21,327
Offer compressor pumps.

465
01:00:22,367 --> 01:00:24,660

A disused chimney three.
Trying to destroy the system.

467
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:32,252
It makes no sense, if dropped Statham
will die with us.

468
01:00:33,156 --> 01:00:35,799
He knows, by Bruce,
Where escape capsule.

469
01:00:37,398 --> 01:00:41,683
I will try to override the system.
See if it can find!

470
01:00:42,185 --> 01:00:43,772
Go with you.

471
01:00:49,790 --> 01:00:52,076

To do.

If you start it, there's no place's back.
We have one chance.

Then take advantage of it.

01:07:23,574 --> 01:07:26,109
We need this
capsule prepared for the final ascent.

528
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:29,130
There is an emergency contact in the roof span. It engages.

- Do you think you will arrive on time?
- Fifty-fifty.

595
01:17:20,682 --> 01:17:24,998
Or sit here and pray to God
to reach us...

596
01:17:25,455 --> 01:17:28,983
Or...
've got three minutes until landing dock.

597
01:17:30,006 --> 01:17:32,459
Can you hold your breath
three minutes and a half to run?

598
01:17:32,483 --> 01:17:33,935
Da...

599

No sign of life.

Na exited anyone here, I see traces
.

604
01:19:13,502 --> 01:19:15,595
Escape pods have to be docked from now.

605
01:19:15,596 --> 01:19:19,560
Let's hope we find some answers.
Until then, keep quiet.

606
01:19:19,624 --> 01:19:22,116
- You called the Task Force?
- I'll be here in ten minutes.

Crows capsule basic coverage.
Breathing thing, get on all networks.

608
01:19:27,165 --> 01:19:30,101
Isolated area, and enter
nobody gets out.

609
01:19:50,824 --> 01:19:53,771
Sir, I think it would be
to see this.
