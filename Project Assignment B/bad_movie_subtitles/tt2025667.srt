5
00:01:08,411 --> 00:01:10,645
I had to get
your attention somehow.

6
00:01:10,647 --> 00:01:11,846
It's not funny.

7
00:01:11,848 --> 00:01:14,515
Who you texting anyway,
your boyfriend?

8
00:01:14,517 --> 00:01:16,451
Just work stuff.

9
00:01:16,453 --> 00:01:18,419
Eww.
Hey.

10
00:01:18,421 --> 00:01:21,689
You know, someday, you're
gonna have to get a job, too.

11
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:23,758
Nah. I'll just
get married.

12
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,827
Hi.

13
00:01:28,298 --> 00:01:30,131
Mare, come on.
No chatting.

14
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:31,666
Say goodbye to your friend.

15
00:01:31,668 --> 00:01:35,002
He's not my friend.
I don't even know him.

16
00:01:40,676 --> 00:01:41,976
Oh, no.
Is this that site

17
00:01:41,978 --> 00:01:45,046
Where it just chooses
who you talk with?

18
00:01:45,048 --> 00:01:47,248
Yeah, hideandgochat.

19
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,884
Yeah, you really
shouldn't be on this site.

20
00:01:49,886 --> 00:01:52,153
It's for people that do gross
things to other people.

21
00:01:52,155 --> 00:01:54,021
People do other things.

22
00:01:54,023 --> 00:01:56,057
Yeah, like what?

23
00:01:56,059 --> 00:01:57,258
I don't know.

24
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,359
Be silly.

25
00:01:58,361 --> 00:01:59,760
Make friends
all over the world.

26
00:01:59,762 --> 00:02:02,163
You know, you can
even meet a cute guy.

27
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:03,598
Heh. Really?

28
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,333
People use this
to find dates?

29
00:02:05,335 --> 00:02:07,869
Yeah, a lot
of guys do it.

30
00:02:07,871 --> 00:02:09,203
Hmm.

31
00:02:09,205 --> 00:02:10,938
Some of them even do it
with their pants off.

32
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,741
Okay, see, that's why you
shouldn't be on this site.

33
00:02:13,743 --> 00:02:14,942
It's way too sketch.

34
00:02:14,944 --> 00:02:16,110
Totally.

35
00:02:16,112 --> 00:02:17,745
I'm serious, though, mare.
You really

36
00:02:17,747 --> 00:02:19,547
Shouldn't put yourself
out there like that.

37
00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:23,317
What? Like someone's
gonna go smiley on me.

38
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:25,586
Who?

39
00:02:25,588 --> 00:02:27,989
You know,
the urban legend,

40
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:29,457
Smiley.

41
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:32,360
No. Who's that?

42
00:02:32,362 --> 00:02:34,395
You start a video chat
with somebody

43
00:02:34,397 --> 00:02:35,796
Who you don't even know,

44
00:02:35,798 --> 00:02:40,234
And you type in "I did for
the lulz" three times.

45
00:02:40,236 --> 00:02:45,773
And then this guy with a
knife appears behind them.

46
00:02:47,276 --> 00:02:49,343
And what?

47
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,647
They die.

48
00:02:55,918 --> 00:02:58,352
Why do they
call him smiley?

49
00:02:58,354 --> 00:03:00,955
Because he stitched
his eyes shut

50
00:03:00,957 --> 00:03:04,225
And carved a smile
onto his face.

51
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,230
okay.

52
00:03:09,232 --> 00:03:12,166
You need to stop
being creepy right now.

53
00:03:12,168 --> 00:03:13,634
But it's fun!

54
00:03:13,636 --> 00:03:15,036
That doesn't
even make sense,

55
00:03:15,038 --> 00:03:18,239
'cause how can
one person, smiley,

56
00:03:18,241 --> 00:03:20,908
Just show up behind people
all over the Internet?

57
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,477
You'd be surprised.

58
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,478
I think that's

59
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,948
Just--
crazy!

60
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,482
What's crazy, daddy?

61
00:03:28,484 --> 00:03:30,151
That you're still up. Go.

62
00:03:30,153 --> 00:03:31,152
Go brush your teeth.

63
00:03:31,154 --> 00:03:33,955
Go to bed, you,
before I get you.

64
00:03:33,957 --> 00:03:37,258
I'm sorry
that I was late.

65
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,662
Um, would
a check be okay?

66
00:04:45,962 --> 00:04:47,361
Shush.

67
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:59,407
Hello?

68
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:21,449
Wow. It's big.

69
00:07:21,451 --> 00:07:23,017
Yeah.

70
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:24,785
Sure you're
gonna be okay here?

71
00:07:24,787 --> 00:07:25,886
Mm-hmm.

72
00:07:25,888 --> 00:07:27,421
You can still
stay at the college

73
00:07:27,423 --> 00:07:28,422
If you like.
Dad.

74
00:07:28,424 --> 00:07:29,423
Hmph.

75
00:07:30,859 --> 00:07:32,159
Got everything
you need?

76
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:33,294
I think so.

77
00:07:33,296 --> 00:07:34,562
Need some money?

78
00:07:34,564 --> 00:07:36,063
Dad, you give me
plenty as it is.

79
00:07:36,065 --> 00:07:37,798
I know, but I just want to
make sure that you're okay.

80
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,168
I promise, I'm fine.

81
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,136
I know.

82
00:07:42,138 --> 00:07:44,071
But if you need
another year at home--

83
00:07:44,073 --> 00:07:46,941
It won't be
like last time.

84
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,676
I'm ready
for this now.

85
00:07:48,678 --> 00:07:50,110
Yeah, I know.

86
00:07:50,112 --> 00:07:53,314
Look at you,
all grown-up.

87
00:07:53,316 --> 00:07:56,217
You're sure you don't want to
be closer to your classes?

88
00:07:56,219 --> 00:07:59,186
Daddy, campus is
literally a block away.

89
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:01,689
You don't have
to worry so much.

90
00:08:01,691 --> 00:08:02,990
Well, I'm a father.

91
00:08:02,992 --> 00:08:05,259
I--it's part of my job.

92
00:08:05,261 --> 00:08:06,994
Daddy.

93
00:08:08,096 --> 00:08:09,363
Hey.

94
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,234
We're both
gonna be okay.

95
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:15,736
Okay?

96
00:08:15,738 --> 00:08:17,438
Okay.

97
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,740
We got this.

98
00:08:19,742 --> 00:08:21,342
I love you.

99
00:08:21,344 --> 00:08:22,676
I love you back.

100
00:08:23,946 --> 00:08:25,546
Get in there.

101
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:27,548
Text me if you
need anything!

102
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,250
I think I'll just call.

103
00:08:29,252 --> 00:08:32,286
Probably a good idea.

104
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:39,994
Proxy, this house
is so nice.

105
00:08:39,996 --> 00:08:42,463
Thanks for picking me.
Hey.

106
00:08:42,465 --> 00:08:45,099
Hey, I was just psyched
to meet someone normal

107
00:08:45,101 --> 00:08:46,634
When my roommate bailed.

108
00:08:46,636 --> 00:08:48,402
You know, it's weird.
There's so much online,

109
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:50,337
I kind of feel like
I already know you.

110
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:52,773
It's just so cool
that your parents

111
00:08:52,775 --> 00:08:54,174
Bought this house
for you.

112
00:08:54,176 --> 00:08:55,609
Um, my parents
bought it four years ago,

113
00:08:55,611 --> 00:08:57,511
And they can't sell it,
so might as well

114
00:08:57,513 --> 00:09:00,281
Have your daughter live in it instead
of paying dorm fees, I guess.

115
00:09:00,283 --> 00:09:02,283
Yeah, I really didn't
want to live in a dorm.

116
00:09:02,285 --> 00:09:04,018
Yeah, they're small.
They're gross.

117
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,220
Dorm parties suck.
Speaking of which,

118
00:09:06,222 --> 00:09:08,756
Um, I have a party
to get to.

119
00:09:08,758 --> 00:09:12,393
Well, it's actually kind of more
of like a little get-together.

120
00:09:12,395 --> 00:09:13,994
Hey, I mean, you wouldn't--

121
00:09:13,996 --> 00:09:16,030
You wouldn't want
to come with, would you?

122
00:09:16,032 --> 00:09:18,699
Isn't it a school night?

123
00:09:20,035 --> 00:09:22,536
Oh. Yeah, it's college.

124
00:09:22,538 --> 00:09:25,005
I can
do whatever I want.

125
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:29,109
Yes, I accept
your invitation.

126
00:09:30,712 --> 00:09:33,080
Lovely.

127
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,217
Is, like, everybody
at this party?

128
00:09:37,219 --> 00:09:39,153
Mm, probably. But, um,

129
00:09:39,155 --> 00:09:41,355
It's not exactly
a college party, though.

130
00:09:41,357 --> 00:09:42,723
It's just across campus.

131
00:09:42,725 --> 00:09:44,959
Oh. Is it
some friends of yours?

132
00:09:44,961 --> 00:09:46,460
Wait. Am I
too dressed up?

133
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:48,295
No. No, no, no.
Don't worry.

134
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:51,098
You're cool. I don't know all
these people either, so...

135
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,333
You don't?

136
00:09:52,335 --> 00:09:54,501
Did you hear about
the party or something?

137
00:09:54,503 --> 00:09:56,870
Wait. Do you think
we can get in?

138
00:09:56,872 --> 00:09:58,305
Is it safe?
No!

139
00:09:58,307 --> 00:09:59,506
Look,
I know them, okay?

140
00:09:59,508 --> 00:10:01,241
I just haven't
met them in person.

141
00:10:01,243 --> 00:10:02,776
This guy from "b"
invited LA people

142
00:10:02,778 --> 00:10:03,944
To his house
for a meet-up.

143
00:10:03,946 --> 00:10:06,413
What's bee?

144
00:10:06,415 --> 00:10:08,882
You know,
the "b" board on 4chan.

145
00:10:08,884 --> 00:10:11,552
Is that like
an Asian dating site?

146
00:10:11,554 --> 00:10:12,553
What?!

147
00:10:12,555 --> 00:10:15,222
Oh, my God, that sounded
totally racist.

148
00:10:15,224 --> 00:10:16,824
Oh, my God. You rule.

149
00:10:16,826 --> 00:10:20,494
Um, I might need to get
stoned to explain this.

150
00:10:20,496 --> 00:10:21,562
Do you smoke pot?

151
00:10:21,564 --> 00:10:25,299
Oh, uh, I was kind of
a dork in high school.

152
00:10:25,301 --> 00:10:28,869
Oh, but you're
in college now.

153
00:10:28,871 --> 00:10:31,605
I can do whatever I want.

154
00:10:31,607 --> 00:10:33,941
Yeah.

155
00:10:33,943 --> 00:10:36,276
Oh, my God, pusher.

156
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,179
As I was saying,
grandma,

157
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:41,315
"b" is
an image board

158
00:10:41,317 --> 00:10:44,051
Where people can
communicate anonymously.

159
00:10:50,325 --> 00:10:52,226
And what do people
do anonymously?

160
00:10:52,228 --> 00:10:53,694
Oh, very
important things,

161
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:56,830
Like post gross,
but hilarious pictures,

162
00:10:56,832 --> 00:10:59,066
Plan raids,
troll scientology,

163
00:10:59,068 --> 00:11:00,534
Make memes,
and in general

164
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:02,803
Do anything necessary
for the lulz.

165
00:11:04,906 --> 00:11:07,675
I think I'm high
on your marijuana.

166
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,381
Give me my marijuana.

167
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:17,551
Ooh, I hope there's some
hot guys at this party.

168
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:18,519
I like nerdy guys.

169
00:11:18,521 --> 00:11:20,254
Obviously you
like nerdy guys.

170
00:11:20,256 --> 00:11:21,989
Wait. Jacket on or off?

171
00:11:21,991 --> 00:11:23,657
Off. Ready?

172
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:24,725
Yeah.

173
00:11:30,599 --> 00:11:31,632
You okay?

174
00:11:31,634 --> 00:11:35,135
Hey, uh, what's up,
superhot ladies?

175
00:11:35,137 --> 00:11:36,770
What's up?

176
00:11:36,772 --> 00:11:39,807
Heh heh. I'm guessing
one of you is proxy?

177
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:41,408
Yeah?
Yeah.

178
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,110
Yeah.
What's up, Zane?

179
00:11:43,112 --> 00:11:45,045
Zane, yeah.

180
00:11:45,047 --> 00:11:46,613
Who's your
smoking friend?

181
00:11:46,615 --> 00:11:49,216
Hey. I'm Ashley.

182
00:11:49,218 --> 00:11:51,051
Ashley. Nice.

183
00:11:51,053 --> 00:11:54,021
Uh, I'm used to living
alone, or else I'd suggest

184
00:11:54,023 --> 00:11:55,789
<i>A   three's company
kind of thing.</i>

185
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,157
There's plenty
of room,

186
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,992
Especially
in my bedroom.

187
00:11:58,994 --> 00:12:01,195
yeah.

188
00:12:03,698 --> 00:12:05,299
Whoa.

189
00:12:07,502 --> 00:12:09,436
Cool.

190
00:12:10,472 --> 00:12:12,406
Oh, so, uh,

191
00:12:12,408 --> 00:12:14,408
You enjoy
the strange?

192
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:17,478
Yeah, I enjoy
the strange.

193
00:12:18,981 --> 00:12:20,447
I just smoked pot.

194
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:22,149
Did that come out right?

195
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:24,651
Yeah, it did.

196
00:12:24,653 --> 00:12:27,654
No, I enjoy the strange,
because it's, uh,

197
00:12:27,656 --> 00:12:30,257
Interesting and
often retarded.

198
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:32,426
That's kind of my
special research area,

199
00:12:32,428 --> 00:12:37,464
The intersection of the
strange and retarded.

200
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:40,267
That would make
a really good soap opera,

201
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:41,835
<i>The strange
and the retarded.</i>

202
00:12:41,837 --> 00:12:44,905
"and these are the days of our
strange and retarded lives."

203
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:48,942
No, but, uh, really,
what I'm interested in

204
00:12:48,944 --> 00:12:51,245
Is how people start believing
in things, you know?

205
00:12:51,247 --> 00:12:53,614
Like, uh, bigfoot,
for example.

206
00:12:53,616 --> 00:12:56,617
You know, there's no evidence
that bigfoot exists,

207
00:12:56,619 --> 00:12:59,953
Yet lots of people
believe in bigfoot.

208
00:12:59,955 --> 00:13:00,954
Chupacabra.
Sure.

209
00:13:00,956 --> 00:13:02,422
Sure.
Or how 'bout God?

210
00:13:02,424 --> 00:13:04,391
I mean, millions of
people go to church,

211
00:13:04,393 --> 00:13:05,959
And there's more
evidence for chupacabra.

212
00:13:05,961 --> 00:13:10,831
So is God strange
or retarded?

213
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,566
Hmm.

214
00:13:12,568 --> 00:13:13,433
Hmm.

215
00:13:13,435 --> 00:13:15,135
Let's take acid
and discuss.

216
00:13:15,137 --> 00:13:17,171
But first
I need another beer.

217
00:13:17,173 --> 00:13:18,806
Uh, get drunk now,
three-way later?

218
00:13:18,808 --> 00:13:19,807
Sound good? Yeah.

219
00:13:22,877 --> 00:13:25,012
What the?

220
00:13:25,014 --> 00:13:26,180
Oh, hey.

221
00:13:26,182 --> 00:13:29,082
Hey, I think I saw
that guy on campus.

222
00:13:29,084 --> 00:13:31,051
Ashley:
Oh. Should we say hi?

223
00:13:31,053 --> 00:13:33,387
You should say hi.

224
00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:35,956
Go. Go.
I'll be fine. Go.

225
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,491
College party. Go.
Okay.

226
00:13:43,264 --> 00:13:46,433
Hey. I'm Ashley.

227
00:13:46,435 --> 00:13:48,001
Hey.

228
00:13:48,003 --> 00:13:50,370
Um, is this
the anonymous party?

229
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:53,340
Nobody will say.

230
00:13:53,342 --> 00:13:56,476
Oh. Well, then,
I guess it is, right?

231
00:13:56,478 --> 00:13:58,212
I'm just kidding.

232
00:13:58,214 --> 00:13:59,947
Yeah, it's the
anonymous party.

233
00:13:59,949 --> 00:14:02,783
Yeah. I'm a dork.

234
00:14:03,786 --> 00:14:06,353
Hey. Hey, what's up?
I'm Zane.

235
00:14:06,355 --> 00:14:07,888
What's up?
I'm binder.

236
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,824
Yeah. What are you
doing here, pedobear?

237
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,127
Don't call me that.

238
00:14:14,129 --> 00:14:16,096
Okay? I thought
it would be cool.

239
00:14:16,098 --> 00:14:17,397
Mm.

240
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,966
You're pedobear?

241
00:14:18,968 --> 00:14:21,001
Do you approve
this message?

242
00:14:21,003 --> 00:14:22,436
Bitch tits!

243
00:14:22,438 --> 00:14:25,839
pedobear!

244
00:14:25,841 --> 00:14:27,074
Guys, come on.

245
00:14:27,076 --> 00:14:28,742
I was just
hanging out, okay?

246
00:14:29,878 --> 00:14:30,677
Why don't you

247
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:32,079
Get out of here,
pedobear?

248
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:34,548
No one wants
to hang out with you.

249
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,950
Man: What a fucking tool.

250
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:40,387
Bye, pedobear.

251
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:44,558
Yikes.
What was that about?

252
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,594
Ah, he thought some of the stuff
on the board was messed up,

253
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:48,929
Said he'd report it.

254
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:51,632
Honestly, some of the stuff
is pretty messed up,

255
00:14:51,634 --> 00:14:54,368
But, uh, it's not smart
to say so.

256
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,369
He seemed nice.

257
00:14:55,371 --> 00:14:57,771
Yeah,
probably too nice.

258
00:14:58,574 --> 00:15:02,042
Dude, it's the tits.

259
00:15:02,044 --> 00:15:04,111
I did it
for the lulz!

260
00:15:04,113 --> 00:15:05,312
What are they saying?

261
00:15:06,748 --> 00:15:07,814
Check it out.

262
00:15:12,687 --> 00:15:14,021
What is this?

263
00:15:14,023 --> 00:15:15,455
Hideandgochat.

264
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:17,457
It's video chat,
like Skype,

265
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:20,193
But you don't know who
you're chatting with.

266
00:15:20,195 --> 00:15:22,396
Why would you chat
with strangers?

267
00:15:22,398 --> 00:15:23,630
Isn't that dumb?

268
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:25,999
Does this
look dumb to you?

269
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:47,788
Really?

270
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,623
Really?

271
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,158
Ashley:
What was that?

272
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,392
What, you've never
seen that?

273
00:15:52,394 --> 00:15:53,694
"I did it for the lulz."

274
00:15:53,696 --> 00:15:55,429
That's smiley.
Who?

275
00:15:55,431 --> 00:15:56,697
It's not real,
though, right?

276
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:58,198
Well, nobody knows
if it's real.

277
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,399
It's on the Internet.

278
00:16:00,568 --> 00:16:01,601
It's like
bloody Mary, okay?

279
00:16:01,603 --> 00:16:02,936
It's an urban legend.

280
00:16:02,938 --> 00:16:05,372
You type "I did it
for the lulz" three times

281
00:16:05,374 --> 00:16:06,773
Across from someone
you're chatting with,

282
00:16:06,775 --> 00:16:08,709
And then smiley
creeps into frame,

283
00:16:08,711 --> 00:16:10,711
And he kills them!
Heh heh.

284
00:16:10,713 --> 00:16:12,846
"I did it
for the" what?

285
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:14,448
Lulz! Laughs.
I did it just--

286
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,049
I did it just because.
It's like--

287
00:16:16,051 --> 00:16:19,152
Do you know when you do
something just because you can

288
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:21,121
Or you're bored
or whatever?

289
00:16:21,123 --> 00:16:23,256
Anyway, don't worry.
That video's totally fake.

290
00:16:23,258 --> 00:16:25,859
Really?
Yeah. Yeah.

291
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:29,162
'cause that's so freaky.

292
00:16:29,164 --> 00:16:30,397
Raah!

293
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,433
You got me.
Yeah, I did.

294
00:16:33,435 --> 00:16:35,369
I did it
for the lulz.

295
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,468
Oh, my God.

296
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,103
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

297
00:18:03,825 --> 00:18:07,794
This class is an introduction
to reason and ethics.

298
00:18:10,398 --> 00:18:12,132
Well, good morning.
How are you?

299
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:13,200
Come on in, please.

300
00:18:13,202 --> 00:18:15,268
Have a seat.

301
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,503
Make yourself
comfortable.

302
00:18:16,505 --> 00:18:18,705
I'm gonna stay here.

303
00:18:18,707 --> 00:18:20,440
Great.
As you guys know,

304
00:18:20,442 --> 00:18:22,075
That this class
is a requirement.

305
00:18:22,077 --> 00:18:28,081
Now, aside from my
brilliance and my charisma

306
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:31,318
And the, uh, school's
obvious huge budget...

307
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,652
Do you have a pencil?

308
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:34,354
And some of the
technical equipment...

309
00:18:34,356 --> 00:18:35,422
Thanks.

310
00:18:35,424 --> 00:18:36,756
Why do you think
this class is--

311
00:18:36,758 --> 00:18:38,125
You smell better
than I do.

312
00:18:38,127 --> 00:18:39,259
Excuse me. Excuse me.

313
00:18:39,261 --> 00:18:42,295
What--what is your name?

314
00:18:42,297 --> 00:18:43,430
Mark.
Mark.

315
00:18:43,432 --> 00:18:45,632
Okay, mark,
could you please tell me

316
00:18:45,634 --> 00:18:48,635
Why do you think this
class is a requirement?

317
00:18:48,637 --> 00:18:52,606
Um, because we
have to take it?

318
00:18:53,642 --> 00:18:55,142
Okay, all right,
all right.

319
00:18:55,144 --> 00:18:56,676
Hold on a second.
Don't laugh at mark.

320
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:58,145
All right, now what
is going on here?

321
00:18:58,147 --> 00:19:01,181
Now, why can't, "because
we have to take it,"

322
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:04,317
Be the reason that this class
is a requirement? Why?

323
00:19:07,088 --> 00:19:09,556
Yes, my sweet latecomer.

324
00:19:09,558 --> 00:19:12,926
Because they're just different
ways of saying the same thing.

325
00:19:12,928 --> 00:19:14,427
Exactly.

326
00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:17,531
They are what
we will learn to call

327
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:19,499
Equivalent statements.

328
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:22,469
Neither supports
nor follows the other.

329
00:19:22,471 --> 00:19:23,937
Now, as you guys
get more comfortable

330
00:19:23,939 --> 00:19:26,973
With the keys
of logic and reason,

331
00:19:26,975 --> 00:19:30,777
You're gonna find that they'll
open up just about any box.

332
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:33,480
Open your books
to page, uh, 29.

333
00:19:33,482 --> 00:19:35,348
29. No, that's just--

334
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,317
That's just
a picture of me.

335
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:43,089
Professor Clayton.

336
00:19:43,091 --> 00:19:44,925
Oh, girl who was late.

337
00:19:44,927 --> 00:19:46,259
I'm so sorry.
Ashley Brooks.

338
00:19:46,261 --> 00:19:47,594
I promise
I will never--

339
00:19:47,596 --> 00:19:49,462
No, just kidding.
Half the people in this class

340
00:19:49,464 --> 00:19:50,797
Are gonna drop out
once they realize

341
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:51,831
That reading is involved.

342
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,466
Oh, well,
I was wondering

343
00:19:53,468 --> 00:19:55,535
Whether I could get all the
semester's assignments early?

344
00:19:55,537 --> 00:19:56,670
Why? You leaving town?
No.

345
00:19:56,672 --> 00:19:58,805
I just like to be
really prepared.

346
00:20:02,276 --> 00:20:04,477
Are you hitting on me?

347
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,512
What? No.

348
00:20:05,514 --> 00:20:07,247
I wanted
to know about--

349
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:11,585
You're joking.

350
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:13,987
Oh, no. No, that--

351
00:20:13,989 --> 00:20:15,889
ah, yeah.

352
00:20:15,891 --> 00:20:17,390
Nothing gets past you,
Ms. Brooks.

353
00:20:17,392 --> 00:20:19,492
Ah, you know what? All the
assignments on the website.

354
00:20:19,494 --> 00:20:20,827
All right. Okay.
Okay. Thanks.

355
00:20:20,829 --> 00:20:22,395
Do yourself a favor,
though, okay?

356
00:20:22,397 --> 00:20:24,664
You don't have to do all
your homework in one night.

357
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:25,665
Just relax, okay?
It's college.

358
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:27,667
Have a good time, okay?

359
00:20:38,146 --> 00:20:40,814
Oh, what's up,
party monster?

360
00:20:40,816 --> 00:20:42,649
Everything is
still spinning.

361
00:20:42,651 --> 00:20:43,750
Is that normal?

362
00:20:43,752 --> 00:20:45,485
I don't know
what got into you.

363
00:20:45,487 --> 00:20:46,920
oh, God.

364
00:20:46,922 --> 00:20:48,855
Did I do something crazy?

365
00:20:48,857 --> 00:20:50,890
Uh, well, if belting out
Taylor swift lyrics

366
00:20:50,892 --> 00:20:52,892
At the top
of your lungs in front

367
00:20:52,894 --> 00:20:56,062
Of a bunch of 4chan nerds
is crazy, then yes.

368
00:20:56,064 --> 00:20:57,430
Oh, my God.
That's so embarrassing.

369
00:20:57,432 --> 00:20:58,598
No, don't worry, okay?

370
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,433
No one's even
gonna remember that,

371
00:21:00,435 --> 00:21:02,902
Because there's
a new video.

372
00:21:02,904 --> 00:21:04,838
What?

373
00:21:09,744 --> 00:21:12,379
Are those juicy
Booty shorts?

374
00:21:12,381 --> 00:21:14,214
Oh, my God,
his forehead.

375
00:21:14,216 --> 00:21:16,216
That is from last night.
What's that guy's name again?

376
00:21:16,218 --> 00:21:18,418
I don't know. Is that
a mole on your face,

377
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,586
Or is that a herpes?

378
00:21:19,588 --> 00:21:20,820
I don't know.
They put something

379
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:22,589
Right there on my face.
I don't know.

380
00:21:22,591 --> 00:21:24,424
What--what's it say?

381
00:21:26,727 --> 00:21:28,828
Oh, my God.

382
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,297
There's no way, right?

383
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:32,465
No way it's real?
Or no way it's fake?

384
00:21:32,467 --> 00:21:33,800
I don't know.

385
00:21:33,802 --> 00:21:35,368
Can't you call somebody?

386
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:38,571
None of us even know
each other's real names,

387
00:21:38,573 --> 00:21:41,408
But he hasn't
been online, so...

388
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,475
What do
other people think?

389
00:21:42,477 --> 00:21:43,810
About half and half.

390
00:21:43,812 --> 00:21:45,345
Well, did anyone
call the police?

391
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:47,714
And say what? That there's
some Internet video

392
00:21:47,716 --> 00:21:49,282
Of some guy
getting killed?

393
00:21:49,284 --> 00:21:50,517
Yes. If this is real,

394
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:52,319
Oh, my God,
this is so sick.

395
00:21:52,321 --> 00:21:53,820
"hi. Police?

396
00:21:53,822 --> 00:21:56,489
"yeah, there's an Internet video
of some guy getting killed.

397
00:21:56,491 --> 00:21:57,490
"oh, no, sorry.

398
00:21:57,492 --> 00:21:58,825
"I don't know his name,

399
00:21:58,827 --> 00:22:01,094
"but, um, he plays pranks
on the Internet,

400
00:22:01,096 --> 00:22:02,362
"and there's
this urban legend that says

401
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:04,297
"if you type
'I did it for the lulz'

402
00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:05,999
"3 times in a chat,
this guy smiley

403
00:22:06,001 --> 00:22:07,534
Appears behind
the other person and..."

404
00:22:07,536 --> 00:22:09,669
Okay.

405
00:22:09,671 --> 00:22:11,838
So it has
to be fake.

406
00:22:12,973 --> 00:22:13,907
Duh.

407
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:16,376
How would smiley
know where you are?

408
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:19,746
Right?

409
00:22:19,748 --> 00:22:21,381
Right. Yep.

410
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:23,917
I mean, they're all just waiting
to see who falls for it.

411
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,285
We're way too smart
for that.

412
00:22:25,287 --> 00:22:26,353
Yeah, stupid trolls.

413
00:22:26,355 --> 00:22:28,488
Heh. Oh, God,
I'm so glad you came home.

414
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,557
That was kind of
freaking me out.

415
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,294
Hey, you know, I know how
we could find out for real.

416
00:22:36,997 --> 00:22:38,198
What?

417
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:42,268
Try to do it?

418
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:44,938
No way.
That's so spooky.

419
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,440
No, it's not.
Okay, we just do it.

420
00:22:47,442 --> 00:22:50,377
Nothing happens, and
then we know it's fake.

421
00:22:50,379 --> 00:22:51,478
Because that way,

422
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,247
We'll know it's fake
for sure, huh?

423
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:55,515
Mm-hmm.
Okay.

424
00:22:55,517 --> 00:22:57,817
What are they
called again?

425
00:22:57,819 --> 00:22:59,319
Lulz, l-u-l-z,

426
00:22:59,321 --> 00:23:03,123
Like lols, like lolcats,
but lulz.

427
00:23:04,593 --> 00:23:08,194
Mm. Ah, no.

428
00:23:08,196 --> 00:23:10,463
Waah.

429
00:23:10,465 --> 00:23:11,498
Mm...

430
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,899
Maybe.

431
00:23:12,901 --> 00:23:14,901
Don't want to waste it.
Keep going. Keep going.

432
00:23:14,903 --> 00:23:17,003
Mm.
Oh, he's kind of cute.

433
00:23:17,005 --> 00:23:19,038
Mm, yeah, super cute.
Total babe.

434
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,373
Don't kill him.
Okay.

435
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:21,608
Enh, no.

436
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,943
Ahh! Penis!

437
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:25,845
Hi, tiny and kind of bent.

438
00:23:25,847 --> 00:23:27,747
Hope you like
touching that thing,

439
00:23:27,749 --> 00:23:29,015
'cause no one else
is gonna do it.

440
00:23:29,017 --> 00:23:30,183
"next" him.
Wait, wait.

441
00:23:30,185 --> 00:23:32,218
Wait, maybe should
we kill him instead.

442
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,020
Let me do it.
Maybe smiley

443
00:23:34,022 --> 00:23:36,156
Will come out and
cut off his wiener.

444
00:23:36,158 --> 00:23:36,956
"wiener"?

445
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,425
Heh. I think
you mean penis.

446
00:23:38,427 --> 00:23:39,993
You can't joke around,
though, okay?

447
00:23:39,995 --> 00:23:41,828
You have to really
want it to happen.

448
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,329
Yeah, okay, okay.
I want it to happen.

449
00:23:43,331 --> 00:23:45,298
Picture it.
You have to picture it.

450
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:47,834
Okay.

451
00:23:52,239 --> 00:23:54,574
Okay.

452
00:23:54,576 --> 00:23:56,876
Give me the keyboard.

453
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:05,418
Right.

454
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,533
Yeah, right.
As if.

455
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,867
He--he can see us!

456
00:24:53,869 --> 00:24:56,002
"next" him!
"next" him! "next" him!

457
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:59,138
Oh, my God.
What the fuck?!

458
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,007
I don't know. Did we
just kill somebody?

459
00:25:01,009 --> 00:25:02,342
Did I just
kill somebody?!

460
00:25:02,344 --> 00:25:04,110
I don't know.
Where did he come from?

461
00:25:04,112 --> 00:25:05,445
I don't know, okay?
I don't know.

462
00:25:05,447 --> 00:25:07,580
I thought college
was gonna be fun.

463
00:25:07,582 --> 00:25:09,883
If that really just happened,
smiley can't know where we are.

464
00:25:09,885 --> 00:25:11,284
But he saw us. I mean,
he looked right at us.

465
00:25:11,286 --> 00:25:12,452
He doesn't know
where we are.

466
00:25:12,454 --> 00:25:14,320
But he saw our faces,
and, oh, my God,

467
00:25:14,322 --> 00:25:16,823
He waved at us.
And that doesn't matter.

468
00:25:16,825 --> 00:25:18,024
He has no clue
where we are.

469
00:25:18,026 --> 00:25:20,159
He can't find out
from the computer?

470
00:25:20,161 --> 00:25:21,661
No, absolutely not, okay?

471
00:25:21,663 --> 00:25:23,563
The hideandgochat servers
are completely anonymized.

472
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:25,064
That's the whole point.
They're set up

473
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:26,900
So not even your root
can find the IP.

474
00:25:26,902 --> 00:25:28,034
I don't know
what that means.

475
00:25:28,036 --> 00:25:29,636
Trust me. It's good.

476
00:25:29,638 --> 00:25:31,170
Okay, okay.

477
00:25:31,172 --> 00:25:32,472
So we report this,
tell the police

478
00:25:32,474 --> 00:25:34,507
What we saw.
No, no, no, did. No, saw.

479
00:25:34,509 --> 00:25:36,042
No.
Why not?!

480
00:25:36,044 --> 00:25:37,677
Because if we report this,
there's gonna be press.

481
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,846
If it's real, it's gonna
lead him right to us.

482
00:25:39,848 --> 00:25:41,347
He does know
what we look like.

483
00:25:42,816 --> 00:25:44,584
What about the FBI
or something?

484
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:46,853
No. Ashley,
we can't do that, okay?

485
00:25:46,855 --> 00:25:48,488
We can't tell anybody
about this.

486
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:51,057
This never happened.

487
00:25:52,861 --> 00:25:54,527
Oh. It's my dad.

488
00:25:54,529 --> 00:25:56,095
Not a word.

489
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:03,736
Hi, daddy.

490
00:26:03,738 --> 00:26:04,737
Hi, sweetheart.

491
00:26:04,739 --> 00:26:06,839
How's college life?

492
00:26:06,841 --> 00:26:08,541
It's fine.

493
00:26:08,543 --> 00:26:11,578
I mean, it's okay.

494
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,012
It's good.

495
00:26:13,014 --> 00:26:14,280
I'm having fun.

496
00:26:14,282 --> 00:26:17,617
well, not too
much fun, I hope.

497
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:19,452
No.

498
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:21,554
You sound a little
funny, sweetheart.

499
00:26:21,556 --> 00:26:22,488
Everything's fine.

500
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,424
I'm sorry
I haven't called.

501
00:26:24,426 --> 00:26:25,425
I just...

502
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:31,264
I was just watching a
scary movie with proxy,

503
00:26:31,266 --> 00:26:34,667
And I-I'm still trying to
get it out of my head.

504
00:26:34,669 --> 00:26:35,935
Everything's good.

505
00:26:35,937 --> 00:26:37,236
Is this a bad time?
I mean,

506
00:26:37,238 --> 00:26:39,072
Do you want to get
back to your movie?

507
00:26:39,074 --> 00:26:41,307
No! I mean...

508
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:43,476
No.

509
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:46,846
Now's a good time.
I'm out on the patio.

510
00:26:46,848 --> 00:26:50,083
You still sound
kind of funny, hon.

511
00:26:50,085 --> 00:26:53,152
Must be a bad connection.

512
00:26:54,555 --> 00:26:56,089
Okay.

513
00:26:56,091 --> 00:26:59,192
But I do want you to
know that if you just...

514
00:26:59,194 --> 00:27:02,528
Feel like you're not ready
to be out on your own,

515
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:04,998
You know, you can
always come home.

516
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,566
Thanks, daddy.

517
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,574
I just miss mom.

518
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:17,543
Yeah.

519
00:27:17,545 --> 00:27:19,946
Yeah, so do I, baby.

520
00:27:19,948 --> 00:27:23,316
I wish we could just
call her up, you know,

521
00:27:23,318 --> 00:27:25,685
Hear her voice
one more time.

522
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:27,153
Yeah.

523
00:27:29,323 --> 00:27:31,491
Me, too.

524
00:27:31,493 --> 00:27:34,060
It's just hard,
you know.

525
00:27:35,729 --> 00:27:39,766
But I promise I'm fine
most of the time.

526
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:42,468
Ohh! Um...

527
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,203
Proxy's ready
to keep watching,

528
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:47,507
So I'll call you
later, okay? Bye.

529
00:27:49,276 --> 00:27:51,310
I didn't tell.
Good.

530
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:57,450
Now, who could
tell me what we mean

531
00:27:57,452 --> 00:28:00,386
By "the scientific method"?

532
00:28:00,388 --> 00:28:01,387
Mark.

533
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:06,392
It's like you make
a hypothesis...

534
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:07,960
No, that's true.
Please, mark,

535
00:28:07,962 --> 00:28:09,328
Stop--stop being right
so often,

536
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,664
And give some of the
other students a chance.

537
00:28:11,666 --> 00:28:12,632
Yes, it's true.

538
00:28:12,634 --> 00:28:14,400
The first step
in the scientific method

539
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:16,135
Is forming a hypothesis.

540
00:28:16,137 --> 00:28:17,770
So what's a hypothesis?

541
00:28:17,772 --> 00:28:18,938
Maria.

542
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,907
It's like what
you think is true.

543
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:22,809
Yes. Now that we
have this notion

544
00:28:22,811 --> 00:28:26,212
Of what we think is true,
what do we do next?

545
00:28:26,214 --> 00:28:27,580
I test it, girl.

546
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:29,782
Exactly.

547
00:28:29,784 --> 00:28:30,983
You test it.

548
00:28:30,985 --> 00:28:33,453
This man is
a closet scientist.

549
00:28:33,455 --> 00:28:35,722
All right, so what
do we do now? Ashley.

550
00:28:37,891 --> 00:28:42,729
Um, what if you test your
hypothesis and it's wrong?

551
00:28:42,731 --> 00:28:44,597
That's fine.
Happens all the time.

552
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:48,167
You add that result
to your observations.

553
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:49,635
You revise your hypothesis.

554
00:28:49,637 --> 00:28:51,537
No. I mean...

555
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:53,940
What if you test
your hypothesis

556
00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:56,142
And something
impossible happens?

557
00:28:56,144 --> 00:28:59,612
Hmm. What do you mean,
impossible?

558
00:29:01,215 --> 00:29:03,049
Nothing.
It's stupid.

559
00:29:03,051 --> 00:29:05,284
I'm sure it's not.

560
00:29:05,286 --> 00:29:06,919
Like supernatural?

561
00:29:06,921 --> 00:29:09,288
Like ghosts?

562
00:29:11,693 --> 00:29:13,626
I don't think we're gonna
settle the ghost question,

563
00:29:13,628 --> 00:29:16,863
But I want to talk about
how the curiosity

564
00:29:16,865 --> 00:29:19,265
And skepticism embodied
in the scientific method

565
00:29:19,267 --> 00:29:21,000
Have applications
beyond the laboratory

566
00:29:21,002 --> 00:29:24,871
And their opposite,
ideology.

567
00:29:24,873 --> 00:29:28,174
We can call ideology
the complete confidence

568
00:29:28,176 --> 00:29:30,943
In what we think
we know, and as such,

569
00:29:30,945 --> 00:29:33,679
It is the end
of critical thinking

570
00:29:33,681 --> 00:29:34,747
And not in a good way.

571
00:29:34,749 --> 00:29:36,449
The worst things
that happen in the world

572
00:29:36,451 --> 00:29:40,820
Are done by people who are
sure that they are right.

573
00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:43,790
Hitler, Stalin, mao,

574
00:29:43,792 --> 00:29:45,758
Pol pot, bin laden,

575
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,362
These are people who believe that
they have some special knowledge

576
00:29:49,364 --> 00:29:52,698
And that this gives them
license to do anything

577
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,768
Because they can.

578
00:29:57,204 --> 00:29:59,906
Now, provided any of you
are still awake,

579
00:29:59,908 --> 00:30:04,677
Would you please turn your books
to the bottom of page 256?

580
00:30:41,149 --> 00:30:42,648
Oh, I'm so sorry.

581
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:43,649
Uh, sorry.

582
00:30:49,189 --> 00:30:50,823
Binder, right?

583
00:30:50,825 --> 00:30:51,791
Yeah.

584
00:30:51,793 --> 00:30:54,026
We met at that,
uh, party last night.

585
00:30:54,028 --> 00:30:55,027
Right.

586
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:57,163
Ashley.

587
00:30:57,165 --> 00:30:58,998
I remember.

588
00:31:01,602 --> 00:31:04,003
Can I talk to you
about something?

589
00:31:04,005 --> 00:31:05,238
Me?

590
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,139
Uh, yeah, sure.

591
00:31:07,141 --> 00:31:09,141
Guess I'm
the only one here.

592
00:31:09,143 --> 00:31:10,376
What's up?

593
00:31:10,378 --> 00:31:13,179
What do you know
about smiley?

594
00:31:13,181 --> 00:31:14,513
You mean,
is he real?

595
00:31:14,515 --> 00:31:16,949
Did they send you
here to mess with me?

596
00:31:16,951 --> 00:31:18,584
What?

597
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:20,653
Well, smiley's part of the
reason they don't like me,

598
00:31:20,655 --> 00:31:23,256
Like when I reported the child
porn they posted on /b/.

599
00:31:23,258 --> 00:31:24,657
I don't know.
I just don't think

600
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:26,025
Stuff like that
is ever funny.

601
00:31:26,027 --> 00:31:27,059
Because it's not.

602
00:31:27,061 --> 00:31:29,929
But what about smiley?

603
00:31:29,931 --> 00:31:33,099
Well, my theories on him
are kind of weird.

604
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:35,101
This whole thing
is pretty weird.

605
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:36,269
Yeah.

606
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:38,371
Well, I think
smiley's only real

607
00:31:38,373 --> 00:31:40,439
When people
make him real.

608
00:31:40,441 --> 00:31:42,408
Like tinker bell?

609
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:44,977
Heh. Yeah.

610
00:31:44,979 --> 00:31:48,314
Except it's like all the
evil around the Internet

611
00:31:48,316 --> 00:31:50,182
Found one place
to hide,

612
00:31:50,184 --> 00:31:52,118
You know,
where it's invited,

613
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:56,022
And then people just made
it become something.

614
00:31:56,024 --> 00:31:57,590
Smiley.

615
00:31:57,592 --> 00:32:00,559
Do you think he's real?

616
00:32:00,561 --> 00:32:02,495
I don't know
if smiley's real.

617
00:32:02,497 --> 00:32:05,298
I mean, I think
the videos are real.

618
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,333
That probably
doesn't make any sense.

619
00:32:07,335 --> 00:32:09,001
No, I think I know
what you mean.

620
00:32:11,004 --> 00:32:12,772
You seem really nice.

621
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:15,074
You do, too.

622
00:32:16,276 --> 00:32:18,644
Maybe we could...

623
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,080
Be friends?

624
00:32:21,082 --> 00:32:22,782
Yeah.

625
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,750
Yeah.

626
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:27,787
What's your number?

627
00:32:30,958 --> 00:32:32,425
Uh, okay.

628
00:32:38,967 --> 00:32:40,199
oh.

629
00:32:40,201 --> 00:32:42,101
That's you.

630
00:32:42,103 --> 00:32:43,636
That's me.
That's you.

631
00:32:43,638 --> 00:32:46,372
Okay, I gotta go, but...

632
00:32:46,374 --> 00:32:47,373
Text me, okay?

633
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:48,808
Really?

634
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,109
Yeah, really.

635
00:32:50,111 --> 00:32:51,477
Bye.
Bye.

636
00:32:51,479 --> 00:32:53,045
See you later.

637
00:32:59,287 --> 00:33:01,053
Hey.

638
00:33:01,055 --> 00:33:02,355
Where are you going?

639
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:04,557
There's a big
party night at Zane's.

640
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,892
It's gonna be huge,
and you're coming.

641
00:33:08,428 --> 00:33:10,296
What about what we did...

642
00:33:10,298 --> 00:33:11,630
With smiley?

643
00:33:11,632 --> 00:33:13,899
I don't know what
you're talking about,

644
00:33:13,901 --> 00:33:16,235
Because that never
happened, remember?

645
00:33:16,237 --> 00:33:17,770
Oh. Right. Sorry.

646
00:33:17,772 --> 00:33:20,039
Yeah. Okay,
go get ready, all right?

647
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:22,641
This'll make us
both forget, I promise.

648
00:33:22,643 --> 00:33:23,609
Okay.

649
00:33:23,611 --> 00:33:24,977
Okay. Just don't dress

650
00:33:24,979 --> 00:33:27,480
Like you're going to
a quinceañera this time.

651
00:33:36,356 --> 00:33:38,157
Whoo Whoo!

652
00:33:42,462 --> 00:33:43,496
Hey, ash, I think--

653
00:33:43,498 --> 00:33:45,164
Ohh! Ohh!

654
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:48,200
Shit. Oh, shit,
I am so sorry.

655
00:33:48,202 --> 00:33:50,102
Um, the bar here.
Here. Try some.

656
00:33:50,104 --> 00:33:51,404
Oh, I probably
shouldn't.

657
00:33:51,406 --> 00:33:53,873
Ah, come on. Drink it.
It's a free drink.

658
00:33:53,875 --> 00:33:55,508
Okay.

659
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,509
Drink it.

660
00:33:56,511 --> 00:33:57,777
I gotta pee so badly.

661
00:33:57,779 --> 00:34:00,646
Mm. I think there
was a bug in it.

662
00:34:00,648 --> 00:34:02,214
I'm gonna go pee
in a closet.

663
00:34:04,385 --> 00:34:07,153
You're crazy!

664
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:25,838
"...Did it for the lulz"
three times,

665
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:29,475
And then smiley came up behind
him, and he killed him.

666
00:34:29,477 --> 00:34:30,843
Nuh-uh.
That sounds crazy.

667
00:34:30,845 --> 00:34:32,812
Are you sure
it's real?

668
00:34:49,262 --> 00:34:51,197
Oh.
Hey, what's up?

669
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,232
Hey, I'm Ashley.

670
00:34:53,234 --> 00:34:54,500
Yeah, yeah, I know.

671
00:34:54,502 --> 00:34:56,335
We, uh--we met
the other night.

672
00:34:56,337 --> 00:34:58,204
You wanted
to have sex with me,

673
00:34:58,206 --> 00:34:59,472
But I wasn't
into it.

674
00:34:59,474 --> 00:35:02,141
What?
Hmm?

675
00:35:05,346 --> 00:35:07,546
I'm sorry
about your friend.

676
00:35:07,548 --> 00:35:09,281
Kells was
your friend, right?

677
00:35:11,017 --> 00:35:12,017
That's...

678
00:35:12,019 --> 00:35:14,019
What? No.

679
00:35:14,021 --> 00:35:16,088
He's not dead.

680
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:17,189
Are you kidding me?

681
00:35:17,191 --> 00:35:18,357
He's probably just

682
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:19,825
Pulling a frigging
prank on us. Hello.

683
00:35:19,827 --> 00:35:21,293
They haven't even
found the body.

684
00:35:21,295 --> 00:35:24,029
Well, do you know
where he lives?

685
00:35:24,031 --> 00:35:25,197
I don't know.

686
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:27,433
Probably
with his moms.

687
00:35:27,435 --> 00:35:28,467
Oh, dude.

688
00:35:28,469 --> 00:35:29,802
You just
come up with that?

689
00:35:29,804 --> 00:35:31,504
So you don't know
if he's alive.

690
00:35:31,506 --> 00:35:34,373
What if this
is really real?

691
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:37,643
Oh, what if
nothing's real?

692
00:35:37,645 --> 00:35:39,979
<i>Maybe it's the end
of   the Truman show</i>

693
00:35:39,981 --> 00:35:42,581
And you both just hit
the sky mural.

694
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:46,585
"oh, what's real?
I don't know.

695
00:35:46,587 --> 00:35:49,054
My life is
a show on TV."

696
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:54,760
Come with me.

697
00:35:54,762 --> 00:35:56,428
What did you see?

698
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,630
Nothing.

699
00:35:57,632 --> 00:35:59,698
Seriously,
what did you see?

700
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,869
I mean, I saw
the video of kells.

701
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:07,006
Yeah, and he's
fucking dead, right?

702
00:36:07,008 --> 00:36:09,675
I mean,
we're on the same page here.

703
00:36:09,677 --> 00:36:11,610
What else did you see?

704
00:36:11,612 --> 00:36:14,346
Nothing.

705
00:36:14,348 --> 00:36:16,282
I didn't see
anything else.

706
00:36:16,284 --> 00:36:18,651
Are you fucking with me?

707
00:36:20,487 --> 00:36:22,855
You typed it,
and you made it happen.

708
00:36:22,857 --> 00:36:23,889
No.
Yes. You did.

709
00:36:23,891 --> 00:36:26,692
You did it
for the lulz, right?

710
00:36:26,694 --> 00:36:29,128
You called smiley,
and he came.

711
00:36:30,764 --> 00:36:33,632
Okay, look, if it
makes you feel any better...

712
00:36:35,035 --> 00:36:36,101
I did it, too.

713
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:39,405
I don't even know
who the fuck he killed.

714
00:36:39,407 --> 00:36:40,439
It was just some kid.

715
00:36:40,441 --> 00:36:42,041
He cut him up
like a pig.

716
00:36:43,643 --> 00:36:45,978
God, this can't
be real, right?

717
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:46,979
It can't.

718
00:36:46,981 --> 00:36:48,647
I mean, God,

719
00:36:48,649 --> 00:36:51,417
I don't even know who these
people are that are my friends,

720
00:36:51,419 --> 00:36:52,551
Just people I know.

721
00:36:52,553 --> 00:36:55,154
whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

722
00:36:55,156 --> 00:36:56,755
Whoa. Hey, hey.
I'm so sorry.

723
00:36:56,757 --> 00:36:59,858
You--you want a bed
or something?

724
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,060
I'm gonna go home.

725
00:37:01,062 --> 00:37:03,529
Do you have a ride?
You want a cab?

726
00:37:03,531 --> 00:37:05,164
Or...

727
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,235
You can sleep over.

728
00:37:12,872 --> 00:37:14,373
I'm gonna walk.

729
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:18,043
Eh, no, you shouldn't walk
across campus by yourself.

730
00:37:18,045 --> 00:37:20,946
What if he comes for
the people who call him?

731
00:37:20,948 --> 00:37:22,581
Have you thought
about that?

732
00:37:33,093 --> 00:37:34,727
Proxy.

733
00:38:34,154 --> 00:38:35,421
It's nothing.

734
00:38:35,423 --> 00:38:36,488
You're being stupid.

735
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:37,956
You're just being stupid.

736
00:38:43,563 --> 00:38:47,166
Man: Ashley.

737
00:39:26,574 --> 00:39:28,340
No! Please, no!

738
00:39:36,383 --> 00:39:37,383
Are you okay?

739
00:39:37,385 --> 00:39:39,218
what?

740
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,653
That must have been one gnarly nightmare.
What was it?

741
00:39:41,655 --> 00:39:43,722
Smiley.

742
00:39:43,724 --> 00:39:45,958
Smiley was trying
to kill me.

743
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,260
That sucks. It's like
Freddy Krueger.

744
00:39:48,262 --> 00:39:49,261
What?!

745
00:39:49,263 --> 00:39:50,195
No! Last night,

746
00:39:50,197 --> 00:39:52,231
He was really
trying to kill me!

747
00:39:52,233 --> 00:39:55,367
Dude, what happened
to your shirt?

748
00:39:57,972 --> 00:40:00,706
He--he chased me,
and he caught me.

749
00:40:00,708 --> 00:40:02,307
He ripped my shirt.

750
00:40:02,309 --> 00:40:04,676
I don't think so.

751
00:40:04,678 --> 00:40:07,012
Maybe I--

752
00:40:07,014 --> 00:40:08,247
I left the party.

753
00:40:08,249 --> 00:40:11,283
Um, yeah. I was looking
all over for you.

754
00:40:11,285 --> 00:40:13,786
And then this girl,
she was like, "meh,

755
00:40:13,788 --> 00:40:16,121
She's not in the reh,"

756
00:40:16,123 --> 00:40:18,390
So I got a ride
with them.

757
00:40:18,392 --> 00:40:20,592
Look, this neighborhood isn't
that bad, but you probably

758
00:40:20,594 --> 00:40:22,761
Shouldn't be walking around
by yourself at night.

759
00:40:22,763 --> 00:40:25,063
Proxy!
This actually happened!

760
00:40:25,065 --> 00:40:28,567
I left the party,
and I was pretty buzzed.

761
00:40:28,569 --> 00:40:29,835
I was super wasted.

762
00:40:29,837 --> 00:40:31,336
I mean, how did
I get so wasted?

763
00:40:31,338 --> 00:40:32,838
Mm, I don't know.
And then--

764
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,840
And then I went
across campus,

765
00:40:34,842 --> 00:40:36,108
And he was there.

766
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:38,310
Well, are you sure
it was him?

767
00:40:38,312 --> 00:40:41,914
Wasn't just
some creepy guy?

768
00:40:41,916 --> 00:40:43,515
He had the fucking face,

769
00:40:43,517 --> 00:40:45,083
And he had the knife,

770
00:40:45,085 --> 00:40:47,920
And he said
my name, proxy.

771
00:40:47,922 --> 00:40:49,955
He knows my name.

772
00:40:49,957 --> 00:40:52,224
But you got away.

773
00:40:52,226 --> 00:40:53,358
No.

774
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,495
But, like,
you're right here,

775
00:40:56,497 --> 00:41:01,467
So, um, news flash, this
didn't happen, Ashley.

776
00:41:01,469 --> 00:41:04,303
Where did you find me?
I found you right here.

777
00:41:04,305 --> 00:41:06,672
I came in your room, and
you were in your bed.

778
00:41:06,674 --> 00:41:07,706
He was in here?!

779
00:41:07,708 --> 00:41:10,275
No.  God.

780
00:41:10,277 --> 00:41:11,543
It was just you.

781
00:41:11,545 --> 00:41:13,245
He did this.

782
00:41:13,247 --> 00:41:14,379
Okay.

783
00:41:14,381 --> 00:41:18,884
I think that it was just
a really bad dream.

784
00:41:18,886 --> 00:41:21,253
I mean,
don't get me wrong.

785
00:41:22,856 --> 00:41:25,257
I'm really
freaked out, too.

786
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,861
Okay, what's the last
thing you remember?

787
00:41:28,863 --> 00:41:32,030
Uh, he--

788
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:35,934
He was...

789
00:41:38,605 --> 00:41:41,073
And I woke up.

790
00:41:42,308 --> 00:41:47,112
Ashley, are you
on any psychiatric meds?

791
00:41:47,114 --> 00:41:48,380
No.

792
00:41:51,451 --> 00:41:52,551
Not anymore.

793
00:41:55,955 --> 00:41:58,490
Have you ever been
on any medication?

794
00:41:58,492 --> 00:42:00,959
Lithium for bipolar.

795
00:42:00,961 --> 00:42:03,028
And when were
you diagnosed?

796
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:05,030
My senior year
of high school.

797
00:42:05,032 --> 00:42:07,032
I kind of
had a breakdown

798
00:42:07,034 --> 00:42:09,434
After my mom
committed suicide.

799
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:13,372
Had your mother been
diagnosed as bipolar?

800
00:42:13,374 --> 00:42:18,210
No. Well, I mean,
afterwards.

801
00:42:18,212 --> 00:42:20,312
And why'd you stop
taking the meds?

802
00:42:20,314 --> 00:42:22,848
The lithium made me
so fat and stupid.

803
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:24,283
I couldn't
remember anything.

804
00:42:24,285 --> 00:42:27,085
But I--I didn't just quit.
I came off it gradually.

805
00:42:27,087 --> 00:42:28,987
Under your doctor's
supervision?

806
00:42:28,989 --> 00:42:30,422
Mm-hmm.

807
00:42:30,424 --> 00:42:32,558
I've been totally
off it for six months.

808
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,461
Okay. Well, what's up?

809
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:39,231
I'm really anxious.

810
00:42:39,233 --> 00:42:41,767
It is your first week
of college.

811
00:42:41,769 --> 00:42:43,502
Yeah, but...

812
00:42:43,504 --> 00:42:45,637
Really anxious,

813
00:42:45,639 --> 00:42:47,906
Like terrified.

814
00:42:47,908 --> 00:42:49,508
And I feel guilty.

815
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:51,777
I feel like I've done
something really bad,

816
00:42:51,779 --> 00:42:53,211
But I don't think I have.

817
00:42:53,213 --> 00:42:56,548
Well, in your
first week of school,

818
00:42:56,550 --> 00:43:00,052
You haven't done
something really awful,

819
00:43:00,054 --> 00:43:02,821
Like, say,
killed anyone.

820
00:43:02,823 --> 00:43:05,457
Heh.

821
00:43:05,459 --> 00:43:07,326
No.

822
00:43:09,195 --> 00:43:12,431
But I'm having really
vivid nightmares.

823
00:43:12,433 --> 00:43:14,666
You've been
through a trauma,

824
00:43:14,668 --> 00:43:16,034
Adjusted to it,

825
00:43:16,036 --> 00:43:18,503
And now you're
in a new environment.

826
00:43:18,505 --> 00:43:19,504
It's stressful.

827
00:43:21,074 --> 00:43:22,674
I don't seem crazy?

828
00:43:22,676 --> 00:43:23,942
Crazy?

829
00:43:23,944 --> 00:43:26,712
I'd have to say...

830
00:43:26,714 --> 00:43:28,080
Not at all.

831
00:43:28,915 --> 00:43:32,017
Even though the dreams,

832
00:43:32,019 --> 00:43:35,754
They're really...

833
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:40,659
They're
really realistic.

834
00:43:40,661 --> 00:43:44,062
Well, that's the nature
of dreams, isn't it?

835
00:43:44,064 --> 00:43:45,664
They seem real
when we're having them.

836
00:43:45,666 --> 00:43:48,333
Otherwise, they'd have
no power over us.

837
00:43:48,335 --> 00:43:50,969
But it sounds like this
anxiety is debilitating.

838
00:43:50,971 --> 00:43:53,105
Yeah.
And you don't want

839
00:43:53,107 --> 00:43:54,840
To go back
on the lithium salts.

840
00:43:54,842 --> 00:43:57,743
Have you ever tried anything
for situational anxiety,

841
00:43:57,745 --> 00:44:00,412
Rather than a sledgehammer
like lithium?

842
00:44:00,414 --> 00:44:02,714
Like what?

843
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:06,885
I'm gonna write you
a short scrip for ativan.

844
00:44:06,887 --> 00:44:08,787
That sound okay?

845
00:44:08,789 --> 00:44:10,389
Hmm?

846
00:44:10,391 --> 00:44:12,157
Yes.

847
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:14,760
I just remembered
something.

848
00:44:14,762 --> 00:44:16,495
I'm not crazy.

849
00:44:16,497 --> 00:44:17,429
Okay, good.

850
00:44:17,431 --> 00:44:19,564
That's a good thing
to remember.

851
00:44:19,566 --> 00:44:21,767
I'm gonna give you
this scrip,

852
00:44:21,769 --> 00:44:23,301
And it's not for crazy.

853
00:44:23,303 --> 00:44:24,369
It's for anxiety.

854
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,740
Okay.

855
00:44:32,478 --> 00:44:33,478
Did you tell?

856
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,813
no.

857
00:44:34,815 --> 00:44:36,415
I just remembered.
At the party,

858
00:44:36,417 --> 00:44:37,649
Zane knew-- yeah,
he just called me.

859
00:44:37,651 --> 00:44:39,885
There's another one.
Another what?

860
00:44:39,887 --> 00:44:41,153
Another dead person.

861
00:44:41,155 --> 00:44:43,088
We gotta go
to Zane's.

862
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:50,395
Ashley.

863
00:44:52,031 --> 00:44:54,199
Okay, what is going on?

864
00:44:54,201 --> 00:44:56,101
I don't know.

865
00:44:56,103 --> 00:44:57,235
What about you?

866
00:44:57,237 --> 00:44:58,970
Huh? You know
what's going on?

867
00:44:58,972 --> 00:45:00,672
Is that a gun?
Yes. Yes.

868
00:45:00,674 --> 00:45:02,140
This--
this is a gun.

869
00:45:02,142 --> 00:45:03,575
Why do you have that?

870
00:45:03,577 --> 00:45:06,144
Because I am
a security professional.

871
00:45:06,146 --> 00:45:07,679
But I thought
you went to college.

872
00:45:10,016 --> 00:45:12,584
Do I really seem
that retarded to you?

873
00:45:12,586 --> 00:45:15,187
What?
College is for retards.

874
00:45:15,189 --> 00:45:17,689
I am a security
professional.

875
00:45:17,691 --> 00:45:19,691
Oh.

876
00:45:19,693 --> 00:45:20,959
Like at the mall?

877
00:45:20,961 --> 00:45:23,562
Fucking fuck, no!
No, no, no!

878
00:45:23,564 --> 00:45:26,064
Like at the mall?
Network security.

879
00:45:26,066 --> 00:45:27,265
What's
network security?

880
00:45:27,267 --> 00:45:29,434
He's a hacker,
okay, like lulzsec,

881
00:45:29,436 --> 00:45:31,169
Like--like anonymous,
like wikileaks,

882
00:45:31,171 --> 00:45:32,237
Like trolling
westboro--

883
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:33,672
Proxy, will you
shut up, please?

884
00:45:33,674 --> 00:45:35,574
Will you watch the gun?
Please shut up.

885
00:45:35,576 --> 00:45:37,442
She has to understand that to
know what you're talking about.

886
00:45:37,444 --> 00:45:38,877
I don't know what
you're talking about.

887
00:45:38,879 --> 00:45:39,878
He needs some money,

888
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,213
He hacks
a corporate network,

889
00:45:41,215 --> 00:45:43,315
And then says, "hey,
pay me to fix your problem."

890
00:45:43,317 --> 00:45:44,649
That's a network
security professional.

891
00:45:44,651 --> 00:45:46,451
What you're talking
about would be

892
00:45:46,453 --> 00:45:49,454
An illegal
protection racket.

893
00:45:49,456 --> 00:45:52,724
I am one
of a hundred

894
00:45:52,726 --> 00:45:56,728
Or 500 or a thousand
people in the whole world

895
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:59,064
Who can find out
anything about anyone,

896
00:45:59,066 --> 00:46:02,467
Medical records,
how much money,

897
00:46:02,469 --> 00:46:05,437
Chocolate or vanilla,
top or bottom.

898
00:46:05,439 --> 00:46:09,341
I mean,
and honestly,

899
00:46:09,343 --> 00:46:13,378
I have no idea
what's going on.

900
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,947
I mean,
who's doing this?

901
00:46:15,949 --> 00:46:17,516
We don't know.

902
00:46:17,518 --> 00:46:21,820
Okay, well, why don't
you riddle me this?

903
00:46:21,822 --> 00:46:22,821
Who is she?

904
00:46:22,823 --> 00:46:24,089
Me?

905
00:46:24,091 --> 00:46:25,624
Smiley's trying
to kill me.

906
00:46:25,626 --> 00:46:27,726
"smiley's trying
to kill me. Ahh."

907
00:46:27,728 --> 00:46:28,727
You're not dead.

908
00:46:28,729 --> 00:46:29,861
You're not dead,

909
00:46:29,863 --> 00:46:31,930
And other
people are.

910
00:46:31,932 --> 00:46:33,698
You want to see
the video

911
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:36,535
Of smiley slashing
crash's throat?

912
00:46:36,537 --> 00:46:38,570
I could show it
to you if you want.

913
00:46:38,572 --> 00:46:40,572
No.
Proxy?

914
00:46:41,574 --> 00:46:44,442
This shit's
personal, okay?

915
00:46:44,444 --> 00:46:48,113
If this isn't some Internet
hobgoblin fairy tale,

916
00:46:48,115 --> 00:46:49,714
This is one
of our enemies.

917
00:46:49,716 --> 00:46:52,851
Who are your enemies?

918
00:46:52,853 --> 00:46:54,953
Who is not our enemies?

919
00:46:54,955 --> 00:46:58,423
You don't get to be king
of the Internet assholes

920
00:46:58,425 --> 00:47:01,092
Without making
a few enemies,

921
00:47:01,094 --> 00:47:02,093
A shit-ton, in fact.

922
00:47:02,095 --> 00:47:03,094
I mean, it could be--

923
00:47:03,096 --> 00:47:04,696
Could be the--
the Chinese

924
00:47:04,698 --> 00:47:07,098
Or those fucking--
those dicks in Holland.

925
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,266
Remember them?
Yeah.

926
00:47:08,268 --> 00:47:09,734
And, uh, the feds.

927
00:47:09,736 --> 00:47:10,769
Could be the FBI.

928
00:47:10,771 --> 00:47:13,505
I mean, but--
but if it was the FBI,

929
00:47:13,507 --> 00:47:17,209
You know, they'd be--
just knock down the door.

930
00:47:17,211 --> 00:47:19,978
fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck.

931
00:47:21,314 --> 00:47:24,783
What if smiley isn't
any of those things?

932
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:29,621
I mean, what if he's real?

933
00:47:29,623 --> 00:47:31,256
He's definitely
fucking real.

934
00:47:31,258 --> 00:47:32,958
I think we've established
that by now.

935
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,062
No, I mean, what if he's
something we can't understand?

936
00:47:37,064 --> 00:47:40,966
What if he's just evil?

937
00:47:43,035 --> 00:47:45,704
And that evil...

938
00:47:45,706 --> 00:47:47,539
Is hunting us?

939
00:47:47,541 --> 00:47:48,406
Yes.

940
00:47:48,408 --> 00:47:51,710
What if that evil
is hunting us?

941
00:47:51,712 --> 00:47:55,881
Well, then, I'd say that's
pretty fucking bad news.

942
00:47:57,617 --> 00:47:58,950
Shit!

943
00:48:00,353 --> 00:48:02,454
I think I'm gonna go get
my prescription filled.

944
00:48:02,456 --> 00:48:04,422
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

945
00:48:04,424 --> 00:48:06,758
What are
you getting?

946
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,261
Oh, ativan.

947
00:48:09,263 --> 00:48:12,297
Ativan. Um, save me
some of that.

948
00:48:12,299 --> 00:48:14,499
I think we're
gonna need it.

949
00:48:22,375 --> 00:48:24,109
All right,
be careful, ladies.

950
00:48:24,111 --> 00:48:25,710
Yeah. You, too.

951
00:48:25,712 --> 00:48:26,745
Right.

952
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:48,426
All righty.

953
00:49:48,428 --> 00:49:51,763
Who can tell me
about occam's razor? Yeah?

954
00:49:51,765 --> 00:49:56,735
Uh, "entities must not be
multiplied beyond necessity."

955
00:49:56,737 --> 00:49:59,004
You've done your reading.
That's very good.

956
00:49:59,006 --> 00:50:01,606
Okay, now give it to me
in the plain language, okay?

957
00:50:01,608 --> 00:50:04,142
What did William
of ockham mean? Hmm?

958
00:50:04,144 --> 00:50:05,276
Maria?

959
00:50:05,278 --> 00:50:08,380
Uh, the most likely
explanation

960
00:50:08,382 --> 00:50:10,715
Is usually
the right explanation.

961
00:50:10,717 --> 00:50:13,418
Now, is occam's razor
a rule

962
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:14,686
Or more of a guideline?

963
00:50:14,688 --> 00:50:16,421
Well, it's a guideline,
because, I mean,

964
00:50:16,423 --> 00:50:20,725
Sometimes the unlikely explanation
is actually the right explanation.

965
00:50:20,727 --> 00:50:25,030
Right, and that brings
us back to something

966
00:50:25,032 --> 00:50:26,865
That, uh, Ashley...

967
00:50:26,867 --> 00:50:27,866
Was asking about

968
00:50:27,868 --> 00:50:30,068
At the end
of the last class.

969
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:33,571
How do we account for things
that seem so unlikely

970
00:50:33,573 --> 00:50:35,273
As to be impossible?

971
00:50:35,275 --> 00:50:37,308
They do occur.

972
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:38,810
Like supernatural?

973
00:50:38,812 --> 00:50:40,612
Ah, let me give you
something that's

974
00:50:40,614 --> 00:50:42,614
A little weirder than what
we call supernatural,

975
00:50:42,616 --> 00:50:44,182
Just to, uh,
blow your minds.

976
00:50:44,184 --> 00:50:47,085
Are your minds
ready to blown?

977
00:50:48,354 --> 00:50:49,888
Okay.

978
00:50:51,424 --> 00:50:54,359
Now, we know
that the physical laws

979
00:50:54,361 --> 00:50:58,296
That govern the universe
are specific

980
00:50:58,298 --> 00:51:01,900
And that the tiniest,
most infinitesimal change

981
00:51:01,902 --> 00:51:05,403
In the weight of just one
type of subatomic particle,

982
00:51:05,405 --> 00:51:07,539
Any kind of particle,

983
00:51:07,541 --> 00:51:10,008
Would mean no universe,

984
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:13,545
No stars, no planets,

985
00:51:13,547 --> 00:51:16,314
No life,
no consciousness,

986
00:51:16,316 --> 00:51:19,284
Us not even having
this conversation.

987
00:51:19,286 --> 00:51:23,755
Unless you believe in a God
whose only reason for being

988
00:51:23,757 --> 00:51:27,125
Is the authorship of a
relatively small book of rules

989
00:51:27,127 --> 00:51:30,462
About the weight and
behavior of particles,

990
00:51:30,464 --> 00:51:32,964
Then we have
to acknowledge

991
00:51:32,966 --> 00:51:35,800
That those rules could have
been anything whatsoever.

992
00:51:35,802 --> 00:51:39,270
Now, what is the implication
of what I just said?

993
00:51:39,272 --> 00:51:40,572
Yeah?

994
00:51:40,574 --> 00:51:42,574
It's almost like
everything that happened

995
00:51:42,576 --> 00:51:45,944
Happened so we could
know it happened.

996
00:51:45,946 --> 00:51:47,078
A-plus.

997
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:50,381
And that idea is called
the anthropic principle,

998
00:51:50,383 --> 00:51:54,119
That everything happened just so
that we could know it happened,

999
00:51:54,121 --> 00:51:57,856
But there's a problem with the
anthropic principle. Ashley...

1000
00:51:57,858 --> 00:52:02,227
What could be wrong
with this idea?

1001
00:52:02,229 --> 00:52:04,929
It assumes we're the end.

1002
00:52:04,931 --> 00:52:06,297
Yes.

1003
00:52:06,299 --> 00:52:08,133
It assumes
we're the reason,

1004
00:52:08,135 --> 00:52:11,469
When really we could just
be amoebas or whatever.

1005
00:52:11,471 --> 00:52:15,540
Simple forms of life were
necessary for us to develop.

1006
00:52:16,642 --> 00:52:18,943
We might be
what's necessary

1007
00:52:18,945 --> 00:52:22,147
For something else
to develop.

1008
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:27,719
And I think I'd like
to end it on that.

1009
00:52:27,721 --> 00:52:31,055
Humanity may be nothing more
than an intermediate step

1010
00:52:31,057 --> 00:52:32,624
In the development
of a consciousness

1011
00:52:32,626 --> 00:52:34,792
A trillion times
greater.

1012
00:52:34,794 --> 00:52:37,795
We already
built it a network,

1013
00:52:37,797 --> 00:52:39,731
Millions of nodes
communicating with each other

1014
00:52:39,733 --> 00:52:41,699
That is called
the Internet.

1015
00:52:41,701 --> 00:52:44,536
And while each node
on its own

1016
00:52:44,538 --> 00:52:46,771
Is nothing more
than a dumb computer,

1017
00:52:46,773 --> 00:52:50,575
Please remember that each of
our individual brain cells

1018
00:52:50,577 --> 00:52:53,378
Is capable
of far, far less.

1019
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:55,079
<i>Terminator,
like skynet.</i>

1020
00:52:55,081 --> 00:52:57,582
<i>Or like the matrix,
like Neo.</i>

1021
00:52:57,584 --> 00:53:00,118
I think it's gonna be
a lot stranger

1022
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:02,820
Than anything we're
capable of imagining.

1023
00:53:02,822 --> 00:53:05,957
Let's just hope that when
it becomes conscious...

1024
00:53:07,493 --> 00:53:09,194
It's nice to us.

1025
00:53:12,531 --> 00:53:14,666
Or it could all just be
a bunch of nonsense.

1026
00:53:14,668 --> 00:53:16,134
All right,
get out of here.

1027
00:53:17,203 --> 00:53:18,870
Have a good day.

1028
00:53:23,542 --> 00:53:25,543
Could I speak to you
for a second?

1029
00:53:25,545 --> 00:53:27,779
You know what?
I'm kind of in a hurry.

1030
00:53:27,781 --> 00:53:29,681
Yeah, but it'll just
take one second.

1031
00:53:29,683 --> 00:53:31,716
No, just come during
office hours, okay?

1032
00:53:31,718 --> 00:53:33,017
But--
all right.

1033
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,354
Okay.

1034
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:52,704
...Baby-sitter Stacy

1035
00:53:52,706 --> 00:53:57,675
Hasn't been answering
her calls.

1036
00:53:57,677 --> 00:53:59,410
I'm really worried
about her,

1037
00:53:59,412 --> 00:54:02,347
Of her getting
killed by smiley.

1038
00:54:03,482 --> 00:54:07,785
And nobody believes me.

1039
00:54:27,606 --> 00:54:28,973
Binder.

1040
00:54:28,975 --> 00:54:30,541
Scared the crap
out of me.

1041
00:54:30,543 --> 00:54:32,577
Don't sneak up
on people like that.

1042
00:54:32,579 --> 00:54:33,578
Oh, sorry.

1043
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:35,179
What are you doing here?

1044
00:54:35,181 --> 00:54:37,515
Oh, I, uh--

1045
00:54:37,517 --> 00:54:38,549
I work here.

1046
00:54:38,551 --> 00:54:40,084
Oh, in the library?
Yeah.

1047
00:54:40,086 --> 00:54:41,519
I manage the
networking databases.

1048
00:54:41,521 --> 00:54:42,987
It's how I pay
for school.

1049
00:54:42,989 --> 00:54:44,222
You're like
a computer genius.

1050
00:54:44,224 --> 00:54:46,057
Uh, yeah, thank you.

1051
00:54:46,059 --> 00:54:48,760
I prefer
the term nerd, but...

1052
00:54:49,561 --> 00:54:51,095
What are you doing?

1053
00:54:51,097 --> 00:54:54,399
You remember saying something
about evil being a force.

1054
00:54:54,401 --> 00:54:56,134
Yeah.

1055
00:54:56,136 --> 00:54:58,936
Did you
mean that literally?

1056
00:55:03,142 --> 00:55:05,143
We're talking about
smiley, right?

1057
00:55:05,145 --> 00:55:07,111
Well, I've been
researching it,

1058
00:55:07,113 --> 00:55:09,647
And I haven't even had time
to get to this part yet--

1059
00:55:09,649 --> 00:55:11,282
Smiley's real.

1060
00:55:12,318 --> 00:55:13,918
What?
How do you know?

1061
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:16,487
I killed someone.

1062
00:55:16,489 --> 00:55:19,924
are you serious?
Ah, that's amazing.

1063
00:55:19,926 --> 00:55:21,192
I mean, that's terrible,
obviously,

1064
00:55:21,194 --> 00:55:23,394
But I tried to do it,
and nothing happened.

1065
00:55:23,396 --> 00:55:24,896
Do you want them to die?

1066
00:55:24,898 --> 00:55:26,731
No. I mean,
I wanted to be right,

1067
00:55:26,733 --> 00:55:28,366
But I didn't want
to kill anybody.

1068
00:55:28,368 --> 00:55:29,834
You have
to really want it.

1069
00:55:29,836 --> 00:55:31,903
You have to really
want them to die.

1070
00:55:31,905 --> 00:55:34,806
But then
he comes after you.

1071
00:55:34,808 --> 00:55:37,508
He tried to kill me.

1072
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:39,510
What did it feel like?

1073
00:55:39,512 --> 00:55:42,780
What do you mean?
It was horrible.

1074
00:55:43,649 --> 00:55:45,783
Wow. Do you know
what this means?

1075
00:55:45,785 --> 00:55:47,752
I mean, I thought
I was crazy, but--

1076
00:55:47,754 --> 00:55:50,021
But if this is true,
if you're not lying,

1077
00:55:50,023 --> 00:55:51,723
Then that means something's
been awakened,

1078
00:55:51,725 --> 00:55:53,024
Like something's
been born,

1079
00:55:53,026 --> 00:55:54,425
Like smiley could be
the next generation--

1080
00:55:54,427 --> 00:55:55,793
Are you not
listening to me?

1081
00:55:56,929 --> 00:55:59,263
Smiley's trying
to kill me.

1082
00:56:00,332 --> 00:56:02,033
You know...

1083
00:56:03,001 --> 00:56:05,303
I thought maybe
you could help.

1084
00:57:32,558 --> 00:57:34,058
What are you doing?! Huh?!

1085
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:36,661
What the--are you
trying to get us killed?!

1086
00:57:36,663 --> 00:57:38,062
I just--
are you crazy?

1087
00:57:38,064 --> 00:57:39,697
No, I just
want it to stop.

1088
00:57:39,699 --> 00:57:41,132
Well, then stop
trying to find out

1089
00:57:41,134 --> 00:57:42,834
What it is, okay?
You're bringing it to us.

1090
00:57:42,836 --> 00:57:44,402
But he won't
leave me alone.

1091
00:57:44,404 --> 00:57:46,671
I don't care!
I don't care.

1092
00:57:46,673 --> 00:57:48,539
You need to stop.

1093
00:57:49,608 --> 00:57:52,043
Crazy bitch.

1094
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:05,890
hi, sweetheart.

1095
00:58:05,892 --> 00:58:07,892
Daddy?

1096
00:58:11,898 --> 00:58:13,831
Proxy.
What are you, crazy?

1097
00:58:13,833 --> 00:58:16,734
No. No, I'm not crazy. I really
didn't mean to. It was smiley.

1098
00:58:16,736 --> 00:58:17,735
Shut up, Ashley.

1099
00:58:17,737 --> 00:58:18,803
He was on the phone.

1100
00:58:18,805 --> 00:58:21,072
I swear he was
on the phone.

1101
00:58:23,675 --> 00:58:25,343
I'm sorry.

1102
00:58:28,547 --> 00:58:30,681
I'm sorry.

1103
00:58:30,683 --> 00:58:34,018
I'm so sorry.

1104
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:37,054
I know I should have
mentioned something before,

1105
00:58:37,056 --> 00:58:39,290
And I know I lied.
I'm just...

1106
00:58:40,893 --> 00:58:43,861
I just don't want
to be crazy like my mom.

1107
00:58:45,031 --> 00:58:47,265
I'm really happy
I can talk to you,

1108
00:58:47,267 --> 00:58:51,002
Because I have
nobody else.

1109
00:58:51,004 --> 00:58:54,405
Do you think you're
a danger to yourself?

1110
00:58:54,407 --> 00:58:55,706
No.

1111
00:58:57,209 --> 00:58:59,744
I don't want to die.

1112
00:58:59,746 --> 00:59:01,612
I don't want
anybody to die.

1113
00:59:01,614 --> 00:59:05,583
I'm gonna need to see
you again tomorrow.

1114
00:59:05,585 --> 00:59:08,519
Between now and then,
I want you to sleep.

1115
00:59:08,521 --> 00:59:11,389
I can't sleep.

1116
00:59:11,391 --> 00:59:13,925
Even the ativan
won't make me.

1117
00:59:13,927 --> 00:59:15,626
I'm gonna give you
a serious tranquilizer.

1118
00:59:15,628 --> 00:59:17,328
I'm only gonna
prescribe one dose,

1119
00:59:17,330 --> 00:59:20,364
And I don't want you to
mix it with the ativan.

1120
00:59:20,366 --> 00:59:21,365
Got it?

1121
00:59:22,834 --> 00:59:25,503
You're presenting
as rational,

1122
00:59:25,505 --> 00:59:29,106
But what you're saying
makes me very concerned.

1123
00:59:29,108 --> 00:59:30,374
The good news

1124
00:59:30,376 --> 00:59:33,010
Is that you know
it doesn't make sense,

1125
00:59:33,012 --> 00:59:35,246
And that's
why you're here.

1126
00:59:36,782 --> 00:59:38,316
Tomorrow, we're
gonna talk about

1127
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:40,518
Checking you in
for another evaluation.

1128
00:59:41,653 --> 00:59:44,221
But I--I don't want
to go for another--

1129
00:59:44,223 --> 00:59:45,957
We talk about it
tomorrow,

1130
00:59:45,959 --> 00:59:48,593
Or we do it today.
Your call.

1131
00:59:51,863 --> 00:59:53,598
Okay.

1132
00:59:57,336 --> 00:59:59,670
Then I'll see you
tomorrow.

1133
01:00:02,708 --> 01:00:04,408
Okay.

1134
01:00:49,688 --> 01:00:51,756
Yeah.

1135
01:00:51,758 --> 01:00:53,224
Ah, Ms. Brooks.

1136
01:00:53,226 --> 01:00:54,458
You here to hand in

1137
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:55,960
Your next four months
of assignments?

1138
01:00:55,962 --> 01:00:57,662
No. I...

1139
01:00:57,664 --> 01:01:00,498
come on.

1140
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,533
So what's up?

1141
01:01:02,535 --> 01:01:06,370
I wanted to know-- you were talking
about in class the other day

1142
01:01:06,372 --> 01:01:07,638
About computers
being conscious.

1143
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,306
Do you think
that's really possible?

1144
01:01:10,308 --> 01:01:11,709
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, why not?

1145
01:01:11,711 --> 01:01:14,545
I--frankly, I think
it's more likely

1146
01:01:14,547 --> 01:01:16,747
That we'll all
just kill each other

1147
01:01:16,749 --> 01:01:18,883
Before something that
interesting occurs, but yeah.

1148
01:01:18,885 --> 01:01:20,551
You mean with
nuclear weapons?

1149
01:01:20,553 --> 01:01:22,420
Or bioweapons
or nanomachines

1150
01:01:22,422 --> 01:01:24,221
Or just plain old
resource depletion

1151
01:01:24,223 --> 01:01:28,092
Until we finally achieve total
extinction of all complex life, yeah.

1152
01:01:28,094 --> 01:01:29,660
But why would we
want to do that?

1153
01:01:29,662 --> 01:01:30,594
Want to do it?

1154
01:01:30,596 --> 01:01:32,296
I don't think
we want to do it

1155
01:01:32,298 --> 01:01:33,831
Any more than
a great white shark

1156
01:01:33,833 --> 01:01:35,099
Wants to be
an apex predator.

1157
01:01:35,101 --> 01:01:36,400
It just does
what it does.

1158
01:01:36,402 --> 01:01:38,703
So you think that humans
are just evil?

1159
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:42,640
Can you keep a secret?

1160
01:01:42,642 --> 01:01:44,041
Yes.

1161
01:01:44,043 --> 01:01:45,376
Okay.

1162
01:01:47,679 --> 01:01:48,779
Hmm?

1163
01:01:48,781 --> 01:01:50,614
No.

1164
01:01:50,616 --> 01:01:52,783
Okay.

1165
01:01:54,152 --> 01:01:55,853
What's the secret?

1166
01:01:58,156 --> 01:02:00,691
I keep whiskey
in the filing cabinet.

1167
01:02:00,693 --> 01:02:02,760
Oh.

1168
01:02:02,762 --> 01:02:04,729
Duh.

1169
01:02:06,164 --> 01:02:08,232
You know, usually students
come to my office,

1170
01:02:08,234 --> 01:02:10,067
And they want to talk
about grades,

1171
01:02:10,069 --> 01:02:11,569
But evil is
far more interesting,

1172
01:02:11,571 --> 01:02:14,405
But I've gotta be honest
with you, Ms. Brooks.

1173
01:02:14,407 --> 01:02:16,774
I'm not sure exactly
where this is going.

1174
01:02:17,943 --> 01:02:20,411
Do you think evil
really exists?

1175
01:02:20,413 --> 01:02:23,247
Yeah. Of course I do.

1176
01:02:23,249 --> 01:02:24,915
Who would deny it?

1177
01:02:24,917 --> 01:02:26,717
Evil is a byproduct
of humanity.

1178
01:02:26,719 --> 01:02:28,886
You--you mean--
I don't understand.

1179
01:02:28,888 --> 01:02:30,187
Like pollution?

1180
01:02:30,189 --> 01:02:32,089
Heh heh. Sure.
Yeah, that's a--

1181
01:02:32,091 --> 01:02:34,358
That's a good way
to put it.

1182
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:37,394
Think about people,
what they do.

1183
01:02:37,396 --> 01:02:41,232
Eh, we're a perfect
planetary suicide machine.

1184
01:02:41,234 --> 01:02:43,134
All we have to do is drive,

1185
01:02:43,136 --> 01:02:46,103
Consume, start a family.

1186
01:02:46,105 --> 01:02:48,739
There's nothing
more effective

1187
01:02:48,741 --> 01:02:49,874
Than human reproduction

1188
01:02:49,876 --> 01:02:52,510
If you want to accelerate
planetary extinction.

1189
01:02:52,512 --> 01:02:55,012
You don't even have to do
anything spectacular

1190
01:02:55,014 --> 01:02:59,283
To play a meaningful role in the grand
human project of ending the world.

1191
01:03:00,352 --> 01:03:02,987
And if you play your part
better than others

1192
01:03:02,989 --> 01:03:05,956
By inventing
some new weapons system

1193
01:03:05,958 --> 01:03:10,060
Or a more efficient way of
extracting resource material,

1194
01:03:10,062 --> 01:03:14,999
Just so you can suck everything
out of the planet before we go--

1195
01:03:15,001 --> 01:03:17,101
I don't know.

1196
01:03:17,103 --> 01:03:20,671
Do you think
that that is evil?

1197
01:03:20,673 --> 01:03:23,707
It's just doing
what we do.

1198
01:03:23,709 --> 01:03:25,576
Isn't it?

1199
01:03:31,249 --> 01:03:34,385
We're rats on a ship,

1200
01:03:34,387 --> 01:03:36,754
Ants on an ice-cream cone.

1201
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:40,925
We're just going along
for the ride.

1202
01:03:43,061 --> 01:03:45,596
Everything's gonna end.

1203
01:03:45,598 --> 01:03:49,333
I think
the real question is

1204
01:03:49,335 --> 01:03:51,969
Is it gonna end
with a bang

1205
01:03:51,971 --> 01:03:55,139
Or eliot's whimper?

1206
01:03:55,141 --> 01:03:58,809
And, uh, in the meanwhile...

1207
01:04:06,318 --> 01:04:08,285
It just doesn't matter.

1208
01:04:10,188 --> 01:04:12,690
What is it
that the kids say?

1209
01:04:13,992 --> 01:04:18,996
Uh, it's the perfect
expression of nihilism.

1210
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:23,534
Hmm?

1211
01:04:23,536 --> 01:04:25,903
You know what
I'm talking about.

1212
01:04:25,905 --> 01:04:28,339
No?

1213
01:04:28,341 --> 01:04:31,542
What is it?

1214
01:04:31,544 --> 01:04:33,477
"I did it for the..."

1215
01:04:36,147 --> 01:04:38,315
"I did it for the lulz"?

1216
01:04:38,317 --> 01:04:40,885
Yeah. That's it.

1217
01:04:40,887 --> 01:04:44,355
"I did it for the lulz."

1218
01:04:44,357 --> 01:04:47,291
It's got a nice sound,

1219
01:04:47,293 --> 01:04:48,792
Doesn't it?

1220
01:04:50,195 --> 01:04:52,029
Lulz.

1221
01:04:56,701 --> 01:04:59,737
Is that why
you're here, Ashley?

1222
01:04:59,739 --> 01:05:04,608
Do you want to do
something for the lulz?

1223
01:05:06,645 --> 01:05:08,312
I should go.

1224
01:05:08,314 --> 01:05:10,381
Go. Stay.

1225
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:14,051
You know
my point of view.

1226
01:05:16,888 --> 01:05:18,355
I just don't care.

1227
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,360
Man: Ashley.

1228
01:06:09,342 --> 01:06:11,542
Man: Ashley, I'm here.

1229
01:06:11,544 --> 01:06:12,810
I'm inside your head.

1230
01:06:22,354 --> 01:06:24,855
Over here.

1231
01:06:30,663 --> 01:06:33,564
I'm not scared of you.
Just shut up.

1232
01:06:33,566 --> 01:06:35,532
Shut up. Just shut up.

1233
01:06:35,534 --> 01:06:37,634
Fuck you.
I'm not scared of you.

1234
01:06:37,636 --> 01:06:40,004
Fuck you!
Fuck you! Fuck you!

1235
01:06:40,006 --> 01:06:43,140
Fuck--aah! Shut up!

1236
01:06:43,142 --> 01:06:44,141
Aah!

1237
01:07:05,997 --> 01:07:09,433
What the fuck are you
looking at? Huh?!

1238
01:07:09,435 --> 01:07:11,502
Huh?!

1239
01:08:19,971 --> 01:08:21,572
No.

1240
01:09:33,077 --> 01:09:34,912
Ashley.

1241
01:09:40,118 --> 01:09:41,285
Mom?

1242
01:09:49,428 --> 01:09:53,363
Oh, what's
happening?

1243
01:09:53,365 --> 01:09:55,098
Ow. I think
you broke my nose.

1244
01:09:56,434 --> 01:09:57,935
Am I dreaming?

1245
01:09:57,937 --> 01:10:00,704
Uh, does it look
like you're dreaming?

1246
01:10:03,308 --> 01:10:04,908
No.

1247
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:06,810
This seems
pretty real.

1248
01:10:06,812 --> 01:10:08,011
That's 'cause it is.

1249
01:10:08,013 --> 01:10:10,380
My nose is broken
in a pretty real way.

1250
01:10:10,382 --> 01:10:11,982
Gotta go get a towel.

1251
01:10:21,226 --> 01:10:23,727
Sorry about your nose

1252
01:10:23,729 --> 01:10:26,463
And being just insane.

1253
01:10:26,465 --> 01:10:27,931
That's okay.

1254
01:10:27,933 --> 01:10:30,234
And I'm sorry
that I yelled.

1255
01:10:30,236 --> 01:10:31,768
You're not insane.

1256
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:34,504
I know
you're just scared.

1257
01:10:34,506 --> 01:10:38,842
Oh. Zane and I,
we had sex,

1258
01:10:38,844 --> 01:10:42,746
And then he split right
before you started screaming.

1259
01:10:44,048 --> 01:10:46,383
I seriously
can't take this anymore.

1260
01:10:48,019 --> 01:10:52,522
I mean, is this real,
or am I just going crazy?

1261
01:10:52,524 --> 01:10:54,658
I think both, dude.

1262
01:10:59,864 --> 01:11:02,032
Who are you calling?

1263
01:11:02,034 --> 01:11:04,301
It's 4:00
in the morning.

1264
01:11:04,303 --> 01:11:05,302
They're open.

1265
01:11:09,407 --> 01:11:10,641
Operator:
911 emergency.

1266
01:11:10,643 --> 01:11:14,111
Hi. I'd like
to report a murder.

1267
01:11:20,885 --> 01:11:23,086
Could I have
some more coffee?

1268
01:11:24,622 --> 01:11:26,623
Sure.

1269
01:11:26,625 --> 01:11:28,125
You want me
to make this run?

1270
01:11:28,127 --> 01:11:30,327
Ah, I got it.
I need another cup, too.

1271
01:11:33,197 --> 01:11:35,666
All right, let's
go over this again.

1272
01:11:35,668 --> 01:11:36,900
Okay.

1273
01:11:38,169 --> 01:11:40,904
Now, you called in
to report a murder,

1274
01:11:40,906 --> 01:11:43,206
Maybe two, you don't know.

1275
01:11:43,208 --> 01:11:44,474
I do know.

1276
01:11:44,476 --> 01:11:45,876
Definitely
several murders.

1277
01:11:45,878 --> 01:11:47,778
I witnessed
at least two.

1278
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:49,613
On video.

1279
01:11:49,615 --> 01:11:51,615
And you say that
both of these murder--

1280
01:11:51,617 --> 01:11:54,184
Well, all these murders
were performed

1281
01:11:54,186 --> 01:11:56,486
By the same guy,
the same person,

1282
01:11:56,488 --> 01:11:59,022
This, uh, smiley.

1283
01:11:59,857 --> 01:12:01,024
Okay. Well, just so--

1284
01:12:01,026 --> 01:12:03,727
Just so we
get this straight...

1285
01:12:05,697 --> 01:12:07,664
Smiley appears
behind people

1286
01:12:07,666 --> 01:12:09,933
In an anonymous
video chat,

1287
01:12:09,935 --> 01:12:13,103
Like from out of
cyberspace or something,

1288
01:12:13,105 --> 01:12:15,806
When the other person
types in, uh,

1289
01:12:15,808 --> 01:12:19,810
"I did it for the lulz. I did it for the lulz.
I did it for the lulz."

1290
01:12:19,812 --> 01:12:23,246
Yes. I told you,
I know it sounds crazy.

1291
01:12:24,649 --> 01:12:28,585
But, I mean,
it happened.

1292
01:12:28,587 --> 01:12:30,520
Hmm. Yeah.

1293
01:12:30,522 --> 01:12:33,623
And he--he chased me
across campus,

1294
01:12:33,625 --> 01:12:35,892
And then he
tried to kill me.

1295
01:12:35,894 --> 01:12:37,728
And then you woke up.

1296
01:12:37,730 --> 01:12:39,763
But I must have
blacked out.

1297
01:12:39,765 --> 01:12:41,798
Maybe he did
something to me.

1298
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,301
I'm gonna
tell you the part

1299
01:12:44,303 --> 01:12:45,802
I'm having
a hard time with.

1300
01:12:45,804 --> 01:12:47,871
All of it.

1301
01:12:49,107 --> 01:12:50,006
But...

1302
01:12:50,008 --> 01:12:52,242
Look, look, look.
Listen. Listen.

1303
01:12:52,244 --> 01:12:54,711
Just hear me out.
This is what it looks like

1304
01:12:54,713 --> 01:12:56,880
From my perspective
as a police detective.

1305
01:12:58,116 --> 01:13:02,686
First of all,
you have no victim.

1306
01:13:02,688 --> 01:13:03,987
But we do
have victims.

1307
01:13:03,989 --> 01:13:05,722
But there are no bodies.

1308
01:13:05,724 --> 01:13:07,791
You say you saw
dead people,

1309
01:13:07,793 --> 01:13:09,993
But you don't know
who they are,

1310
01:13:09,995 --> 01:13:13,430
Except for some nicknames
that, uh, nobody can trace.

1311
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:19,002
It is very difficult
to investigate a crime

1312
01:13:19,004 --> 01:13:22,973
When it's not very clear
that any crime has been done.

1313
01:13:22,975 --> 01:13:26,543
You haven't found
a single body?

1314
01:13:26,545 --> 01:13:28,578
We find bodies
all the time.

1315
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:31,248
We just haven't found one that fit
the description that you gave.

1316
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:33,617
And nobody's
called in about smiley?

1317
01:13:33,619 --> 01:13:36,553
No, we've had a few calls
about this smiley character,

1318
01:13:36,555 --> 01:13:39,222
But yours is the first one
that we've taken

1319
01:13:39,224 --> 01:13:41,258
Seriously enough
to have this talk.

1320
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:45,028
Now, you look like
a nice girl

1321
01:13:45,030 --> 01:13:47,297
That nobody
would want to hurt,

1322
01:13:47,299 --> 01:13:50,367
So I gotta ask you.

1323
01:13:52,236 --> 01:13:55,539
Are you on the wrong end
of some kind of prank?

1324
01:13:55,541 --> 01:13:56,540
You been punk'd?

1325
01:13:56,542 --> 01:13:58,008
No!

1326
01:13:58,010 --> 01:13:59,709
Why won't you
believe me?

1327
01:13:59,711 --> 01:14:05,015
Look, I'll show you
everything I'm talking about.

1328
01:14:05,017 --> 01:14:06,283
You're welcome.

1329
01:14:07,218 --> 01:14:09,519
Let me show you
something first.

1330
01:14:09,521 --> 01:14:10,921
Coop.

1331
01:14:19,864 --> 01:14:21,031
How did you get that?

1332
01:14:21,033 --> 01:14:22,732
How did we get it?

1333
01:14:22,734 --> 01:14:24,367
I think pretty much
everybody got it.

1334
01:14:24,369 --> 01:14:26,436
Over 5 million views
since yesterday.

1335
01:14:26,438 --> 01:14:29,873
Maybe he took it.
Maybe he took it.

1336
01:14:29,875 --> 01:14:33,543
We have to take allegations like
the one you called in seriously,

1337
01:14:33,545 --> 01:14:37,280
So we're not gonna press charges
against you for wasting our time.

1338
01:14:38,649 --> 01:14:40,050
If you believe
everything

1339
01:14:40,052 --> 01:14:43,053
That you
told us tonight,

1340
01:14:43,055 --> 01:14:47,324
Please, please,

1341
01:14:47,326 --> 01:14:49,159
You need to see
a psychiatrist.

1342
01:14:49,161 --> 01:14:52,529
I am seeing
a psychiatrist.

1343
01:14:53,831 --> 01:14:56,733
I am.

1344
01:14:56,735 --> 01:14:58,969
Well, that's too bad.

1345
01:14:58,971 --> 01:15:01,605
Uhh! This is bullshit!

1346
01:15:01,607 --> 01:15:03,940
Well, at least my nose isn't broken.
I guess that's good news.

1347
01:15:03,942 --> 01:15:06,042
Proxy, they didn't
believe any of it.

1348
01:15:06,044 --> 01:15:07,544
How can everything
just be gone?

1349
01:15:07,546 --> 01:15:08,545
I don't know.

1350
01:15:08,547 --> 01:15:09,813
Okay, we did
the same thing

1351
01:15:09,815 --> 01:15:12,349
In my interview room, and
I just-- I don't know.

1352
01:15:12,351 --> 01:15:15,952
It's just weird. He--it--okay,
whatever smiley is,

1353
01:15:15,954 --> 01:15:18,889
He's just
playing with us.

1354
01:15:18,891 --> 01:15:22,926
But how can you erase everything
over the whole Internet?

1355
01:15:22,928 --> 01:15:24,628
You can't.

1356
01:15:26,497 --> 01:15:29,332
Not if you're human.

1357
01:15:37,208 --> 01:15:39,543
I promise
I'm feeling better.

1358
01:15:39,545 --> 01:15:44,648
And it's not like I'm saying
yesterday I was crazy

1359
01:15:44,650 --> 01:15:46,283
And today I'm not.

1360
01:15:46,285 --> 01:15:49,052
I still believe
everything I said,

1361
01:15:49,054 --> 01:15:52,556
But it was just really weird
at the police station.

1362
01:15:52,558 --> 01:15:54,090
And?

1363
01:15:55,293 --> 01:15:57,994
Look, I'm not there yet,

1364
01:15:57,996 --> 01:16:00,964
But maybe I've
been having trouble

1365
01:16:00,966 --> 01:16:02,966
With what's real
and what's not.

1366
01:16:02,968 --> 01:16:05,035
Good.

1367
01:16:05,037 --> 01:16:06,970
Is it bad?

1368
01:16:06,972 --> 01:16:09,706
Acknowledging it
is good.

1369
01:16:09,708 --> 01:16:11,408
That's a scary thing to do,

1370
01:16:11,410 --> 01:16:14,444
Admit that your perceptions are in
conflict with objective reality,

1371
01:16:14,446 --> 01:16:18,582
And it's the first step to bringing
them in line with each other.

1372
01:16:18,584 --> 01:16:21,117
Are you sure?

1373
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:24,754
Trust me. This is good.

1374
01:16:40,004 --> 01:16:42,205
Ashley: Thanks so much
for doing this.

1375
01:16:42,207 --> 01:16:44,975
Hey, being a total nerd is
good for something, right?

1376
01:16:44,977 --> 01:16:46,743
You're not a nerd.

1377
01:16:46,745 --> 01:16:50,080
And it's so awesome that you
gave me your old computer.

1378
01:16:50,082 --> 01:16:51,915
Ah, well,
that's what friends do.

1379
01:16:51,917 --> 01:16:53,750
You didn't
have to do that.

1380
01:16:53,752 --> 01:16:56,720
I know,
but I wanted to.

1381
01:16:58,389 --> 01:17:02,492
So not to be
any nerdier than usual,

1382
01:17:02,494 --> 01:17:05,061
But this computer is
fully equipped, okay?

1383
01:17:05,063 --> 01:17:07,597
It has your own firewall,
128-bit encryption

1384
01:17:07,599 --> 01:17:08,865
And a 256-bit key.

1385
01:17:10,502 --> 01:17:12,969
I don't know
what you just said,

1386
01:17:12,971 --> 01:17:15,338
But sounds good.

1387
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:17,607
Okay,
this is the dungeon.

1388
01:17:17,609 --> 01:17:20,276
I am the dungeon master.

1389
01:17:20,278 --> 01:17:23,513
This is the dungeon
master's key.

1390
01:17:23,515 --> 01:17:26,282
Why, thank you,
dungeon master.

1391
01:17:26,284 --> 01:17:28,785
You're welcome,
princess.

1392
01:17:28,787 --> 01:17:31,488
Unfortunately
the dungeon master

1393
01:17:31,490 --> 01:17:33,156
Never gets
the princess.

1394
01:17:36,827 --> 01:17:38,561
Sometimes they do.

1395
01:17:59,850 --> 01:18:01,384
Whoa!

1396
01:18:01,386 --> 01:18:02,852
Ohh!

1397
01:18:02,854 --> 01:18:04,454
Heh. You crazy kids.

1398
01:18:04,456 --> 01:18:06,423
hi.

1399
01:18:06,425 --> 01:18:08,058
So you're sure
you're cool with me

1400
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:09,392
Going to my parents'
for the weekend?

1401
01:18:09,394 --> 01:18:11,027
I just--I really
gotta clear my head.

1402
01:18:11,029 --> 01:18:12,762
Yeah, totally.

1403
01:18:16,033 --> 01:18:19,636
Oh. Okay, well, uh,
I should probably go,

1404
01:18:19,638 --> 01:18:22,172
So see you later?

1405
01:18:23,874 --> 01:18:25,575
Bye, dungeon master.

1406
01:18:29,847 --> 01:18:31,981
Dungeon master?

1407
01:18:31,983 --> 01:18:33,083
that's kinky.

1408
01:18:33,085 --> 01:18:34,984
Not like that.

1409
01:18:34,986 --> 01:18:37,587
The nerd kind
of dungeon master.

1410
01:18:37,589 --> 01:18:38,588
Yeah.

1411
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:39,456
He's sweet.

1412
01:18:39,458 --> 01:18:41,224
Whatever.
No judging here.

1413
01:18:41,226 --> 01:18:43,927
There are handcuffs in my
underwear drawer if you need 'em.

1414
01:18:43,929 --> 01:18:45,228
If you need me,
call me.

1415
01:18:45,230 --> 01:18:46,396
Otherwise, I don't know.
We could just,

1416
01:18:46,398 --> 01:18:48,631
Like, video chat
the whole time.

1417
01:18:48,633 --> 01:18:50,200
Okay.

1418
01:18:51,802 --> 01:18:53,169
You'll be fine.

1419
01:18:53,171 --> 01:18:55,271
I know.
I'll talk to you?

1420
01:18:55,273 --> 01:18:56,339
Text me.
Okay.

1421
01:18:56,341 --> 01:18:58,074
Okay.
Have a good weekend.

1422
01:18:58,076 --> 01:18:59,075
Yeah, have fun.

1423
01:18:59,077 --> 01:19:01,911
so much fun. Bye.

1424
01:19:08,586 --> 01:19:11,988
Heh. Yes, really,
daddy, I'm fine.

1425
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:13,823
Okay, sweetheart.

1426
01:19:13,825 --> 01:19:16,593
You know you can always call
me if you need me, right?

1427
01:19:16,595 --> 01:19:18,828
Yes, I know.

1428
01:19:18,830 --> 01:19:20,196
I love you.

1429
01:19:20,198 --> 01:19:23,433
I love you back. Heh.

1430
01:19:32,076 --> 01:19:33,409
Oh, my God.
Thank God you're there.

1431
01:19:33,411 --> 01:19:35,378
Hey, what's up?
Are you okay?

1432
01:19:35,380 --> 01:19:36,813
I can't find Zane.

1433
01:19:36,815 --> 01:19:38,148
Zane?
Yeah.

1434
01:19:38,150 --> 01:19:41,584
Um, we were gonna
do stuff on video chat.

1435
01:19:41,586 --> 01:19:43,920
It's the only thing
he's never late for.

1436
01:19:46,091 --> 01:19:48,691
What? What, you think he's
hooking up with some other slut?

1437
01:19:48,693 --> 01:19:51,261
Mm, or...

1438
01:19:51,263 --> 01:19:53,496
Oh, my God.

1439
01:19:53,498 --> 01:19:54,464
Smiley?

1440
01:19:54,466 --> 01:19:55,965
I'm gonna call the cops.

1441
01:19:55,967 --> 01:19:57,700
No. I'll go.

1442
01:19:57,702 --> 01:19:59,269
No, you can't go
by yourself.

1443
01:19:59,271 --> 01:20:01,137
Binder will
come with me.

1444
01:20:01,139 --> 01:20:02,505
Uh, okay, fine, fine.

1445
01:20:02,507 --> 01:20:04,874
Okay, fine. Yeah,
I guess if he goes with you.

1446
01:20:04,876 --> 01:20:07,143
Okay, stay online. I'll make
sure everything's okay.

1447
01:20:07,145 --> 01:20:08,578
Be careful!

1448
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:09,946
Yeah. Bye.

1449
01:20:11,515 --> 01:20:13,716
Hey, you've reached
binder's voice mail.

1450
01:20:13,718 --> 01:20:14,851
Leave me a message.

1451
01:20:14,853 --> 01:20:17,187
Hey, binder. It's Ashley.

1452
01:20:17,189 --> 01:20:19,355
Could you give me
a call when you get this?

1453
01:20:19,357 --> 01:20:21,724
Proxy just called me,
and Zane's not, um--

1454
01:20:21,726 --> 01:20:24,227
Just call me when you
get this, okay?

1455
01:20:39,643 --> 01:20:41,611
Zane!

1456
01:20:48,485 --> 01:20:50,320
Hello?

1457
01:20:50,322 --> 01:20:52,188
Are you here?

1458
01:20:58,662 --> 01:21:00,330
Hello?

1459
01:21:04,735 --> 01:21:07,003
Zane?

1460
01:22:19,643 --> 01:22:21,010
Ashley.

1461
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:25,348
Ashley.

1462
01:22:26,417 --> 01:22:28,284
Ashley. Ashley.

1463
01:22:28,286 --> 01:22:30,119
Ashley. Ashley.
No!

1464
01:22:30,121 --> 01:22:32,956
Ashley. Ashley.

1465
01:22:45,936 --> 01:22:46,936
This is diamond.

1466
01:22:46,938 --> 01:22:48,304
You have to help me.

1467
01:22:48,306 --> 01:22:49,372
Zane's dead.

1468
01:22:49,374 --> 01:22:51,908
I'm sorry. Who is this?

1469
01:22:51,910 --> 01:22:52,842
Ashley. Ashley Brooks.

1470
01:22:52,844 --> 01:22:55,244
I called you about
the serial killer.

1471
01:22:55,246 --> 01:22:57,513
Ah, Ms. Brooks. Heh heh.

1472
01:22:57,515 --> 01:23:01,818
Is this another one of your
friends from cyberspace?

1473
01:23:01,820 --> 01:23:03,553
Yes.

1474
01:23:03,555 --> 01:23:06,189
He's dead. I saw the
body in person.

1475
01:23:06,191 --> 01:23:07,290
Ms. Brooks.

1476
01:23:07,292 --> 01:23:08,391
Hello?

1477
01:23:09,594 --> 01:23:11,694
She dropped the call.

1478
01:23:11,696 --> 01:23:14,397
I'm sure
she'll call back.

1479
01:23:15,532 --> 01:23:18,101
Wha--did you just
hang up on me?

1480
01:23:18,103 --> 01:23:20,503
Fucking crackpots.

1481
01:23:20,505 --> 01:23:22,972
What the fuck?

1482
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:31,514
Proxy: Ashley?
Proxy!

1483
01:23:31,516 --> 01:23:32,882
Ashley. Ashley,
what's going on?

1484
01:23:32,884 --> 01:23:34,484
Zane's dead.
Oh, my God.

1485
01:23:34,486 --> 01:23:36,452
Smiley cut off his face.
Oh, my God, Ashley.

1486
01:23:36,454 --> 01:23:37,553
There's blood
everywhere.

1487
01:23:37,555 --> 01:23:39,989
Call the police.
Call 911. 911.

1488
01:23:41,158 --> 01:23:42,291
No.

1489
01:23:42,293 --> 01:23:44,027
No?

1490
01:23:45,462 --> 01:23:48,064
This has to stop now.

1491
01:23:48,066 --> 01:23:50,333
Oh, my God. No, no, no.

1492
01:23:50,335 --> 01:23:51,334
Ashley, no.

1493
01:23:51,336 --> 01:23:52,335
Do it.

1494
01:23:52,337 --> 01:23:53,803
No. You can't.

1495
01:24:03,814 --> 01:24:06,649
Come on. Do it
before I change my mind.

1496
01:24:08,952 --> 01:24:10,987
Fuck.

1497
01:24:10,989 --> 01:24:12,522
Are you sure?

1498
01:24:13,524 --> 01:24:16,426
You have to mean it,
proxy.

1499
01:24:16,428 --> 01:24:18,861
You have to picture him
killing me.

1500
01:25:26,029 --> 01:25:27,763
Oh, my God. Binder.

1501
01:25:27,765 --> 01:25:30,967
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

1502
01:25:30,969 --> 01:25:33,803
I'm so sorry. I really didn't
mean to do this to you.

1503
01:25:33,805 --> 01:25:36,172
It was an accident.
I promise.

1504
01:25:36,174 --> 01:25:37,807
It was an accident.

1505
01:25:37,809 --> 01:25:39,675
You're gonna be fine.

1506
01:25:39,677 --> 01:25:41,544
You're gonna be fine,
okay. Just breathe.

1507
01:26:25,389 --> 01:26:27,356
What the...

1508
01:26:48,879 --> 01:26:52,882
Clayton: What brings people
to do the things they do?

1509
01:26:52,884 --> 01:26:57,153
Reason and ethics can
explain some of man's motives,

1510
01:26:57,155 --> 01:26:59,722
But only some.

1511
01:27:01,024 --> 01:27:04,727
We all have the capacity
to commit the most...

1512
01:27:04,729 --> 01:27:08,831
Vicious of acts,
the cruelest of atrocities,

1513
01:27:08,833 --> 01:27:13,135
To do something
simply because we can.

1514
01:27:13,137 --> 01:27:18,140
But what prevents us
from doing the unthinkable?

1515
01:27:18,142 --> 01:27:21,744
From crossing over from
the light and into the dark?

1516
01:27:22,713 --> 01:27:26,716
Every community
lives by a moral code,

1517
01:27:26,718 --> 01:27:28,918
And when that code
is broken,

1518
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:34,190
We're led to believe that a force has
been unleashed onto the universe...

1519
01:27:35,993 --> 01:27:38,194
A score needed to be settled...

1520
01:27:39,763 --> 01:27:41,497
A bounty to be collected.

1521
01:27:41,499 --> 01:27:46,135
Of course,
we can never know for sure

1522
01:27:46,137 --> 01:27:49,438
The consequences
of our actions.

1523
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:52,975
But one thing we know for sure

1524
01:27:52,977 --> 01:27:56,746
Is that our actions
will have consequences.

1525
01:27:58,148 --> 01:28:02,218
And in the struggle
between good and evil...

1526
01:28:03,987 --> 01:28:06,922
We'll never know
who has the last laugh.

1527
01:28:11,662 --> 01:28:14,230
Oh, my God.
Holy shit.

1528
01:28:14,232 --> 01:28:15,564
Ohh.

1529
01:28:15,566 --> 01:28:19,001
Boys, we fucking
did it.

1530
01:28:19,003 --> 01:28:21,103
Dude, that bitch
went fucking splat.

1531
01:28:21,105 --> 01:28:23,172
Yeah, I gotta
instagram that.

1532
01:28:24,741 --> 01:28:26,776
Woman:
Guys, what happened?

1533
01:28:26,778 --> 01:28:28,711
We didn't even
get to come out.

1534
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:32,281
Our noob fell

1535
01:28:32,283 --> 01:28:34,183
And broke her neck.

1536
01:28:34,185 --> 01:28:35,251
She's dead.

1537
01:28:37,221 --> 01:28:40,189
Oh, my God.

1538
01:28:41,426 --> 01:28:44,026
That's awesome.

1539
01:28:44,028 --> 01:28:45,461
Oh, shit.

1540
01:28:45,463 --> 01:28:47,563
We have to get
out of here.

1541
01:28:47,565 --> 01:28:48,764
Oh, relax.
We're fine.

1542
01:28:48,766 --> 01:28:51,133
Proxy: Oh, my God! Ashley!

1543
01:28:51,135 --> 01:28:52,501
Ashley!
What's going on?!

1544
01:28:52,503 --> 01:28:55,771
Oh, my God.
Shut up, you whore.

1545
01:28:55,773 --> 01:28:56,906
It's over.

1546
01:28:56,908 --> 01:28:58,207
What do you mean
it's over?

1547
01:28:58,209 --> 01:29:00,910
She fell on her head,
and now she's dead.

1548
01:29:00,912 --> 01:29:02,545
Oh. That rhymed.

1549
01:29:02,547 --> 01:29:04,280
Oh, my God.

1550
01:29:06,783 --> 01:29:09,552
That's fantastic!

1551
01:29:09,554 --> 01:29:11,087
Hey, uh, Daniel day-Lewis,

1552
01:29:11,089 --> 01:29:13,522
Your girlfriend just landed a
triple lindy on her brain.

1553
01:29:13,524 --> 01:29:15,391
What up?

1554
01:29:15,393 --> 01:29:17,126
Ah, and I didn't even
get to fuck her?

1555
01:29:17,128 --> 01:29:19,362
Ah, well, she's not
going anywhere.

1556
01:29:19,364 --> 01:29:21,530
You're right. Hmm.

1557
01:29:21,532 --> 01:29:24,834
Oh, and, uh, by the way, good
call on the double kill.

1558
01:29:24,836 --> 01:29:27,236
I really thought I cut
you up there for a sec.

1559
01:29:27,238 --> 01:29:29,071
Ah, well, you know,
a little latex

1560
01:29:29,073 --> 01:29:31,273
And corn syrup
goes a long way.

1561
01:29:32,543 --> 01:29:34,577
Wait. Did Ashley
do it on purpose,

1562
01:29:34,579 --> 01:29:35,845
Or it was
an accident?

1563
01:29:35,847 --> 01:29:37,279
It was
an accident,

1564
01:29:37,281 --> 01:29:38,981
But we're still calling
it a win for anonymous.

1565
01:29:38,983 --> 01:29:40,182
Whoo!
Uh, not sure

1566
01:29:40,184 --> 01:29:42,918
Our hacktivist branch
will condone this.

1567
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:44,387
Okay, you know what?

1568
01:29:44,389 --> 01:29:45,855
Fuck those guys.

1569
01:29:45,857 --> 01:29:48,624
They don't get to say who's
anonymous and who's not.

1570
01:29:48,626 --> 01:29:49,959
The troll army?

1571
01:29:49,961 --> 01:29:51,894
They don't have any
command or control.

1572
01:29:51,896 --> 01:29:53,929
I mean, they say
we're off message?

1573
01:29:53,931 --> 01:29:55,531
No, fuck them.
They're off message.

1574
01:29:55,533 --> 01:29:59,001
Because, I mean, there's
only one reason to troll.

1575
01:30:00,537 --> 01:30:01,804
For the lulz.

1576
01:30:01,806 --> 01:30:03,906
For the lulz!
For the lulz!

1577
01:30:03,908 --> 01:30:05,107
Amen, brother.

1578
01:30:05,109 --> 01:30:07,143
Well, now that
she's dead,

1579
01:30:07,145 --> 01:30:09,044
I guess smiley's
dead, too, right?

1580
01:30:09,046 --> 01:30:10,479
Heh. God,
you know what, kells?

1581
01:30:10,481 --> 01:30:12,548
I'm really glad we
killed you off early,

1582
01:30:12,550 --> 01:30:14,817
'cause I feel like you
just don't get it.

1583
01:30:14,819 --> 01:30:16,085
You see,
smiley's not dead.

1584
01:30:16,087 --> 01:30:17,520
Smiley is immortal.

1585
01:30:17,522 --> 01:30:20,222
Smiley'll be around
longer than any of us.

1586
01:30:20,224 --> 01:30:22,458
You know, he's like
the pyramids

1587
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:25,461
Or the great work
of William Shakespeare.

1588
01:30:25,463 --> 01:30:27,229
<i>He's chocolate rain.</i>

1589
01:30:28,766 --> 01:30:30,099
And these masks,

1590
01:30:30,101 --> 01:30:32,768
They're in boxes
all over campus

1591
01:30:32,770 --> 01:30:35,571
And about
20 other campuses.

1592
01:30:35,573 --> 01:30:40,476
It's only a matter of time before
the copycats start rolling in.

1593
01:30:40,478 --> 01:30:42,411
Smiley can be anyone

1594
01:30:42,413 --> 01:30:45,347
Anywhere
at any time.

1595
01:30:46,184 --> 01:30:49,151
The first viral
serial killer.

1596
01:30:49,153 --> 01:30:50,686
Oh, God,
something tells me

1597
01:30:50,688 --> 01:30:53,122
Smiley's gonna be really
popular this Halloween.

1598
01:30:53,124 --> 01:30:54,657
Ah, it's gonna
be historic.

1599
01:30:54,659 --> 01:30:57,259
People are gonna be speaking
our names for generations.

1600
01:30:57,261 --> 01:31:01,297
Except they don't actually
know our names, right?

1601
01:31:01,299 --> 01:31:02,331
You know what?

1602
01:31:02,333 --> 01:31:03,699
That part's actually
really important.

1603
01:31:03,701 --> 01:31:05,100
We should probably
get our shit

1604
01:31:05,102 --> 01:31:07,069
And get the fuck
out of here.

1605
01:31:14,478 --> 01:31:16,679
I kind of have a boner.

1606
01:31:16,681 --> 01:31:17,813
Is that weird?

1607
01:31:17,815 --> 01:31:20,916
Look, Zane, um,
is she really dead?

1608
01:31:20,918 --> 01:31:22,918
Uh, yeah.

1609
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:27,656
She's really,
really, really dead.

1610
01:31:27,658 --> 01:31:29,992
Are we bad people?

1611
01:31:30,794 --> 01:31:32,228
Yeah.

1612
01:31:33,663 --> 01:31:36,031
Why did we do this?
Seriously?

1613
01:31:36,033 --> 01:31:38,968
Oh, well, I don't know
why you did it,

1614
01:31:38,970 --> 01:31:41,537
But I know why I did it.

1615
01:31:47,077 --> 01:31:49,545
That's not funny,
Zane.

1616
01:31:50,548 --> 01:31:52,014
We really
killed her.

1617
01:31:52,016 --> 01:31:54,517
Oh, come on.
She killed herself.

1618
01:31:54,519 --> 01:31:56,151
Yeah.

1619
01:31:56,153 --> 01:31:57,720
Proxy!

1620
01:32:08,265 --> 01:32:09,999
Holy shit.
