1
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:57,639
Mortal Kombat is not about death...

2
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:00,642
...but rather the preservation of life.

3
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:04,772
Liu Kang and a few chosen fighters
from the Earthrealm...

4
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:07,649
...defeated Outworld sorcerer
Shang Tsung.

5
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,986
According to rules of Mortal Kombat...

6
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:15,991
...their victory preserved the safety
of the Earth for one more generation.

7
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,203
Our chosen ones were returned
to Liu Kang's home on Earth...

8
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,498
...only to enjoy a brief period of peace.

9
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:29,171
For someone from Outworld
has a different point of view.

10
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,712
Shao-Kahn, emperor of Outworld.

11
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:56,091
The Earth was created in six days...

12
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,803
...so too shalI it be destroyed.

13
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,055
And on the seventh day...

14
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:06,768
...mankind will rest in peace!

15
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,232
This is not good.

16
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,943
Somehow,
he's opened gateways to your world.

17
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:18,238
I thought our victory in MortaI Kombat
closed those portals.

18
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:21,116
- What closes can open again.
- What's that supposed to mean?

19
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,958
Mother.

20
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:35,964
- You're alive.
- Too bad you will die.

21
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,858
As long as I have the power, Kahn,
you will never rule this world.

22
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,819
As long as the portal remains open...

23
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,988
...your world becomes my world.

24
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:21,802
You will never win.

25
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,752
Master.

26
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:10,726
This ends now.

27
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,019
You hide behind a human?

28
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,938
Why not, Lord Rayden?

29
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,733
You hid behind them
your entire pathetic life.

30
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:23,071
- Aah!
- No, Johnny!

31
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,796
Surrender, Rayden, or this one dies.

32
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,383
Then I will take your generals.

33
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,428
Because Earth does not bend
to the will of tyrants.

34
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:51,058
You who would never let one
of your precious humans die.

35
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,151
Trade me for Johnny Cage.

36
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,946
Come bow at my feet.

37
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:10,285
You fool.

38
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,787
Johnny!

39
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:34,142
In six days, you will all bow to me!

40
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,979
It has begun!

41
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:05,048
- We can't let Kahn get away with this.
- This is not a fight we can win.

42
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,383
Annihilate them.

43
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,932
We must go.

44
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,822
Move back.

45
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,370
Kahn has opened the portal.

46
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,500
Your planet and Outworld
have begun to merge into one realm.

47
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,419
Think of it as hell on Earth.

48
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,886
My mother, resurrected.

49
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,554
How is that possible?

50
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,682
If I'm correct, your mother, SindeI,
is the key to alI of this.

51
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,934
This can't be. We won the tournament.

52
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,687
The rules say the Earth is safe
for another generation.

53
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,231
Obviously, Kahn has cheated
and broken the rules.

54
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:06,860
He has resurrected your mother
to keep these portals open indefinitely.

55
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:11,698
By reuniting you with her,
Kahn's spell will be broken.

56
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,534
Your mother's soul will be at peace...

57
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,119
...and his portals closed.

58
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:19,456
- How could the Elder Gods allow this?
I do not know.

59
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,626
But Kahn must be stopped
or your world wilI perish.

60
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:25,086
We have six days until annihilation.

61
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,923
I beat Shang Tsung. I can beat Kahn.

62
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:31,468
Yes, you beat a great sorcerer
to win the tournament...

63
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,762
...but you're no match for Kahn.

64
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:37,224
If anyone's going to kill Kahn,
it's going to be me.

65
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:38,767
Enough.

66
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:47,400
You are far from ready.
When those portals open...

67
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:50,946
...Kahn's extermination squads
will be everywhere, hunting you.

68
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,240
I am telling you this for your own good.

69
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,284
Kahn knows I have no powers
in Outworld.

70
00:08:56,452 --> 00:09:00,580
As the two realms merge,
I wilI lose my powers here on Earth.

71
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:04,543
Each of you must grow
stronger together.

72
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,670
We are the only hope.

73
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:18,974
Together, we couldn't even save Johnny.

74
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,853
What do these do?

75
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:28,316
Once inside the velosphere, you can travel
to anywhere on Earth in mere hours.

76
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:31,194
The inner winds propeI you.

77
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:34,698
You'll be moving so fast,
it'll be as though you're not moving at all.

78
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,784
Whoa.

79
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,705
We need your help, Sonya.
I wilI take you to find your partner, Jax.

80
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:45,542
Forget it. If I die, that's fine,
but I'm not losing anybody else.

81
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:49,337
Alone, you are vulnerable,
but if you work together as a team...

82
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:50,547
...you can do much.

83
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,756
What about us?

84
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,009
The two of you will traveI
to the Hopi Mesa.

85
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:57,846
You did great last time, but you will
need help for what you are about to face.

86
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,056
Go deep into the night.

87
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,726
Seek out the counseI
of one called Nightwolf.

88
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:06,354
You will not find him. He wilI find you.

89
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,024
I wilI speak with the Elder Gods...

90
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:12,360
...and I will demand answers
for what Shao-Kahn has done.

91
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,195
- Ready?
Ready.

92
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,405
Here we go.

93
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,495
- They are faster than I remember.
- Can't wait.

94
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,717
- This is amazing.
- Hot air rising from the Earth's core.

95
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,218
We've harnessed its energy.

96
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:47,729
- What's going on? Where are we?
- The interchange. Roll to your right. Hard.

97
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,277
Hold on to me. Hold on to me.

98
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,795
Father, the merger has begun.

99
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,922
Earth is under attack.

100
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:58,508
And it is glorious!

101
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:03,680
TelI me, did you make Rayden beg
for his life before destroying him?

102
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,983
Rayden is of no concern to us.

103
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,655
You let him live?

104
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,700
He could not be stopped.

105
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:28,163
I have no use for excuses.

106
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:31,875
I have broken the sacred rules
to keep the portals open.

107
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,502
If the Elder Gods learn of our plot...

108
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,172
...we shall both suffer the consequences.

109
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:38,506
I do not understand.

110
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,551
How can you fear the Elder Gods?

111
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:45,180
With control of the Earthrealm,
our power will be absolute.

112
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:48,349
Until the sixth day has passed...

113
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:52,270
...we can take no chances
with Rayden and his mortals.

114
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:58,651
Do not underestimate
the power of the human spirit.

115
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:39,400
Liu, if anything happens to me,
I want you to-

116
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,027
Kitana...

117
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,905
...I have lost everything...

118
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,286
...and I'm not going to lose you too.

119
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,884
Liu, the missile.

120
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:28,069
You must go. There will be others.

121
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,072
I killed you in the tournament.

122
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,200
You killed my older brother.

123
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,621
- So why did you help us?
- I helped her.

124
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:43,251
Because legend has it the princess
is the key to stopping Kahn's plot.

125
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,753
You've been following us. Why?

126
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:49,757
Two days ago, Kahn reprogrammed Smoke
to come after you instead of me...

127
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:52,927
...in order to keep you apart
from Queen Sindel.

128
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,972
All right.
So how do we get to Nightwolf now?

129
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,558
We have a common enemy, Sub-Zero.

130
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:02,437
You must help us with your powers
if you want to stop Kahn.

131
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,236
Let's hope you succeed.

132
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,730
Get over here.

133
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,747
Take it.

134
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,711
Suckers!

135
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,754
Kitana!

136
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,220
I've got to find Kitana.

137
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,639
Kahn wants you to go after her.

138
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,266
- Don't.
- You don't understand.

139
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,476
Without Kitana, it's over. We've lost.

140
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:51,147
What happened here should prove
you are not ready for what's ahead.

141
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:21,385
You'll take the same track back
and turn where I showed you.

142
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,179
Don't worry about me.

143
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,228
Is it like this everywhere?

144
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:34,232
With each hour,
the merger of the realms grows closer.

145
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,860
More of the Earth will be destroyed.

146
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,535
I wilI meet you
at the temple of the Elder Gods.

147
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,633
Jax.

148
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,052
Jax. Jax.

149
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,972
Hey, I thought I was supposed
to be rescuing you.

150
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:08,266
Yeah, well, I couldn't wait.

151
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:11,602
What the hell have you done to yourself
this time?

152
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,312
Cybernetic strength enhancers.

153
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,816
It takes what you've got,
quadruples the muscle capacity.

154
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,527
You've got a real confidence problem,
you know that?

155
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:27,285
These locks must be on some kind
of a remote access mechanism.

156
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,203
What's going on? What you doing here?

157
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:33,541
Everybody split. The facility is going
to be trashed by an extermination squad.

158
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,502
Extermination squad?
What do you mean extermination squad?

159
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,547
All you need to know is they're trying
to kill me and you too.

160
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,133
I don't even know these dudes.
Where you been anyway?

161
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:48,222
Damn it. I can't get you free, Jax.

162
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,600
All right, stand back, stand back.
Let's see what I'm made of.

163
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,526
Yeah. Now, that's what I'm talking about.

164
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,910
- Wish I had these back in high school.
- You'Il wish you were in high school.

165
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:13,247
- Is that right?
- Come on, Jax, hurry.

166
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,721
What the hell is that?

167
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:15,101
Death is the only way out.

168
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:20,022
Major Briggs, Sonya Blade,
Shao-Kahn will be pleased.

169
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,066
Shao what?

170
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:24,485
I'll take homeboy.

171
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,995
I take it this ain't something
we can talk about. Guess not.

172
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,067
Come on. Hah!

173
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:19,039
Sonya, heads up.

174
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:37,558
Catch this.

175
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,568
Let's do this.

176
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,070
No.

177
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,750
There we go.

178
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:07,880
Yeah, now what?

179
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,640
Cybernetic strength enhancers.
Get some.

180
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,334
Nice look, but I'd lose the wall.

181
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,628
And I was just getting a feel for it too.

182
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,590
Watch out, Sonya.

183
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,300
Watch out.

184
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,281
Whoa.

185
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:42,808
Damn, you barbecued his ass.

186
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,936
Look at this.

187
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:03,871
- Does this mean what I think it does?
- Too bad I didn't get myself new legs.

188
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:35,069
My squads have already claimed
thousands of innocent souls on Earth.

189
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:37,404
And I would have claimed millions.

190
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:40,949
By now, you'd be behind bars
on display in a zoo.

191
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:44,662
If those bars could keep me away from you,
Sheeva...

192
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,288
...I would welcome them.

193
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,092
Silence.

194
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:04,807
What is your report?

195
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:07,726
Two of Earth's best warriors
have already been taken.

196
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,603
KabaI and Stryker.

197
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:14,942
TelI me, did you make them beg
for their lives before you destroyed them?

198
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:19,113
- But, master, I thought if I let them live-
- I have no use for excuses.

199
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:33,460
Rain, this will never happen again.

200
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,129
It will never happen again.

201
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:46,890
It is true, this wilI never happen again.

202
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:50,227
It is also true I need a new general.

203
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:55,023
You can die in duty or by my hand.
The choice is yours.

204
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,443
Centaurs are known
for their hunting prowess.

205
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,904
As your generaI, I will personally
hunt down every human soul...

206
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,948
...and spare no one.

207
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:06,160
Motaro can't be trusted.
Long ago, I proved myself...

208
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,454
...as the personal protector
of Queen Sindel.

209
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:11,331
Your orders are mine to follow.

210
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:14,126
The energies they waste
with their sniveling...

211
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:17,212
...I wilI use to capture souls for you.

212
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,756
No.

213
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:22,801
You are all far too impetuous
for such important work.

214
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:28,348
You are my new general, Queen Sindel.

215
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:33,645
Unless anyone else
has a different point of view.

216
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,877
Pretty cooI, huh?

217
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,461
It's my animality.

218
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,965
- Who are you?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

219
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,510
So you're Rayden's prodigy.

220
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,095
I've seen better.

221
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:34,474
Don't sweat it. I've seen worse too.

222
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:40,480
If you are Nightwolf,
you know I won MortaI Kombat.

223
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:44,318
Don't get cocky.
The tournament had rules.

224
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:45,861
This time, anything goes.

225
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:51,366
It was a mistake even coming here.

226
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,452
You think you're ready, Liu Kang...

227
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,705
...but if you were,
would Kitana have been captured?

228
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:02,169
Can you help me get her back?

229
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:07,049
Maybe. Kitana is important.

230
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:10,594
But to beat Shao-Kahn,
you've got to pass three tests.

231
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,012
First one's courage.

232
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,640
I don't have time for these stupid games.

233
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:17,809
To test your courage
and find your animality...

234
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:20,520
...you've got to put yourself
in a dream state.

235
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,898
And just how am I supposed to do that?

236
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:30,989
Well, there's a slow way
and there's a fast way.

237
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:35,661
- We don't have time for the slow way.
- That's what I thought you'd say.

238
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:41,375
Sweet dreams, Liu Kang.

239
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:54,805
I had faith in you, Liu Kang,
but you have failed me.

240
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:58,850
- Kitana.
- You are not the warrior I thought you were.

241
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,603
What if I fail you?
What if I fail everyone?

242
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:04,189
Your brother's soul is mine.

243
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:05,399
No!

244
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:12,280
Fight from the inside, Liu.

245
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,825
It's the fire inside of you...

246
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,244
...your everlasting faith in yourself...

247
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,454
...that can never be defeated.

248
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:24,292
Liu Kang,
the fire that burns inside you is guilt.

249
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,795
You lost Kitana.

250
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,380
You are not a leader.

251
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:31,091
Find that power inside you.

252
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:33,844
Feel your animality.

253
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:44,646
You will fail!

254
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,366
I am Jade.

255
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:46,166
I have searched the mesa for you,
Liu Kang.

256
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:53,840
Of all the horrors darkness holds...

257
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:57,427
...to die alone...

258
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,889
...that is my worst fear.

259
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:11,983
With you, Liu Kang, I'm not afraid.

260
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:18,073
This is almost too good to be true.

261
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,620
The same could be said about you.

262
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,002
No.

263
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:39,886
My heart belongs to another.

264
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,360
I can't.

265
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,821
There's not much time left.

266
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:14,671
Is this just another dream?

267
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:29,060
How can you beat Shao-Kahn
when I alone am too much for you?

268
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:57,839
First you betray me, now you laugh?

269
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:00,800
You are even more pure and faithful
than I heard.

270
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:04,471
You have passed the test, Liu Kang.

271
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,307
A test?

272
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:14,397
This was just another one
of Nightwolf's crazy tests?

273
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:16,942
We could have killed each other.

274
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,485
But we live.

275
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:29,788
- I will lead you to the temple of Elder Gods.
- I can't.

276
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:33,667
If this was just a test, it was only
his second. I'm not ready yet.

277
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,461
Not ready to save Kitana?

278
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:39,130
Because she is the key to all of this.

279
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:41,549
And I can take you to where she's kept.

280
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,970
- She's alive?
- For now, yes.

281
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:46,388
For how long, I cannot say.

282
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:53,353
We must go.

283
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:18,420
All your past betrayals, I can forgive.

284
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:21,715
Kitana, please accept this offering...

285
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,718
...for I do not want your death.

286
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:56,583
You sorely test my patience.

287
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:04,424
You destroyed my family.

288
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:07,093
You drove my mother to kilI herself.

289
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:10,430
I am your enemy forever.

290
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:14,059
So kill me now, if you dare.

291
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:17,812
Foolish child.

292
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:26,029
A struggling worm on a hook
lands a bigger catch than a dead one.

293
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,962
No trees, no animals.

294
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:46,633
Damn, what's going on here?

295
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:50,470
Nature's dying.

296
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,141
The merger of the realms is almost done.

297
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:58,103
You keep talking about mergers and realms
and all that...

298
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:01,564
- ... but it don't mean squat to me, alI right?
- I can't explain it.

299
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:04,609
The merger is close,
we've only got a few days left.

300
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,319
Use your imagination.

301
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,822
Use my imagination?

302
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:15,453
You keep talking to me like that, Sonya,
and I'm gonna split, all right?

303
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:19,374
You dragged me out the base
with some lunatic killers after us.

304
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,876
Put me in a ball,
take me halfway around the world.

305
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:24,754
If I'm gonna die today,
at least tell me why.

306
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:28,007
Nobody told me why Johnny had to die.

307
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:31,302
What is it with you?
And who the hell is Johnny?

308
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,389
Okay, Sonya, I'm your partner.

309
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:37,058
If you can't trust me, who can you trust?

310
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:40,520
- Well, obviously, nobody but me.
- Nobody but you?

311
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:43,356
Every time you ever needed me,
I was there.

312
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:47,569
I'm stuck in the middle of nowhere because
of you. I don't even know where I am.

313
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,530
I need to use the restroom,
I ain't got no toilet tissue.

314
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:53,199
I got metal things on my hands.
Sonya Blade.

315
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,398
Oh!

316
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:35,533
- Kitana?
- You wish.

317
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:03,329
I told you these arms was good
at something.

318
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:10,962
Thanks, Jax.

319
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,797
I...

320
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,299
I owe you one.

321
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:16,509
I don't know how much longer
I can take this.

322
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,678
But you do look good in mud.

323
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:22,098
- Jax.
- Well, you do.

324
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:23,933
Ugh.

325
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,310
I gotta go find a river.

326
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:31,691
- We better roll. Come on.
- Let's do it.

327
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,527
They don't even use parachutes.

328
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:15,151
I have come to the Eternal Palace...

329
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:18,529
...because your sacred rules
have been broken.

330
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,745
Shao-Kahn has invaded the Earth.

331
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:47,225
As always, Lord Rayden,
you are granted three questions.

332
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:51,813
The first must be:
Why was this treachery ever allowed?

333
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,774
We do not control the destiny of men.

334
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:58,236
Everyone possesses
the ability to change their fate.

335
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:04,075
You will stand by
and watch the ruination of Earth?

336
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,869
You are correct
in believing Kitana is the key...

337
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,539
...to closing Kahn's portals.

338
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:12,709
But if I reunite her with Sindel...

339
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:16,337
...how can I be sure Kahn's portals
will stay closed until next tournament?

340
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:20,675
Only when Shao-Kahn
is destroyed will the future be safe.

341
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,927
After living among the humans...

342
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:25,138
...do you truly believe
they're worth saving?

343
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,932
More than anything I know.

344
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,811
Do you love them
enough to sacrifice your immortality?

345
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:47,618
I don't see no street signs, no mailboxes.
Which temple is the Elder Gods'?

346
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:50,163
Just keep moving, Jax.

347
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:00,173
- Jax.
- Sonya.

348
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:05,344
- You know this dude?
- Yeah.

349
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,517
- Is that Jax?
- Yeah. Who is she?

350
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:14,854
Jade, this is Sonya Blade.

351
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:17,356
Major Jackson Briggs.

352
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,485
You've got an incredible set of legs...

353
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:22,528
...for kicking, I mean.

354
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:25,865
Where's Kitana?

355
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:29,160
She was kidnapped by Scorpion.

356
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:31,496
You lost Kitana and you picked up her?

357
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,039
She helped me get here.

358
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:38,211
Well, thanks to you,
we got extermination squads on our butts.

359
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:41,506
Can I make a suggestion here?
Let's put this petty stuff aside...

360
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:44,884
...and start worrying about bigger things,
like staying alive.

361
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,413
He's not here, either.

362
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:16,415
We just sit and wait for this dude?

363
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:17,959
Without Rayden, it's hopeless.

364
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:28,261
Never give up hope.

365
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:34,433
- At least not so early in the fight.
- Rayden?

366
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:36,727
It's a new look.

367
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:41,065
Who's the girl?
Can she fight as good as she looks?

368
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,442
- Heh. Better.
- Good.

369
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:47,405
I was expecting a team. Instead,
I hear fighters at war with each other.

370
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:49,991
Oh, give us a break, Rayden.
We've been through hell.

371
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:53,286
Compared to what lies ahead,
you've been through nothing.

372
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:58,124
- Where's Kitana?
- Kahn took her. It's all my fault.

373
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:00,126
This is not about blame.

374
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:01,836
We're together in this.

375
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:05,715
Each of us must help
and support the others, like a family.

376
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:07,633
What's the deal with your arms?

377
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:10,636
I've known you one minute
and you're dissing me already?

378
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:12,555
I mean no disrespect.

379
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:16,350
You have real skills. Those arms are not
your strength, they're your weakness.

380
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:17,810
Well, thanks for the tip.

381
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:21,147
But these things right here,
state of the art.

382
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,066
Faith in yourself is all you need.

383
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,985
And I say that to all of you.

384
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:34,160
I'll try to open a portal to Outworld
while I still can. Follow me.

385
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:05,524
My powers are leaving me.

386
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:11,364
Who does this dude think he is,
Moses parting the Red Sea?

387
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:17,411
Destroy everything.

388
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:40,226
Whenever you're ready, Rayden.

389
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,290
Come on.

390
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:11,590
That was fun.

391
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:13,050
They have taken the bait...

392
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:15,761
...and fallen right into our trap.

393
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:17,930
Proceed as planned.

394
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:21,017
I'll await your arrivaI in Outworld.

395
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,109
Oh, man.

396
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:32,695
My skin is burning up,
but I'm freezing inside.

397
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:36,699
- Feels like I got microwaved or something.
- You never do get used to that.

398
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,784
My God, is that what I think it is?

399
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,121
The realms are merging.

400
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:45,708
This will continue to happen
unless Kahn's portals are closed.

401
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,918
Time is against us.

402
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:50,629
- All those people in their cars-
- Torn between realms.

403
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:53,174
It's like a nightmare or something, man.

404
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:55,176
We have to stop this.

405
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:58,262
To do that, we must rescue Kitana.

406
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,558
I know Kahn took Kitana
back to his fortress.

407
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:06,645
Hold up, hold up. Kahn?
You mean Mr. Bad Attitude back there?

408
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:08,939
You want us to go check out his crib?

409
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:10,733
Uhn-uhn. No way.

410
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,693
I ain't going on no suicide mission.

411
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:14,403
Rayden.

412
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:15,821
Jax is right.

413
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:18,365
That's probably just what Kahn
wants us to do.

414
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:19,658
No.

415
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:22,286
There is a secret passageway.

416
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:25,331
It was the one I used to escape.

417
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:45,976
You believed that the ruination
of the Elders' temple...

418
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:48,062
...would not put our plan in jeopardy?

419
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:52,441
It was necessary to convince the mortals
that their only hope lie in Outworld.

420
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:56,654
You seem confident that Sindel will capture
Rayden and his mortals in your trap.

421
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:59,406
I promise you, Father, on my soul.

422
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:02,868
All the millenniums of planning
will be rewarded.

423
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:05,037
You will be proud.

424
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:07,289
Know this:

425
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:12,044
I wilI take your soul myself
if you fail me now.

426
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:17,591
I wilI rally the extermination squads...

427
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:20,845
...and prepare for victory.

428
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:23,764
The merger will soon be complete...

429
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:27,560
...and all your friends will be dead.

430
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,906
This must have been Edenia.

431
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:47,037
The royal family's temple.

432
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:49,582
Kitana told me I would find it here.

433
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:56,463
Look like this babe's
having a bad hair day.

434
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:11,395
They must have followed us.

435
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:19,612
Perhaps, but it may be
a blessing in disguise.

436
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:22,573
We need Sindel
to close Kahn's portals forever.

437
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:25,451
- I'll take care of her.
- I'll rescue Kitana.

438
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:54,164
Something finally went right
for a change. We won.

439
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,166
Who finished off Sindel?

440
00:54:56,334 --> 00:55:00,546
After she blasted you,
I surprised her from behind.

441
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:03,882
Maybe she did come in handy
after all, huh?

442
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:13,225
You are witness
to the dawning of mankind's final day.

443
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:17,229
The two realms will be one.

444
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:24,570
Rayden and his mortals
have fallen for my trick...

445
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:27,614
...and failed to stop us. Go now.

446
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:32,077
Bring Rayden and his pathetic mortals
to bow at my feet.

447
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:38,083
So then with their dying breaths,
they can witness the birth...

448
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:43,547
...of the greatest army in existence!

449
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:47,820
Liu.

450
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:08,173
It's a trap, Liu. Leave.

451
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:42,082
Up there.

452
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:44,084
Come on.

453
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:12,738
Liu!

454
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:15,300
The date's over.

455
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:40,325
Only your love
can reunite her body and soul.

456
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:46,039
Kitana, your love can break the hold
Kahn has over your mother...

457
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:48,959
...and close his portals to Earth.

458
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:20,532
Oh, Kitana.

459
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:26,079
I have prayed for the day...

460
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:29,541
...when our love
will bring us together again.

461
01:00:39,927 --> 01:00:43,930
Love? I have never loved you.

462
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:47,517
With such a pathetic child as you,
what reason was there to love?

463
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,270
I knew it could not be true.

464
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:51,688
It cannot be.

465
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:54,691
Oh, but it can.

466
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:55,901
And it is.

467
01:00:56,069 --> 01:01:01,073
And you are powerless, thunder god.

468
01:01:08,122 --> 01:01:12,751
It's over. You fools, you've been tricked.

469
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:14,711
The legend was a lie.

470
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:17,547
Kahn's portals stay open.

471
01:01:17,715 --> 01:01:21,051
Now the merger is nearly complete.

472
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:22,594
How could you do this to us?

473
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:28,058
It was so easy.

474
01:01:28,976 --> 01:01:31,770
You will die for this, Jade.

475
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:11,810
- That's it.
We trusted you, man.

476
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:15,272
And what happens?
You take us on a wild goose chase.

477
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:17,315
I don't understand.

478
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:19,651
You were advised by the Elder Gods.

479
01:02:20,194 --> 01:02:22,028
The Gods must have lied to me.

480
01:02:22,196 --> 01:02:26,533
Yo, forget your gods and immortals
and all that junk.

481
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:29,828
I say the only ones we can trust
from here on out are humans.

482
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:32,330
Nobody else, not even Rayden.

483
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:33,623
Don't you understand?

484
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:36,960
By leading us here, he is mortal now,
just like you.

485
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:39,087
All his powers have been sacrificed.

486
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:40,297
That's even worse.

487
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:42,132
How do we stop Kahn now?

488
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:44,926
There's more to this than Kahn.

489
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:48,346
If Sindel is not the key
to closing Kahn's portals...

490
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:50,223
...then Kahn has a higher allegiance.

491
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:55,687
Wait a second.
That tattoo, I've seen it before.

492
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:57,647
On a robot and a woman.

493
01:02:57,815 --> 01:02:59,357
They both tried to kill me.

494
01:02:59,525 --> 01:03:01,359
And both of them worked for Kahn.

495
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:07,824
This tattoo is a family crest...

496
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:11,077
...bestowed only to my bloodline.

497
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:15,165
It is a permanent mark that allows
safe passage through the portals...

498
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:17,125
...for the bearer and his passengers.

499
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:20,587
The tattoos you saw,
did they flee the fighter upon death?

500
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:22,214
Took off like a bat out of hell.

501
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:24,090
Temporary passes.

502
01:03:24,258 --> 01:03:25,842
They did not share my bloodline.

503
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:30,222
But if it's your family crest,
how can Kahn's side have it too?

504
01:03:31,098 --> 01:03:33,558
My father is an Elder God.

505
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:35,727
And only they
can bestow such a marking.

506
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:38,396
Your dad's an Elder God?

507
01:03:43,027 --> 01:03:45,529
Funny how you failed
to mention that before.

508
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:51,409
If your father's an Elder God...

509
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:53,620
...what does that make Kahn?

510
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:03,713
Shao-Kahn is my brother.

511
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:17,936
It was not my fault.

512
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:20,063
I did everything you ordered.

513
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:22,274
It was your job
to lure them to an ambush.

514
01:04:22,733 --> 01:04:25,735
If they escaped, then you failed me!

515
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:28,446
We could never
have stopped them alone.

516
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:30,949
Listen to her. She speaks the truth.

517
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:32,909
We would've died trying.

518
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:35,036
You...

519
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:37,122
You are already dead.

520
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:41,167
And you...

521
01:04:41,627 --> 01:04:43,420
...will be soon.

522
01:04:57,310 --> 01:05:00,312
You will mount a defense
around my newest temple.

523
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:02,647
Prepare for Rayden
to make one last attack.

524
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:05,191
You said Rayden
was no longer to be feared.

525
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:08,486
I am to be feared!
For if you fail me now...

526
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:12,949
...I wilI feed your rotting corpse
to the worms!

527
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:20,165
Your hallowed position
atop the worm pile...

528
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:24,002
...appears to be most tenuous.

529
01:05:24,295 --> 01:05:29,966
Now your failure wilI be my opportunity.

530
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:38,350
You got one dysfunctional family,
you know that?

531
01:05:38,517 --> 01:05:40,852
Years ago, my father decreed...

532
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:44,356
...that his heir to the family throne
must be strong enough...

533
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:48,026
...to kilI his own brother in battle
if necessary.

534
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:50,654
I beat my brother...

535
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:52,864
...but I could not kill him.

536
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:55,241
Only one thing is certain.

537
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,577
Kahn must die.

538
01:05:58,371 --> 01:06:00,497
This time you're going to kill him.

539
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:02,707
I could not then.

540
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:04,376
I cannot now.

541
01:06:04,543 --> 01:06:06,920
So, what do we do?

542
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:10,924
You will do your best.
It is all that can be expected.

543
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:12,884
I wilI pray for you all.

544
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:17,555
Listen to me.

545
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:19,224
Liu is our only hope.

546
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:25,563
I want to fight Kahn,
but I don't know if I'm ready.

547
01:06:25,731 --> 01:06:27,732
You must believe in yourself, Liu.

548
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:30,402
We believe in you.

549
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:11,067
My home.

550
01:07:12,486 --> 01:07:14,738
The Temple of the Order of Light.

551
01:07:14,905 --> 01:07:16,781
Your family.

552
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:20,326
There's so little time left.

553
01:07:20,619 --> 01:07:24,622
Whatever time we have,
we must use well.

554
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:27,292
Are we really ready to die here?

555
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:31,463
If we die...

556
01:07:31,964 --> 01:07:33,882
...we will die in battle.

557
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:36,760
Together.

558
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:38,863
Prepare for final battle!

559
01:08:39,031 --> 01:08:40,740
Kahn!

560
01:08:46,330 --> 01:08:48,164
So good of you to join us, son.

561
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:53,086
In less than one hour,
the merger of realms will be complete.

562
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:56,256
Father, you alone have the power
to end this.

563
01:08:56,423 --> 01:08:57,799
Stop!

564
01:08:58,092 --> 01:09:00,510
I do not want
to remember you this weak.

565
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:02,887
It is not weak to value life!

566
01:09:05,015 --> 01:09:09,769
I offer you one final chance
to return to my side, Rayden.

567
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:12,605
To rule alI realms with your family.

568
01:09:17,778 --> 01:09:19,195
They are my family.

569
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:25,243
Then you shall die with the rest
of your pathetic human race. Finish him.

570
01:09:26,745 --> 01:09:29,080
You should've killed me...

571
01:09:30,249 --> 01:09:33,918
...when you had the chance, brother.

572
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:36,796
My brother died a long time ago.

573
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:39,299
His heart, anyway.

574
01:09:47,808 --> 01:09:49,100
Rayden!

575
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:56,774
I win, brother.

576
01:10:08,954 --> 01:10:10,079
Liu.

577
01:10:11,957 --> 01:10:14,459
You cannot die.

578
01:10:15,753 --> 01:10:18,338
I am proud to die...

579
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:19,964
...a mortal.

580
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:24,844
Like you.

581
01:10:46,283 --> 01:10:50,286
This is the beginning of the end.

582
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:54,499
Show them the way to oblivion!

583
01:10:57,795 --> 01:10:59,128
Mister Ed is mine.

584
01:11:03,008 --> 01:11:04,300
I'll take my mother.

585
01:11:08,013 --> 01:11:10,181
Leftovers are fine with me.

586
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:20,233
Yeah, I'm gonna make you eat that thing.

587
01:11:32,037 --> 01:11:34,622
I can't take too much more of this.

588
01:11:37,209 --> 01:11:38,501
Is that alI you got?

589
01:11:49,263 --> 01:11:51,055
Is that any way to treat your mother?

590
01:11:51,223 --> 01:11:52,557
My mother's dead.

591
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:54,559
As soon will be her daughter.

592
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:18,458
That just leaves you and me, Kahn.

593
01:12:54,995 --> 01:12:56,954
Pathetic and weak.

594
01:12:57,122 --> 01:13:00,416
Clearly, Rayden has molded you
in his image.

595
01:13:24,942 --> 01:13:26,818
Yes.

596
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:38,204
Without your weapons,
you are no match for Motaro.

597
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:44,562
Jax, help!

598
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:49,901
I got everything I need right here.

599
01:15:17,262 --> 01:15:20,264
It's over. Yeah.

600
01:15:22,226 --> 01:15:24,018
Help!

601
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:26,854
Get off her.

602
01:15:33,278 --> 01:15:34,779
Yeah.

603
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:36,656
Get down, Sonya.

604
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:41,160
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

605
01:15:41,328 --> 01:15:43,871
So you finally
got your confidence back, huh?

606
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:45,623
Finally asked for help, huh?

607
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:50,211
Whatever you are,
you will live to see the end of Kahn...

608
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:53,965
- ... to give my mother's soul peace.
- Uhn!

609
01:16:04,643 --> 01:16:06,435
Face it, Liu Kang.

610
01:16:06,603 --> 01:16:10,147
You will fail.

611
01:16:16,863 --> 01:16:22,243
I can feel it.

612
01:16:30,043 --> 01:16:31,502
Now I done seen everything.

613
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:36,424
Impressive.

614
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:38,676
You've come prepared.

615
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:40,886
But not good enough.

616
01:17:53,126 --> 01:17:54,543
Your blood flows, Kahn.

617
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:57,588
Just like the blood of a mortal.

618
01:17:58,048 --> 01:18:01,300
Father, how can this be?

619
01:18:02,135 --> 01:18:04,595
I warned you
there would be consequences...

620
01:18:04,763 --> 01:18:06,889
...for breaking the sacred rules.

621
01:18:07,057 --> 01:18:09,266
But I did not expect this.

622
01:18:09,434 --> 01:18:11,435
Must I do everything for you?

623
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:38,838
The fate of the universe
will be decided as it should be.

624
01:18:39,005 --> 01:18:41,799
In Mortal Kombat.

625
01:19:09,536 --> 01:19:12,538
Nothing can alter your destiny, nor mine.

626
01:19:15,667 --> 01:19:17,960
I can and I will!

627
01:20:22,067 --> 01:20:25,027
No!

628
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:19,290
- Yes.
- Yeah.

629
01:21:22,168 --> 01:21:23,294
Kitana.

630
01:21:24,045 --> 01:21:25,087
Oh, Mother.

631
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:27,464
That was the longest week of my life.

632
01:21:27,632 --> 01:21:30,467
Oh, come on, Jax. Could've been worse.

633
01:21:30,635 --> 01:21:32,511
Could've been the last week of our lives.

634
01:21:32,679 --> 01:21:34,513
Yeah, I guess that's right.

635
01:21:34,681 --> 01:21:36,599
- Hey.
- Yeah?

636
01:21:36,766 --> 01:21:38,893
What's up with that?

637
01:22:00,707 --> 01:22:02,041
Was I dead?

638
01:22:02,208 --> 01:22:05,878
It is only right that
Shinnok's son be allowed to take his place...

639
01:22:06,046 --> 01:22:07,421
...in the Eternal Palace.

640
01:22:07,589 --> 01:22:10,507
You've become one of us.

641
01:22:19,267 --> 01:22:22,186
I wilI never forget this moment, Liu.

642
01:22:28,693 --> 01:22:31,528
