1
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,640
<i>There are gajillions of stories...</i>

2
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,760
<i>of mischief and fun,</i>

3
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,640
<i>but to keep things simple,</i>

4
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,240
<i>let's start with just one...</i>

5
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,760
<i>about a mom and two kids...</i>

6
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,000
<i>and a house and a hat...</i>

7
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,920
<i>that, oddly enough,</i>

8
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,160
<i>was worn by a cat.</i>

9
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,120
<i>But soon enough
we will get to all that.</i>

10
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,960
<i>In the valley that stretches
from this hill to that hill,</i>

11
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,000
<i>a city is nestled...</i>

12
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,040
<i>that city is Anville.</i>

13
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,200
- Hurry up!
We'll miss the movie!
- Any more tutti-frutti?

14
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,280
I'll check.
Thanks!

15
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,400
<i>It's a town that's not huge,
but quite big enough...</i>

16
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,560
<i>for buyers and sellers
to sell and buy stuff,</i>

17
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,240
<i>from shoes and shirts...</i>

18
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,440
<i>and elongated ladders...</i>

19
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,600
<i>to sailboats and gibble-grated
berry-juice bladders.</i>

20
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,280
<i>So our story begins
at the corner
of Main and Montroob...</i>

21
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,720
<i>in the spotless
real estate office...</i>

22
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,240
<i>run by Hank Humberfloob.</i>

23
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,880
<i>Humberfloob Real Estate. How can
we make your dreams come true?</i>

24
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,640
What do you mean,
you're leaving?

25
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,000
You're a babysitter.
Babysitters don't leave. They sit.

26
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,880
Baby-leavers leave.
I'm sorry. I really
gotta go, Miss Walden.

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,760
Well, I need to come home
right away.

28
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,360
All right.
Thank you, Amy.
Sorry.

29
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,640
Attention, everyone!
It's 9:02.

30
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,800
Staff meeting!
Staff meeting!

31
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,760
<i>Look alive, everyone!</i>

32
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,800
First I'd like to
welcome aboard...

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
our newest member
of the Humberfloob family,

34
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,160
Jim McFlinnagan!

35
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,000
- Mr. Humberfloob,
I wanted to thank you...

36
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,000
Fired.
I beg your pardon?

37
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,440
Fired.
B-But l...

38
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,520
Fired!

39
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,160
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, 10!

40
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,400
As you know, tonight is
our bimonthly “meet and greet" party.

41
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,880
Tonight's host is...
Joan Walden.

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,840
This is where people can
meet our real estate agents...

43
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,680
in an informal,
yet hygienic setting.

44
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,600
Mr. Humberfloob,
I have to get home to my kids.

45
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,880
Ah, yes.

46
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,560
Your children.

47
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,680
Joan, let me make this
perfectly clear.

48
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,240
If your house
is as messy as last time,

49
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,200
you're fired!

50
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,680
That's pretty clear,
Mr. Humberfloob.

51
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,600
Don't worry. I promise.

52
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,000
My kids'll be
on their best behavior.

53
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,680
Great.

54
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,400
<i>Humberfloob Real Estate.</i>

55
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,280
<i>How can we make
your dreams come true?
Please hold.</i>

56
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,240
<i>If you leave Humberfloob's
and turn left onto Main,</i>

57
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,640
<i>three miles down
you'll find Lipplapper Lane,</i>

58
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,040
<i>a pleasant-enough street
in a pleasant-enough way...</i>

59
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,280
<i>where a neighbor greeted neighbor
with a neighborly "Hey!"</i>

60
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,840
Hey!
Hey!

61
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,040
<i>Here the hedges were hedged,
the weeds were all weeded,</i>

62
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,440
<i>and lawns were mowed daily,</i>

63
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,320
<i>twice daily if needed.</i>

64
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,560
<i>And at the end
of this street,</i>

65
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,760
<i>in a house like any other,</i>

66
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,840
<i>something magical
would happen...</i>

67
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,920
<i>to a sister and her brother.</i>

68
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,480
<i>Shh! Nevins!
Stealth mode.</i>

69
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,400
Today's to-do list.

70
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,760
Number one:
Make to-do list.

71
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,040
Number two:
Practice coloring.

72
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,840
Number three:
Research graduate schools.

73
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,520
Number four:
Be spontaneous.

74
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,960
Number five:
Create lasting
childhood memories.

75
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,120
<i>And number six:
Amend will.</i>

76
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,600
What is he doing?

77
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,680
Number 10:
Make tomorrow's to-do list.

78
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,400
<i>Ladies and gentlemen!</i>

79
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,200
Nevins,
your attention, please.

80
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,160
You are about to witness
the third most spectacular stunt...

81
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,560
ever performed
under this roof!

82
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,120
Do you know how hard it's getting
to tell people that we're related?

83
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,560
Relax.
I'll put everything back.

84
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,760
And now,
for the indoor stair luge!

85
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,680
Indoor stair luge?

86
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,920
I'll have to add this one
to my list.

87
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,560
Go have no fun
somewhere else.

88
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,040
<i>It... is... showtime!</i>

89
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,800
<i>Whoa!</i>

90
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,880
- Aah!
- Yeah!

91
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,000
<i>- Oh, my word!</i>

92
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,920
Nevins!

93
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,240
<i>Nevins, come back!</i>

94
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,440
Hey, Mom. What's up?

95
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,720
You are so lucky
you didn't ruin this dress.

96
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,200
Mom, I know
you're angry,

97
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,120
but there's something
you need to know.

98
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,720
This was all Sally's fault.
Oh, really?

99
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,120
And how, exactly,
was it Sally's fault?

100
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,160
Give me a minute.
I'm workin' on it.

101
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,480
Save it, Conrad.

102
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,560
Why today? Why did you
have to pick today
to destroy the house?

103
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,480
You know
what's happening today.

104
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,400
I tried to tell him, Mom.

105
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,800
"Mom's throwing
a very important party," I said.

106
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,720
"All other important
clients will be here."

107
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,360
But he went right ahead
and wrecked the house
and let Nevins get away.

108
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,960
Now, again, I hope
you're going to ground him.

109
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,640
Yes, Sally, for a week, but
that's none of your business.

110
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,560
A week?
Come on. Two days.

111
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,000
I asked you to do
one thing today, Conrad...

112
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,920
keep the house
clean.

113
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,720
Do you know how frustrating it is
that you're always doing
the exact opposite of what I say?

114
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,840
<i>Knock, knock, knock.</i>

115
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,000
Someone lose a dog?

116
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,920
<i>I found him next door...</i>

117
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,800
in my yard... again.

118
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,240
You are a saint.

119
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,000
And here I thought
you were only dating me
for my good looks.

120
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,440
Lucky us.
Larry Quinn is here.

121
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,480
<i>Hey-a, sport.
Call me Lawrence.
Okay?</i>

122
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,440
You rescued Nevins!
Thanks, Lawrence!

123
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,240
It was my pleasure, Sally.
Anything for my little princess.

124
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,880
Oh, I don't wanna be a princess.

125
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,520
In a constitutional monarchy
parliament has all the real power.

126
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,720
I see.
Okay, that's great.

127
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,760
Uh, look, pal, be a sport.

128
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,600
<i>Why don't you go
tidy up the living room.
Okay...dude?</i>

129
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,440
I don't have to listen to you, Larry.

130
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,760
Conrad,
do what Lawrence says.

131
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,040
Have you given some thought
about the Wilhelm Academy?

132
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,120
You mean the Colonel Wilhelm
Military Academy for Troubled Youth?

133
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,600
That's the one, Joan.

134
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,760
I'm not sure
it's right for Conrad.

135
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,200
Oh, Joan, Joan.

136
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,760
Joan, Joan, Joan.

137
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,400
I have so much respect
for you, Joan.

138
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,920
Single mother, career woman,
raising two children on your own,

139
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,160
and still finding time
to be the best darned
real estate agent in town.

140
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,320
I know how hard it is, Joan.

141
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,880
It is hard.
Oh... I know.

142
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,880
<i>And I know
how hard you're trying.</i>

143
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,160
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
proposition,
and you must act now.

144
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,040
The Colonel Wilhelm
Military Academy
for Troubled Youth...

145
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,840
is what we call in the sales game
a win-win scenario.

146
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,440
A top-flight military school,
and it's only... eight hours away.

147
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,520
<i>Oh, the phone.</i>

148
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,360
I heard what you said.

149
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,240
I'm not going to military school, Larry.

150
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,720
Look, buddy,

151
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,600
I know I'm not your dad...

152
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,480
and this is probably
really strange for you...

153
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,240
your neighbor's
dating your mom.

154
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,640
But here's the thing, son.
Come here.

155
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,040
I don't like you either.

156
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,680
But I'm gonna
marry your mom.

157
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,760
And if it was up to me,
you'd be at military school today.

158
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,200
I'm not going
to military school.
Ohh!

159
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,200
I think you're gonna love it.

160
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,120
It's just like summer camp,

161
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,040
except with brutal forced marches...

162
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,960
and soul-crushing discipline.

163
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,480
And one more thing...
It's Lawrence,
you snot-nosed son of a...

164
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,320
wonderful woman
who I'm absolutely crazy about!
Oww!

165
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,240
Gosh, I love children!

166
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,160
Oh, Joan,
I didn't see you there.

167
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,840
Would you be a doll
and help me bring up chairs
from the basement?

168
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,440
Nothing would give me
more pleasure, Joan,
but I do have to run.

169
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,200
I have a very important
sales conference downtown.

170
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,520
Oh. Okay.

171
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,240
- Well, I'll see you at the party tonight.
- Sure.

172
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,560
Mom, that guy's a total phony.
You can't let Larry...

173
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,440
<i>It's Lawrence, Conrad.</i>

174
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,600
Kate's Catering.
I'm here to do your party tonight.

175
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,200
Oh, hi.
Where's Kate?

176
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,240
I'm Kate.
Oh. Okay.

177
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,160
Right this way, Kate.

178
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,800
<i>Mom, you've gotta
listen to me...</i>

179
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,240
Quiet!
Two weeks ago
you said you would...

180
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,480
I "specialed" it.
See?

181
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,560
Quiet!
Nevins!

182
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,600
I said quiet!

183
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,960
Joan Walden Real Estate.
Be it ever so humble,
there's no place like Joan.

184
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,120
This is Mr. Humberfloob.

185
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,800
- Oh, hi, Mr. Humberfloob.
- Joan, I need you to come back to the office.

186
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,120
<i>- Today?
- Yes, Joan.</i>

187
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,720
- No problem?
- No problem at all.

188
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,640
Great!

189
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,040
- What's going on, Mommy?

190
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,760
Mommy has to go
back to the office.

191
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,440
Oh! I hope Mrs. Kwan
can baby-sit.

192
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,040
<i>- Not Mrs. Kwan!</i>

193
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,080
Oh!
Hi, Mrs. Kwan.

194
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,000
Hi.
I'm running late.

195
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,920
Thanks for babysitting
on such short notice.
Mmm, yeah.

196
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,920
Okay, Mrs. Kwan.

197
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,320
Oh-oh-oh!

198
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,040
I'll be back
in a couple of hours.
Hi.

199
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,640
<i>Conrad's grounded,
so no video games.</i>

200
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,640
<i>Sally?
Last chance.</i>

201
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,560
If you wanna make cupcakes,
I can take you to
your friend Ginny's house.

202
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,480
<i>- Ginny's not my friend anymore.</i>

203
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,160
<i>Last time we made cupcakes
she wanted to be the head chef.</i>

204
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,080
<i>I'm the head chef.</i>

205
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,840
What about Denise, then?

206
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,600
She talked back to me,
so I ordered her
not to speak to me anymore.

207
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,680
- And you don't like bossy?
- I won't tolerate it.

208
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,320
Right.

209
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,080
Well, if you're both staying,
remember the rules.

210
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,160
Conrad: No playing ball
in the house, no fighting,

211
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,080
no answering the phone,
"City morgue."

212
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,000
Mommy,
can't I have some rules?

213
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,480
No chewing tobacco.

214
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,480
Thanks, Mom.
You have my word.

215
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,680
And absolutely no one
sets foot in the living room, or else.

216
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,160
<i>Or else what?
You're gonna do what Larry said
and send me to military school?</i>

217
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,560
Maybe if you'd just behave,
I wouldn't have to consider military school.

218
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,560
I wish I could trust you.

219
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,000
I wish I had a different mom.

220
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,360
Well, sometimes
I wish the same thing.

221
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,560
Mmm.

222
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,040
Good luck with your meeting.

223
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,520
<i>Children, would you like
to watch television with me?</i>

224
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,880
<i>- We don't have to tell your mother.</i>

225
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,920
<i>Taiwanese parliament.</i>

226
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,560
<i>You tell them, Kwi-Chang!
No more big government!</i>

227
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,360
<i>Rip his heart out!</i>

228
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,000
Hit me!

229
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,480
<i>So they slumped in their chairs,</i>

230
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,600
<i>too glum to complain,</i>

231
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,040
<i>and to make matters worse,
it started to rain.</i>

232
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,160
<i>They sat in the house...</i>

233
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,520
<i>on that cold, cold, wet day...</i>

234
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,560
<i>with no fun to have...</i>

235
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,480
<i>and no games to play.</i>

236
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,440
<i>They could just
stare out the window...</i>

237
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,640
<i>or perhaps get a nap in,</i>

238
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,840
<i>and hope that something,</i>

239
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,760
<i>anything might happen.</i>

240
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,400
Quit bothering
the fish.

241
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,800
I know.
Quit bothering the fish.

242
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,240
Spit hand!
Oh, gross!

243
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,560
Get that away from me!
Get it away!

244
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,080
<i>Then something went bump.</i>

245
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,920
- What was that?

246
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,120
<i>How that bump
made them jump.</i>

247
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,320
<i>I think it came
from the closet.</i>

248
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,520
Conrad?

249
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,840
Conrad.

250
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,280
Come on, Conrad.

251
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,400
You shouldn't scare people.

252
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,400
You should've seen
the look on your face.
It was like you saw a monster...

253
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,680
A monster? Where?

254
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,720
That could've gone better.

255
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,040
<i>What was that?
I don't know.</i>

256
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,240
<i>Looked like
a humongous cat.</i>

257
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,440
"Humongous"?

258
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,880
I prefer the term "big-boned" or “jolly."
Now, what are we hiding from?

259
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,520
<i>That was a giant cat.</i>

260
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,440
But that's impossible,
isn't it?

261
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,360
It's entirely
impossible.

262
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,800
You know,
I like this hiding place
a lot better.

263
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,160
<i>They'll never
find us here.</i>

264
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,320
Scream and run.

265
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,720
And there they go.

266
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,120
Who are you?

267
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,160
Who? Me?

268
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,360
Why, I'm the Cat in the Hat.
There's no doubt about that.

269
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,760
I'm a "super-fun-diferous" feline...

270
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,360
who's here to make sure
that you're...

271
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,760
Meeline? Key lime?

272
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,640
Turpentine?

273
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,560
I got nothin'.

274
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,880
I'm not so good with the rhyming.
Not really, no.

275
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,440
Look, I'm a cat
that can talk.

276
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,920
That should be enough
for you people!

277
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,560
<i>I can talk!
I'm a cat! Yes!</i>

278
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,400
Where did you come from?

279
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,840
Hmm, how do I put this?

280
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:54,160
When a mommy cat and a daddy cat
love each other very much,

281
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,080
they decide that...

282
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,480
<i>Oh, no, no, no, no.
Where did you come from?</i>

283
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,240
My place!
Where do you think?

284
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,280
No, how did you get here?

285
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,200
I drove!

286
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,040
Look, I've been here two whole minutes,
and no one has offered me a drink.

287
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,520
Harrumph!

288
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:17,120
- Sorry, Mr. Cat.
Would you like some milk?
- Milk? Ecch! No!

289
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,640
<i>Lactose intolerant.
Gums up the works. Oy.</i>

290
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,840
You'll thank me later.

291
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,800
<i>Wipeout!
- Hello!</i>

292
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,120
<i>@¤@¤Yeah!</i>

293
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:35,000
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Yee-hee-hee!

294
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,520
Nice spread you got here.

295
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,880
Homina-homina-homina-homina!

296
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,880
Who is this?

297
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,440
Ohh!

298
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,320
That's my mom.

299
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,880
Awkward, yeah.

300
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,120
Yes, this place will do
quite nicely, actually. Yeah.

301
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,720
Although those drapes
are a train wreck.

302
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,960
<i>And this is the lumpiest couch
I ever sat on.</i>

303
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,040
Who is this dreadfully
uncomfortable woman?

304
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,440
<i>Get off her.
That's our babysitter.</i>

305
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,400
What the... Babysitter?

306
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,040
You don't need one of those,
do ya?

307
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,040
<i>Let me get this straight.</i>

308
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,240
You pay this woman...

309
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,160
to sit on babies?

310
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,200
That's disgusting!

311
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,440
I'd do it for nothing!

312
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,440
Hmm!

313
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,920
Now, let's see
what the old "phunometer"
has to say.

314
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,480
- "Phunometer"?
- Yeah. It measures
how fun you are.

315
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,640
Hi.

316
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,800
Huh?

317
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,120
Ohh.

318
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,120
<i>Ah. Control freak.
Yeah.</i>

319
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,680
Now you.

320
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,880
Hi. How are ya?

321
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,720
- Whoa!

322
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,720
Oh.

323
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,560
Tap it.

324
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,000
Listen, kid,
you can tap it with a hammer,

325
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,920
it ain't gonna change.

326
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,120
Just as I suspected.

327
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,640
You guys are both out of whack.
You're a control freak,
and you're a rule-breaker.

328
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,840
That'll be $700.
Who's your insurance carrier?

329
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,160
- So, what do we do?
- Well, there are two treatments
I'd recommend.

330
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,880
One is a series of painful shots
injected into your abdomen and kneecap.

331
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,600
<i>And the other...</i>

332
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,240
involves a musical number!

<i>@ Me-Me-Me-Meow @</i>

334

335
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,840
"How many shots?"
Aren't you precious?

336

Remember? The fish?

347
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,680
Came home in a Baggie,
loved me for two weeks, and then nothing!

348
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,160
- The fish is talking!
- Well, sure, he can talk.

349
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,240
But is he saying anything?
No, not really. No.

350

<i>Hey, Socks, can it!</i>

351
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,080
This cat should not be here.
He should not be about.

352
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,920
He should not be here
when your mother is out.

353
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,560
Come on, kids!
You gonna listen to him?
He drinks where he pees!

These children are smart enough
not to fall for your MTV-style flash...

<i>All right, I'll stay.

But if I'm gonna stay,
there's something I wanna show you.

398
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,880
Something magical...

399
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,520
and full of wonder.

400
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,320
- It's called a contract.
- You want us to sign this?

401
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,240
- Just a formality, really. Yeah.
- Who are they?

402
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,000
Magical time-traveling elves.

403
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,320
Yeah. Magic.

404
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,640
Okay, they're my lawyers.

405
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,520
Liability issues, litigious society,
frivolous lawsuits.

406
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,080
You understand.

407
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,080
Basically, this contract guarantees
you can have all the fun you want...

408
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,320
and nothing bed’s
ever gonna happen.

409
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,520
- All the fun we want?
- Uh-yeah!

410
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,720
- Nothing bad will happen?
- Uh-no!

411
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,920
Come on, Sal,
for once in your life
try something spontaneous.

412
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,880
It goes against
my better instincts, but...

413
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,600
fine.

414
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,720

Not here!

417
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,040

started! Uh-huh!

426
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,240
Hey, check out this room!

427
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,160
What now?

428
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,040
Mom says we're not
allowed in the living room
today, or else.

429
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,400
<i>She's worried we'll mess up the couches
by jumpin' on 'em or somethin'</i>

430
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,720
And she's right.
You can't jump on these.

431
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,240
Not like this.
They need some adjustment.
Yee-haw!

432
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,680
Let's take a look
under the hood.

433
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,560
Yeah.

434
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,840

436
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,840

437
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,400
Here we go.

438
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,960
It's oversized.
That's unusual.

439
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,880
Here it is.

440
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,680

<i>- Thanks for the help.</i>

443
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,880
Back in a second.
Who's your couch mechanic?

444
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,480
You oughta call

<i>Oww! My fur!

447
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,960
Come on, kids.
I could use a little company.

448
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,880
What about Mom's party?

449
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,960
What about it?
We signed the contract.

450
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,280
Wha-hoo!
Yeah!

451
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,120
One cushion left,
Sally.

452
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,000
She'll never do it.
She doesn't know
how to have fun.

453
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,240
<i>Fun? Sally,
you're better than fun.
Fun is beneath you.</i>

454
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,720
Remember
what your mother told you...

455
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,600
<i>No one sets foot
in the living room...</i>

456
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,120
You know what?
Let's just watch some flashbacks.

457
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,920
Absolutely no one sets foot
in the living room, or else.

458
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,160
You're fired... fired... fired...

Fired... fired... fired... fired...

461
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,200

462
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,640
Oww!

463
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,680
<i>This is where

467
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,960
Yeah, but without
those tortured animals...

468
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,360
or drunken clowns
that have hepatitis.

469
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,920
See, kids, I told you
we could have fun!

470
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,400
<i>The best thing is,
no one will ever...</i>

471
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,160
know.

472
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,520
Judas Priest!
I can't believe what I'm seeing!

473
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,840
Oh, Mr. Quinn,
I was just telling Conrad
to get off the couch.

474
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,760
Bad, Conrad!
Bad!

475
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,680
Sally,

476
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,520
baby, angel, princess,

477
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,240
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret, okay?

478
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,400
Nobody likes a suck-up!

479
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,960
Where's the cat?
I don't know.

480
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,600
Ohh!

481
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,600
Good bread.

482
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,240
What are you two
lookin' at?

483
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,440
Is there a cat in here?

484
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,960
I'm gonna...
You're gonna...

485
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,600
I have to...

486
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,760
Get out of here.

487
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,400
See, kids, I told you.
Stick with me, it'll all work out.

488
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,960
Oh, no! Ohh!

489
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,640
Little-known fact...
cats always land on their tushy.

490
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,960
- I thought they always
landed on their feet.
- Oh, sure, now you tell me.

491
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,920
Harrumph!

492
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,240
- So, kiddo, what do you
want to do for fun?
- I wanna make cupcakes!

493
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,480
Cupcakes? Oh, yeah!
To the kitchen!

494
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,120
<i>Live from the kitchen,</i>

495
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,920
<i>the following is
a paid commercial announcement
for Astounding Products.</i>

496
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,240
<i>Hi! Welcome to
Astounding Products.</i>

497
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,120
I'm your host,
the guy in the sweater who asks
all the obvious questions.

498
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:31,880
Now, here to tell us
about his astounding product
for making cupcakes,

499
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,880
all the way
from Cheshire, England,
please welcome...

500
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,160
Me! Hello!

501
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,840
Now... Hello!
I'm so excited!

502
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,760
Do you love
making cupcakes,

503
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,240
but hate all
the hard cupcake work?

504
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,160
I know I do!

505
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,360
Well, forget
everything you know
about making cupcakes...

506
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,360
and say hello...

507
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,480
to the amazing Kupkake-inator.

508
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,280
<i>- I'm so excited!</i>

509
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,280
Cupcake-a-what?

510
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,160
Kupkake-inator!

511
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,760
Oh, this amazing device
can instantly make cupcakes...

512
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,160
<i>out of anything that
you have in the kitchen.</i>

513
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,920
- Wait a minute.
Did you say “anything"?
- Anything.

514
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,840
Anything?
Yes, anything.

515
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,480
Anything?
Anything.

516
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,800
- Anything?
- I'll get you, and it'll look
like a bloody accident.

517
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,720
<i>- Anything.</i>

518
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,600
Now, take off the lid.
You can put in, I don't know,
a carton of eggs.

519
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,040
What?
How about
a pack of hot dogs?

520
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,960
That's incredible!
Why not some ketchup?

521
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,200
Yeah, why not?
How about...
I know what you're thinkin'.

522
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,720
Even a fire extinguisher.
There we go.

523
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,640
Hmm?

524
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,360
Now, close the lid
and Bob's your flippin' uncle!

525
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,160
What an
astounding product!

526
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,680
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

527
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,440
Open the drawer,

528
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:47,080
<i>Fill the patented
Kupkake-inator tray,</i>

529
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,880
<i>- Close the drawer,</i>

530
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,040
Then place it
in a conventional oven.

531
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,840
Delicious cupcakes
are just minutes away.

532
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,760
Did you just say
"minutes away"?

533
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,440
That's impossible!

534
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,560
You're not just wrong,
you're stupid.
Now, wait just a minute...

535
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,560
And you're ugly,
just like your mum.

536
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,080
<i>Did you just call
my mother ugly?</i>

537
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,680
Shut up! I mean it!
I will end you!

538
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,200
Um, Cat.
Your tail.

539
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,760
What about it?

540
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:25,080
Oh, I see! I've chopped it off.
That's interesting, because...

541
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,360
Son of a bi...

542
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,960
Look, I'm not saying
we're going to sue.

543
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,240
I'm just saying
we have a case.

544
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,160
We'll talk later.
Ixnay, ixnay.

545
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,480
Hi.

546
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,040
Cat, is the oven
supposed to be
making that sound?

547
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,960
Huh?

548
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,160
Of course. That means
they're almost done, Conrack.

549
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,280
- Conrad.
- That's what I said, Condor.

550
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,760
<i>- Cat!
- Now, that's my name!</i>

551
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,240
<i>Yep!</i>

552
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,160
They're done!

553
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,640
Oh, man!
There's nothing
to worry about.

554
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,560
I'm sure
they still taste fine.

555
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,520
Yecch!
They're horrible!

556
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,640
Who wants some?
Come on, come on!

557
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,520
Oh... my... cod.

558
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,000
Ohh! Aah!

559
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,880
Cat, you need to
clean this mess up pronto.

560
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,000
We have a contract.
All right, I'll try.

561
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,040
You don't try. You do.

562
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,920
Yes, ma'am.
Right away, ma'am.

563
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,600
I'll be right back.

564
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,440
<i>Whoa!</i>

565
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,680
Hi.
How are ya?

566
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,720
Okay.

567
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,800
Look. I'm a girl.

568
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,360
Stop! That's...

569
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,960
Mom's dress!

570
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,360
This filthy thing?

571
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,440
She was gonna wear that tonight,
and you ruined it.

572
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,400
Honey, it was ruined
when she bought it.

573
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,400
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

574
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,280
<i>I told you
all this would happen!</i>

575
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,240
- But no one listens to a fish!
- Oy.

576
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,840
<i>A dog goes "woof-woof"
and everybody knows that
little Timmy's trapped under a log.</i>

577
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,680
<i>But a fish speaks
in plain English...</i>

578
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,440
All right, everyone,
let's just take a deep breath
and calm down.

579
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,720
<i>You know who's gonna solve it?
Me. I am.</i>

580
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,600
I will personally
take care of everything.

581
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,680
And I know
just the guys to do it.

582
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,280
In this box are two Things.
I will show them to you.

583
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:54,400
<i>Two Things, and I call them
Thing One and Thing Two.</i>

584
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,760
These Things will not bite you.
They want to have fun.

585
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,880
So without further ado,

586
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,120
meet Thing Two
and Thing One!

587
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,320
@Ta-da @

588
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,120
Oh, yeah!

589
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,240
Thing One, Conrad, Sally.
Conrad, Sally, Thing One.

590
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,240
<i>Thing Two, Conrad, Sally.
Conrad, Sally, Thing Two.</i>

591
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,360
Thing One, Thing Two.
Thing Two, Thing One.
Conrad, Sally. Sally, Conrad.

592
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,000
I am the Cat.
Don't belittle me.

593
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,960
Ah, yes, of course.

594
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,840
Thing Two would like to
clarify that just because
he wears the number two...

595
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,360
does not imply in any way
that he's inferior to Thing One.

596
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,680
And all of the above.

597
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,280
He says you may feel free
to call him Thing "A," if you like.

598
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,480
He will also accept Super Thing,
Thing King, Kid Dynamite,

599
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,200
Chocolate Thun-Da...
or Ben.
Ben!

600
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,640
Thing One says
he's Thing One for a reason,

601
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,040
and some people
should just get used to it.

602
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,640
It's a Thing thing.
You wouldn't understand.

603
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,040
Okay, enough!

604
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,240
You are quickly turning into
one of my least favorite Things.

605
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,640
Listen, Convex,
you probably don't
wanna do that.

606
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,560
Why not?
It's just a crate.

607
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,040
This isn't just any old crate.

608
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,120
It's the Trans-dimensional
Transportolator.

609
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,240
It's kinda like a doorway
which leads from this world
to my world.

610
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,560
But it says,
"Made in the Philippines."

611
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,720
<i>Yes, but not this Philippines.</i>

612
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,160
<i>Look, now,
I'm not usually a rules guy,
but this is a biggie.</i>

613
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,160
No opening the crate.

614
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,080
No lookee, no touchee.
Got it?

615
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,160
<i>Mekka-dekka we should
settle our differences.</i>

616
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,720
<i>Things, front and center!</i>

617
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,560
Cool.

618
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:37,280
All right, Things,
I'm not paying you to
stand around and look pretty.

619
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,320
<i>Here's Mom's dress.</i>

620
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,240
<i>Oh! Mommy's dress!</i>

621
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,080
- What about the couch?
- Which couch?

622
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,080
<i>The clean one,
or the horribly stained one?</i>

623
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,160
Ho!

624
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,080
Mekka-dekka
don't worry!

625
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,520
Incoming!

626
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:13,240
<i>Cat, they're wrecking
the whole house!</i>

627
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,360
- Conrad, help!
- Help yourself!

628
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,240
Look at me!
Come and get it!

629
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,560
Whoa! Ooh, yeah! Whoa!

630
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,160
That tickles!

631
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,160
Geronimo!

632
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,640
Mine, mine, mine!
Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine!

633
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,120
Ride 'em, cowboy!
Yee-hee-hee! Ho-ho-ho! Whee!

634
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,080
If this were my house,
I'd be furious.

635
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,360
Hey! Klondike!

636
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,000
Do you have any idea
what happened to the lock
on this crate?

637
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,440
- It's on Nevins's collar.
- Nevins?

638
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,160
<i>Nevins? Nevins!</i>

639
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:44,120
Put the dog down!
I said, put the dog down!

640
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,040
Why won't they
listen to me?

641
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:51,480
Oh. I don't know if this helps,
but the Things always do
the opposite of what you say.

642
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,920
Why do they always
do the opposite?
That's so annoying!

643
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,840
Remind you of anyone,
Conrad?

644
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,440
<i>Zinga!</i>

645
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,440
Zinga! Zinga!

646
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,400
Blue! 41! Set!
Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut!

647
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:08,160
Hey, Thing,
don't let go of that dog!

648
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,880
Let go!

649
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:13,440
<i>Catch him...
I mean, don't catch him!</i>

650
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,760
Well, this is just great, Conrad.

651
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:21,760
The whole house is destroyed,
the party is ruined,
and now Nevins is gone.

652
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,160
Sally, Kojak,

653
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:28,240
that's nothing compared
to what's gonna happen
if we don't lock this crate.

654
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,200
Take a look.
It's already leaking.

655
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,080
- It won't stay shut.
- Not without the lock.

656
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,840
Look, if we don't get that lock off of Nevins
and put it back on this crate,

657
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,600
we're gonna be staring down
the business end
of the mother of all messes.

658
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,640
We've gotta go out
and find Nevins.

659
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,920
Impossible! Sally!

660
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,320
<i>There's only four hours
till the party.</i>

661
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,840
The Fish is right.
We should call Mom
and tell her what happened.

662
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,040
Look at this house!
There's no way we could
explain this to Mom.

663
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,720
We gotta get Nevins back
and lock the crate!

664
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,720
We're staying and calling Mom.

665
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,000
We're going and getting the dog.

666
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,080
There is a third option.

667
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,440
<i>There is?</i>

668
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,800
<i>Yes. It involves...</i>

669
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,800
murder!

670
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,680
- That's your option?
- No.

671
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,440
But you guys both had options.
I just wanted to have one too.

672
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,680
Or did I?

673
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,440
- Cat, you're not helping!
- Come on. Let's go get that dog.

674
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:34,840
<i>Now, we just need
a heavy, inanimate object
to weigh down this crate.</i>

675
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,040
There. That oughta
buy us some time.

676
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:46,960
Come on, kids!
Let's go, go, go!

677
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,920
<i>Identical sister Mitzy...</i>

678
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:57,040
<i>That's right.</i>

679
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,520
<i>- Yeah!</i>

680
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,080
What do you want now?

681
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,640
Repo.

682
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,840
You're repossessing my TV?

683
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,240
I'm sure I made a payment.

684
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,040
If it's about that bounced check,
let me give you a credit card.

685
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:21,400
That one's expired.
Huh? Oh, come on!

686
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,480
<i>With the lock on his collar,
Nevins kept running,</i>

687
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,920
<i>unaware of his part...</i>

688
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,400
<i>in the evil Quinn's cunning.</i>

689
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,400
Joan Walden Real Estate.
Be it ever so humble, there's no...

690
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,000
Oh, hi, Joan.

691
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,520
The kids let the dog
out again.
You're kidding.

692
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:43,240
Don't worry. I'll go get him,
then we'll have a conversation
vis-a-vis military school.

693
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,560
I don't know.
Conrad's like you, Lawrence.

694
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,440
He's very... sensitive.
Uh-huh.

695
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,440
But I suppose it's something
I should consider.

696
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,680
I'll get the dog.
I'll be right over.

697
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,320
<i>Okay, there's Nevins.</i>

698
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,640
<i>Stay out of sight.</i>

699
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,720
I thought the moment
needed something.

700
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,400
Oh, what will become of us?

701
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,520
Your mother will lose her job,

702
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,800
and we'll have to...
live on the street!

703
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,840
I can't! Don't make me go...

704
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,280
<i>I don't know this world!</i>

705
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:41,000
It's dry! It's like...
I can't... It's too...
Fish!

706
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,920
It's too much!

707
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,920
Would you like to go back
in the toilet?

708
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,400
On second thought,
it's such a beautiful day.
Why spend it indoors?

709
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,080
- Thank you!

710
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,160
Okay, kids.
Get out of my way.

711
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,920
This fence is no match
for my cat-like grace and reflexes.
Here we go.

712
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,680
Ow. Okay.
Watch me fly, kids.

713
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,600
Ow!

714
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,280
I don't think
the little girl's even trying.

715
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:17,320
What about your
cat-like... reflexes?

716
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,560
What about showing a little effort,
shrimp boat? Now, push!

717
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,880
Whaa!

718
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,120
All right, Nevins.

719
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,120
Time to die.

720
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,160
- Cat, you scared him away!

721
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,160
Dirty hoe.

722
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:37,560
I'm sorry, baby.
I love you. Hmm.

723
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,280
<i>Come on, Cat!</i>

724
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,880
There he is!

725
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,800
<i>Happy birthday, Denise.</i>

726
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,720
<i>Denise?</i>

727
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,520
Everyone I know
is there.

728
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,000
There's Ginny and Alan.

729
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,880
How come Denise didn't
invite me to her birthday?

730
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,520
<i>Don't worry. Let’s just
get Nevins and go.</i>

731
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,680
<i>Okay, kids.
Everyone outside!</i>

732
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,920
Aaah!

733
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,080
Nevins.
Cat, get down!
They're gonna see you!

734
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,320
<i>Hide!</i>

735
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,160
Piñata! Piñata! Piñata!

736
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,080
Piñata! Piñata!

737
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,160
<i>Piñata! Piñata!</i>

738
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,760
- Everybody join in!

739
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,360
It's breaking!

740
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,360
Step out of my way.

741
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,760
This cannot end well.

742
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:52,640
- Piñata! Piñata!

743
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,760
<i>@¤I'm easy @¤</i>

744
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,480
<i>@¤Ah, ah, ah, ah @¤</i>

745
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,080
<i>@¤I'm easy
like Sunday morning @¤@¤</i>

746
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,680
Oh-ho-ho! Whoo!

747
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,080
<i>- Oh! Whoo-hoo!
- I got an idea.</i>

748
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,600
<i>Candy!</i>

749
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,000
Candy!

750
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,480
No!

751
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,760
Get back!
Cat!

752
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,800
I'll get you!

753
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,600
I'd love to buy some.

754
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,680
Hello, Mrs. Kwan.
It’s Joan Walden.

755
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,160
I just called
to check on the kids.
Are they okay?

756
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,120
Those aren't children.

757
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,000
They're little angels.

758
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,520
That's sweet.

759
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:54,400
Well, all right, Mrs. Kwan.
I'll be home as soon as I can.

760
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,280
Bye-bye.
Bye.

761
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,560
<i>All right, soldier.
Our bogey is in range.</i>

762
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,880
Commence
search and destroy.

763
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,680
<i>- What?
- Search and rescue.</i>

764
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:37,000
I meant search and rescue.
Come on!

765
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:40,000
I can't believe I wasn't
invited to that party.

766
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,440
Hey!
You're a lone wolf.

767
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,040
Live alone, die alone.
Yeah.

768
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:48,240
- Can we please get the dog?
Can we please get the dog?

769
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:51,120
Can we please get the dog?
Boo!

770
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,880
<i>Oh, no! Oh, man!</i>

771
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,760
Hello, Nevins.
Good-bye, Conrad.

772
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:03,720
Not so tough now,
are you?

773
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,240
We're dead.
We're never gonna get
that crate shut.

774
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,520
<i>And I'm getting shipped off
to Colonel Von Kronk's School
for Wayward Boys!</i>

775
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:22,080
Why don't we
take my car?
You have a car?

776
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,880
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

777
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,280
Wow.
That is so cool.

778
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,760
That's just
the dust cover.

779
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:39,720
Here she is, the Super Luxurious
Omnidirectional Whatchamajigger.

780
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,280
Or S.L.O.W. For short.

781
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,320
S.L.O.W.?

782
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,480
Yeah, SLOW.
It's better than the last name we had.

783
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:50,640
Super Hydraulic
Instantaneous Transporter.

784
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:54,680
- Oh, you mean...
- Ohh! Quick, to the SLOW.

785
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,160
Buckle up, kids.

786
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:03,120
We're on a mission to get that dog,
and we will not rest
until we find and destroy it.

787
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,600
Rescue it!
Rescue it! Of course
I meant rescue it.

788
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:09,000
Whatever. Remember, kids,
there's nothing faster than SLOW.

789
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:12,040
That's backwards!
It makes no sense.
Look at you! Argh!

790
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,640
Okay, here we go.
G.P. S... check.

791
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,560
<i>DVD, CD... check.</i>

792
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,520
Someone from Czechoslovakia
is a... Czech.

793
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,880
Siren!
What are you...
What...

794
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,200
<i>Siren?</i>

795
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:27,920
Let's go!

796
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,280
Whoo-whoa-ho-ho!

797
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:33,600
Hi there!
How are you? Yeah!

798
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:45,760
@ I'm sending Conrad away @

799
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,320
- Oh! Oh!

800
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,000
<i>Oh!</i>

801
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:54,240
I can't believe you whizzed
on my taco!

802
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,720
Wait till Joan
gets a load of you!

803
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,320
<i>- There they are!
- Red light, red light,
red light, red light!</i>

804
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,360
Red light!

805
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,720
- Someone else should drive.
- All right. You win.

806
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:17,280
Concrete,
you drive.
Are you serious?

807
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,760
I don't know.

808
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:22,320
A little voice inside of me
is saying, "This is a bad idea,"

809
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,240
but I can barely hear
that little voice...

810
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:29,360
because an even louder
little voice is screaming,
"Let the 12-year-old drive!"

811
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,160
Now, punch it!

812
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,320
<i>This is awesome!</i>

813
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:44,280
- I want to drive.
- I think that's a great idea.

814
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:50,040
Wait!
Two people can't drive
at the same time.

815
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:53,960
You're right.
We should all drive.

816
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:01,520
<i>- Cat! Where are the brakes?
- I'll get them.</i>

817
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,920
I think there's something wrong
with your brakes. When's the
last time you had them checked?

818
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,960
<i>Bad brake!</i>

819
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:21,120
<i>One-way street, one-way street,
one-way street, one-way street!</i>

820
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,720
Hey, Rhode Island license plate.
You never see those.

821
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,120
Om. Om.

822
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,800
Air bag. Standard.

823
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,840
I think... I wet... my jar.

824
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,840
Can we do that again?

825
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,240
Hey, there he is!

826
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,800
<i>Oh, no!
He's going into Mom's office!</i>

827
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,120
Come on, Cat!

828
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,360
You know, Nevins,

829
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:16,960
when Joan finds out
you've escaped again,
Conrad will be moving out,

830
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,960
and I'll be moving in.

831
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:24,120
<i> We've gotta get
Nevins and that lock back.
What are we gonna do?</i>

832
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:27,320
<i>Don't worry.
I have three plans.</i>

833
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,280
Plan "A": "Mess up
a perfectly clean house."

834
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:34,680
Done that. Plan "B":
"Cut your losses and ditch the kids."

835
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,280
- That could work.
- What about that one?

836
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:42,120
Plan "C": "Trick Mom's boyfriend
into handing over dog and lock."

837
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,120
I don't know.
I still like Plan "B."

838
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,800
- Cat!
- Okay, okay. Plan "C."

839
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,640
Look at you. Argh!

840
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:54,320
<i>Excuse me, sir.</i>

841
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:57,600
I'd like you to sign
my petition. Yeah.

842
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,880
Get out of my way,
you hippie freak.

843
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,560
Are you aware of the senseless,
wholesale slaughter...

844
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:05,960
of the flatulating,
acid-spitting Zumzizeroo?

845
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:08,480
What will it take
to get you out of my face?

846
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,680
Just sign my petition...

847
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:14,000
with this large, oversized pen
that requires two hands.

848
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,600
<i>I see.</i>

849
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:19,120
- Will you hold my dog?
- Yes!

850
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,520
Okay, I have a problem
with the word "dog."

851
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,760
I don't use the "D" word per se
'cause I think it's really, really wrong.

852
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:30,280
<i>Yeah. But I will happily
hold your Canine-American.</i>

853
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,760
- I'm more comfortable
with that really, yeah.

854
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:37,760
@ How much is that Canine-American
in the window @

855
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,280
Cat! Come on!

856
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,440
<i>- Hey, what the...</i>

857
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,360
<i>Go, go, go!
Come back here!
I'm on to you kids!</i>

858
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:50,240
- Nothing to see here.
Keep moving! Go!

859
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:53,320
Come on! Let's go.
Ah, get in, get in!

860
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:57,360
Come on, let's go.
Get in! Hi, hi.
Get in! Get in!

861
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:00,480
<i>Look out below!</i>

862
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:03,640
Oh! Sorry. Over there.

863
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,160
<i>
Hey! Hey, hey!
Hey, hey!</i>

864
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:11,160
<i>Ohh!</i>

865
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,960
Oh!

866
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,560
I got you!

867
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:22,600
Here he comes!
Cat!

868
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:29,960
- Where's my hat? Oh! Go! Go, go!

869
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:32,000
Go! Let's go!
My tail, my tail.

870
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:35,840
Come on, Cat!
I'm walking here!

871
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:45,480
Joan. Joan!

872
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,600
- I think we lost him.
- Not the pocket. Not the pocket!

873
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:54,440
- We got the lock back.
Now let's get home.
- Relax, kid. I'm all over it.

874
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,120
Hey.

875
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,240
What's wrong?
This.

876
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,240
This is not my hat.
I must have picked up
the wrong hat back there.

877
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,800
- So?
- So...

878
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,440
without my hat,
I'm just your garden-variety
six-foot-tall talking cat.

879
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:09,760
<i>Joan, your children
are running around town
like complete maniacs.</i>

880
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:16,320
<i>Yes, they are.
With some weird,
hairy man in a big hat.</i>

881
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,200
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

882
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:21,320
You're gonna believe everything
I'm telling you once we get to
your house, okay? Come on.

883
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,280
We're doomed!

884
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:27,480
We're dead. This is all my fault.
I'm such an idiot.

885
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:31,600
Why do I always have to do
the opposite of what I'm supposed to?

886
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,520
Wait a second.
That's it! The opposite!

887
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,080
Hey, Things!
Don't help us!

888
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:40,600
Do not show up and help us
get home right now!

889
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,880
- We're goin' on a road trip!
- Larry's car?

890
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:48,280
How'd you get so smart?

891
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,680
<i>
So the race was on
to get back home first.</i>

892
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,560
Hang on! We gotta beat
Mom and Quinn home!

893
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:58,320
<i>But back at their home,
things were just getting worse.</i>

894
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,720
There's Mom and Larry!

895
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:18,840
Step on it, Joan.
Go, go, go, go, go.

896
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:23,120
Oh, Things, do not do anything
to slow down my mom.

897
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,040
<i>Slow down Mom!</i>

898
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,640
Look, Joan, they don't
beat them every day.

899
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,960
<i>Oh, great.</i>

900
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,480
I'm sorry, Officer.
Was I speeding?

901
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,840
Mekka dekka license,
appa registration.

902
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,880
Mekka dekka,
you're one hot mama.

903
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:54,480
Hey, that's my car.
Joan, we better go right away!

904
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,760
Please let me handle this.

905
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,280
Sorry, I guess I was
in a hurry to get home.

906
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:02,960
- I'm not gonna let them
get away with this!

907
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:09,480
Meet me at the house!

908
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,920
Not so fast,
you little maggots!
Ha-ha!

909
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,360
<i>Oh, you are so busted.
Now get inside.</i>

910
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,360
You don't want to go in there.
It's going to be a total...
Aah!

911
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:34,280
What?
Sally, what happened?

912
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,680
<i>What about the mother
of all messes?
I don't know.</i>

913
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:39,400
Why am I sneezing?

914
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,560
That'd be me. Boo!

915
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:50,880
You're a giant...

916
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,800
Cat!

917
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:59,400
Judas Priest!

918
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,480
<i>Ooh.
Mama mia.</i>

919
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,720
What happened
to our house?

920
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,800
It's the mother
of all messes.
Yup!

921
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:14,240
Pure, unadulterated fun
without any good sense or judgment.

922
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,800
See, Corn Dog,
this is why I warned you...

923
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,720
not to open the crate.

924
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,400
- Although, on the plus side,

925
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:26,000
I think people will be
talking about tonight's party
for the rest of their lives.

926
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:31,240
- We gotta shut the crate! Come on!
- Okay.

927
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,640
Let's take the front hall carpet.

928
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:40,440
- This can't be the front hall.
- This is what happens when you
mix your world and my world.

929
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,840
Oh, and when you eat
bad shellfish.

930
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:45,440
Let's go! Oh, yeah!

931
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,200
Cat, how do we
find the crate?
Beats me.

932
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:51,320
This hat is worthless,
and it makes me look fat.

933
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:53,400
- Where's Mrs. Kwan?
- Oh-ho-ho!

934
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:56,760
<i>Here she comes,
right on schedule.</i>

935
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,520
- Oh, yeah!
- We're going to ride Mrs. Kwan?

936
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,160
<i>Sure! It's the only way
to the crate. Hop on!</i>

937
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:09,800
Oh, this is gonna be good!

938
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:13,640
Please keep your hands and feet
in the Kwan at all times!

939
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:17,680
Enjoy the ride!

940
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:21,280
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the dining room. Ohh!</i>

941
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,600
<i>This is the dining room?</i>

942
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,800
Hey, look.
Chandelier!

943
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:34,920
<i>Is that the bathroom?</i>

944
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,520
You might want to
hold it for a while.

945
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,440
Something like that
really burns my...

946
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,560
Aaah!

947
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:50,160
This is amazing!
It's like a ride
at an amusement park!

948
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:53,080
You mean, like at...
Universal Studios.

949
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,640
Cha-ching.

950
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:59,280
Whoa!

951
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:04,920
- Whoa!

952
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:09,000
Please exit the Kwan to your left.
Have a nice day!

953
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,640
This is ridiculous.
I have to get home.

954
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:15,960
Police brutality!
Illegal choke hold!

955
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,560
Where are we?
The living room,
I think.

956
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,800
Ah, man!
My eyes are closed.

957
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:26,280
If there's no line, could we
go back and do that again?
There's the crate!

958
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,080
Oh!

959
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,960
If we shut the crate,
the house will go back to normal.

960
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,040
You have the lock?

961
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,400
Got it!
Come on! Let's go!

962
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:45,480
Sally!

963
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:48,760
- Come on!
- It won't shut!

964
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:53,160
Sally! Everything
is disappearing up there!

965
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,480
- Help!
- Sally!

966
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:58,160
- Oh! Oh!
- Sal... Aaah!

967
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,840
- Help me, Conrad!
- Sally!

968
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:06,680
Help me!
I can't hold on!

969
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:10,200
Hang on!
Help me, Conrad!

970
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:13,240
<i>Help!
Sally, I can't reach
the lock!</i>

971
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:17,320
- No!
- I can't save you
unless you let go!

972
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:19,120
Okay.

973
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,480
Help me!

974
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:28,160
- Yes!

975
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:59,400
<i>Ugh!</i>

976
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,760
I did it!
I did it!

977
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:04,440
<i>I did it! I did it!
I did it!</i>

978
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:06,520
I did it! I did it!

979
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:13,240
Okay, "we" did it.

980
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:16,040
I don't think
we did anything.

981
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:20,280
The place is still a wreck.
You said if we shut the crate,
everything would be okay!

982
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:23,280
But it's not.
It's a complete disaster!

983
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:25,760
Well, what are you
gonna do?

984
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,680
Tennis, anyone?

985
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:37,160
Ooh!

986
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,920
Love that new ball smell.
Yeah.

987
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:45,000
- Hey, your hat... it's magic again?
- Oops.

988
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:49,040
Well, now that the cat's out of the bag,
to use an archaic
and cruel-sounding metaphor,

989
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,080
why don't you serve first?

990
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:53,240
You had your real hat
this whole time?

991
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:56,400
Uh-yup.
I planned the whole day.

992
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:59,880
- What do you mean,
you planned the whole day? All of it?
- Uh-yup.

993
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:01,280
- The house getting trashed?
- Uh-yup.

994
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,040
- Quinn taking Nevins?
- Uh-yup.

995
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:06,120
- Cutting off your tail?
- Uh-nope. No.

996
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,360
<i>You even knew
I'd open the crate?</i>

997
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:13,200
Why do you think I made it my one rule?
I knew you couldn't resist.

998
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:16,680
Now, who's up for a game
of Canadian doubles?

999
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,240
Cat, you said nothing bad
would happen.

1000
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:24,200
Cat, you need to get out.

1001
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,720
I don't know that game.
It's not a game.

1002
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:29,880
None of this is a game!

1003
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:34,240
- But I thought you two
wanted to have fun today.
- Look around, Cat.

1004
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:36,920
<i>You were right.
It's fun to have fun,
but you have to know how.</i>

1005
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,520
You don't know
when enough is enough.
Now, go!

1006
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,520
Suzy.

1007
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:45,240
Cromwell.

1008
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:47,160
Please.

1009
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,280
Out!

1010
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:57,640
Out!

1011
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:14,560
Good riddance!

1012
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:17,400
Now, this may not be the time
for “I told you so," but...

1013
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,720
Like I said,
not the time.

1014
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:28,000
I'll get the mop
and bucket.

1015
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:31,920
Conrad, you might want
to get out of here until Mom
has a chance to calm down.

1016
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:36,720
No. This was my fault.
I'll take the blame.

1017
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:40,080
Look, Mom will be home any second.
Why don't you go upstairs?

1018
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:42,560
I'm not going upstairs.
I'm staying with you.

1019
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:45,840
Really? Why?
Two reasons.

1020
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,080
One, the stairs are destroyed.

1021
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:52,760
Two, this is just as much
my fault as yours.

1022
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,680
We should share the blame.

1023
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,720
Thanks, Sally.

1024
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:59,640
By the way,

1025
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,040
you're a pretty good brother.

1026
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:06,000
Glad you think that.
Maybe we can room together
at military school.

1027
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:12,400
Well, here goes.

1028
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:23,640
@ Bet you thought I'd gone
Bet you felt a sting @

1029
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:26,600
<i>@¤Bet you never thought
I'd have another song to sing @¤</i>

1030
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:29,320
@ But now that you've learned your lesson
Allow me to blow your mind @

1031
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:32,360
@ By reading to you the small print
of the contract that you signed @@

1032
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:35,800
Okay, section eight,
article 93, subparagraph 834.

1033
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:37,760
<i>Right by the chili stain.</i>

1034
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:41,080
It reads, "If Conrad, a.k.a. Concrete,
should open the crate...

1035
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:44,240
"and we know he will...
the contract shall be null and void.

1036
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,560
"However,

1037
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:51,360
if Sally and Conrad
should learn from their mistakes,
the contract shall be reinstated."

1038
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:54,320
<i>I think you two have satisfied
the legal burden of learning.</i>

1039
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,160
Yeah!

1040
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:58,680
So there's just one last game to play.
It's called "Clean Up The House."

1041
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:02,920
Kids, meet the Dynamic Industrial
Renovating Tractormajigger.

1042
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:04,760
D-l-R-T?

1043
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:06,600

1079
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:12,880
Okay, we had some good times.

1080
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,800
We cleaned up the house.

1081
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,400
We even managed to work in
an up-tempo pop tune for the sound track.

1082
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,400
That's important.

1083
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:23,760
I guess there's just one
last thing to check.

1084
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:27,080
Huh?

1085
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:38,040
Looks like everything's
in balance,

1086
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:39,920
but you're still smoking
way too many cigars.

1087
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:43,760
<i>- And you... lay off the sauce!</i>

1088
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:45,800
Cat,

1089
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:50,120
this day has been...
amazing.

1090
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:52,000
Thank you, Cat.

1091
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:58,200
For everything.

1092
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:01,520
Conrad?

1093
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:04,400
Sally?

1094
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:08,760
Adieu.

1095
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:12,480
<i>Cat!
- Cat!</i>

1096
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,840
- Huh?
- Wait, Cat.
- Don't go!

1097
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,640
Uh-oh!

1098
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:24,640
<i>All right, kids.
This place better not be a mess.</i>

1099
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:27,120
I'm... home?

1100
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:29,440
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Mom.

1101
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:33,360
Miss Walden, home so soon?
The children were angels.

1102
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:35,680
<i>- Thanks, Mrs. Kwan.
- Hello, Joan.</i>

1103
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:38,840
Lawrence, what happened to you?

1104
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:43,720
They... happened to me.

1105
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:47,120
Your demonic children.

1106
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:50,080
<i>They destroyed your house!</i>

1107
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:52,880
Uh...

1108
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:56,200
<i>The house was alive.
The wall was made of paper.</i>

1109
01:08:56,320 --> 01:09:00,000
I fell off the cliff.
And the giant cat...

1110
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:03,960
The giant cat!

1111
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:05,880
Tell her.

1112
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:08,760
Larry, Larry.

1113
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:11,040
You look terrible,

1114
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,080
and my mom
thinks you're insane.

1115
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:17,680
This is what we in sales
call "a win-win scenario."

1116
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,960
Joan, you are passing up
the opportunity of a lifetime.

1117
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:25,720
You know what kind of kid
your boy is.

1118
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:29,120
I mean, who are you
going to believe?

1119
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:32,960
You're right. I do know
what kind of kid Conrad is.

1120
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:34,880
He can be irresponsible.

1121
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:37,240
Yes!
He makes bad choices.

1122
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:40,760
Sometimes he makes me
want to tear my hair out.
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1123
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:44,320
But he's a good kid,
and I believe in him.

1124
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:46,640
Now, I'd like you
to leave.

1125
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:49,800
Wha... Joan. Joan.

1126
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:53,040
Joan. Joan.

1127
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:57,960
Oh, Joan, Joan, Joan!

1128
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:08,880
- Will you marry me, Joan?

1129
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:11,840
Oh, Joan, Joan,
Joan, Joan.

1130
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:18,120
Yes!
Yeah!

1131
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:20,080
<i>Yeah!</i>

1132
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:24,800
Oh, that's nice.

1133
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:30,920
Mr. Humberfloob?
Whoa-ho-ho!

1134
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:34,880
Almost got me again.
Enjoy the party.

1135
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:39,000
<i>Mr. Humberfloob.
Joan, the party's a hit
and the house is immaculate.</i>

1136
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:41,120
Congratulations.

1137
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:43,400
<i>Miss Walden. Uh, Miss Walden.</i>

1138
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:46,480
Chicka-ow, chicka-ow,
chica-yee-haw!
Hi, Mom!

1139
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:49,680
<i>Honey, your cupcakes
are a huge hit.
What did you put in them?</i>

1140
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:52,920
Mom, you can make cupcakes
out of anything.

1141
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,280
<i>Are you telling me
you can make cupcakes
out of anything?</i>

1142
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:59,760
- Anything.
- Anything?

1143
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:02,200
So what did you kids
do today, huh?

1144
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:05,640
<i>Well, what would you do
if your mother asked you?</i>

1145
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,920
<i>The family was whole,
all thanks to the Cat,</i>

1146
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,880
<i>who was dashing and charming,
no doubt about that.</i>

1147
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,800
<i>He was witty and cultured...</i>

1148
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,840
<i>and, well, very endearing...</i>

1149
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:17,920
<i>and tremendously attractive,</i>

1150
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:20,120
but in a sort of real way.

1151
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:23,320
You know, kind of
an approachable way that I think
you don't see these days...

1152
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:26,200
Oh! Hello! I was just, uh...

1153
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:29,640
I really should be going.

1154
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:31,960
How'd they get so smart?

1155
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:39,320
Oh, yeah!

1156
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:42,000
Whoo!

1157
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,840
Come on, Things!
Let's go!

1158
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:58,200
What's on my schedule
for tomorrow?

1159
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:01,160
What do you say
we go on vacation?

1160
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:04,920
How 'bout Hawaii?
I like Hawaii.

1161
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,680
I should warn you,
there are certain places that
don't allow certain Things.
