1
00:00:32,326 --> 00:00:35,366
- Is the orchestra tuning?
- 15 seconds.

2
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,952
She's good.

3
00:04:49,033 --> 00:04:51,152
Good, huh?

4
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:53,953
Yes, she's good.

5
00:04:56,313 --> 00:04:58,833
As good as you?

6
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,233
Maybe.

7
00:05:09,154 --> 00:05:11,154
Haha. Better.

8
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:29,156
She was only showing how good she is.

9
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:31,557
I know how good she is.

10
00:05:32,237 --> 00:05:33,997
Or she wouldn't be with us.

11
00:05:45,518 --> 00:05:51,039
Now, there's to be no fighting
amongst us. Understood?

12
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:57,239
Here they come.

13
00:06:15,281 --> 00:06:18,882
I wish you wouldn't smoke.

14
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:23,762
I should never have ever sent to America.
They've got such appalling habits.

15
00:06:23,882 --> 00:06:26,579
- As if no one smoked in Lugash.
- That's different.

16
00:06:26,618 --> 00:06:30,722
Umm, of course. And there's nothing
wrong with America, Father.

17
00:06:30,842 --> 00:06:36,523
- My mother was American.
- Your mother never smoked.

18
00:06:36,643 --> 00:06:38,644
I'm surprised that you noticed.

19
00:06:38,683 --> 00:06:43,524
She wasn't dead 3 weeks three weeks
before you married that... woman.

20
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:50,324
You'll be on doubt pleased to know,
I am about to pay the price for that folly.

21
00:06:50,925 --> 00:06:55,685
- So the rumor's true?
- Yes it would seem so.

22
00:06:55,805 --> 00:06:59,965
Yasmin, please, keep it to yourself.

23
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:05,006
I don't want to alert your Stepmother
until I have proof.

24
00:07:20,087 --> 00:07:22,088
Card.

25
00:07:27,329 --> 00:07:31,049
- Praise Allah that someone
in this family is lucky.
_ Huh.

26
00:07:33,489 --> 00:07:38,290
- Cash this in.
- How did you know I can be trusted?

27
00:07:40,809 --> 00:07:44,970
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were one of my bodyguards.
It's alright...

28
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:48,650
What's the going rate on a slap these days?

29
00:07:51,851 --> 00:07:53,651
You're cheap.

30
00:07:54,011 --> 00:07:56,012
Thank you Sir.

31
00:07:58,931 --> 00:08:03,252
I must apologize for my daughter.
She's a very high spirited girl.

32
00:08:23,614 --> 00:08:25,614
Look, a flare.

33
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:04,698
- Yasmin, go to your cabin.
- Wait a minute. - Now

34
00:09:07,218 --> 00:09:09,379
Gentlemen...

35
00:11:06,951 --> 00:11:11,511
- Haven't we met before?
- Not formally.

36
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:23,953
Be a nice little princess and go to sleep.

37
00:11:36,274 --> 00:11:38,274
Hi, Dad.

38
00:11:42,834 --> 00:11:45,475
To save your daughter,
you must do two things.

39
00:11:45,515 --> 00:11:50,555
First $ 100 million to be deposited
into a Swiss bank account.

40
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:55,116
- No problem.
- Second: You abdicate.

41
00:11:56,515 --> 00:12:00,916
Renounce the throne?
That is impossible.

42
00:12:02,357 --> 00:12:05,276
Then Yasmin will die.

43
00:12:05,397 --> 00:12:08,717
Who will succeed me?

44
00:12:08,877 --> 00:12:11,037
All in good time.

45
00:12:11,158 --> 00:12:16,638
What a shame, I enjoyed your
company at the table.

46
00:12:16,758 --> 00:12:18,998
And I yours.

47
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,961
Hey, stop. I said stop.

48
00:12:45,721 --> 00:12:50,802
I haven't time to deal with
some bumpkin cop, lose him.

49
00:12:51,961 --> 00:12:54,362
I said stop.

50
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,522
Can you hear me?

51
00:13:01,442 --> 00:13:03,563
I think we lost him.

52
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:05,723
Yeah.

53
00:13:07,723 --> 00:13:08,683
Look out!

54
00:13:16,404 --> 00:13:18,525
- Are you alright?
- Yes. - No.

55
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:25,165
- One of my passengers is injured.
- No wonder, the way you drive it's a
wonder they're not all dead.

56
00:13:25,285 --> 00:13:29,405
- They way I drive? - Yes.
- Could we please settle this at the hospital?

57
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:33,365
No. I'm Police Commissioner Dreyfus, and
I demand to see your driving license.

58
00:13:34,445 --> 00:13:36,486
As you wish.

59
00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:46,327
Ahh!... That felt good.

60
00:13:46,967 --> 00:13:49,607
Now then. Is anyone hurt?

61
00:13:49,727 --> 00:13:53,568
- Yes, in the van.
- My sister is unconscious.
- She is?

62
00:13:53,688 --> 00:13:56,248
- She should be taken to the hospital.
- Where is she?

63
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:58,008
In the van.

64
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:03,449
- Excuse me, your sister is in his van?
- No.
- That's not my van.

65
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:08,889
- Look, I'm Commissioner Dreyfus, if you will allow me...
- Excuse me. Just a moment, just a moment.

66
00:14:09,009 --> 00:14:15,890
When.. Excuse me, when I asked you if anyone was hurt,
you replied: Yes, in my van.

67
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:20,491
No, no, I said: Yes, in the
van, not in my van.

68
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:25,171
No, no, you did not say: Yes in the van. Not yes in the van.

69
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:30,532
- You said: Yes. You do not say: Yes, my van. Not yes the van.
- Look... - You said yes my van, not yes in the van

70
00:14:30,652 --> 00:14:33,692
- Did you hear what I just said?
- Yes, I heard.

71
00:14:33,812 --> 00:14:36,812
- It's my van.
- Now we're getting somewhere.

72
00:14:36,932 --> 00:14:42,053
- Listen, you imbecile...
- Wait sir, I am an Officer of the "Lour".

73
00:14:42,253 --> 00:14:48,094
- I said-
- I know what you said. I am an Officer of the "Lour".

74
00:14:48,453 --> 00:14:51,494
Please, my sister may be dying.

75
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:57,015
Please stand back, stand back.

76
00:15:02,654 --> 00:15:08,536
- Have you been hunting?
- Yes. Hunting. Very perceptive.

77
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:31,498
Who are you?

78
00:15:31,617 --> 00:15:37,138
I am Gendarme Jacques
Gambrelli, 2nd Class.

79
00:15:37,258 --> 00:15:41,099
- Who are you?
- I am...

80
00:16:00,861 --> 00:16:04,141
Your sister is very...

81
00:16:04,581 --> 00:16:06,741
Very unconscious

82
00:16:06,901 --> 00:16:10,382
I suspect that she has received
a "burmp" on the head.

83
00:16:10,821 --> 00:16:12,822
- A bump.
- What?

84
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:15,782
Never mind. Come, Franзois.

85
00:16:16,662 --> 00:16:20,143
She requires immediately the emergency treatment, Mr..? er...

86
00:16:20,263 --> 00:16:24,783
- Jones.
- Take her quickly to the Nice hospital, Mr. Jones.

87
00:16:24,903 --> 00:16:28,983
And I will phone ahead to find out...

88
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:34,304
Mr. Jones, please stop. Mr Jones, my hand, my finger.
Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones please stop, Mr. Jones...

89
00:16:51,306 --> 00:16:56,226
I have no time now for you to show me your
credentials. Do not drive off...

90
00:16:56,347 --> 00:17:02,907
But I have an idea. You shall drive me,
you shall drive me to the nearest phone...

91
00:17:11,628 --> 00:17:14,828
Sorry we are late, but we've had a car accident.

92
00:17:14,948 --> 00:17:19,389
- Nothing too serious, I trust?
- We are lucky to be alive.

93
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:21,869
Be seated.

94
00:17:21,989 --> 00:17:27,750
Now Chief, listen. Normally investigation of crimes
committed in French territorial waters is your responsibility.

95
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:31,630
But as this kidnapping is politically so important
to the Government,

96
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,711
The president has ordered me to
personally take charge of the case.

97
00:17:35,831 --> 00:17:39,951
Understand, he does not think that you are
less qualified for this than I, but...

98
00:17:40,071 --> 00:17:44,551
- Maybe I think...
- More qualified.

99
00:17:44,671 --> 00:17:49,871
- So. What are your orders?
- First i want to know everything that is known about the case.

100
00:17:49,992 --> 00:17:52,792
- This is everything we have to date.
- Oh, good.

101
00:17:52,912 --> 00:17:57,312
- Then I'll want your best man to liaison.
- That will be Gambrelli.

102
00:17:59,352 --> 00:18:04,713
I'll study the report tonight, and I'll
see you here in the morning at 9:00 o'clock.

103
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:09,474
Oh, by the way, there was a
police officer at the accident.

104
00:18:09,594 --> 00:18:13,514
How shall I... he had an odd way of speaking.

105
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:16,914
- Mispronouncing words.
- No.

106
00:18:18,274 --> 00:18:23,795
- He crashed his bicycle into our car.
- Doesn't ring a bell.

107
00:18:23,955 --> 00:18:28,076
Perhaps it's not that important.
See you in the morning.

108
00:18:35,036 --> 00:18:39,317
- A fine room for Your Highness.
- I want water.

109
00:18:41,357 --> 00:18:45,597
- Can you get me water now?
- Yes, Of course.

110
00:18:48,997 --> 00:18:51,758
- Take your clothes off.
- No.

111
00:18:52,838 --> 00:18:56,359
- Take your clothes off!
- No.

112
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:01,399
Let go. Get you hands off me.

113
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,368
What about the Cop?
The longer we wait...

114
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,321
He'll probably show up at the hospital.

115
00:19:23,201 --> 00:19:24,121
Arnon.

116
00:19:26,282 --> 00:19:28,002
Try to make it look like an accident.

117
00:19:36,202 --> 00:19:41,443
- What makes you think they'll show up?
- It's just a hunch.

118
00:19:46,323 --> 00:19:48,324
Look.

119
00:20:29,048 --> 00:20:32,328
- It wont be long.
- Why not?

120
00:20:32,568 --> 00:20:35,529
Because something there's something phoney about Mr. Jones...

121
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:38,529
and those hunters with their automatic weapons.

122
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:42,209
Then Mr. Jones just wanted to get out of there...

123
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:47,330
I don't believe he had any intention of
take his sister to the hospital.

124
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:51,770
It it looks like you might be right.

125
00:22:23,539 --> 00:22:28,620
- What is he doing?
- What does it look like he's doing?

126
00:23:54,109 --> 00:23:58,990
- Has he drowned?
- He can't. Not yet.

127
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:10,390
What am I doing?
I can't swim, help, help.

128
00:24:11,591 --> 00:24:14,671
- What's wrong?
- I can't swim.

129
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:16,791
Neither can I.

130
00:24:16,911 --> 00:24:23,070
- Then why aren't you drowning?.
- Because you see, there's sand... yes, sand.
- What? - Stand. - Ha ha ha!

131
00:24:26,312 --> 00:24:30,193
- Who are you?
- Gendarme 2nd class Jacques Gambrelli.

132
00:24:30,273 --> 00:24:34,513
- Who are you?
- Commissioner Dreyfus. Police.

133
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:39,034
Come on, Gambrelli. I'll give you a lift home.

134
00:24:46,274 --> 00:24:49,035
But why would the man in the
van want to kill me?

135
00:24:49,394 --> 00:24:54,435
Maybe it has something to do with the unconscious girl.
You had a good look at her, didn't you?.

136
00:24:56,355 --> 00:25:02,916
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes of starry skies...

137
00:25:03,516 --> 00:25:05,196
Very Poetic.

138
00:25:05,316 --> 00:25:08,797
- Yes, "Lurd" Byron.
- "Lurd".

139
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:20,637
Thank you for the lift
Commissioner, good night.

140
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:23,958
Wait here.

141
00:25:24,678 --> 00:25:29,158
- Do you live here alone Gambrelli?
- Oh no, I live with my mother.

142
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:34,519
- I... I'd like to meet your mother.
- Why not, everyone wants to meet my mother.

143
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:40,560
Oh, gee, this is Police Commissioner
Dreyfus, he wants to meet you.

144
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,000
How do you do, Mrs. Gambrelli?

145
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:48,001
- I hope it's not too late?
- No no, please, come in Commissioner.

146
00:25:53,481 --> 00:25:56,522
I'm sorry, I must explain.

147
00:25:58,562 --> 00:26:02,882
- I'm sorry, I must explain. I'm... i'm a bit wet.
- Please be seated. - Thanks.

148
00:26:07,282 --> 00:26:10,203
I am... I am just going upstairs to change my clothes.

149
00:26:10,323 --> 00:26:12,723
- Do you speak Italian Commissioner?
- No, not really.

150
00:26:13,012 --> 00:26:14,163
- Darling.
- Yes.

151
00:26:14,953 --> 00:26:15,746
Speak Italian.

152
00:26:16,058 --> 00:26:17,113
Yes.

153
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:19,289
How do you know this man?

154
00:26:20,302 --> 00:26:22,652
He gave me a lift in his car.

155
00:26:23,296 --> 00:26:24,857
Why do you so upset?

156
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,800
The world is full of strange crazy people.

157
00:26:29,364 --> 00:26:32,531
Now, bring the Commissioner down one of your robes.

158
00:26:32,532 --> 00:26:33,491
Make it quick!

159
00:26:39,286 --> 00:26:42,126
He's just like his father.

160
00:26:42,246 --> 00:26:46,086
- Would you care to join me in the kitchen?
- I would indeed.

161
00:27:07,409 --> 00:27:10,889
It's refreshing to hear some
good singing for a change.

162
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:13,930
Jacques loves opera.

163
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:31,371
- Are you musically inclined, Madame?
- No.

164
00:27:31,491 --> 00:27:36,051
- Was his father?
- He played the French horn.

165
00:27:36,412 --> 00:27:38,412
That probably accounts for it.

166
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:11,695
Why did you name him Jacques?

167
00:28:11,816 --> 00:28:16,696
- Why not, is a beautiful French name.
- Yes, but you're Italian.

168
00:28:22,536 --> 00:28:26,656
I knew a man once named Jacques.

169
00:28:26,776 --> 00:28:29,857
When he died ten years ago I said:

170
00:28:29,977 --> 00:28:34,337
Thank God, there can never,
never be another one like him.

171
00:28:34,497 --> 00:28:37,218
And then, I met your son.

172
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:56,260
So I decided he would be better
of if he never knew.

173
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:59,580
- You mean his father is...
- Clouseau.

174
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:03,300
No, never.

175
00:29:13,061 --> 00:29:15,302
Oh, Commissioner.

176
00:29:23,462 --> 00:29:27,423
Your Highness? Yasmin?

177
00:29:29,783 --> 00:29:33,303
I have a... a little snacky for you.

178
00:29:49,825 --> 00:29:53,266
Under different circumstances
we could have had such fun.

179
00:29:55,706 --> 00:29:57,866
What happened?

180
00:29:58,586 --> 00:30:02,026
Make sure she doesn't get out again.

181
00:30:02,546 --> 00:30:05,107
We need to get you a doctor.

182
00:30:16,908 --> 00:30:19,789
- How are you?
- Terrible.

183
00:30:19,868 --> 00:30:22,828
- No doubt that was a "Burmb".
- A what?

184
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:24,989
- A bomb.
- A bo..

185
00:30:25,429 --> 00:30:27,750
You need to rest, Charles.

186
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:31,950
- How do you know my first name?
- You told me in the ambulance.

187
00:30:32,069 --> 00:30:36,710
Strange, I don't remember.
But I remember you.

188
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:41,471
You said: My name is Charlie
Dreyfus and I'm going to be a policeman.

189
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:46,631
I used to say that as a child.
I must have been delirious.

190
00:30:46,751 --> 00:30:49,832
- No, you were very sweet.
- I was?

191
00:30:50,591 --> 00:30:54,472
What's this? What's this?
Something's happened.

192
00:31:10,595 --> 00:31:11,554
Stop it!

193
00:31:19,995 --> 00:31:20,955
- Give it to me!
- Stop it...

194
00:31:26,235 --> 00:31:28,955
Something terrible has happening.

195
00:31:30,915 --> 00:31:34,476
- Now don't play with it again.
- Thank you nurse.

196
00:31:34,636 --> 00:31:36,916
No no no, you should relax now.

197
00:31:37,036 --> 00:31:40,756
No, I can't relax.
I have to tell him something.

198
00:31:40,876 --> 00:31:46,397
- What's his name, your son? Jacques. Listen Jacques,
I'm wanting to tell you, you are in great danger.

199
00:31:46,517 --> 00:31:50,437
- I am?
- Franзois, where is the chief's report? - Ah. Here.

200
00:31:52,038 --> 00:31:55,398
There. You remember the unconscious girl you saw in the van?

201
00:31:55,558 --> 00:31:57,999
Oh. How could I ever forget her?

202
00:31:58,119 --> 00:32:01,959
"Beauty, too rich for use, for earth too dear"...

203
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:06,559
- Jacques loves poetry.
- Yes, I know, I want you to look at this photograph.

204
00:32:06,719 --> 00:32:09,400
My God, but it is she, how did you know?

205
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,439
- Just a hunch.
- A what?.

206
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,801
- Who is she, what is she doing in this photograph?
- She is Princess Yasmin.

207
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,240
A Princess? Kidnapped? Mama is she not beautiful?

208
00:32:21,401 --> 00:32:24,401
Not bad for a princess.

209
00:32:25,441 --> 00:32:29,522
Evening Commissioner. At ease Gambrelli.
I'm glad to see that you are not hurt, Madame.

210
00:32:29,562 --> 00:32:30,482
Thank you Chief.

211
00:32:30,681 --> 00:32:34,962
- And I'm particularly happy that you're still with us Commissioner.
- Oh, I'm sure you must be.

212
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:38,443
And I'm particularly happy that you
you assigned me Officer Gambrelli.

213
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:39,923
Really?

214
00:32:39,963 --> 00:32:44,203
Without him I might not have discovered that the
Princess was being held here in the south of France.

215
00:32:44,323 --> 00:32:48,484
- I will put a general alarm immediately.
- You will do nothing of the kind until I give the word.

216
00:32:48,604 --> 00:32:53,964
Meanwhile, Officer Gambrelli's
mother needs a safe place to stay, so...

217
00:32:54,084 --> 00:32:57,084
Since I'm going be here a while so
she can have my suite at the hotel.

218
00:32:57,125 --> 00:32:58,044
Oh, but I can't.

219
00:32:58,365 --> 00:33:01,004
You must, please.

220
00:33:01,124 --> 00:33:04,165
Whatever they need Franзois.
Around the clock protection Chief.

221
00:33:04,205 --> 00:33:05,125
God bless you.

222
00:33:06,645 --> 00:33:08,606
Come on.

223
00:33:16,126 --> 00:33:17,886
Get out!

224
00:33:38,369 --> 00:33:43,609
Wait, I... I just remembered something
that I forgot to say to the Commissioner.

225
00:33:43,729 --> 00:33:45,529
I will bring the car around.

226
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:47,769
No no no, if it's not much trouble

227
00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:49,930
I'd rather you take my Mother to
the hotel and then come back for me.

228
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:56,410
You go that way.

229
00:34:41,575 --> 00:34:45,336
Sorry, sorry.

230
00:35:01,897 --> 00:35:06,898
- Why don't you just ask for a doctor.
- Don't worry we'll find one.

231
00:35:42,901 --> 00:35:47,982
If you are looking for a
Doctor, I am very good doctor.

232
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:54,223
I'll be in Surgery.

233
00:35:56,623 --> 00:35:58,583
Ambulance.

234
00:35:58,703 --> 00:36:04,504
- Yes? - Are you are a Doctor?
- Yes, I am a very good doctor.

235
00:36:04,744 --> 00:36:08,584
- Then would you mind coming with us, please?
- Oh, It would be a delight.

236
00:36:29,066 --> 00:36:31,667
You are looking as beautiful as ever.

237
00:36:31,827 --> 00:36:34,947
And you still look as elegant and handsome.

238
00:36:38,267 --> 00:36:43,588
We haven't been in this place here together, how long?

239
00:36:43,708 --> 00:36:45,987
Ten years?

240
00:36:46,107 --> 00:36:48,228
Minimum.

241
00:36:49,668 --> 00:36:54,589
You wanted to see me. Why?

242
00:36:54,869 --> 00:36:57,789
I thought I should give you my support.

243
00:36:57,909 --> 00:37:00,029
That's very considerate of you.

244
00:37:00,189 --> 00:37:04,190
I beleive one of the ransom conditions
is that you have to give your throne.

245
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:05,830
Yes.

246
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:09,190
Will you do that?

247
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:15,350
It's possible. As long as my successor is not an Army man.

248
00:37:17,751 --> 00:37:20,191
Well, I'm sure it wont.

249
00:37:23,392 --> 00:37:25,952
I wont forget that.

250
00:37:33,393 --> 00:37:37,193
Obviously he doesn't have
much faith in the military.

251
00:37:37,353 --> 00:37:40,954
People have been saying that he knows that
we're sleeping together.

252
00:37:41,074 --> 00:37:44,634
- Do you think that is all that he knows?
- Hmmm.

253
00:37:44,754 --> 00:37:48,594
Or right now, you would be soup for my supper.

254
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:58,116
- Yes?
- It's the doctor.

255
00:37:59,596 --> 00:38:03,195
Finally. Come in, Doctor.

256
00:38:03,755 --> 00:38:05,756
Good evening.

257
00:38:08,236 --> 00:38:11,117
What? What seems to be the problem?

258
00:38:12,116 --> 00:38:15,437
You have received the blemish in your arm, eh?.

259
00:38:15,557 --> 00:38:18,557
I beleive it may require some stitches.

260
00:38:18,678 --> 00:38:21,037
- What do you think?
- Ohh!

261
00:38:22,598 --> 00:38:28,318
Oh yes, I think you need to do something
to keep you from fainting, yes.

262
00:38:28,518 --> 00:38:31,279
You must take deep breaths, like this.

263
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:38,919
See? Then you don't faint, but deep, very, very deep.

264
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,521
- What happened?
- You hyper-ventilated.

265
00:38:49,681 --> 00:38:52,320
I did? Where?

266
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,801
- You fainted.
- Oh, That I know.

267
00:38:57,521 --> 00:39:01,521
Well, are you going to stitch up my arm or not?

268
00:39:01,641 --> 00:39:06,122
Of course, I am going to stitch up.. Phew!.. Up your arm...

269
00:39:07,042 --> 00:39:11,603
But first I must check...

270
00:39:11,723 --> 00:39:16,803
if you are physically fit.

271
00:39:17,283 --> 00:39:21,204
Fit as a fiddle. Very good.

272
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:31,325
And now...

273
00:39:32,325 --> 00:39:35,965
...must check your reflexes.

274
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:42,206
Reflexes of a fiddle.

275
00:39:42,366 --> 00:39:45,285
Very good. And now...

276
00:40:07,088 --> 00:40:10,449
It must be somewhere.

277
00:40:14,769 --> 00:40:18,810
This is very good. Do you know
what is this? Very good.

278
00:40:18,929 --> 00:40:21,010
My dentist uses this.

279
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:25,690
He pulls my WIS.. wisdom tooth

280
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:28,890
and I didn't even feel it.

281
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:32,971
- Novocain.
- No. No, no.

282
00:40:33,091 --> 00:40:37,051
Dentist, his name is Fishburne.

283
00:40:38,891 --> 00:40:42,212
Dr. Marvin Fishburne.

284
00:40:42,932 --> 00:40:47,612
I highly recommend him, seriously.

285
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:59,333
I think I stabbed myself in the cheek.

286
00:41:01,054 --> 00:41:04,814
Now, before I can stitch up your arm...

287
00:41:06,094 --> 00:41:09,214
I must inject you.

288
00:41:09,374 --> 00:41:11,534
Hold still. Hold... hold still.

289
00:41:11,655 --> 00:41:13,935
Hold still.

290
00:41:19,896 --> 00:41:21,856
Very good.

291
00:41:25,976 --> 00:41:26,936
Good.

292
00:41:35,617 --> 00:41:39,017
Now, Ok, it's, it's, it's getting very late.

293
00:41:39,417 --> 00:41:41,658
And I think...

294
00:41:42,658 --> 00:41:46,858
I get back to... the the Hospital and surgery.

295
00:41:46,978 --> 00:41:49,379
I am very important.

296
00:41:50,619 --> 00:41:52,619
Bye-bye.

297
00:41:56,819 --> 00:42:02,540
On second thought, I am in no condition to operate.

298
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:08,141
Better that I stay here, with you.

299
00:42:09,061 --> 00:42:13,301
If you need me, I am here, with you.

300
00:42:13,461 --> 00:42:17,902
I'm here, now just relax...

301
00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:23,782
We've run into a slight complication...

302
00:42:23,943 --> 00:42:28,102
It makes it impractical for us to stay here any longer.

303
00:42:28,262 --> 00:42:32,463
Yeah, yeah. If all goes well,
We will be in Darfur by tomorrow afternoon.

304
00:42:53,665 --> 00:42:56,826
"But, sof... soft"

305
00:42:56,945 --> 00:43:02,106
"What light through yonder window breaks?"...

306
00:43:02,227 --> 00:43:07,947
"It is the east, and Juliet is the sun"

307
00:43:12,467 --> 00:43:14,507
Romeo?

308
00:43:14,627 --> 00:43:17,388
Er, no.. Hic.. Jacques.

309
00:43:17,507 --> 00:43:20,908
- You know what they say?
- No.

310
00:43:21,028 --> 00:43:23,268
"A rose by any name"...

311
00:43:23,388 --> 00:43:26,388
"Would smell as sweet"

312
00:43:28,275 --> 00:43:31,712
What are you doing here sweetie?

313
00:43:31,732 --> 00:43:34,591
I came to rescue... hic... rescue you.

314
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:37,430
- Hold your breath.
- My breath?

315
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:45,111
- Longer. - I can't.
- Ohhh...

316
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:47,510
I'll help. Try again, look.

317
00:43:59,752 --> 00:44:01,792
It's no use.

318
00:44:02,592 --> 00:44:06,393
There is one other way.

319
00:44:06,513 --> 00:44:11,473
A little extreme but it always works.

320
00:44:21,516 --> 00:44:24,795
- Hello?
- Did I wake you?

321
00:44:25,595 --> 00:44:26,555
No.

322
00:44:27,314 --> 00:44:31,715
- Are you alone?
- No, I am in bed with a beautiful woman.

323
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:35,596
Do not lie. Not even in fun.

324
00:44:35,716 --> 00:44:41,397
I just spoke to our friend in France. Something's
come up, and he plans to visit uncle Idris.

325
00:44:41,836 --> 00:44:45,357
- So?
- Evidently, he had no alternative.

326
00:44:45,477 --> 00:44:48,517
Rumor has it that the king return
back to town tomorrow.

327
00:44:48,757 --> 00:44:54,438
Right. This place is getting
a little to close to Uncle Idris for comfort.

328
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:58,518
- Will I see you tomorrow?
- Of course.

329
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:04,598
Your hiccups are gone.

330
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:08,199
Incredible. How did you discover that?

331
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:12,520
I was engaged to a football player
when I went to college in the U.S..

332
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:15,360
He always had the hiccups.

333
00:45:15,439 --> 00:45:19,800
Who could blame him.
How about you?

334
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:24,681
- I've never had hiccups. - Never?
- But if I ever do, then...

335
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:26,481
I hope to you find in the neighbourhood.

336
00:45:26,601 --> 00:45:31,481
I'll consider it an honor
and a privilege to be of assistance.

337
00:45:33,802 --> 00:45:39,202
- How long have you been a policeman, Officer Gambrelli?
- Oh. Three years next May.

338
00:45:39,322 --> 00:45:41,962
How long have you been Princess, Your Highness?

339
00:45:42,082 --> 00:45:46,603
- All my life.
- That's a long time to be anything.

340
00:45:48,803 --> 00:45:54,444
- Do you like being a cop?
- Yes sometimes. How is it being a princess?

341
00:45:54,524 --> 00:45:58,924
- It's not much fun.
- Oh, the fun is important.

342
00:45:59,804 --> 00:46:03,724
What else is important to you?

343
00:46:03,845 --> 00:46:05,924
- Oh... Singing.
- Yes...

344
00:46:15,525 --> 00:46:17,886
That... is terrible.

345
00:46:18,006 --> 00:46:20,567
Yes, and poetry.

346
00:46:20,687 --> 00:46:25,487
Parents of golden dreams,
the romance of the Queen's joy

347
00:46:25,607 --> 00:46:28,207
The airy dance

348
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:31,047
That's Byron.

349
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:34,688
And the rain.

350
00:46:34,968 --> 00:46:39,408
And sleeping. And my mother.

351
00:46:39,528 --> 00:46:42,769
- Do you like your mother?
- Yes, very much, yes. And women.

352
00:46:42,889 --> 00:46:45,968
What kind of women?

353
00:46:46,129 --> 00:46:51,810
All kinds. Especially
dark women with blue eyes...

354
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:58,210
and full red lips, who smell like night-blooming jasmine

355
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:03,451
and taste like warm mango.

356
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:06,131
Warm mango?

357
00:47:06,251 --> 00:47:08,331
And honey.

358
00:47:08,452 --> 00:47:11,811
- Oh my God.
- Mine too... hic...

359
00:47:24,453 --> 00:47:27,813
Playing Doctor?

360
00:47:27,934 --> 00:47:33,494
We're going on a little trip. And I think you'll
be much more comfortable asleep throughout the journey.

361
00:47:33,614 --> 00:47:36,614
Touch her and you'll answer to me.

362
00:48:02,217 --> 00:48:06,217
- There'll be nothing left of him when that goes off.
- He's coming out of it.

363
00:48:07,377 --> 00:48:09,377
Come.

364
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:35,940
You're driving too fast.

365
00:48:59,143 --> 00:49:02,183
- Ahh... Mama.
- Jacques, I was so worried.

366
00:49:03,783 --> 00:49:06,743
The Princess. They have taken the Princess!

367
00:49:07,104 --> 00:49:09,984
- Please, Jacques.
- I have to stop them.

368
00:49:11,663 --> 00:49:16,985
- You're not supposed to get up.
- I must. I must tell the Commissioner about Uncle Idris.

369
00:49:17,105 --> 00:49:21,345
I will tell the Commissioner about Uncle Idris?
Who is the uncle Idris?

370
00:49:21,465 --> 00:49:24,385
I don't know.

371
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:28,106
I remember he is someone, that they were going to
Darfur...

372
00:49:28,226 --> 00:49:30,865
to visit Uncle Idris.

373
00:49:31,306 --> 00:49:34,666
- Just keep quiet.
- Uncle Idris.

374
00:49:55,108 --> 00:49:58,389
- Well?
- They said he was in Room 408.

375
00:49:58,509 --> 00:50:00,549
I'll check.

376
00:50:07,669 --> 00:50:10,229
How is he?

377
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:13,430
Jacques just wanted to get out of bed come to...

378
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:18,070
come down here to tell you about a guy called Idris.

379
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:21,070
He said they were going a place called Darfur.

380
00:50:21,231 --> 00:50:26,351
Darfur? That's in a small military republic called Lugash.

381
00:50:27,431 --> 00:50:32,872
- Charles. - Yes, Maria.
- I'm worried about Jacques.

382
00:50:33,032 --> 00:50:38,072
There, there, if he's anything like his father,
he'll be alright, he'll manage.

383
00:50:38,193 --> 00:50:42,073
But that's the trouble, he's
too much like his father

384
00:50:42,193 --> 00:50:46,554
That's why I disappeared, came here and
encourage him in music and poetry

385
00:50:46,713 --> 00:50:51,274
but in spite of everything he
was determined to be a policeman.

386
00:50:52,034 --> 00:50:55,315
And to protect you, Charles?

387
00:50:56,794 --> 00:51:02,315
- You must know who his father was.
- His father, yes, was an idiot. I mean...

388
00:51:02,435 --> 00:51:06,876
- Yes, but I can not say that.
- Of course not.

389
00:51:07,836 --> 00:51:11,316
Clouseau has always been his hero.

390
00:51:11,436 --> 00:51:15,436
Imagine you've always wanted
be a great fisherman...

391
00:51:15,556 --> 00:51:20,357
and suddenly you discover that
your father was Captain Ahab.

392
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:23,357
Come here. Tell me...

393
00:51:23,477 --> 00:51:29,237
- You and Clouseau...
- I was very young.

394
00:51:29,478 --> 00:51:34,038
I know I still don't understand.
You, such a beautiful woman.

395
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:41,439
We were caught in a snowstorm,
I knew that if we didn't do something we would die.

396
00:51:41,639 --> 00:51:46,119
He said that the Alaskan Indians
keep from freezing to death by making love.

397
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:49,520
I was young, I wanted to live.

398
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,640
Do I hope you are not offended?

399
00:51:53,241 --> 00:51:58,041
No. It's just too bad you didn't have a stationary bike

400
00:51:58,161 --> 00:52:00,841
or a rowing machine or something.

401
00:52:01,001 --> 00:52:04,882
- So, I never would have had Jacques.
- Exactly, no no.

402
00:52:05,002 --> 00:52:07,842
I was a little brusque.

403
00:52:07,962 --> 00:52:14,835
Tell me, don't you think it's best if
you told him about his father now?

404
00:52:15,242 --> 00:52:19,123
Probably let him find out for himself later on.

405
00:52:21,643 --> 00:52:24,644
Yes, actually you're right.

406
00:52:44,885 --> 00:52:48,566
Oh, Chief, you look a bit frazzled.

407
00:52:48,686 --> 00:52:54,367
Why not, Officer Gambrelli
pushed me out of the window.

408
00:52:54,846 --> 00:52:59,687
Fortunately I held onto the telephone.

409
00:53:00,447 --> 00:53:03,127
And to make matters worse

410
00:53:03,247 --> 00:53:08,608
Officer Gambrelli wont tell me anything
until he's cleared it with you.

411
00:53:09,488 --> 00:53:12,769
Have you taken charge of this case Commissioner...

412
00:53:12,929 --> 00:53:15,688
But I am chief of police here.

413
00:53:15,809 --> 00:53:19,929
And as long as Officer
Gambrelli is on my force...

414
00:53:20,049 --> 00:53:26,946
I expect him to report to me
without your official permission!

415
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:32,090
And I always knew you were
a pompous pissant pip... pip...

416
00:53:37,691 --> 00:53:38,651
Commissioner.

417
00:53:55,892 --> 00:53:59,333
- Clouseau, my father.
- Yes.

418
00:54:01,053 --> 00:54:04,094
Why didn't you tell me?

419
00:54:04,253 --> 00:54:09,974
For the same reason I did not tell him.
I thought you would both be better off not knowing.

420
00:54:10,135 --> 00:54:13,255
Your father and I weren't in love.

421
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:17,335
We had a brief encounter in a blizzard.

422
00:54:17,455 --> 00:54:21,496
Why did you pretend my father was a
Italian French horn player.

423
00:54:21,615 --> 00:54:25,096
Well, for one thing to justify
your interest in music.

424
00:54:25,216 --> 00:54:27,816
Actually, Clouseau played the violin.

425
00:54:27,936 --> 00:54:33,616
Not well, but full of passion.
He made love the way he played violin.

426
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:39,017
- Why tell me now?
- Because in many ways you are like your father.

427
00:54:39,137 --> 00:54:43,858
Foolhardy, accident prone,
pigheaded, brave...

428
00:54:43,978 --> 00:54:46,178
Accident prone.

429
00:54:46,338 --> 00:54:50,818
I think it's important that you know
the things that kept him alive.

430
00:54:50,938 --> 00:54:56,179
Also all those things that he did not pay
attention too and that cost him his life.

431
00:54:56,579 --> 00:55:03,580
If I should die, I'll encounter the darkness
as a bride and encircle it with my arms.

432
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:06,020
- Shakespeare.
- Yes.

433
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:11,780
Excuse me, but you would want to know

434
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:15,821
Chief Lazar and Commissioner Dreyfus
are both in intensive care.

435
00:55:25,022 --> 00:55:27,702
- Have you told him?
- Yes.

436
00:55:27,822 --> 00:55:31,063
- Gendarme 2nd class Gambrelli
- Yes?

437
00:55:31,183 --> 00:55:35,263
- Looks like you're in charge now.
- Yes. -No.

438
00:55:35,583 --> 00:55:40,343
Time is running out for the princess.
Apart from me and Franзois...

439
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:44,624
Gambrelli officer is the only one
you can identify the kidnappers.

440
00:55:44,744 --> 00:55:47,665
But Charles he has
so little experience.

441
00:55:47,784 --> 00:55:50,704
His father was a patrolman
and became the...

442
00:55:50,744 --> 00:55:54,185
greatest detective in France
without any experience.

443
00:55:54,544 --> 00:55:59,026
If you are a Clouseau, you
can succeed without experience.

444
00:55:59,145 --> 00:56:02,905
- I hope you will now change your name?
- Why?

445
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:07,827
- You are a Clouseau.
- Yes but Gambrelli is a good name.

446
00:56:07,946 --> 00:56:10,066
Gambrelli.

447
00:56:10,186 --> 00:56:13,027
You can sing it. And you want me to change it?

448
00:56:13,147 --> 00:56:16,707
Sounds nice, your
father saved my life.

449
00:56:16,827 --> 00:56:21,067
Clouseau... OK.

450
00:56:21,228 --> 00:56:26,068
Franзois you are to see to it, that Gendarme
2nd Class Jacques Gambrelli be promoted...

451
00:56:26,108 --> 00:56:29,668
to Detective 1st Class Jacques
Clouseau, Junior.

452
00:56:29,789 --> 00:56:34,188
As fast as you can get him
new papers and a passport.

453
00:56:34,309 --> 00:56:39,230
Do not worry Maria, when the kidnappers
hear that a Clouseau is on their trail...

454
00:56:39,350 --> 00:56:42,709
they'll probably surrender without a fight.

455
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:44,830
Shut up.

456
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:46,630
Salute.

457
00:57:06,512 --> 00:57:10,353
- Dr. Balls?
- Who wants to know?

458
00:57:11,073 --> 00:57:16,793
Detective Jacques Clouseau,
2nd... 1st Class, Junior.

459
00:57:17,993 --> 00:57:21,154
I spoke with you on the phone earlier...

460
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:28,714
- Good evening.
- I am Madame balls.

461
00:57:32,634 --> 00:57:37,475
- You do not like him.
- I wouldn't know, I've never met your husband.

462
00:57:37,595 --> 00:57:41,555
- Who said anything about my husband?
- You said I do not look like him.

463
00:57:41,636 --> 00:57:46,916
- I meant your father.
- Well, why didn't you say so, I never met him either.

464
00:57:48,036 --> 00:57:51,436
He is a real Clouseau.

465
00:57:51,556 --> 00:57:55,197
- Detective Clouseau.
- 1st class, Junior.

466
00:57:55,317 --> 00:58:01,037
Of course. Dr. Auguste
Balls, totally at your service.

467
00:58:03,158 --> 00:58:08,359
You must forgive me for having Madame
Balls establish your authenticity.

468
00:58:08,478 --> 00:58:14,159
Many grims and charlatans
these days would use my talents.

469
00:58:14,599 --> 00:58:18,280
When you're a part of the game You can't be too careful.
Now, am I?

470
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:19,240
Yes.

471
00:58:19,679 --> 00:58:26,000
Happy to see the child of my oldest,
dearest and deadest friend.

472
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,881
And as I always used to think of him,
remember...

473
00:58:29,921 --> 00:58:36,481
If you need a disguise and duty calls,
look no further because you've got balls.

474
00:58:37,241 --> 00:58:39,682
Did you make that up?

475
00:58:39,802 --> 00:58:43,282
No, my genius lies in the art of transfiguration.

476
00:58:43,402 --> 00:58:47,763
My wife is the 'Emily Brontл' of the establishment.

477
00:58:48,843 --> 00:58:53,523
Congratulations. I also am a bit of a poet.

478
00:58:53,643 --> 00:58:58,444
You should go see Marta
Parmet's sonnets.

479
00:58:59,043 --> 00:59:03,404
She also makes the most delicious borscht.

480
00:59:03,604 --> 00:59:08,804
Now specifically,
how I can help the child of...

481
00:59:08,845 --> 00:59:12,965
my dearest, my best client?

482
00:59:13,085 --> 00:59:17,086
I need to get into Lugash,
without being recognized.

483
00:59:17,246 --> 00:59:19,606
Certainly.

484
00:59:26,086 --> 00:59:28,047
Marta.

485
00:59:31,327 --> 00:59:32,287
Hey.

486
00:59:34,367 --> 00:59:41,528
Martha, bring me the package
of the sickening beggar, number 2.

487
01:00:24,213 --> 01:00:26,213
Wait here.

488
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:41,780
That is why you asked me to meet you in the park?

489
01:01:41,861 --> 01:01:45,141
So you could attack me like
you attacked my father?

490
01:01:45,261 --> 01:01:49,901
Yes, I can honestly say that
your father would have been dead many times.

491
01:01:49,941 --> 01:01:54,342
But thanks to my surprise attacks keeping him
on his toes and alert to every danger.

492
01:01:55,341 --> 01:02:01,063
I am available if you are considering hiring me in
the same capacity I once served your father.

493
01:02:03,623 --> 01:02:06,063
Take a fortune cookie.

494
01:02:12,184 --> 01:02:14,584
What does it say?

495
01:02:14,703 --> 01:02:19,664
"You will hire an Oriental
family friend". Amazing.

496
01:02:19,784 --> 01:02:22,865
The plane will arrive on time in Lugash. He will be met
at the airport, where he will be taken to the hotel...

497
01:02:22,985 --> 01:02:27,065
where he will be contacted by one our Agents.

498
01:02:27,185 --> 01:02:30,546
We interrupt this broadcast to give
you an important news flash.

499
01:02:30,665 --> 01:02:36,065
A breaking story out of Nice reveals
that Clouseau may have had a child.

500
01:02:36,345 --> 01:02:41,986
According to an anonymous phone call it's stated
that Gendarme 2nd Class Jacques Gambrelli...

501
01:02:42,106 --> 01:02:47,587
Was in fact 1st Class Detective Jacques
Clouseau of the Nice Police Force.

502
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:52,987
Charles, have you seen the
morning paper?

503
01:02:53,107 --> 01:02:54,987
Detective Clouseau's Son.

504
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:15,470
He's being met by a French Agent, posing
as a Limo Driver.

505
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:24,910
- Mr. Gambrelli?
- Yes. -Me too.

506
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:28,391
- Mr. Gambrelli.
- Yes.

507
01:03:28,431 --> 01:03:31,951
I have to take you to your hotel room.
There is no need to register.

508
01:03:31,992 --> 01:03:37,672
Go to your room and wait
for a call from Mr. Wasim.

509
01:03:38,193 --> 01:03:41,753
- Who?
- Mr. Wasim.

510
01:03:41,912 --> 01:03:44,073
This way please.

511
01:03:45,433 --> 01:03:48,993
The son of France's greatest detective.

512
01:03:49,154 --> 01:03:53,514
Undoubtedly a gifted police officer in his own right.

513
01:03:53,674 --> 01:03:57,754
Probably new to Lugash.

514
01:03:58,355 --> 01:04:00,714
Then it isn't clear.

515
01:04:00,874 --> 01:04:05,315
- This will change our plans.
- I don't think so.

516
01:04:05,915 --> 01:04:11,636
We have always known that if we were discovered
we risked reprisal from our unstable neighbour.

517
01:04:12,235 --> 01:04:17,596
It may well be that France's greatest detective
can insure us against that discovery.

518
01:04:17,716 --> 01:04:19,276
How he can do that?

519
01:04:19,396 --> 01:04:23,597
By eliminating Uncle Idris or
or least taking credit for it.

520
01:04:23,717 --> 01:04:29,397
At least for the time being, make sure that
Detective Clouseau Junior is well protected.

521
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:50,600
Your Highness, please, put your legs
around my waist.

522
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:54,520
- In your dreams.
- As you wish.

523
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:00,721
You can't take me down, what are you doing?.

524
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,681
Geronimo!

525
01:05:08,722 --> 01:05:12,202
Jumping without a parachute.

526
01:05:12,362 --> 01:05:15,882
Highness stop beating me or I'm going to drop you.

527
01:05:16,002 --> 01:05:20,363
Really? I'm your ticket to paradise.

528
01:05:35,684 --> 01:05:40,164
Mr. Gambrelli room.
For you, it's Mr. Wasim.

529
01:05:40,405 --> 01:05:41,365
Thank you.

530
01:05:43,164 --> 01:05:44,045
Hello?

531
01:05:44,085 --> 01:05:47,965
Meet me in Ohmar's
Oasis at 10 o'clock.

532
01:05:48,086 --> 01:05:50,686
I'll be wearing a red carnation... Argghh...

533
01:06:23,049 --> 01:06:26,689
- Welcome to my home away from home, Your Highness.
- Who are you?

534
01:06:26,809 --> 01:06:30,850
I am Atif Idris Al Sheikh Al Sabah.

535
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:33,690
You can call me Uncle Idris.

536
01:06:33,810 --> 01:06:39,570
What's wrong with my disguise?
Dr. Ball said it was a totally original creation.

537
01:06:47,212 --> 01:06:50,212
Mr. Gambrelli's room.

538
01:06:50,332 --> 01:06:52,612
It's Commissioner Dreyfus.

539
01:06:56,492 --> 01:06:59,533
Give me the phone.

540
01:07:02,293 --> 01:07:03,253
Hello?

541
01:07:03,573 --> 01:07:04,533
Hello?

542
01:07:06,613 --> 01:07:07,573
Hello?

543
01:07:10,133 --> 01:07:11,093
Where are you?

544
01:07:14,054 --> 01:07:15,014
Hello?

545
01:07:15,615 --> 01:07:16,575
- Yes?
- Hello?

546
01:07:18,414 --> 01:07:19,375
- What happened?
- Hello.

547
01:07:20,615 --> 01:07:22,575
- Commissioner?
- Yes.

548
01:07:22,695 --> 01:07:28,415
I'm sorry to do this, but I want you pack
you bags and catch next plane home.

549
01:07:29,095 --> 01:07:34,937
You've become a politically hot potato.
The French Government can't protect you.

550
01:07:35,097 --> 01:07:39,376
- Then what about the princess?
- Officially she's not your concern any more.

551
01:07:39,537 --> 01:07:45,337
Maybe not officially, but unofficially
she will always be my concern.

552
01:07:48,338 --> 01:07:51,058
I think I'll go with you anyway.

553
01:07:51,178 --> 01:07:54,738
No Cato, one hot potato is too much.

554
01:09:12,706 --> 01:09:15,946
Is it really you? You are...

555
01:09:16,307 --> 01:09:21,387
I'm not wanting to be difficult about it,
but will you give me your autograph?

556
01:09:22,228 --> 01:09:25,868
- What?
- I do not have the pen. Do you have the pen?

557
01:09:25,987 --> 01:09:28,588
- No.
- Anyone have a pen?

558
01:09:32,828 --> 01:09:36,629
You write: To Wafiyyah.

559
01:09:36,749 --> 01:09:40,669
- Yes, but I do not have any paper.
- Not on paper, here.

560
01:09:41,349 --> 01:09:42,309
- There?
- Yes.

561
01:09:42,949 --> 01:09:45,950
To my girlfriend. Hurry.

562
01:09:47,710 --> 01:09:52,070
Hurry, if not finish my dance,
Omar he cut off my nipples.

563
01:09:53,631 --> 01:09:57,071
This not right, "Gambrelli"?

564
01:09:57,191 --> 01:10:02,792
No, Clouseau. I saw your picture. Very beautiful.

565
01:10:04,271 --> 01:10:06,512
Is this Omar?

566
01:10:06,992 --> 01:10:09,112
Music, Mufib.

567
01:10:35,595 --> 01:10:39,715
- Where is the princess?
- Not far away from here. I can take you to her.

568
01:10:39,835 --> 01:10:43,315
- We haven't much time.
- Why? What time is it now?

569
01:10:43,436 --> 01:10:45,676
A quarter past three.

570
01:10:55,837 --> 01:10:57,837
My nose.

571
01:11:02,517 --> 01:11:05,518
With permission. Thanks

572
01:11:11,718 --> 01:11:14,519
They're going to kill you, follow me.

573
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:28,320
Wafiyyah he's Clouseau.

574
01:11:35,921 --> 01:11:38,121
Pervert.

575
01:11:50,522 --> 01:11:52,843
In here, in the kitchen.

576
01:12:15,605 --> 01:12:18,925
- Come, this way.
- Not until you tell me who you are?

577
01:12:19,046 --> 01:12:24,326
- Colonel Al-Durai, Lugash special services.
I'm here to help you rescue the Princess.
- Where is the Princess?

578
01:12:24,446 --> 01:12:29,047
She's being held in a desert hideout about 20
kilometres north-east of Ksar el Kabir.

579
01:12:29,167 --> 01:12:32,327
What is this? I'm ruined.

580
01:12:32,487 --> 01:12:35,647
It's not fine to be like this, you
will be compensated. Where is your car?

581
01:12:35,767 --> 01:12:38,007
- Over there.
- Everyone, in the car,in the car.

582
01:12:44,408 --> 01:12:46,888
Cato. Cato. Here.

583
01:12:55,529 --> 01:12:58,010
- Where is Gambrelli?
- Hopefully gone to rescue the princess.

584
01:12:58,089 --> 01:13:00,290
- Where are we going?
- To see that he does.

585
01:13:07,690 --> 01:13:10,810
Get out and see what that sign says.

586
01:13:16,491 --> 01:13:21,052
It says, Ksar el Kabir 175 kilometres.

587
01:13:21,172 --> 01:13:25,972
- Is where we're going?
- No, that's where I'm going. Goodbye, Cato.

588
01:13:38,893 --> 01:13:41,694
Get in, Rabbi.

589
01:13:47,095 --> 01:13:49,975
Remember Men, this is a diplomatic intelligence
mission.

590
01:13:50,095 --> 01:13:54,615
Clouseau gets credit for rescuing the Princess.
Good Luck.

591
01:13:54,735 --> 01:13:59,495
- Gentelmen, After you.
- Me? I am not going.

592
01:13:59,615 --> 01:14:02,976
- Me neither.
- That's it. Sergeant, take them out and shoot them.

593
01:14:03,096 --> 01:14:08,097
- I changed my mind.
- Keep me a seat.

594
01:14:24,618 --> 01:14:28,819
- Excuse me, do you know which way is north?
- Yes

595
01:15:49,747 --> 01:15:52,987
Yussa, get her.

596
01:16:09,949 --> 01:16:12,789
Come with me. There is a way out of here.

597
01:16:12,909 --> 01:16:17,349
- That fine, but she's not going with us.
- Don't be foolish, she is our ticket to escape.

598
01:16:23,631 --> 01:16:25,590
Go ahead shoot me.

599
01:16:25,710 --> 01:16:29,711
Oh I will, unless you can stop me.

600
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:35,152
Let's see.

601
01:17:00,274 --> 01:17:03,914
Here, you need some help.

602
01:18:01,841 --> 01:18:06,441
- Drop it.
- Hello, sailor.

603
01:19:25,849 --> 01:19:28,249
That felt good.

604
01:19:29,489 --> 01:19:32,809
Come with, we'll miss our escape.

605
01:19:34,970 --> 01:19:40,650
When I am dead, my dearest,
Sing no sad songs for me.

606
01:19:40,891 --> 01:19:46,411
Plant no roses at my
head, no shade to hide my street.

607
01:19:46,571 --> 01:19:51,491
Water the green grass above me with soul
and dewdrops wet

608
01:19:51,651 --> 01:19:56,692
And if thou wilt remember,
and if thous wilt forget.

609
01:20:05,332 --> 01:20:09,294
That's it, no more Mr. Nice Guy.

610
01:20:11,293 --> 01:20:15,934
Yesterday morning, Princess Yasmin of Lugash
was rescued from her kidnappers...

611
01:20:15,974 --> 01:20:20,054
...by Detective Inspector 1st Class
Jacques Clouseau Junior,
