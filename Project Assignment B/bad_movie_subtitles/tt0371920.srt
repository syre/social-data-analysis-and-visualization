1
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,770
Okay.
Open it up!

2
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,200
Everybody off!

3
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,740
- Come on! Everybody out!
- Get out! Come on!

4
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:29,370
Everybody! Get out! Move it!
Get out! Move there!

5
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,960
Get out! Come on!

6
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,080
Come on! Move!

7
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,340
Ula?

8
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,850
I'm afraid we can't help you.
There's no Ula here, boy.

9
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,390
What have you done to her?

10
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,980
How's she like it? In the ass?
Or don't you remember?

11
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,790
Move it!
Come on, get up!

12
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,510
Why the hell is he always
looking at me?

13
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,300
Because he knows
white meat tastes better.

14
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,980
Those shiny teeth,
they scare you?

15
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,730
Leave him alone, old man.

16
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:41,990
It is your backer. You can't
hide from the breath of evil.

17
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,330
Let 's go!
Everyone back in the truck!

18
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,620
Now!

19
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,500
He's coming for you.

20
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,790
It will eat your soul,
your life will be a burning hell.

21
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,260
It bit me! It bit me!

22
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,140
- I'm dying! I'm dying!
- Old man!

23
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:12,430
Old man? Old man? Aranda!
Don't do this to me! Aranda!

24
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,610
- Don't touch him!
- He's hurt!

25
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,030
Can't you see he's hurt?

26
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:27,530
Come on! Come on!
Get out! Move it!

27
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,640
Not that way.
This way, to the river!

28
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,980
Our destiny is one now, brother.
Trust in Allah.

29
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,310
- I don't believe in destiny.
- Come on!

30
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,810
Up!

31
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,490
Get up!

32
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,640
Give me your hand.

33
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,580
To hell with you!

34
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,200
Bad to go in there.

35
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:35,080
- Relax, old man. It 's just fog.
- Not ordinary fog.

36
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,760
The breath of evil.
It takes your soul.

37
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,720
I don't need to hear
your shit tonight, old man.

38
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:49,100
Tell him, Dante.
Tell him it 's just fog.

39
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:57,190
- It 's the breath of evil.
- Do not joke. It 's your destiny.

40
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,570
It will destroy and corrupt
what is most pure.

41
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:47,360
Hey Grandpa,
I'm not worried about my destiny.

42
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:50,830
You worried about yours?

43
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,120
Who you running from?

44
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,330
Do you think
the evil cannot touch you?

45
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:00,130
Fool!

46
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,840
You are the fool, Aranda.
A superstitious old fool!

47
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,260
What 's going on over there?

48
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:11,970
Well, the old witch doctor
thinks the fog is evil.

49
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,640
I think he's been eating
too many mushrooms.

50
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,940
What 's that for?

51
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:29,360
Look at us!
What we're doing here, you know...

52
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,410
coming on this boat.
Infiltrating.

53
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,750
Taking chances.

54
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,080
I don't want it to end.

55
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,750
Ever.

56
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:46,090
I love you, Ula.

57
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,680
No. No, don't say that.

58
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,850
- Not if you're not serious, okay?
- Hey, I am serious.

59
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,350
I wouldn't lie to you.

60
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,150
Not ever.

61
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:03,020
Ula, you mean everything to me.

62
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,150
I'd die for you.

63
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,990
You would die for me?

64
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,580
I swear.

65
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,270
I love you.

66
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,770
That 's my destiny.

67
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,150
What 's that?

68
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,990
Must be a patrol.

69
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,000
Switch off your engines!

70
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,330
I repeat:
Switch off your engines!

71
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,170
Identify yourselves!

72
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,970
Identify yourselves!

73
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,630
Prepare to be boarded!

74
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,720
I repeat:
Prepare to be boarded!

75
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,020
There will be no escape!

76
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,480
- Ula, come on!
- What?

77
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,190
We gotta jump!

78
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:48,590
Make one move
and I will blow your head off.

79
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,220
You didn't really think
you could get away, did you?

80
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,900
Your girlfriend?

81
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,280
A little weasel like you
has a woman like that?

82
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,780
- Give it back!
- You're crazy!

83
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,450
You're never going
to see her again.

84
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:42,890
Havert fed the Rott for two days.

85
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,440
Those teeth could snap your neck
like a toothpick.

86
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,440
I'd just as soon let him kill you.

87
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,200
Like you friend here.

88
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:04,000
Dead or alive, I still get paid.

89
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,750
But Mr. Kufard wants you alive.

90
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,380
But the Rott doesn't care.

91
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,760
So...

92
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:25,730
don't press your luck.

93
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,570
Go ahead, a little siesta.

94
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:35,380
You hungry, boy?

95
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,760
You smell that?

96
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,970
Yeah, you're hungry boy, huh?

97
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,230
Do you want that rabbit?

98
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,020
Go fetch it.

99
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:00,780
Yeah, you want that rabbit.
You smell it?

100
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,200
Go for it.

101
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,080
Yeah, you want that, huh?

102
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,960
You want that, boy?

103
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,550
You hungry?

104
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,380
Go fetch it.

105
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,300
Come on, just take a look.

106
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,640
Come on.

107
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,880
Please, no.

108
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,860
You'll never find...

109
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,240
that bitch.

110
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:37,170
Sometimes you win,
sometimes you lose.

111
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:49,220
I guess today just
wasrt your lucky day.

112
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:50,280
He had the gun.

113
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:53,410
You live by the gun,
you die by the fucking gun.

114
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:56,040
That 's the way it goes.

115
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,470
There's enough evil in this world
without your breath of evil.

116
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,120
Money, money, money!

117
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:20,500
- This time I'll win.
- Show it to me!

118
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,710
Money, money, money...

119
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,960
Money, money...
Now I got you!

120
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,590
What 's that?
You won?

121
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,140
- Of course I did.
- How come?

122
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:36,140
You saw it,
I don't have to explain it to you...

123
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:43,270
Good evening. We were on our way
to Puerto Angel and we got lost.

124
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,730
You have food?

125
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:51,860
You're not Spanish.
Are you American?

126
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,820
Yeah, can you spare some food?

127
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,200
You're alone?

128
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,920
Give it to him.

129
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,260
- You come a long way.
- I haven't eaten for days.

130
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:17,550
Some men are following you?

131
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,640
Not any more.

132
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,770
Where do you go?

133
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,320
Puerto Angel.

134
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:35,530
Puerto Angel is suicide, my friend!

135
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:40,790
Go north. Yeah, you can get
across the border. Puerto Angel!

136
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:43,750
That 's where Kufard is.
What you wanna go there for?

137
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:47,000
His woman.

138
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,130
All Puerto Angel woman is a whore.

139
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:56,550
Not a whore.
You have a real woman, yes?

140
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:01,430
Yeah. Yeah, I have a real woman.

141
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,680
In Puerto Angel?

142
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,770
Not any more.
She is dead or whore.

143
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:23,580
- Sweet. You grow it?
- No. Some friends grow it.

144
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,050
Can you get this off?

145
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,010
You come here, with gun.
Okay, no problem.

146
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,470
Want food, we give you to eat.

147
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:43,310
Smoke, whisky, everything.
Now this?

148
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,600
How you gonna pay, brother?

149
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,150
- Nice boots.
- Yeah, nice boots.

150
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,530
And they don't look like
they fit you so good anyway.

151
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:58,780
Too big for you.
Look like my size.

152
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:01,160
Here, let me put them on.

153
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,950
I don't think so.

154
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:11,420
Where did you get those boots?

155
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,960
A guard at camp.

156
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:23,010
A guard? Kufard guard?
Gives to you boots?

157
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:29,310
Not exactly.

158
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,990
No problem.
Sit down, friend.

159
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,450
Sit down.
Sit down, my friend.

160
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,870
Sit down.

161
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,900
Find him.

162
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,490
Kill him.

163
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,210
What is it?

164
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,220
There's something out there.

165
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,180
Nothing out there, my friend.

166
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,350
Relax, my friend.

167
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:20,860
Thinking about your woman, right?
That can drive a man crazy.

168
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,900
Yeah.

169
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,360
Yeah, I guess they can.

170
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:30,990
And when you find her,
then you can get really crazy.

171
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:58,150
Surrender yourselves right now!
Or we'll be forced to shoot!

172
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,820
Surrender or you'll be shot!

173
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:05,190
This is the lmmigration Police!

174
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,990
Freeze or we'll shoot!

175
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:13,330
This is the lmmigration Police!

176
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,250
Grab the woman!

177
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,160
Let 's get outta here.

178
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,210
Freeze or we'll shoot!
I repeat: Surrender or we'll shoot!

179
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:35,970
I'll look over here!

180
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,060
Over here!

181
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:45,610
Come here.

182
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:53,910
Freeze!
I said don't move!

183
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,210
Hold it!

184
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:01,790
- I said don't move!
- Go back!

185
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,430
Well, well, well!

186
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:18,430
What do we have here?
Not your usual immigrants.

187
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,890
- Not like...
- No, we're not like them.

188
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:26,900
You have passports?
Visa? Zone permits?

189
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:30,320
No papers? This gives me
the right to imprison you...

190
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:32,990
or shoot you
if you try to escape.

191
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:37,700
Like he did.

192
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:44,000
Hey, listen.
We were just playing a game, okay?

193
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,590
- Infiltration.
- A game?

194
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:52,090
Infiltration. You play it in
real places, with real people.

195
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,390
Like role-playing
in the real world.

196
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,140
What are the rules?

197
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,220
- Anything you can get away with.
- There aren't any.

198
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:03,940
I see. Privileged children
playing dangerous games.

199
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,730
I like games.

200
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,190
You infiltrate my world...

201
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:12,280
I infiltrate yours.

202
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:19,410
Let us make the game a little more
interesting, shall we?

203
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:24,170
- What 's your name?
- Dante.

204
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:34,720
Ula Lume.
Ula.

205
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:38,060
Come here, Ula.

206
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,720
You're dead.

207
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,890
I killed you!

208
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:34,480
What are you doing back?

209
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,320
Well, you want me?
Well, come and get me!

210
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,780
Come on!

211
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:45,910
Come on!

212
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:48,830
You want me?

213
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,620
Yeah! Come on!

214
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:52,330
You're never gonna get me!

215
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,960
You're just a fucking dog!

216
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:00,590
You don't even understand
a word I'm saying, do you?

217
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,470
Yeah, your teeth are strong
but your brairs a joke.

218
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,100
I can outsmart you
any day of the week!

219
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,020
You fucking dog!

220
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:36,190
You got a light?

221
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,810
No.

222
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,990
So...

223
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:49,530
...you alone?
- No, I'm not alone.

224
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,990
What 's the matter?

225
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,580
You can't keep up?

226
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:47,470
Ghost dog!

227
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,760
Come and get me!

228
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:58,080
Come on! Go!

229
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:01,040
- I'm scared.
- Of what?

230
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:05,340
- The monster.
- There's no monsters.

231
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:08,710
Remember that God is good
and doesn't make monsters.

232
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,470
But the devil does.

233
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,930
Look, I'll show you.

234
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:21,850
See?
No monster.

235
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:24,860
What if he comes back?

236
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:29,360
He won't.

237
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:25,500
Perla?

238
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,340
Mama!

239
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,380
Oh hell!

240
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,810
Esperanza, bring me a washcloth.

241
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:45,690
Esperanza?

242
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,820
Esperanza!

243
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:26,350
Where are you?

244
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:44,410
Mama!

245
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:48,830
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot, please!

246
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:15,480
Put them on!

247
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:20,700
- Please, I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Don't look at me!

248
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:25,700
Esperanza, go feed the dogs.
Right now!

249
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:28,040
But the monster...

250
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:32,790
Don't cry, love.
The monster won't come.

251
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:37,970
Look what a pretty flower.
Do you know the name?

252
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,890
- It 's called "no-me-olvides".
- "No-me-olvides".

253
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:44,890
Go. Feed the dogs, okay?

254
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:48,480
Nino! Perla!

255
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:50,940
What 's your name?

256
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,810
Dante.

257
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:56,280
My name is Dante.

258
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,360
Put your hands on your head.

259
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,620
Go, Dante. Go.

260
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:21,430
- You came from the prison, yes?
- Yes.

261
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:25,100
Why are you, American,
in Kufard prison?

262
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:29,850
I came on a boat from Rabat.
I had no papers.

263
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:36,610
Don't look at me.

264
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:40,820
Listen, I'm not gonna hurt you.
I never hurt anybody. Okay?

265
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,410
I just need help.

266
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:57,670
I came over also...

267
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:01,670
to meet my brother.
But he wasrt there.

268
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,430
Nobody helped me.

269
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:12,520
Turn around.

270
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,150
Please. I just need
to get to Puerto Angel.

271
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,400
Why?

272
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:21,740
I need to find someone.

273
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:26,160
When my husband comes home
it will be bad for you.

274
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,540
I can help you.

275
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,840
I know someone
who can take care of you.

276
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,640
When you are here
without papers...

277
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:54,890
there are few choices.

278
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:03,610
If you are pretty,
they don't hire you for regular work.

279
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:17,420
You belong to everyone who can pay.
It changes you.

280
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:24,920
You even can like it.
Not always. But sometimes.

281
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,270
Nino! Perla!

282
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:44,440
Nino! Perla!

283
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:52,950
- Can you help me?
- Don't touch me! I don't like men.

284
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:56,040
I could kill you.
No problem.

285
00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:00,670
In Puerto Angel I was a whore.

286
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:05,300
One of Kufard's girls.

287
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:10,640
Most of the time I was stoned.

288
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,350
Then she came...

289
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:18,600
Esperanza, my hope.

290
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:23,690
Mama, Mama,
Nino and Perla won't come.

291
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,320
Out! Get out, Esperanza!

292
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:27,650
- But Mama...
- Get out!

293
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:01,310
Santiago was one of my regulars.

294
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:06,690
He was a priest.
But he has a weakness.

295
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:10,900
I'd sleep in his bed.

296
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:14,280
But we don't touch.
We pray.

297
00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:22,830
We never touch.
Do you understand?

298
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:47,730
Mama! Mama!
The monster!

299
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:51,360
Out, Esperanza!
Get out! Out!

300
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:04,580
I only stay here for Esperanza.

301
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:10,050
So she will have a place.
So she won't be like me.

302
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:36,110
Perla?

303
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:45,710
Perla!

304
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:55,050
Perla...

305
00:50:58,850 --> 00:50:59,930
Mama!

306
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:06,690
Mama!

307
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:10,980
Gimme the gun!

308
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:13,030
Trust me.

309
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,580
- What is it?
- It 's a Rottweiler.

310
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:56,650
Get to the bedroom!

311
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,120
It 's not gonna hold.

312
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,790
Through the window!

313
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,340
Come on!

314
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:20,800
You go first, I'll pass her on.

315
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:29,100
God damn it!

316
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:40,740
Is there somewhere safe
where you can take the girl?

317
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:42,030
- The root cellar.
- Go!

318
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,660
- What about you?
- Just go!

319
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:52,000
Come on!
Come and get me!

320
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,680
No!

321
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,520
Get down! Down!

322
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:29,720
Come on!

323
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:33,640
Come here. Come here.
Come on.

324
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:53,750
Stay back.

325
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,760
Come on, you son of a bitch!

326
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,910
Come on, let 's get out of here.

327
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,510
Just a second, okay?

328
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:31,050
Don't bother yourself.
I'll do it.

329
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:57,910
Will you leave that
before you break it?

330
00:57:57,260 --> 00:58:00,480
You see? What did I tell you?
I knew you were gonna break it!

331
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:03,150
Curiosity killed the cat.

332
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:11,650
Did you hear that, Nacho?

333
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:37,680
You okay?

334
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:50,780
I'm sorry.

335
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:55,200
I'm sorry.

336
00:58:57,530 --> 00:59:01,500
It 's beautiful. It 's pretty.
Where'd you pick it?

337
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,210
"No-me-olvides".

338
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,960
What?
I can't hear you.

339
00:59:09,290 --> 00:59:10,670
"Olvides".

340
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,470
"Olvides"?

341
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,930
That 's "forget", isn't it?

342
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:19,640
"No-me..."

343
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:23,180
You want to forget?

344
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:32,530
I lost someone too.

345
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:37,490
I'm gonna find her, though.

346
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,830
No...

347
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:45,580
No.
I can't remember where she is.

348
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:50,130
Where I last saw her.

349
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:55,380
It was...

350
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:57,430
somewhere in...

351
00:59:57,630 --> 00:59:59,760
Puerto Angel.

352
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:05,060
"No-me-olvides".

353
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:13,190
No-me... forget?

354
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:17,200
Forget-me-not.

355
01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:21,660
Forget-me-not!
You're talking about the flower!

356
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:25,290
"No-me-olvides"?

357
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:31,710
I'm sorry.

358
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:35,050
I'm sorry.

359
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:41,260
Forget-me-not.

360
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:56,860
Come on, let 's go
before he changes his mind.

361
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:03,240
Ula?

362
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:08,040
- Hey, you okay?
- I'm fine.

363
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:13,290
Well, I mean...
What happened there?

364
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:17,010
What do you think?
You saw him.

365
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:21,430
What you...?
You let him?

366
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:26,930
You don't think
I wanted to, do you?

367
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:33,400
No, no.
Of course not.

368
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:43,620
You sounded like...
you enjoyed it.

369
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:49,120
How can you say that?

370
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:06,390
There's a pack of cigarettes
in my shirt back there.

371
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:11,560
Berta?
Will you get them for me?

372
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:14,190
Yeah, okay.

373
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:18,940
And don't touch
anything else back there!

374
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:20,750
What the hell
is going on back there?

375
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:49,740
Stay back!
Get back!

376
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,700
I'm stuck!

377
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,720
Berta!

378
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:29,660
Berta?

379
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:47,970
Berta...

380
01:05:10,450 --> 01:05:14,030
The monster, I killed him.

381
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:24,710
God!

382
01:06:28,570 --> 01:06:31,280
I'm gonna die of rabies.

383
01:08:16,930 --> 01:08:19,340
That 's better.

384
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:24,600
You're dead.

385
01:08:24,930 --> 01:08:28,230
It 's what we all aspire to.

386
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:32,320
You're not real.

387
01:08:32,980 --> 01:08:35,360
What 's real?

388
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:54,800
Where are you going?

389
01:08:55,050 --> 01:08:56,720
What do you want from me?

390
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:00,840
The question is,
what do you want?

391
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:03,560
What do I want?

392
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:07,180
I came to help you out, man.

393
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:09,770
How?

394
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:13,230
Don't you know what night this is?

395
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:15,360
Tonight?

396
01:09:15,570 --> 01:09:18,030
Exactly one year ago...

397
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:24,280
in October,
of your most immemorial year.

398
01:09:25,330 --> 01:09:27,290
I lost her.

399
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:32,630
Could be you found her.

400
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,420
Here?

401
01:09:38,630 --> 01:09:44,510
She rolls through
an ether of sighs...

402
01:09:45,970 --> 01:09:47,270
No.

403
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:52,230
Was it love?

404
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:55,650
Did you truly love her?

405
01:09:55,980 --> 01:10:00,320
Or was it the idea of her
that you loved?

406
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:05,280
The soft flesh and warm embrace?

407
01:10:07,330 --> 01:10:10,080
- She's not dead.
- A promise is a promise...

408
01:10:10,330 --> 01:10:12,620
is a promise.

409
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:17,340
When are you going
to stop running away?

410
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:20,300
No.

411
01:10:21,470 --> 01:10:25,510
No! She's not dead!

412
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:38,730
She can't be dead!

413
01:12:32,350 --> 01:12:33,930
Looking for something, man?

414
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:37,560
I know everybody.
Anybody, anything.

415
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:39,860
I'm your Sugarman.

416
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:43,440
- I'm looking for a girl.
- Yep, I know her, man.

417
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:46,990
I know everyone upstreet,
downstreet and in between.

418
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:50,410
You name 'em, I know 'em.
What 's she look like?

419
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,950
That 's her.
Her name is Ula.

420
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:59,630
Yeah, man. I know her, man.
Strung-out bitch.

421
01:12:59,830 --> 01:13:02,380
I hate to tell you, man,
she's my old lady now.

422
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:05,840
Hey, hold it, man!
Hold it! Hold it! Okay, okay.

423
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:09,090
Maybe I got that wrong.
Let me see that again.

424
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,390
How long she been out here, man?

425
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:19,730
One year...
I left her here.

426
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:24,320
She don't call herself
Ula now, man.

427
01:13:24,820 --> 01:13:26,320
Fuck you.

428
01:13:26,530 --> 01:13:30,410
She started upstreet but
now she's downstreet, man.

429
01:13:30,610 --> 01:13:32,870
I can take you.

430
01:13:34,330 --> 01:13:37,040
- You can take me?
- Yeah, man, yeah.

431
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:41,580
Okay, you take me.

432
01:13:46,510 --> 01:13:49,340
You get the other half
when I see her.

433
01:14:13,570 --> 01:14:15,450
Do you love her, man?

434
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:19,200
- Yeah, I love her.
- No matter what?

435
01:14:20,370 --> 01:14:23,080
- No matter what.
- Then why'd you leave her, man?

436
01:14:23,290 --> 01:14:28,050
I didn't leave her, okay?
We just... We just got separated.

437
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:31,180
Yeah, bummer, man.
How'd that happen?

438
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:34,510
I can't remember.

439
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:37,850
Yeah, man. Yeah, I've had
days like that too, man.

440
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:02,790
Let them in.

441
01:15:35,610 --> 01:15:37,370
She's in here.

442
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:49,550
After you, man.

443
01:16:07,860 --> 01:16:09,150
Ula?

444
01:16:14,780 --> 01:16:17,490
Are you alone?

445
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:20,200
No.

446
01:16:20,530 --> 01:16:22,290
No?

447
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:38,840
You said you'd take me to Ula!
That wasrt Ula!

448
01:16:39,050 --> 01:16:42,010
At this point, man...
At this point they're all the same.

449
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:45,730
They're all whores! Not a cunt 's
hair of difference between them.

450
01:16:45,930 --> 01:16:48,980
How the fuck do you know
that 's not her?

451
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:51,730
It 's not her.

452
01:16:53,610 --> 01:16:55,570
I got something here, man...

453
01:16:55,780 --> 01:17:01,120
that will make you think
that really is her, all night long.

454
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:05,000
And in the morning, you just
gotta put her out on the street.

455
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,870
And I'll collect her.

456
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:15,960
You stay away from me.

457
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:18,340
Fuck you!

458
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:26,020
Shit!

459
01:17:37,150 --> 01:17:40,740
What the hell have we got here?
Armando!

460
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:41,990
What the...?

461
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:55,380
Ula?

462
01:17:58,010 --> 01:18:00,050
Fucking asshole!

463
01:18:01,470 --> 01:18:03,350
Ula?

464
01:18:55,020 --> 01:18:58,530
Hey, baby! Daddy's home
and he's bearing gifts.

465
01:19:00,610 --> 01:19:04,070
- You got some sugar for me?
- Oh, yeah.

466
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:07,200
You wanna try this?
You like that?

467
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:09,910
And the best part 's
coming later, baby.

468
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:12,040
Holy shit! Somebody's having
a good time back there!

469
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:14,920
I'm gonna make you bark
like a dog, baby.

470
01:20:33,790 --> 01:20:35,660
Congratulations!

471
01:20:35,870 --> 01:20:39,460
I didn't think you were
going to make it this far.

472
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:42,050
I didn't think you had it in you.

473
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:44,420
You knew?

474
01:20:44,630 --> 01:20:47,130
I've been tracking you.

475
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:49,090
Why are you doing this?

476
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:52,140
She pissed me off.

477
01:20:52,350 --> 01:20:55,180
So I had to... you know...

478
01:20:55,390 --> 01:20:59,610
But you, that 's a different story.

479
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:02,150
You hurt my dog.

480
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:04,030
- No games.
- No games?

481
01:21:04,530 --> 01:21:07,400
This whole thing is a game.
Infiltration.

482
01:21:07,740 --> 01:21:09,450
Isn't that what you said?

483
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:13,490
You want to know where Ula is?

484
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:16,960
She's there, where you left her.

485
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,250
Surely you haven't forgotten.

486
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:29,470
The sands of time.

487
01:21:36,810 --> 01:21:40,560
And now let me say "game over".

488
01:21:57,500 --> 01:22:00,290
She wasrt even a good fuck.

489
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:24,110
What 's going on back there?
We're losing pressure!

490
01:22:33,410 --> 01:22:35,490
Kill, Rott! Kill!

491
01:22:40,370 --> 01:22:42,330
I'm losing control!

492
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:46,460
We're going down!

493
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:35,720
