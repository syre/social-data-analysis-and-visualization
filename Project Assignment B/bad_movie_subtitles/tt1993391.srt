1
00:01:10,023 --> 00:01:12,512
Cameron!

2
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,904
Hi.
-My boss is gonna kill me for leaving early.

3
00:01:22,029 --> 00:01:24,941
What is your emergency?
I can't believe you brought me out in the rain.

4
00:01:24,976 --> 00:01:27,225
Stop, i love a little summer rain.

5
00:01:27,282 --> 00:01:30,343
I think it's romantic.
And what are you talking about?

6
00:01:30,398 --> 00:01:32,531
I thought you quit the travel agency
to supervise your remodelling..

7
00:01:32,558 --> 00:01:36,833
I did but Owen's out of control,
and now i'm working like a dog to pay for it.

8
00:01:36,872 --> 00:01:38,498
And Cameron, i can't tell Ben.

9
00:01:38,535 --> 00:01:40,857
What's the rush?
You know the market would turn around.

10
00:01:40,903 --> 00:01:42,757
There's only one Hamptons.

11
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:44,546
Why am i here?
What is your emergency?

12
00:01:45,016 --> 00:01:47,131
Okay..

13
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,349
Speaking of the old Hamptons getaway..

14
00:01:50,474 --> 00:01:53,126
I need to borrow it.

15
00:01:53,251 --> 00:01:54,238
Why?

16
00:01:54,301 --> 00:01:56,686
I'm having a little open house myself.

17
00:01:57,013 --> 00:01:58,587
But only one guy is coming.

18
00:01:58,614 --> 00:02:01,209
Read.. His name is Hugh.

19
00:02:05,753 --> 00:02:07,994
I mean she's my future baby mama.

20
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,791
I love me my Kate.
-It's not about love, how's your sex life?

21
00:02:13,048 --> 00:02:14,864
It's..

22
00:02:14,963 --> 00:02:17,450
It's fine.
-My point percisely.

23
00:02:17,486 --> 00:02:19,810
You gotta spice it up.
-By banging other girls?

24
00:02:19,837 --> 00:02:22,720
Slow down buddy,
you're not there yet.

25
00:02:22,972 --> 00:02:23,992
Slow down.

26
00:02:24,046 --> 00:02:26,134
Start by..

27
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:27,969
Asking Kate for a threesome.

28
00:02:28,004 --> 00:02:29,035
Are you out of your mind?

29
00:02:29,071 --> 00:02:30,948
Why not? You ever had one?
-No.

30
00:02:30,983 --> 00:02:32,737
See, you know i know women.

31
00:02:32,782 --> 00:02:36,181
You know this, but you gotta grow a pair
and ask her.

32
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:38,781
You know what?
I'm not even supposed to say this..

33
00:02:38,835 --> 00:02:41,483
But Kate has asked Cameron about it.

34
00:02:41,512 --> 00:02:44,469
No, that don't work me.
That is bull.

35
00:02:44,486 --> 00:02:47,704
There are clear cut signs,
for when a woman wants to sleep around.

36
00:02:47,723 --> 00:02:51,467
I know this, perfect hair, good panties,
night time make up in the morning..

37
00:02:51,494 --> 00:02:53,719
Like you would know good panties.

38
00:02:54,025 --> 00:02:58,562
I'm just saying, if the sex is already boring
and you're not even married yet..

39
00:02:58,589 --> 00:03:01,120
Why not throw it out?

40
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,491
I couldn't handle a threesome.

41
00:03:04,526 --> 00:03:05,982
I couldn't do it, honestly.

42
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:08,901
I'm just not well-verse enough
on threeway ettiquete.

43
00:03:08,946 --> 00:03:10,395
I mean where to start..

44
00:03:10,412 --> 00:03:12,410
What to put where,
who do you do first..

45
00:03:12,437 --> 00:03:15,034
Am i paying too much attention,
not enough attention..

46
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,239
Who to thank..
The pressure.

47
00:03:17,257 --> 00:03:18,677
You thank everybody.

48
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:20,811
I can't believe you're having an affair.

49
00:03:20,838 --> 00:03:22,727
Not an affair.

50
00:03:22,781 --> 00:03:26,298
A fling, a larc, a bump, bootycall.

51
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:27,482
Little bump and grind.

52
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,227
What about your husband?

53
00:03:29,272 --> 00:03:31,275
It was Vince's idea.

54
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:34,032
You're having an open marriage?
How come you never told me this?

55
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:37,631
Over 50% of marriages fail because of infidelity.

56
00:03:37,649 --> 00:03:39,549
So, right before we got married..

57
00:03:39,606 --> 00:03:42,873
Vince came out with the 10 rules
to a healthy open relationship.

58
00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:44,464
How many men have you been with?

59
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:46,749
That we would never end up divorce because of cheating.
-How many?

60
00:03:46,763 --> 00:03:49,410
Men biologically have the need to spread their seeds..

61
00:03:49,432 --> 00:03:51,254
How many men?
-Doesn't matter.

62
00:03:51,282 --> 00:03:52,982
Do you think Hugh would like this?

63
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:55,128
It has no zippers or buttons.

64
00:03:55,352 --> 00:03:56,394
He'll love it.

65
00:03:57,283 --> 00:03:59,653
So, he made up 10 rules.

66
00:03:59,675 --> 00:04:02,945
Yeah, 1.. Never go out with an ex.
-Right.

67
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,226
2.. No more than 3 dates with the same person.

68
00:04:06,241 --> 00:04:11,536
3.. no pictures, video, or media yet to be invented
throughout the universe.

69
00:04:11,571 --> 00:04:15,991
4.. Always an away game, never on home turf.
That includes friends and neighbor's beds.

70
00:04:16,012 --> 00:04:17,807
It can be wrong.
-Yeah.

71
00:04:18,335 --> 00:04:21,236
Number 5 AKA the no Marv Albert play by play..

72
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:23,517
No announcements, no intros,
no details..

73
00:04:23,545 --> 00:04:26,256
You see each other in public,
you keep walking.

74
00:04:26,278 --> 00:04:29,737
Hold it Cammie, this is way to Maxim.

75
00:04:29,863 --> 00:04:32,955
And i don't even read Maxim.

76
00:04:34,192 --> 00:04:37,062
What happened if you just woke up one morning, and you were like..

77
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:40,990
Time for some fresh dick.

78
00:04:41,937 --> 00:04:42,836
Sorry.

79
00:04:42,871 --> 00:04:44,672
Number 6, the neighborhood blackout rule.

80
00:04:44,719 --> 00:04:47,860
Stay away from favorite restaurants,
clubs, hangouts.

81
00:04:47,902 --> 00:04:50,478
7.. The group maxed no more than 5 at a time.

82
00:04:50,513 --> 00:04:53,261
Time out, flag on the play.

83
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:56,107
What does it matter how many people if you're open about it?

84
00:04:56,136 --> 00:04:58,912
More than 5 people becomes an orgy,
i have standard..

85
00:04:58,927 --> 00:05:00,799
But as high as a limbo stick.

86
00:05:00,828 --> 00:05:03,583
8.. No gifts, giving or receiving..

87
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,279
9.. The no sleeping with friends and family plan.

88
00:05:06,294 --> 00:05:07,894
That includes second and third cousins.

89
00:05:07,924 --> 00:05:11,561
God, that is so gross. Only you Vince, would need a rule like that.

90
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,744
The number 1..

91
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:16,506
On the Letterman's top 10,
this is important..

92
00:05:16,615 --> 00:05:18,315
Never ever ever..

93
00:05:18,365 --> 00:05:20,976
Ever say i love you.

94
00:05:21,315 --> 00:05:23,708
Maybe you should consider separation.

95
00:05:24,062 --> 00:05:25,667
Hell no.

96
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:28,079
How can i blame him for something i stupidly agree?

97
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:31,145
You don't have to,
that's what divorce lawyers are for.

98
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,425
You don't get it, girl.

99
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,626
I love him.

100
00:05:34,654 --> 00:05:37,643
Right, but this makes stupid.
Like..

101
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,920
Stupid.
-Taxi!

102
00:05:40,496 --> 00:05:42,310
Taxi!

103
00:05:43,214 --> 00:05:44,841
Stay, stay, stay.

104
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:49,081
Please.
-Owen is at Loraine's in the Hamptons, so you'll be good.

105
00:05:49,111 --> 00:05:50,340
Great.

106
00:05:50,388 --> 00:05:52,296
Hey, can you keep this for me
til tomorrow?

107
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:54,255
I don't want Vince to see it.
-Sure.

108
00:05:54,524 --> 00:05:56,215
I love you.

109
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,044
You and your summer rain.

110
00:06:10,117 --> 00:06:13,416
You two should only be as lucky as us.

111
00:06:13,445 --> 00:06:15,210
And you know why?
-Enlighten us.

112
00:06:15,246 --> 00:06:18,900
It's because we're always completely honest
and open with each other.

113
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,717
And because we keep surprising each other..

114
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,064
This year for your birthday,
i'm taking you antiqing in Rhode Island.

115
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:27,739
No..
-What, no!
-Yes..

116
00:06:27,783 --> 00:06:29,019
You're so sweet.

117
00:06:29,033 --> 00:06:30,660
Quaint little B&B..

118
00:06:30,786 --> 00:06:34,663
No television, no phone,
just you and me my dear, that's it.

119
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:36,492
I love you.
-I love you.

120
00:06:36,557 --> 00:06:38,856
I have been asking him to do this forever.

121
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:39,897
No TV?

122
00:06:39,904 --> 00:06:41,676
It's after the playoffs,
don't worry about it.

123
00:06:41,705 --> 00:06:45,629
Hey guys, so what brings us to this two credit card dinner?

124
00:06:45,664 --> 00:06:48,369
Who is the hottest children's author..

125
00:06:48,421 --> 00:06:50,402
Since Harry Potter?

126
00:06:50,527 --> 00:06:52,643
Emma Cooney.
-Boom, there you go.
-What?

127
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:55,161
Vince is going to be meeting with her on Friday.
-No..

128
00:06:55,183 --> 00:06:56,701
To discuss the publishing of her new book..

129
00:06:56,723 --> 00:06:58,263
Oh my god, why didn't you tell me?

130
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,400
Because you would have bought a new dress.

131
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:03,226
This one can shop more than a speedfreak on Ebay.

132
00:07:03,284 --> 00:07:06,343
He's got that right, wait til Hugh sees her in that new dress.

133
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:08,651
You can really go from..

134
00:07:08,672 --> 00:07:12,768
Sweet to shitty in one second.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom..

135
00:07:12,992 --> 00:07:14,907
I will be right back.

136
00:07:15,032 --> 00:07:18,276
No more working, and travels for you.

137
00:07:18,306 --> 00:07:22,360
I am just gonna leave you two alone
for a minute.

138
00:07:25,376 --> 00:07:26,591
ask her.

139
00:07:27,409 --> 00:07:28,970
What's going on?

140
00:07:29,095 --> 00:07:30,864
I have to ask you something.

141
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:32,382
Sure.

142
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:34,516
You know it's only taking me this long to propose to you because..

143
00:07:34,544 --> 00:07:38,980
I don't want us to end up miserable like my folks,
because they constantly broke..

144
00:07:39,002 --> 00:07:40,990
I can still hear my mom said..

145
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:44,290
No money comes in the door,
love flies out the window.

146
00:07:44,341 --> 00:07:47,118
I love you.
-I keep telling you, it doesn't matter to me.

147
00:07:47,168 --> 00:07:50,040
We'll do our house up, and we'll sell it..

148
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:53,048
And it'll be our little nest egg, you and i.

149
00:07:53,308 --> 00:07:56,218
Thank god we pulled the plug on that fru fru decorator guy..

150
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,349
Otherwise our nest egg, will be a tree house.

151
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:03,147
That's besides the point, that's your money.
I don't want it.

152
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:08,304
I'm sorry that our sex life hasn't exactly been..
-Ben, don't worry. You know what?

153
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:12,782
We've both been really busy and you're focusing on the business, it's fine.

154
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,101
Right. No, wrong.
-Wrong.

155
00:08:15,188 --> 00:08:16,214
Way wrong.

156
00:08:16,243 --> 00:08:18,109
Okay, i've been thinking about something.

157
00:08:20,295 --> 00:08:22,421
I don't even know how to say this.

158
00:08:23,281 --> 00:08:25,423
I'm nervous.
-It's okay.

159
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,978
I think..

160
00:08:27,103 --> 00:08:29,992
That the way to take our relationship
to the next level..

161
00:08:30,026 --> 00:08:31,689
Yeah..

162
00:08:36,755 --> 00:08:38,718
Is..
-It's okay.

163
00:08:38,783 --> 00:08:40,324
I'm gonna say yes..

164
00:08:40,345 --> 00:08:42,088
Well..

165
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,258
Will you have a threesome with me?

166
00:08:48,645 --> 00:08:52,219
Well, you.. I can't wait to get you fuck me.

167
00:08:52,277 --> 00:08:55,044
Because i have a surprise..

168
00:08:55,065 --> 00:08:57,257
Probably Chlamydia..
Hurry up.

169
00:09:00,267 --> 00:09:02,725
Really?
Really you'll have a threesome with me?

170
00:09:02,748 --> 00:09:04,367
Definitely.

171
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:08,215
I've always wanted to know
what it would be like with..

172
00:09:08,562 --> 00:09:10,161
Two guys.

173
00:09:16,198 --> 00:09:21,124
The only question is, tomorrow morning do i text you
or do i nudge you.

174
00:09:23,315 --> 00:09:25,904
What's up, cool breeze?
How did it go?

175
00:09:25,943 --> 00:09:28,516
Awful, the worst possible way it could have gone..

176
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,404
Then you didn't sell it right.

177
00:09:30,425 --> 00:09:33,109
I definitely sold it, she said yes.

178
00:09:33,123 --> 00:09:34,504
Then what's the problem?

179
00:09:36,588 --> 00:09:38,446
Hey, is that you?

180
00:09:39,097 --> 00:09:41,642
Oh my God.
Hi.

181
00:09:41,699 --> 00:09:43,017
Matt!

182
00:09:43,046 --> 00:09:45,041
How are you?
-So good to see you.

183
00:09:45,078 --> 00:09:48,065
You still look amazing.

184
00:09:48,107 --> 00:09:49,923
Nice to see some things don't change.

185
00:09:49,944 --> 00:09:51,678
You still look like you're in shape.

186
00:09:51,738 --> 00:09:54,638
You always did like breaking a sweat.
-Yeah, i remember our litte work out.

187
00:09:55,369 --> 00:09:57,075
Let's do punch tomorrow.

188
00:09:57,774 --> 00:09:59,929
i'm only in town for two days on business.

189
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,708
We got a lot of catching up to do.

190
00:10:02,467 --> 00:10:04,266
9am. Lugo's.

191
00:10:04,302 --> 00:10:05,965
Okay.
-See you tomorrow.

192
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:07,419
Bye.

193
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:17,032
Hello.. Who was that?

194
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,183
Matt.

195
00:10:19,308 --> 00:10:21,045
Exboyfriend Matt?

196
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:24,652
Highschool pole vaulter Matt..

197
00:10:24,696 --> 00:10:28,085
Damn, he can stick it to me anytime.

198
00:10:29,152 --> 00:10:31,168
Ladies..

199
00:10:36,461 --> 00:10:38,829
Perfect time.

200
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,365
A threeway?

201
00:10:40,447 --> 00:10:44,009
Ben can't even get a boner
with a cat in the room.

202
00:10:44,134 --> 00:10:46,747
Matt would never share me with anyone.

203
00:10:48,403 --> 00:10:50,716
At least Benny's getting laid.

204
00:10:50,841 --> 00:10:52,804
I wonder what the Yanks are doing tonight?

205
00:10:54,316 --> 00:10:57,181
It's not slutty,
we're evolved.

206
00:10:57,245 --> 00:10:59,431
It's so European.

207
00:11:01,396 --> 00:11:05,400
Great, i'm gonna have some guy's balls
in my face.

208
00:11:05,734 --> 00:11:07,831
I'm gonna kill Vince.

209
00:11:15,815 --> 00:11:19,702
We're here at the palatial estate of media Tsar,
Jeffery Field.

210
00:11:19,738 --> 00:11:24,974
His legendary summer, starstudded
la Dolce Vita Ball is the party of the season.

211
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,568
The place to be.

212
00:11:26,614 --> 00:11:28,385
Security is tight.

213
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,626
But i had a chance to sit down with the..

214
00:11:30,672 --> 00:11:33,859
Always controversial Field,
and talk to him about..

215
00:11:33,904 --> 00:11:38,533
His legendary career as well as his notoriously
open lifestyle..

216
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:41,827
Which is being followed by
his new reality series..

217
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:43,734
"Fields of Dreams".

218
00:11:43,798 --> 00:11:46,511
Mr Fields, the stories are legendary.

219
00:11:46,557 --> 00:11:49,368
How you started in the mailroom,
work your way all the way up..

220
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:53,088
To owning your own multimillion dollar empire.

221
00:11:53,134 --> 00:11:55,790
Bullshit, i fucked my way to the top.

222
00:11:55,817 --> 00:11:58,448
I fucked whoever and whatever i had to.

223
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:02,562
Men, women, i fucked a camel once.
I don't give a shit.

224
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:06,206
Put it right here in front of my cock,
and i'll fuck it if it means i'll get my way.

225
00:12:06,243 --> 00:12:11,380
I'll fuck you and your cameraman right now,
if it'll make more people watch this shit.

226
00:12:13,531 --> 00:12:16,189
Why don't we talk about your fabulous ball?

227
00:12:16,522 --> 00:12:18,826
Your guest list is the creme de la creme..

228
00:12:18,844 --> 00:12:22,715
Wallstreet, Hollywood celebrities, socialites,
industrial titans..

229
00:12:22,749 --> 00:12:25,745
And my ever presence entourage,
my boys and girls..

230
00:12:25,763 --> 00:12:27,435
The beautiful people..
-yes.

231
00:12:27,462 --> 00:12:30,093
What's your secret?
-I have no secrets.

232
00:12:30,128 --> 00:12:32,513
I'm a media whore, remember?

233
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,239
But i don't give anything away.

234
00:12:34,284 --> 00:12:36,914
So, go to my newest global venture..

00:12:46,294 --> 00:12:48,138
I fucked everyone..

239
00:12:49,024 --> 00:12:52,237
And as in all Jeffery Field's gala..

240
00:12:52,273 --> 00:12:55,571
It don't end until the sun shines.

241
00:12:55,788 --> 00:12:57,343
I'm Michael Corbit.

242
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:01,520
Mr Owen, i was told you want to move the cigar box by 4 feet?

243
00:13:01,556 --> 00:13:03,309
Yes, please thank you.

244
00:13:03,336 --> 00:13:05,355
But.. It's a massive undertaking.

245
00:13:05,391 --> 00:13:07,644
Massive undertaking? Do you feel that breeze?
-Yeah.

246
00:13:07,689 --> 00:13:11,134
See the way the smoke from the cigar is going this way?
If you're smoking a cigar..

247
00:13:11,168 --> 00:13:14,233
Here, and i'm here talking to Gwyneth Paltrow
and Miley Cyrus..

248
00:13:14,295 --> 00:13:17,350
The cigar smoke comes to them,
now they smell like Fidel Castro.

249
00:13:17,405 --> 00:13:21,673
You want that? No, me neither. So, 4 feet, thank you.
-Okay.

250
00:13:21,798 --> 00:13:24,412
Excuse me, why is this purple?

251
00:13:24,448 --> 00:13:26,725
Why is it purple?
I want it violet.

252
00:13:26,748 --> 00:13:30,228
Perfection is our sanctity,
if you don't understand, i'll get someone else.

253
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,021
Thank you, you can take it away now.
Go.

254
00:13:33,066 --> 00:13:36,354
Cherrie..
-Somebody really knows how to crack the whip.

255
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:39,200
Cherrie, you should see me in the bedroom..

256
00:13:39,245 --> 00:13:40,807
That can be arranged.

257
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:44,811
If i have met you before that summer
in Vankemp, who knows..

258
00:13:44,848 --> 00:13:46,745
My life might have taken a different turn.

259
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:50,799
I've got first dibs on Owen.

260
00:13:51,025 --> 00:13:52,967
Besides, i don't think you're his type.

261
00:13:53,122 --> 00:13:55,239
Behave, i'm not a piece of meat.

262
00:13:55,284 --> 00:13:57,706
What is my nosey neighbor Barbara
doing here today?

263
00:13:57,778 --> 00:13:59,027
Being nosey.

264
00:13:59,044 --> 00:14:03,167
I think you're trying to steal my stylist.
Don't worry Barb, i don't think there's a thing he can do to you..

265
00:14:03,184 --> 00:14:05,443
That your plastic surgeon hasn't done already.

266
00:14:05,462 --> 00:14:06,763
I said it.

267
00:14:06,808 --> 00:14:10,942
Stop flirting, if your boyfriend Hans see you touch me,
he's gonna have your nuts in a sling.

268
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,718
If this party isn't uber fabulous,
i'll have your nuts..

269
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:16,050
And they won't be in a sling.

270
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,117
No no, that sucked.

271
00:14:22,172 --> 00:14:23,717
Let's shoot that again.

272
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:25,119
Give me the line again.

273
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:30,136
He'll have nuts..
-Screw it, we'll fix it on the post.

274
00:14:30,415 --> 00:14:32,169
I heard that.

275
00:14:48,823 --> 00:14:51,183
I brought you muffins.

276
00:14:51,983 --> 00:14:56,132
What is IW2SUTYTC mean?

277
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,942
I want to screw you until your toes crawl.
-Oh God.

278
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:02,748
Cameron, that's disgusting, i need
a wetnap.

279
00:15:02,821 --> 00:15:04,854
I need the keys to your house.

280
00:15:04,908 --> 00:15:06,437
So get this..

281
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:09,663
Last night, i thought Ben was gonna propose.

282
00:15:09,698 --> 00:15:13,515
Instead, the jerk asked me
for a threeway.
-No.

283
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:17,238
So i burned him and made up some
BS about wanting 2 guys.

284
00:15:17,285 --> 00:15:19,862
Cameron, Cameron,
this is important to me.

285
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:21,707
Honey, i'm listening.

286
00:15:25,828 --> 00:15:28,838
Okay okay.
All guys want it..

287
00:15:28,884 --> 00:15:31,812
The only difference is
some have the guts to ask.

288
00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:32,983
Vince asked?

289
00:15:33,108 --> 00:15:36,045
No guts, i'm his Madonna,
the Virgin Mary.

290
00:15:36,082 --> 00:15:40,133
Who's on her way to hook up with some guy
for the weekend.

291
00:15:40,682 --> 00:15:43,395
Why aren't you hooking up
in some hotel in the city?

292
00:15:43,425 --> 00:15:47,642
Because, i told you, Hugh is taking me
to Jeffery Field's La Dolce Vida Ball.

293
00:15:47,664 --> 00:15:50,888
The house is under construction,
i haven't been down there for weeks. Owen is..

294
00:15:50,926 --> 00:15:52,898
He's temperamental.
It's totally a mess.

295
00:15:52,927 --> 00:15:56,845
Every room from South Hamptons to Montaugh is sold out.

296
00:15:57,786 --> 00:15:59,153
Thank you, thank you.
I love you.

297
00:15:59,188 --> 00:16:01,618
I'm sorry i have to run on you big time,
big kiss.

298
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,362
I'm not happy about this.

299
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:09,504
Oh shit, Cameron.

300
00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:11,593
Cameron, your dress!

301
00:16:11,644 --> 00:16:13,625
Next stop, Hamptons.

302
00:16:15,393 --> 00:16:18,256
Your dress!

303
00:16:22,124 --> 00:16:24,539
Miss Cooney, can i get your autograph please?

304
00:16:24,561 --> 00:16:26,045
Of course, dear.

305
00:16:26,435 --> 00:16:28,185
When is your next book coming out?

306
00:16:28,272 --> 00:16:30,435
It's called
'The Magical Princess'

307
00:16:30,472 --> 00:16:32,648
And it's coming out shortly.

308
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:40,921
Hi.

309
00:16:41,046 --> 00:16:42,670
Hi.

310
00:16:42,996 --> 00:16:45,028
Hello.
-Hey there.

311
00:16:45,591 --> 00:16:47,297
Weird.

312
00:16:48,237 --> 00:16:53,154
We are auditioning for the "Cooney Magical Princess" book cover, please. Thank you.

313
00:16:53,537 --> 00:16:55,279
Getting a little ahead of ourselves?

314
00:16:58,278 --> 00:16:59,514
Hold on.

315
00:17:00,808 --> 00:17:01,789
Shit.

316
00:17:01,832 --> 00:17:03,416
Oh shit?
-Oh shit?

317
00:17:03,453 --> 00:17:05,947
Why did you say shit for?
I know what shit means, what does it mean?

318
00:17:07,562 --> 00:17:10,772
Need to reschedule Friday lunch
to Monday drinks?

319
00:17:10,815 --> 00:17:13,672
Off to Field's summer ball,
Emma Cooney Ta?

320
00:17:13,716 --> 00:17:14,584
Shit!

321
00:17:14,598 --> 00:17:17,655
I was at his party last year,
and it was ab fab.

322
00:17:18,011 --> 00:17:21,087
Oh my God, you need to get out of here right now.
Sorry.

323
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,728
Really.
-I'm only here about the cover.

324
00:17:22,749 --> 00:17:23,679
What?

325
00:17:23,725 --> 00:17:25,957
Vince said not only do i look like a princess..

326
00:17:25,998 --> 00:17:27,912
But i have that magical quality too.

327
00:17:27,936 --> 00:17:31,327
We don't have much time for magic, but disappear.
Now, seriously.

328
00:17:31,344 --> 00:17:34,094
Hey, ladies audition's over.
Go home.

329
00:17:34,464 --> 00:17:36,860
DUde, this is like Spielberg's boy, okay?

330
00:17:36,884 --> 00:17:39,706
We invited Cooney so we can scoop the deal.
-Do you think?

331
00:17:39,781 --> 00:17:41,569
Yeah, i think.
So what are we gonna do?

332
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:44,041
Give me the keys to the Hampton's house.
-Why?

333
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:47,112
I'm gonna get down there to close Cooney
before Field can.

334
00:17:47,298 --> 00:17:51,482
How are you gonna stroll in uninvited
to the party of the summer?

335
00:17:52,176 --> 00:17:53,998
I'm gonna have to crash it.
-Oh my God.

336
00:17:54,202 --> 00:17:56,435
Want me to tell Cameron you're going so she knows it's legit?
-No no.

337
00:17:56,459 --> 00:17:59,249
She thinks i'm golfing whole weekend.
I don't want to confuse things, it's very important.

338
00:17:59,388 --> 00:18:01,279
Excuse me, hey Vince.

339
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,148
God.

340
00:18:05,149 --> 00:18:06,248
Vince!

341
00:18:06,479 --> 00:18:07,499
Vince!
-Yes!

342
00:18:07,528 --> 00:18:08,632
Stay focus.
-Yeah.

343
00:18:08,656 --> 00:18:10,909
You hear me?
None of your bull.

344
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,051
Vince, we need this.
-I know, Cooney not the pooney.

345
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:15,271
Got it.

346
00:18:15,451 --> 00:18:16,791
Really?

347
00:18:20,262 --> 00:18:21,840
Oh no, Gaby.

348
00:18:23,629 --> 00:18:24,816
Gaby, pick up?

349
00:18:36,735 --> 00:18:39,103
Hi, it's Gabriella.
Please send message.

350
00:18:39,138 --> 00:18:40,948
Gaby, call me as soon as you get this, okay?

351
00:18:40,977 --> 00:18:43,575
My partner Vince is on his way
to the house right now..

352
00:18:43,615 --> 00:18:46,455
So you gotta get to the hotel and get there quick.
I'll pay for it.

353
00:18:46,818 --> 00:18:49,803
Fast, my sweety, very fast.

354
00:18:49,827 --> 00:18:51,402
Ah!

355
00:19:00,953 --> 00:19:03,605
If i had popped the question,
we'd probably on our second kid?

356
00:19:03,629 --> 00:19:05,191
Oh really?

357
00:19:07,434 --> 00:19:09,363
I've been invited to the Dolce La Vita Ball.

358
00:19:09,393 --> 00:19:10,854
You made the guest list?

359
00:19:10,926 --> 00:19:12,609
Yeah.
-One sec.

360
00:19:13,344 --> 00:19:17,352
Sorry, my best friend Cameron is going to that,
i hear it's the party of the year.

361
00:19:17,831 --> 00:19:19,103
Come with me.

362
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,058
He can stick it to me anytime.

363
00:19:25,282 --> 00:19:27,695
I would love to, but..

364
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:30,685
I can't.

365
00:19:37,963 --> 00:19:39,485
Baby, i'm home.

366
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:41,046
Hey, honey.

367
00:19:42,493 --> 00:19:43,499
Babe?

368
00:19:46,826 --> 00:19:48,475
What the hell..

369
00:19:48,807 --> 00:19:50,079
Hey.
-Hey.

370
00:19:50,121 --> 00:19:51,327
Where were you?

371
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,077
I was running errands, why?

372
00:19:54,095 --> 00:19:55,421
I've been calling you.

373
00:19:55,452 --> 00:19:56,811
Why are you so dressed up?

374
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,776
I'm not.

375
00:19:57,806 --> 00:20:01,368
Better question, what is with this $1700 dress?

376
00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:02,620
We haven't closed the deal yet.

377
00:20:02,645 --> 00:20:04,110
Relax, it's not even mine.

378
00:20:04,141 --> 00:20:06,438
I'm just returning it for a friend, Ben.

379
00:20:12,984 --> 00:20:14,582
So, what did you..

380
00:20:15,082 --> 00:20:16,510
Ask me about?

381
00:20:16,939 --> 00:20:20,078
The Hampton house,
i thought maybe..

382
00:20:21,194 --> 00:20:22,665
I should take a loan out on it.

383
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,546
A loan?

384
00:20:23,593 --> 00:20:25,854
To offer Emma Cooney a huge advance
on her book.

385
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:26,936
Why?

386
00:20:26,964 --> 00:20:29,989
Jeffery Field is gonna try and steal our deal.

387
00:20:31,192 --> 00:20:33,190
Unfortunately..

388
00:20:33,678 --> 00:20:37,342
I maxed out the equity we paid for the remodeling.

389
00:20:37,401 --> 00:20:39,134
Jesus Christ!

390
00:20:39,654 --> 00:20:42,186
What did that rip off decorator charge you?

391
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:44,056
Nevermind, you know what?

392
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:48,160
Let's just hope that Vince
talks her into it.

393
00:20:48,825 --> 00:20:50,400
He's on his way up there..
-What?

394
00:20:50,438 --> 00:20:52,187
Ben, you should have asked me.

395
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:57,121
I'll find the money.
-No, about Vince. You shouldn't just let him stay at the house without asking me.

396
00:20:57,626 --> 00:20:58,589
Why is that?

397
00:20:58,626 --> 00:21:00,956
Cause it's a mess.

398
00:21:01,513 --> 00:21:04,637
Vince would live in a leper colony to close a deal.

399
00:21:07,025 --> 00:21:08,804
Is there something else going on?

400
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:12,132
Ben, don't be silly, it's just..

401
00:21:12,591 --> 00:21:17,304
I would appreciate it if you consulted me
on things that were mine.

402
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:21,138
Last night, i thought it was our nest egg.

403
00:21:22,269 --> 00:21:24,893
You went ahead and you spend without talking to me.

404
00:21:28,207 --> 00:21:31,807
Vince, via text, what is IW2..

405
00:21:31,853 --> 00:21:34,112
SUTWTC means?

406
00:21:34,564 --> 00:21:36,833
I want to screw you til your toes curl.

407
00:21:36,893 --> 00:21:37,896
Oh my God.

408
00:21:37,933 --> 00:21:39,959
Lucky you, who's texting you?

409
00:21:40,027 --> 00:21:43,102
Vince, i think she's cheating.
-Calm down.

410
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:46,730
Shit..

411
00:21:47,168 --> 00:21:49,430
Cameron, you idiot.

412
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,714
No, you didn't.

413
00:21:52,113 --> 00:21:55,851
She's wearing night time make up
and it's morning.

414
00:22:01,304 --> 00:22:05,027
Taxi! taxi!
Come on, why don't you stop?

415
00:22:05,999 --> 00:22:08,155
Off to the Hamptons?

416
00:22:19,385 --> 00:22:20,922
Can you take me to the Hamptons?

417
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,797
Hamptons?
-How much for the Hamptons?

418
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,327
No way..

419
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:41,550
Not the threesome i had in mind.

420
00:22:41,588 --> 00:22:45,465
Baby, i gotta go.
I'm pulling off to Field's mansion now.

421
00:22:45,774 --> 00:22:48,676
Alright, i'm just gonna go the cottage, hurry.

422
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:59,096
She is the freaking hottest thing
that you have ever seen.

423
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:03,213
Duncan, i'm telling you.

424
00:23:03,274 --> 00:23:06,321
I'm banging a real cougar tonight.

425
00:23:06,404 --> 00:23:08,982
She's like 28-29 years old.

426
00:23:09,019 --> 00:23:10,743
And she's a real cougar.

427
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:13,908
No way, no way.
-You'll see her at the party.

428
00:23:14,034 --> 00:23:15,527
Boo yeah!

429
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,951
Hey baby..

430
00:23:30,752 --> 00:23:31,943
Upstairs.

431
00:23:31,982 --> 00:23:34,506
No, no..
We're gonna go right here.

432
00:23:35,427 --> 00:23:38,125
I'm taking you from the couch.

433
00:23:38,178 --> 00:23:39,489
Wow..

434
00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:45,048
Not gonna need these anymore.

435
00:23:45,608 --> 00:23:48,970
Oh my God, you have the prettiest feet i have ever seen.

436
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,539
And i've seen a lot of feet.

437
00:23:54,373 --> 00:23:58,058
It's like two basketballs
hiding under your skirt.

438
00:23:58,382 --> 00:24:00,297
You always this aggresive?

439
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:03,037
Don't interrupt my skill.

440
00:24:03,617 --> 00:24:06,142
It's time for some butt bongo, baby.

441
00:24:06,165 --> 00:24:09,321
I want to worship your ass.

442
00:24:11,052 --> 00:24:12,711
Aw..

443
00:24:14,843 --> 00:24:16,673
Have you seen Owen?

444
00:24:16,786 --> 00:24:19,733
Yes, he left on an errand,
saying something about the fa grua..

445
00:24:19,764 --> 00:24:21,942
I think a little too much pistachio.

446
00:24:23,404 --> 00:24:26,058
Your guest?
-Go and get your door for Miss Cooney.

447
00:24:28,514 --> 00:24:31,220
Emma. My darling.

448
00:24:31,689 --> 00:24:35,790
Mon Rocchie is chilled, the berries are freshly baked.

449
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,477
You settle in..

450
00:24:37,696 --> 00:24:39,581
And you get ready for a fabulous feta.

451
00:24:39,706 --> 00:24:43,736
After spending a wet winter, freezing my bum off at Sussex,
i'm more than ready.

452
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:45,791
Take Miss Cooney's things to the lake house.

453
00:24:45,814 --> 00:24:48,128
I have to get ready for the suarrey.

454
00:24:48,188 --> 00:24:52,163
My son is coming home from Andover,
i'm planning a little surprise for him.

455
00:24:52,193 --> 00:24:54,131
You just make yourself at home..

456
00:24:54,152 --> 00:24:56,339
I am so thrilled you're here.

457
00:24:56,464 --> 00:24:58,090
I'm thrilled to be here.

458
00:24:58,105 --> 00:25:00,109
See you.
-Thank you so much.

459
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:04,389
Crashing this joint is a piece of cake.

460
00:25:04,735 --> 00:25:06,997
Emma Conney, here i come.

461
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:09,959
Hi, it's Gabriella,
missing you.

462
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:12,613
Gaby, if you get this,
get out of the house!

463
00:25:14,634 --> 00:25:17,890
Just stay with me,
let your staff do the work.

464
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,212
Are you kidding?
It's the most important event of my career.

465
00:25:21,257 --> 00:25:22,907
Please.

466
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,474
I'll do the thing with my big toe.

467
00:25:42,437 --> 00:25:45,097
You remind me of my aunt.

468
00:25:45,288 --> 00:25:47,420
Only hotter.

469
00:25:50,443 --> 00:25:53,187
Your body is banging.

470
00:25:54,612 --> 00:25:58,077
Oh my God, you are too cool for words.

471
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:01,434
And way too hot for clothes.

472
00:26:13,052 --> 00:26:17,150
I told you that i have a surprise..

473
00:26:17,226 --> 00:26:19,500
For you.
-Oh my God!

474
00:26:19,757 --> 00:26:22,945
Oh my God!
-Nice surprise.

475
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:24,792
Kate, what are you doing here?

476
00:26:24,815 --> 00:26:27,272
One second, pitstop,
but don't worry ladies..

477
00:26:27,287 --> 00:26:30,892
My engine is revved up
and i'm ready to go.

478
00:26:32,075 --> 00:26:34,088
How old is he?

479
00:26:34,213 --> 00:26:35,086
Old enough.

480
00:26:35,108 --> 00:26:38,319
He's gotta go, Vince is here to meet Cooney,
the deal is in trouble, he will be here any minute.

481
00:26:38,341 --> 00:26:40,270
What?
Why don't you call me?

482
00:26:40,338 --> 00:26:42,395
Do you hear me now?
-Shit!

483
00:26:44,292 --> 00:26:45,875
Oh my God!

484
00:26:45,898 --> 00:26:48,083
Put it out!
Oh my God, your hand!

485
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,727
What are you doing?
-Putting the fire out!

486
00:26:50,772 --> 00:26:52,920
I'm naked, i'm hitting it.

487
00:26:52,943 --> 00:26:55,389
And then her girlfriend walks in.

488
00:26:55,427 --> 00:26:56,489
No way!

489
00:26:56,557 --> 00:27:00,713
Not one, but two hot and horny cougars!

490
00:27:01,633 --> 00:27:03,637
Excuse me, excuse me..

491
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,965
Can you come over here please?
-Yeah, hi.

492
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:09,024
Who are you with?
-I'm with the guys.

493
00:27:09,047 --> 00:27:10,291
The guys?

494
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,617
Yeah.

495
00:27:11,647 --> 00:27:13,245
Just doing my thing.

496
00:27:13,268 --> 00:27:14,339
Your thing?

497
00:27:14,345 --> 00:27:17,419
That's cool, cause i thought that you might be
a sneaky snake sneaking in.

498
00:27:17,433 --> 00:27:20,296
Why would i sneak in?
I'm already here.

499
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:21,825
Doing what?

500
00:27:22,217 --> 00:27:23,717
Landscaping?

501
00:27:23,815 --> 00:27:25,409
Skimming the pool?

502
00:27:25,455 --> 00:27:28,077
Okay, moaching.

503
00:27:28,507 --> 00:27:29,999
Decorating.

504
00:27:30,036 --> 00:27:31,958
Breaking and entering.

505
00:27:32,177 --> 00:27:33,473
You don't understand.

506
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:37,515
Is that because you think i make $12 an hour with no benefits, i'm an idiot?

507
00:27:37,793 --> 00:27:40,122
Or maybe because you think i'm black?

508
00:27:40,182 --> 00:27:41,727
Guess what, I'm Dominican.

509
00:27:41,758 --> 00:27:43,959
Really?
-Let's go.

510
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,330
I'm here to see Emma Cooney.

511
00:27:45,376 --> 00:27:46,205
Who?
-Emma Cooney.

512
00:27:46,234 --> 00:27:47,720
You're here to see me?

513
00:27:47,845 --> 00:27:49,283
Yes!

514
00:27:50,172 --> 00:27:51,414
Hi, glad to see you.

515
00:27:51,466 --> 00:27:55,942
Vince.. Ben Roberts, Family Quality Publishing.

516
00:27:55,956 --> 00:27:59,589
You're gonna meet my partner Vince on Monday, yes..
-Yes.

517
00:27:59,714 --> 00:28:00,915
Of course.

518
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:04,339
I got a little place down the beach,
310 Hampton Road..

519
00:28:04,414 --> 00:28:06,629
Come buy for a sunset cocktail.

520
00:28:07,003 --> 00:28:09,785
I'd love to, but i've only just arrived.

521
00:28:09,806 --> 00:28:12,634
I look forward to meeting Vince on Monday..

522
00:28:12,873 --> 00:28:15,767
If you're here tonight,
do say hello.

523
00:28:16,151 --> 00:28:17,968
Ta..
-Ta!

524
00:28:19,048 --> 00:28:20,338
Da.. See?

525
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:22,365
She said if i'd..
Not invite.

526
00:28:22,402 --> 00:28:23,111
Go.

527
00:28:30,261 --> 00:28:32,386
You better get the guys to this party.

528
00:28:32,425 --> 00:28:36,590
They are in for the shock of their lives.

529
00:28:36,649 --> 00:28:37,916
Done, i am there.

530
00:28:37,953 --> 00:28:42,239
Hey, Hugh right now is banging cougar.
He's banging cougar right now.

531
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:48,314
What are we gonna tell Hugh?

532
00:28:49,443 --> 00:28:50,913
What's that noise?

533
00:28:51,327 --> 00:28:53,047
What noise?
-Did you hear that?

534
00:28:56,338 --> 00:28:58,811
When are you gonna stop this gay masquarade?

535
00:28:58,848 --> 00:29:01,395
There are straight 500 designers.

536
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,362
Now can you let me make the bed?

537
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,369
It's a shame nobody sees you for the man you really are.

538
00:29:07,408 --> 00:29:12,049
Every woman wants to believe she's got the magic to turn a gay man straight.

539
00:29:12,147 --> 00:29:15,394
Owen, is that you.
-Admit it, you shit.

540
00:29:15,431 --> 00:29:18,437
I want more down, it's disgusting.

541
00:29:18,482 --> 00:29:20,834
It's like chicken feathers.
-Owen!

542
00:29:21,247 --> 00:29:22,310
Kate!

543
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:24,043
What are you doing here?

544
00:29:24,081 --> 00:29:26,865
I told you i would call you Monday,
the house is not ready for you to see yet.

545
00:29:26,949 --> 00:29:28,313
Who's this?
-Who are you?

546
00:29:28,328 --> 00:29:29,376
Who are they?
-What's going on?

547
00:29:29,383 --> 00:29:31,101
Who's asking?
-No more questions.

548
00:29:32,209 --> 00:29:35,766
I am Owen Manners, i am Kate's personal lifestylers..

549
00:29:35,789 --> 00:29:38,184
Kate, shoo shoo, your hair is a disaster.

550
00:29:38,215 --> 00:29:41,267
Look at this flyaway, my god you need some hair serum.

551
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:43,768
Nice to meet you,
how are you?

552
00:29:44,078 --> 00:29:45,766
This is Gabriella.
She is..

553
00:29:45,796 --> 00:29:47,681
Benny's houseguest.

554
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,327
Benny?

555
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,727
So, this is what Benny had in mind.

556
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:55,215
A threesome with this chiquita.

557
00:29:59,655 --> 00:30:02,217
Global warming in this room
is affecting my chi.

558
00:30:02,254 --> 00:30:03,908
Ciao!

559
00:30:04,587 --> 00:30:07,051
I'm gonna call Benny right now..

560
00:30:07,066 --> 00:30:09,416
We're gonna sort this out.

561
00:30:09,492 --> 00:30:12,250
Fine, it's his house.
-It's my house!

562
00:30:13,064 --> 00:30:15,803
He told me i could stay here
to write my book.

563
00:30:15,841 --> 00:30:17,672
You're a writer?
-Yes.

564
00:30:18,509 --> 00:30:21,096
Like John Gris-ham.

565
00:30:23,885 --> 00:30:24,971
Right.

566
00:30:24,993 --> 00:30:28,465
I'm sure she thinks the thesaurus is a dinosaur.

567
00:30:31,495 --> 00:30:32,809
Hello?
-Hi Ben.

568
00:30:32,847 --> 00:30:34,889
Kate, hey baby. Hi.

569
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:37,345
Do you have a woman staying in my house?

570
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:40,676
And before you lie, i'd like to remind you
that i'm here right now.

571
00:30:40,737 --> 00:30:43,706
And she's right in front of me.

572
00:30:44,768 --> 00:30:47,322
I know you will never believe this by looking at her..

573
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:51,024
But she's a very talented writer.
She has this great idea for a book.

574
00:30:51,054 --> 00:30:54,135
And because the business is running on fume,
In advance..

575
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,910
I thought she can stay at the house for free while she writes.

576
00:30:56,948 --> 00:31:00,422
And at the same time, housesit,
as to protect your investment.

577
00:31:00,618 --> 00:31:02,579
And as for not telling you..

578
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:04,365
Quite honestly i forgot.

579
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,121
You know, keys and glasses you forget..

580
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:12,998
A Brazillian bombshell staying in the master bedroom of your girlfriend's house, you don't forget!

581
00:31:13,057 --> 00:31:15,641
Don't you think that if i knew that if you were going there..

582
00:31:15,692 --> 00:31:17,720
I would call her and tell her to leave?

583
00:31:18,189 --> 00:31:19,215
This is not over.

584
00:31:19,267 --> 00:31:20,842
I love me my Kate.
Your my Kate.

585
00:31:20,873 --> 00:31:22,320
Is Vince there yet?

586
00:31:22,538 --> 00:31:24,626
We're definitely gonna talk about this.

587
00:31:30,809 --> 00:31:32,587
There's nothing going on.

588
00:31:34,245 --> 00:31:37,757
I actually think it's her cheating on me,
but she puts me on the defense, weird.

589
00:31:38,233 --> 00:31:40,509
First i get that crazy sextext..

590
00:31:40,546 --> 00:31:42,685
And that brand new dress she never worn..

591
00:31:42,723 --> 00:31:44,772
And my sex maniac partner goes to the hamptons..

592
00:31:44,788 --> 00:31:48,638
To figure out our business, and at the same time
she's there and i can't get a hold of them?

593
00:31:50,289 --> 00:31:51,956
Are you saying something, young man?

594
00:31:51,978 --> 00:31:54,314
He is a three time loser.

595
00:31:54,352 --> 00:31:57,901
His business is going under,
his girl is two-timing him..

596
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:01,735
And on top of it all,
his partner is stuping her.

597
00:32:01,766 --> 00:32:03,928
That's certainly one interpretation.

598
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:11,142
So here's where you've been hiding.

599
00:32:11,734 --> 00:32:13,400
What's smell like burn cat hair?

600
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,892
You gotta go.

601
00:32:15,156 --> 00:32:18,322
My husband would murder you.

602
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,206
Your husband?

603
00:32:20,327 --> 00:32:21,954
You're married?

604
00:32:27,001 --> 00:32:28,486
I knew it.

605
00:32:28,524 --> 00:32:30,649
Writer my ass.

606
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:32,367
That liar!

607
00:32:33,611 --> 00:32:35,661
Where are my pants?

608
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:38,137
They were right here.

609
00:32:38,447 --> 00:32:40,007
Cameron!

610
00:32:40,534 --> 00:32:43,067
Wait, i'll find you some clothes.
-You see this?

611
00:32:44,243 --> 00:32:45,562
Where are my clothes?

612
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,578
All burned up.
-How?

613
00:32:46,623 --> 00:32:49,382
No time for explanations.
-That bastard is cheating on me.

614
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:50,909
I need pants.

615
00:32:50,932 --> 00:32:54,512
He's on his way.
-No, your husband can't come.

616
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,238
I'm naked.

617
00:32:56,275 --> 00:32:57,790
Oh my god.

618
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:15,645
Shit. He looks mean.

619
00:33:16,059 --> 00:33:17,520
Fuck.

620
00:33:22,735 --> 00:33:24,649
Your husband is here.

621
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,674
What?

622
00:33:30,951 --> 00:33:34,034
Vince is at the door.
-Good, let him in, i'll ask him how long Ben's been banging the bimbo.

623
00:33:34,071 --> 00:33:35,722
Come on.

624
00:33:54,621 --> 00:33:55,910
No, this way.

625
00:33:55,939 --> 00:33:57,658
This way!

626
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:07,259
This is great.

627
00:34:07,304 --> 00:34:09,519
Where did baby Huey go?
-Stop it.

628
00:34:09,644 --> 00:34:11,704
He just looks young.

629
00:34:16,574 --> 00:34:18,711
You're here, hi.

630
00:34:18,758 --> 00:34:20,378
Didn't hear you come in.

631
00:34:20,416 --> 00:34:22,476
You are beautiful.

632
00:34:22,515 --> 00:34:25,190
God damn, you find the place okay?

633
00:34:25,548 --> 00:34:27,301
Who the hell are you?

634
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:28,896
I'm Vinnie.

635
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:32,146
Are you not Jannie, my naughty craiglist hottie?

636
00:34:32,193 --> 00:34:33,905
I'm calling the police.

637
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,978
Relax, anybody's calling the police, it's me.

638
00:34:36,016 --> 00:34:37,881
Ben didn't tell me anybody was staying here.

639
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:41,001
He didn't tell that circus was coming to town either.

640
00:34:41,068 --> 00:34:43,526
Sounds hinky, i'm Ben's partner.

641
00:34:43,564 --> 00:34:45,317
And that sounds hinky to me.

642
00:34:45,354 --> 00:34:48,937
If you were Ben's partner,
you should know i'm here.

643
00:34:49,897 --> 00:34:51,413
The bastard's cheating on me.

644
00:34:51,471 --> 00:34:53,433
That bastard's cheating on you.

645
00:34:53,471 --> 00:34:55,205
I'm gonna circumsized him.

646
00:34:53,471 --> 00:34:55,205
.

647
00:35:23,152 --> 00:35:26,101
This is exaclty why Vince and i
have an open relationship.

648
00:35:26,148 --> 00:35:29,118
Then why are we hiding in the boathouse?

649
00:35:29,523 --> 00:35:31,896
Maybe he's having an affair too.

650
00:35:32,439 --> 00:35:36,884
No, Vince would never, rule number 4 remember?
Always an away game.

651
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,966
But you're here.

652
00:35:39,802 --> 00:35:41,273
I didn't think of that.

653
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:44,479
Never mind about you,
i am getting even..

654
00:35:44,501 --> 00:35:45,654
Tonight.

655
00:35:45,857 --> 00:35:49,022
To think, i could have hooked up with Matt at the party, but i said no.

656
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:52,070
You would not even cheat on a math test.

657
00:35:52,107 --> 00:35:54,715
I can just see you dining on Wiener and Balls.

658
00:35:55,151 --> 00:35:56,855
No, i'm doing it.

659
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,447
Even if it's Owen.

660
00:36:00,201 --> 00:36:01,954
Owen's gay.

661
00:36:02,746 --> 00:36:04,238
Not tonight he's not.

662
00:36:21,641 --> 00:36:23,441
Kate?

663
00:36:24,518 --> 00:36:25,981
Gaby?

664
00:36:26,395 --> 00:36:28,241
Vince?
-Hey!

665
00:36:28,339 --> 00:36:29,864
Don't do that!
-Do what?

666
00:36:29,931 --> 00:36:32,124
Is she here?
-Oh yeah.

667
00:36:32,185 --> 00:36:35,332
No, she's not, but why are you holding out on me?

668
00:36:35,574 --> 00:36:37,458
Is Kate here?

669
00:36:37,526 --> 00:36:41,461
No, you can stop acting like all freaked out now, okay?

670
00:36:41,529 --> 00:36:43,450
She's gone.

671
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:46,412
Did you talk to Emma Cooney yet?

672
00:36:46,442 --> 00:36:48,078
Of course, relax.

673
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,946
She couldn't been more pleasant.
-That's great.

674
00:36:49,977 --> 00:36:51,339
When do we meet?
-Tonight at the party.

675
00:36:51,384 --> 00:36:52,853
SHe invited you?

676
00:36:52,967 --> 00:36:53,826
Not exactly.

677
00:36:53,946 --> 00:36:55,642
But she gave you an invitation?

678
00:36:55,767 --> 00:36:57,089
Not exactly.

679
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,460
But you're on the list?

680
00:36:58,845 --> 00:36:59,997
Not exactly.
-Stop it.

681
00:36:59,998 --> 00:37:01,262
How are we going to the party?

682
00:37:01,263 --> 00:37:03,185
I don't know about you,
but i'm crashing.

683
00:37:11,765 --> 00:37:14,018
Vincy Wincey!

684
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:19,134
I'm Vince.
-Oh my God!

685
00:37:19,224 --> 00:37:20,596
Yes!

686
00:37:21,765 --> 00:37:24,418
And you brought a friend.
-My best friend Wendy!

687
00:37:24,433 --> 00:37:25,983
Hello.

688
00:37:26,029 --> 00:37:27,316
Since we never see each other..

689
00:37:27,354 --> 00:37:28,916
I didn't know if you're gonna be like a creep..

690
00:37:28,959 --> 00:37:31,560
Or one of those gadget predator freaks
or whatever..

691
00:37:31,597 --> 00:37:32,976
I'm no creep.

692
00:37:33,006 --> 00:37:34,521
He doesn't look like a creep.

693
00:37:34,605 --> 00:37:36,029
Come on, this is Ben.

694
00:37:36,066 --> 00:37:38,145
Vince told me.

695
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,519
You're the guy with the women problem.

696
00:37:40,534 --> 00:37:42,230
Poor little fella.

697
00:37:42,283 --> 00:37:44,580
Your casa is tight..

698
00:37:44,597 --> 00:37:47,204
We are gonna have mad fun.

699
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:51,730
Excuse me, what are you doing inviting the Jersey Shore in here?

700
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,579
Kate's already think i'm cheating with gaby.

701
00:37:53,624 --> 00:37:56,164
Aren't you?
-No, of course not.

702
00:37:56,216 --> 00:37:57,550
Why  not?

703
00:37:57,573 --> 00:38:02,033
The fact that you're hiding Gaby from Kate mean subconsiencely, you want something to happen.

704
00:38:02,101 --> 00:38:04,081
Hold on, just because you have a screw up relationship, doesn't mean..

705
00:38:04,118 --> 00:38:05,687
I'll stop you right there.

706
00:38:05,715 --> 00:38:08,609
I love my wife..

707
00:38:08,647 --> 00:38:12,283
I'd die for her, do not judge what you don't understand.

708
00:38:12,408 --> 00:38:14,695
Yo Vinnie, when are we going to the beach?

709
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:16,225
Very soon.

710
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:19,977
I just don't get how you're fine with your wife banging every swinger in a tri-state area.

711
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:21,912
You think Cam has fooled around?

712
00:38:21,943 --> 00:38:23,518
Cam is a shopper.

713
00:38:23,571 --> 00:38:25,690
The way to get her off
is to yell Sale.

714
00:38:32,396 --> 00:38:36,486
Honestly Vince, is the Emma Cooney thing bolt
so you can have your little..

715
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,168
Vince Gone Wild weekend?

716
00:38:39,198 --> 00:38:40,669
Vin, where can we put our stuff?

717
00:38:40,692 --> 00:38:42,899
Upstairs, but first..

718
00:38:42,915 --> 00:38:46,320
Who wants martinis?
Only they won't be tinies..

719
00:38:46,554 --> 00:38:48,581
He's so ready.

720
00:38:48,627 --> 00:38:50,053
Get them out of here right now.

721
00:38:50,076 --> 00:38:51,915
I can't.
-Why not?

722
00:38:51,938 --> 00:38:54,502
They are our ticket into the party.

723
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,819
Martinis are nice,
but mojitos are nicer.

724
00:39:02,985 --> 00:39:05,020
Go, go!

725
00:39:05,145 --> 00:39:07,005
Shuh..

726
00:39:07,254 --> 00:39:09,364
Bad, bad..

727
00:39:10,371 --> 00:39:12,120
Did baby Hugh go home to mommy?

728
00:39:12,135 --> 00:39:13,703
Stop it with the baby jokes.

729
00:39:13,733 --> 00:39:15,886
He told me he was 24.

730
00:39:18,073 --> 00:39:19,646
That's gross.

731
00:39:19,771 --> 00:39:21,124
Why did you get a dog?

732
00:39:21,176 --> 00:39:22,894
Sorry.

733
00:39:31,405 --> 00:39:33,507
Why me?

734
00:39:40,843 --> 00:39:45,108
See that?
Would you look at that? Is that beautiful?

735
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:50,664
What?
-Nothing.

736
00:39:50,867 --> 00:39:52,289
The beach!

737
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:54,189
We need sunbathing.

738
00:39:54,314 --> 00:39:56,219
Oh my God, you are bad.

739
00:39:56,257 --> 00:40:00,174
You're bad.
-You're bad.
-Ladies, you're both bad.

740
00:40:02,238 --> 00:40:05,267
He is so tomorrow's obituary.

741
00:40:09,685 --> 00:40:11,705
God damn it.

742
00:40:11,974 --> 00:40:13,759
You girls have lovely tan.

743
00:40:13,789 --> 00:40:16,382
We got them dyed in..

744
00:40:16,471 --> 00:40:18,428
Turks and Cacos.

745
00:40:18,465 --> 00:40:20,448
I love to dye for konk..

746
00:40:21,699 --> 00:40:23,246
Me too.

747
00:40:24,776 --> 00:40:26,630
I don't get it.

748
00:40:27,082 --> 00:40:28,832
What about your open relationship?

749
00:40:28,861 --> 00:40:31,055
It's just slammed shut.

750
00:40:38,446 --> 00:40:39,966
Cameron, i don't understand.

751
00:40:40,018 --> 00:40:41,715
I thought that you agreed to this.

752
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,132
I did, but..

753
00:40:43,915 --> 00:40:46,371
It's only because i didn't want to lose him.

754
00:41:03,206 --> 00:41:05,676
Benjamin, thank you.
Thank you.

755
00:41:05,801 --> 00:41:07,130
Thank you.

756
00:41:07,621 --> 00:41:09,179
This is 3, you need one.

757
00:41:09,224 --> 00:41:11,221
Make a fourth, please.
-I need that one.

758
00:41:11,259 --> 00:41:12,872
Before Vince and i got married..

759
00:41:12,895 --> 00:41:15,220
I knew he was wild and..

760
00:41:15,258 --> 00:41:16,735
Unpredictable.

761
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:18,423
How do i love him, right?

762
00:41:18,548 --> 00:41:22,377
I guess i kinda thought if i let him be with
other women afterwards..

763
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,938
He'd..

764
00:41:24,063 --> 00:41:26,668
He'd realized that i'm the only one he wants.

765
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:35,786
You've never done it.

766
00:41:36,879 --> 00:41:38,537
You can't do it.

767
00:41:39,615 --> 00:41:41,815
You're a monogamous.

768
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:44,430
How about some music, Benny?

769
00:41:44,452 --> 00:41:46,002
We need music.

770
00:41:46,019 --> 00:41:47,842
Music, can you put the music on, Ben?

771
00:41:48,347 --> 00:41:50,458
There you go, music.

772
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,435
Come on, come on.

773
00:41:53,481 --> 00:41:55,410
I got some moves to show you.

774
00:41:55,433 --> 00:41:57,620
I got some moves to show you..

775
00:42:07,069 --> 00:42:08,810
Come on ladies, let's get you upstairs.

776
00:42:08,869 --> 00:42:11,312
Come on, let's go.

777
00:42:15,393 --> 00:42:16,673
Hell no!

778
00:42:17,961 --> 00:42:19,521
Your room, ladies..

779
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:21,277
Oh, there's only one bed.

780
00:42:21,322 --> 00:42:22,576
That's okay.

781
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:24,068
We can sleep together.

782
00:42:24,107 --> 00:42:26,217
Why didn't i think of that?

783
00:42:28,282 --> 00:42:29,645
Go away, dog.

784
00:42:29,676 --> 00:42:31,831
Stop it..

785
00:42:37,318 --> 00:42:39,849
Keys, keys, where did she put those keys?

786
00:42:43,751 --> 00:42:45,666
Wait, what?

787
00:42:45,689 --> 00:42:48,145
I don't mean to get all uptight, and judgey..

788
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:49,855
Or anything, i just..
-It's all good.

789
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,310
I'm not you, man.

790
00:42:51,355 --> 00:42:54,415
I can't sign up for the Vince's idiot Guide to a marriage.

791
00:42:54,445 --> 00:42:56,707
I didn't mean that,
that came out wrong.

792
00:42:57,618 --> 00:43:01,670
I'm just saying, if Kate cheated on me..

793
00:43:02,273 --> 00:43:04,353
I'd consider killing myself.
-No!

794
00:43:04,933 --> 00:43:07,102
Any pricks doing your old lady would be dead meat, alright?

795
00:43:07,132 --> 00:43:09,506
You're my boy, Ben.
I'd go Goodfellas on them.

796
00:43:09,528 --> 00:43:10,868
Mid-evil torture stuff?
-No.

797
00:43:10,891 --> 00:43:14,372
That's Pulp Fiction, get your movie straight.
I'm trying to be sincere, you're fucking it up.

798
00:43:14,583 --> 00:43:16,943
Not only do i got your back,
i'll take the boat out..

799
00:43:16,966 --> 00:43:18,676
And i'd cut that weasel up.

800
00:43:19,378 --> 00:43:20,996
I'm so..

801
00:43:21,561 --> 00:43:22,436
Fucked.

802
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:24,327
Soprano style.
-Soprano style.

803
00:43:39,709 --> 00:43:41,554
Come on ladies, we want to be early.

804
00:43:41,584 --> 00:43:43,340
I'll stay here and wait for Kate.

805
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,156
You do that, good luck.

806
00:43:45,282 --> 00:43:46,622
Bye bye Benny.

807
00:43:46,683 --> 00:43:49,184
We'll see you later, right?

808
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:54,994
Don't worry, i'm gonna have Cooney signed
by the time i get back.

809
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:02,150
Who doesn't have a door knob?

810
00:44:02,198 --> 00:44:05,507
How are you supposed to get out of the closet
when you're in the closet?

811
00:44:05,854 --> 00:44:08,453
Your chariot awaits.

812
00:44:10,382 --> 00:44:12,581
Come here.
-Oh, how sweet.

813
00:44:12,626 --> 00:44:14,449
He likes you.

814
00:44:16,044 --> 00:44:17,670
Somebody needs a doggy mint.

815
00:44:17,731 --> 00:44:19,328
Yes, you do.

816
00:44:19,358 --> 00:44:22,750
I'm gonna die over cougars.

817
00:44:28,574 --> 00:44:30,888
You must think i'm pretty stupid, huh?

818
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,116
No..

819
00:44:32,214 --> 00:44:33,013
No.

820
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:34,898
I think you're a woman in love.

821
00:44:36,677 --> 00:44:38,161
Let's just go home.

822
00:44:38,199 --> 00:44:40,851
No, we're going to the Dolce Vita Ball.

823
00:44:40,918 --> 00:44:42,530
Okay?
Come on.

824
00:44:42,989 --> 00:44:45,166
Let's go, you'll have fun.

825
00:44:45,506 --> 00:44:47,187
Come on.

826
00:44:50,924 --> 00:44:52,741
Oh crap.

827
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:54,445
Cameron?

828
00:44:54,476 --> 00:44:57,317
Hugh was our ticket to the party,
how are we gonna get in?

829
00:44:57,875 --> 00:45:00,967
The old fashion way, baby.

830
00:45:01,524 --> 00:45:02,806
Damn.

831
00:45:02,836 --> 00:45:04,879
This is the new you.

832
00:45:05,004 --> 00:45:08,428
Let's freaking do it, we got 3 hours til this party starts.

833
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:12,242
So, let's whore up, baby..

834
00:45:19,074 --> 00:45:21,267
I'd die a virgin.

835
00:45:22,452 --> 00:45:26,159
Those Jersey Girls, who likes fake tits?
Nobody.

836
00:45:28,462 --> 00:45:31,876
i have nothing to wear,
i'm not even wearing my good panties.

837
00:45:31,907 --> 00:45:33,619
Why wear any?

838
00:45:33,657 --> 00:45:36,589
Let's steal some of that Brazillian bimbo's clothes.

839
00:45:36,626 --> 00:45:39,510
No, i would never..
-I'll wear something of hers..

840
00:45:39,564 --> 00:45:41,937
And you can wear my new dress.
-No.

841
00:45:42,186 --> 00:45:45,013
How do you not work and afford such expensive clothes?

842
00:45:45,051 --> 00:45:47,674
I can't, Vince may have his 10 rules..

843
00:45:47,704 --> 00:45:48,848
But i've got 1.

844
00:45:48,878 --> 00:45:50,573
The wife shopping code of conduct.

845
00:45:50,596 --> 00:45:54,704
Bang him into that credit card, mortgage,
maternity, whatever it takes.

846
00:45:54,733 --> 00:45:56,602
Too confession of a shopaholic.

847
00:45:56,633 --> 00:45:58,652
Til death do you part.

848
00:45:59,394 --> 00:46:01,933
You know what?
Let's get this party started.

849
00:46:01,979 --> 00:46:04,589
I am gonna get us some shots.
-Okay, i'm gonna take a bath.

850
00:46:14,278 --> 00:46:17,715
I didn't even get to see them make out.

851
00:46:20,729 --> 00:46:22,643
Bad idea.

852
00:46:29,552 --> 00:46:32,017
Short cut..

853
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:33,371
This is so thrilling.

854
00:46:33,417 --> 00:46:35,173
It's like adventure.

855
00:46:35,204 --> 00:46:36,718
It should be right here.

856
00:46:36,824 --> 00:46:40,207
I still have so much to do, and you're dragging me up.
The party stars at 2 hours.

857
00:46:40,228 --> 00:46:44,103
There's no way i'm taking a shower with that pervert,
i'll be quick.

858
00:46:44,473 --> 00:46:46,048
Dwayne!
-Yes sir.

859
00:46:46,071 --> 00:46:48,290
I have to help Miss Shorbin pick up an outfit.

860
00:46:48,334 --> 00:46:50,197
She needs a man's touch.

861
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:52,894
Don't we all?

862
00:46:53,956 --> 00:46:57,317
Be careful with that, please.
And move that fucking tree!

863
00:47:01,413 --> 00:47:04,172
Aren't you a little old to be playing
hide and seek?

864
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:06,164
Ha ha.. Very funny.

865
00:47:06,231 --> 00:47:08,786
What did you do?
Bite the head off something?

866
00:47:09,625 --> 00:47:11,005
Oh God.

867
00:47:11,201 --> 00:47:13,552
Shit!

868
00:47:14,102 --> 00:47:16,996
Stop it, Hugh!
You're not wearing this dress, it's for Kate.

869
00:47:17,043 --> 00:47:19,002
I'm tired of being naked.

870
00:47:19,046 --> 00:47:21,193
Please, i'm begging you.

871
00:47:24,179 --> 00:47:26,694
I told you this was a good shortcut.

872
00:47:26,715 --> 00:47:28,879
Ladies, you go work your magic..

873
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:31,595
And tell him your Vincy Wincy is on his way.
-Okay.

874
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:47,861
Hurry up, let's go chop-chop,
let's get it.

875
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:50,190
Thank you, thank you,
whoa!

876
00:47:50,235 --> 00:47:51,273
Where are you going?

877
00:47:51,398 --> 00:47:53,944
I'm with the ladies, they put me on the list.

878
00:47:54,069 --> 00:47:55,213
I don't think so.
-Just now.

879
00:47:55,258 --> 00:47:57,888
They did tell me they expect a Vincy Wincy though..

880
00:47:57,971 --> 00:48:00,184
But not a little sneaky snake named Ben.

881
00:48:00,223 --> 00:48:02,084
If i see you again, i'm calling the cops.

882
00:48:02,153 --> 00:48:03,486
You got that.

883
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,185
White people get locked up too.

884
00:48:08,688 --> 00:48:11,536
Please hurry, if Fields finds out i left,
he's gonna kill me.

885
00:48:11,574 --> 00:48:15,260
For once, can you think of someone
other than your paycheck?

886
00:48:16,517 --> 00:48:17,527
Hey.
-Hey.

887
00:48:17,557 --> 00:48:19,027
Look who i found.

888
00:48:19,222 --> 00:48:20,873
Feathers, nice..

889
00:48:20,919 --> 00:48:22,930
Pants will be better.

890
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,698
How the hell did i become a naked man trying to escape?

891
00:48:26,823 --> 00:48:29,752
I've begun questioning many things myself.

892
00:48:29,797 --> 00:48:31,667
Cheers.
-Thanks.

893
00:48:31,727 --> 00:48:33,805
Crazy bitches.

894
00:48:34,732 --> 00:48:37,258
Here, don't you dare leave without me.

895
00:48:37,287 --> 00:48:39,781
Hurry up please.
-I will.

896
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:41,478
Ladies..

897
00:48:41,726 --> 00:48:42,811
I'm out of here.

898
00:48:42,849 --> 00:48:45,093
No no..

899
00:48:45,138 --> 00:48:46,992
You promised to take us to that party.

900
00:48:47,006 --> 00:48:49,283
And that's exactly what you're gonna do.

901
00:48:49,375 --> 00:48:53,247
You know what, i think Vince has some clothes,
why don't you go in there and find some of his?

902
00:48:53,269 --> 00:48:54,942
I'll help you.

903
00:48:56,699 --> 00:48:59,653
You know what? I'm gonna get a shower, okay?
-Okay.

904
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,046
Oh shit.

905
00:49:07,137 --> 00:49:09,624
Shit! Shit!

906
00:49:13,724 --> 00:49:17,206
Hey Mattie, it's me Kitty Kate.

907
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:20,692
Gaby, i'm dying!

908
00:49:21,678 --> 00:49:23,158
Who the hell are you and
why are you drinking my beer?

909
00:49:23,241 --> 00:49:25,871
You must be the perv.

910
00:49:29,762 --> 00:49:32,340
Cameron..
-I'm in the shower.

911
00:49:32,529 --> 00:49:33,673
Mind if i come in?

912
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:36,205
So, change of plans.
I'm in the Hamptons.

913
00:49:36,235 --> 00:49:38,129
And i would love to see you.

914
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:40,578
Please hurry, if i don't get to the party..

915
00:49:40,594 --> 00:49:42,227
Field's going to castrate me.

916
00:49:42,249 --> 00:49:43,320
You're going to the party?

917
00:49:43,342 --> 00:49:45,648
Honey, i am the party.

918
00:49:45,723 --> 00:49:48,844
Man buddy, you gotta get me in.
I will do anything.

919
00:49:50,864 --> 00:49:53,557
Almost anything.

920
00:49:53,682 --> 00:49:55,012
No.

921
00:49:55,297 --> 00:49:59,307
Gaby, come on!
I'm dying!

922
00:49:59,857 --> 00:50:01,251
Owen?

923
00:50:09,416 --> 00:50:10,780
Ben?

924
00:50:10,856 --> 00:50:11,979
What are you doing up there?

925
00:50:12,031 --> 00:50:13,824
Looking for a cellphone service.

926
00:50:13,854 --> 00:50:15,321
Help me, dude.

927
00:50:15,705 --> 00:50:17,928
Gaby, it's time to go.

928
00:50:18,053 --> 00:50:20,016
Gaby, i'm getting old waiting for you.

929
00:50:20,076 --> 00:50:22,684
Make love to me.
-What?

930
00:50:25,704 --> 00:50:27,392
Owen?

931
00:50:28,485 --> 00:50:29,668
Come on, baby.

932
00:50:29,743 --> 00:50:32,015
Those are couture.
-Yeah, talk to me.

933
00:50:35,114 --> 00:50:36,651
Owen, is that you?

934
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:39,478
Look at these fancy socks.

935
00:50:40,541 --> 00:50:43,639
Oh yeah baby..
-Oh yeah.

936
00:50:44,318 --> 00:50:45,441
Call me mommy.

937
00:50:45,493 --> 00:50:48,680
Call me mommy, oh yes

938
00:50:48,717 --> 00:50:50,819
Oh yeah..
-Okay, mommy..

939
00:50:50,863 --> 00:50:52,985
Ow ow, you're hurting me.

940
00:50:53,003 --> 00:50:54,967
Yeah.
-Ow ow ow..

00:50:54,991 --> 00:50:57,464
You're hurting my..

942
00:50:57,482 --> 00:50:58,934
You like it rough?

943
00:50:58,953 --> 00:51:00,858
No, i don't like it rough.

944
00:51:00,888 --> 00:51:02,979
Come on, baby.

945
00:51:03,004 --> 00:51:04,426
Hey, here you go.

946
00:51:05,983 --> 00:51:07,272
Where are you going?
-Kate!

947
00:51:07,291 --> 00:51:09,546
Where are you going?
-Owen, where are you?

948
00:51:11,066 --> 00:51:12,542
I can't do this.-
What's the matter?

949
00:51:12,567 --> 00:51:13,863
Shit! Owen!

950
00:51:13,911 --> 00:51:16,372
Owen..

951
00:51:16,631 --> 00:51:17,685
Yeah.

952
00:51:19,364 --> 00:51:20,846
Excuse me.
-No!

953
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:22,637
You're like a man possesed!

954
00:51:22,842 --> 00:51:23,914
Benny?
-Gaby?

955
00:51:23,957 --> 00:51:25,199
What are you doing here?

956
00:51:25,246 --> 00:51:26,181
What do you mean?

957
00:51:26,657 --> 00:51:28,854
I'm so sorry for you.

958
00:51:29,083 --> 00:51:30,560
Owen!

959
00:51:31,513 --> 00:51:33,629
Oh no!
-Ben, it's not what it looks like.

960
00:51:33,683 --> 00:51:35,738
Owen, i'm ready.
Wait!

961
00:51:35,973 --> 00:51:38,366
Before you lie, i'd like to remind you

00:51:38,402 --> 00:51:40,659
And mr, naked fruitypants is right in front of me.

963
00:51:40,695 --> 00:51:42,763

00:51:43,114 --> 00:51:44,174

966
00:51:47,257 --> 00:51:49,663

967
00:51:49,687 --> 00:51:51,435
Your homosexual..

968
00:51:51,496 --> 00:51:53,723
Bixesual fling?
Which one?

969
00:51:55,838 --> 00:51:57,454
I'm disappointed in you.

970
00:51:58,715 --> 00:52:01,491
Ben! hey buddy, wait up!

971
00:52:01,504 --> 00:52:02,830
Slow down!

972
00:52:05,195 --> 00:52:06,703
Get out, get out of my house!

973
00:52:06,727 --> 00:52:08,360
Get out, what are you doing?
-Okay!

974
00:52:08,401 --> 00:52:09,825
Where are you going?
-To Field's.

975
00:52:09,879 --> 00:52:10,958
I'll close Cooney myself.

976
00:52:10,988 --> 00:52:14,516
How are you gonna get in?
-With a little novelty called the truth.

977
00:52:14,561 --> 00:52:15,631
Would you please put a shirt on?

978
00:52:15,654 --> 00:52:18,993
I hate you! Get out!

979
00:52:19,118 --> 00:52:20,217
Have you seen Owen?

980
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:22,101
You're phony french phony!

981
00:52:22,131 --> 00:52:24,496
Your lifestylist is upstairs..

982
00:52:24,518 --> 00:52:27,548
Having an identity crisis with my best friend's fiance.

983
00:52:29,129 --> 00:52:31,360
Okay, okay!

984
00:52:34,929 --> 00:52:37,695
I don't believe this,
this doesn't make sense.

985
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:40,130
I swear to God, i'm gonna kick his puffy ass.

986
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:41,742
You better be sure.

987
00:53:05,798 --> 00:53:07,946
Stop, get up!

988
00:53:07,998 --> 00:53:09,808
Get your boy jewels off me!

989
00:53:12,943 --> 00:53:14,895
It touched me!

990
00:53:14,932 --> 00:53:15,812
Who the hell is that?

991
00:53:15,857 --> 00:53:17,153
You travel with your own boy toy?

992
00:53:17,192 --> 00:53:17,983
Who is he?

993
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,438
We weren't boinking,
we were hiding.

994
00:53:19,483 --> 00:53:20,832
Between his cheeks?

995
00:53:20,884 --> 00:53:22,340
I'm not into boys.

996
00:53:22,897 --> 00:53:25,037
Not that young anyway,
Gaby i wasn't with him, you know that.

997
00:53:25,091 --> 00:53:28,454
Yeah right, cause you're in there with that skinny bitch.

998
00:53:28,462 --> 00:53:29,554
Yeah, so?

999
00:53:29,563 --> 00:53:33,128
So what are you doing with her
when you are with me?

1000
00:53:34,183 --> 00:53:36,180
It's just business!

1001
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:39,969
Christ, hear me!

1002
00:53:40,423 --> 00:53:42,502
You're really hurting me!

1003
00:53:44,993 --> 00:53:47,043
You're.. Ow!

1004
00:53:47,805 --> 00:53:49,078
That really hurts!

1005
00:53:49,116 --> 00:53:51,347
That was a bitchslapping.

1006
00:54:08,308 --> 00:54:09,755
Get out of my house.

1007
00:54:10,078 --> 00:54:11,919
What?
-You heard me, out!

1008
00:54:12,227 --> 00:54:13,780
What's your problem?

1009
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:20,147
If it wasn't for you and your moronic open relationship..

1010
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,692
I wouldn't come down here
and safe your sorry ass..

1011
00:54:22,744 --> 00:54:25,684
And stumble upon that slut and those condoms.

1012
00:54:26,023 --> 00:54:28,701
Which force me to have an affair.

1013
00:54:29,394 --> 00:54:30,713
With a gay man.

1014
00:54:30,759 --> 00:54:35,966
So now, i'm the one who's being blamed for having an affair
when it's really Ben who's been cheating.

1015
00:54:36,268 --> 00:54:39,494
So Ben breaks up with me,
and said it's my fault.

1016
00:54:41,318 --> 00:54:44,183
But it's all your fault.

1017
00:54:44,803 --> 00:54:49,966
It is not my fault your boyfriend is banging some Rio bimbo.

1018
00:54:50,004 --> 00:54:53,867
Get out of my house,
i never want to see you again.

1019
00:55:00,846 --> 00:55:03,257
Where are you going? I need you.
-I'm out of here, i'm leaving.

1020
00:55:03,295 --> 00:55:06,428
Please, you have to tell Ben that nothing happened.
Please.

1021
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:07,890
Are you crazy? I quit.

1022
00:55:07,906 --> 00:55:08,861
Expect my bill in the mail.

1023
00:55:08,891 --> 00:55:11,454
Fine, Quit but please talk to Ben and
tell him nothing happened, please.

1024
00:55:11,469 --> 00:55:15,021
Where the hell is my car? Gaby, damn it!

1025
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,840
My life is falling apart, and all anyone care about is this stupid girl.

1026
00:55:17,877 --> 00:55:20,091
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.

1027
00:55:21,169 --> 00:55:22,518
Pardon me.

1028
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:24,455
I hope i'm not interupting anything.

1029
00:55:24,469 --> 00:55:25,699
You're..

1030
00:55:26,105 --> 00:55:27,341
Emma Cooney.

1031
00:55:27,952 --> 00:55:29,951
Oh my God, i'm sorry.

1032
00:55:29,989 --> 00:55:32,084
It's such a pleasure to meet you.

1033
00:55:32,145 --> 00:55:34,195
Ben will be so pleased that you're here.
-There he is.

1034
00:55:34,239 --> 00:55:35,253
Ben!

1035
00:55:36,435 --> 00:55:37,875
Emma!

1036
00:55:38,116 --> 00:55:39,517
Hi!

1037
00:55:39,585 --> 00:55:40,684
Ben?

1038
00:55:41,114 --> 00:55:43,315
Come in, come in..

1039
00:55:43,721 --> 00:55:45,288
Welcome.

1040
00:55:45,605 --> 00:55:48,874
So glad you can come,
isn't this nice?

1041
00:55:48,911 --> 00:55:52,680
I assume that you've already met my lovely wife..

1042
00:55:53,079 --> 00:55:55,512
Right here.
-Your wife?

1043
00:55:56,077 --> 00:55:57,456
No..

1044
00:55:58,052 --> 00:56:00,354
But you two..

1045
00:56:00,479 --> 00:56:03,150
Don't be silly, he's teasing..

1046
00:56:03,173 --> 00:56:05,235
No, i'm Cameron..

1047
00:56:06,878 --> 00:56:09,645
I'm Vince's wife.

1048
00:56:11,897 --> 00:56:14,022
You're Vince?

1049
00:56:15,334 --> 00:56:19,206
You look nothing like how i'd imagine you
from your e-mails.

1050
00:56:20,397 --> 00:56:22,407
But who looks like their e-mails?

1051
00:56:26,776 --> 00:56:28,999
True..
-Nobody.

1052
00:56:29,224 --> 00:56:30,687
Nobody.

1053
00:56:32,065 --> 00:56:34,644
I hate to be a bother,
i just thought i'd..

1054
00:56:34,683 --> 00:56:36,892
Take Ben up on his..

1055
00:56:36,938 --> 00:56:40,636
Kind offer of a pre-gala libation.

1056
00:56:40,666 --> 00:56:42,480
You like mojitos?
-I don't know.

1057
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:46,143
Let's discover now, please..

1058
00:56:47,016 --> 00:56:47,949
I don't want to be Vince.

1059
00:56:47,972 --> 00:56:49,396
Tough, you owe Ben this much.

1060
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:50,399
I don't owe him anything.

1061
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:54,091
You know what? I owe you a ball straight,
so if you ever want to collect.

1062
00:56:55,786 --> 00:56:57,015
You got 15 seconds.

1063
00:56:57,044 --> 00:56:58,962
You probably heard a tons of crazy stories today..

1064
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:01,022
But i'm gonna go a little different direction,
a little honesty.

1065
00:57:01,065 --> 00:57:03,386
I'm not on the guestlist.

1066
00:57:03,434 --> 00:57:05,251
I don't even like parties,
i don't want to be here..

1067
00:57:05,293 --> 00:57:07,482
I just need to talk to Emma Cooney.

1068
00:57:07,783 --> 00:57:09,109
You know Emma Cooney?

1069
00:57:09,154 --> 00:57:10,173
Yeah.

1070
00:57:10,764 --> 00:57:12,193
Ben Roberts.

1071
00:57:12,892 --> 00:57:14,198
Ben Roberts?

1072
00:57:14,276 --> 00:57:15,760
I know Ben Roberts.
-What?

1073
00:57:15,801 --> 00:57:18,819
You're not him, you're just a sneaky snake trying to get into this party.

1074
00:57:18,873 --> 00:57:20,671
I'm not a sneaky snake.
-Yes you are.

1075
00:57:20,689 --> 00:57:22,617
But guess what,
i got something for you.

1076
00:57:22,635 --> 00:57:23,606
Fellas.

1077
00:57:25,166 --> 00:57:26,626
Get him!

1078
00:57:29,266 --> 00:57:32,343
I love froggy the detective,
it was so..

1079
00:57:33,386 --> 00:57:34,909
Moving.

1080
00:57:35,545 --> 00:57:39,123
So, is your wife here Ben?
I'd love to meet her,

1081
00:57:39,248 --> 00:57:42,325
Wife? No we're not married.

1082
00:57:42,385 --> 00:57:44,586
They're not even engaged.

1083
00:57:46,806 --> 00:57:48,156
Kate's upstairs.

1084
00:57:48,185 --> 00:57:50,876
Look, there's Kate right now.

1085
00:57:51,001 --> 00:57:52,770
You are here.

1086
00:57:53,267 --> 00:57:56,506
Kate, meet Emma Cooney, the author.

1087
00:57:56,769 --> 00:57:58,254
Nice to meet you, Kate.

1088
00:57:58,298 --> 00:58:00,606
Lovely home you have here.

1089
00:58:04,371 --> 00:58:05,479
Thank you.

1090
00:58:05,509 --> 00:58:08,996
I thought it felt a bit gouched..

1091
00:58:09,049 --> 00:58:11,830
Austintatious, new Vouge rich..

1092
00:58:11,868 --> 00:58:14,357
No, i think it'll be lovely when it's finished.

1093
00:58:14,372 --> 00:58:17,786
Do you think so?
I don't know.

1094
00:58:18,701 --> 00:58:20,020
Katy.

1095
00:58:21,588 --> 00:58:22,620
Vince.

1096
00:58:22,688 --> 00:58:24,560
Drink up, Kate.

1097
00:58:26,158 --> 00:58:27,394
You've got to be kidding me.

1098
00:58:27,431 --> 00:58:28,794
So, Emma..

1099
00:58:29,419 --> 00:58:30,693
Ben?

1100
00:58:33,197 --> 00:58:34,735
Ben..

1101
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:36,860
Look who it is. It's..

1102
00:58:37,275 --> 00:58:38,442
Owen.

1103
00:58:38,711 --> 00:58:40,211
Yes, Owen.

1104
00:58:40,256 --> 00:58:41,801
Our interior designer.

1105
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:43,924
He prefers lifestyler.

1106
00:58:43,954 --> 00:58:45,221
Whatever.
-It doesn't matter.

1107
00:58:45,243 --> 00:58:46,774
Owen Manners?

1108
00:58:46,788 --> 00:58:49,931
What are you doing here?
Aren't you the wonderkid who's in charge of tonight's ball?

1109
00:58:49,954 --> 00:58:51,488
Not for long.

1110
00:58:51,613 --> 00:58:53,381
What the hell is going on?

1111
00:58:53,506 --> 00:58:54,841
What are you guys doing?

1112
00:58:55,063 --> 00:58:56,551
Who the fuck..

1113
00:58:58,050 --> 00:58:59,830
Oh my God.. No way.

1114
00:58:59,875 --> 00:59:02,110
Excuse us..

1115
00:59:02,155 --> 00:59:04,665
Owen insists we go to the party.
-That's awesome.

1116
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:05,802
Kate, what is she doing here?

1117
00:59:05,832 --> 00:59:07,458
Pay attention, Owen is Vince..

1118
00:59:07,481 --> 00:59:10,501
Vince is you, I'm Cameron,
Cameron is me, go with it.

1119
00:59:10,539 --> 00:59:11,511
What? Why?

1120
00:59:11,534 --> 00:59:13,900
Because it's the only truth that'll make it work.

1121
00:59:14,164 --> 00:59:15,136
Wait.

1122
00:59:15,309 --> 00:59:17,803
If Owen is Vince,
and Vince is me..

1123
00:59:18,074 --> 00:59:19,702
Does that mean that i'm..

1124
00:59:20,433 --> 00:59:21,576
Yup.

1125
00:59:21,629 --> 00:59:24,561
Do you want this Magical princess book or not?

1126
00:59:24,659 --> 00:59:25,820
Go.

1127
00:59:29,588 --> 00:59:30,604
Oh my God.

1128
00:59:30,634 --> 00:59:33,242
Oh my God Emma Cooney,
i'm such a big fan of yours.

1129
00:59:33,294 --> 00:59:35,231
I's so nice to meet you.
Give me your hands.

1130
00:59:35,292 --> 00:59:36,784
I'm Owen.

1131
00:59:40,176 --> 00:59:42,630
I'm so sorry, it went down the wrong..

1132
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:44,122
Hole.

1133
00:59:46,593 --> 00:59:47,964
Let me get that for you.
Wait.

1134
00:59:47,994 --> 00:59:49,133
There you go.
You look beautiful.

1135
00:59:49,155 --> 00:59:50,452
Really big fans.

1136
00:59:50,497 --> 00:59:53,261
We're huge fans.
-Right. Kate?

1137
00:59:54,129 --> 00:59:57,519
Yes! Big fans!

1138
00:59:59,837 --> 01:00:01,172
I'll get it.

1139
01:00:01,217 --> 01:00:03,176
It's probably for me.

1140
01:00:03,789 --> 01:00:05,018
Hello?

1141
01:00:05,545 --> 01:00:06,556
Who?

1142
01:00:06,774 --> 01:00:08,598
Hugh? What?

1143
01:00:09,518 --> 01:00:11,771
How would i know if Hugh is banging cougars or not?

1144
01:00:11,809 --> 01:00:13,278
It doesn't make any sense.

1145
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:19,888
Wrong number.

1146
01:00:19,981 --> 01:00:21,706
Perhaps i should be going.

1147
01:00:21,831 --> 01:00:24,342
Absolutely not, you can't go.
You should be sitting, you should be sitting down.

1148
01:00:24,369 --> 01:00:28,382
I think i will join you, i'm just gonna go upstairs and freshen up.

1149
01:00:28,835 --> 01:00:30,598
Please sit.
Come on.

1150
01:00:31,292 --> 01:00:33,068
Come on.
-No?

1151
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:34,236
Chips?

1152
01:00:34,682 --> 01:00:37,554
So Emma, how's your new E-book?
Any popups in it?

1153
01:00:37,668 --> 01:00:39,868
Idiot.
-I'm so sorry.

1154
01:00:39,936 --> 01:00:43,687
So sorry. Ben, you publish electronic books, not porn.

1155
01:00:43,718 --> 01:00:46,009
And we got spam blockers for the pop-ups.

1156
01:00:46,030 --> 01:00:47,651
The children will be safe.

1157
01:00:49,113 --> 01:00:50,312
Hey, where are you going?

1158
01:00:50,342 --> 01:00:52,114
To make up for lost times.

1159
01:00:52,129 --> 01:00:54,525
Hey, why did you come down here
and spy on me anyway?

1160
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:55,797
You know the rules.

1161
01:00:55,843 --> 01:00:58,482
Maybe i cam down here to have a little fun myself.

1162
01:00:59,541 --> 01:01:01,546
Did you ever think about that?

1163
01:01:03,656 --> 01:01:05,296
That's what the phonecall was?

1164
01:01:05,333 --> 01:01:07,368
And the naked kid in the bedroom?

1165
01:01:07,406 --> 01:01:10,240
I'm gonna make sharkbait
out of your jailbait.

1166
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:12,041
Owen was telling the truth.

1167
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:15,312
You came down here to rob the cradle, Mrs Robinson?

1168
01:01:20,119 --> 01:01:22,108
Cammie, come on.
-Go away!

1169
01:01:25,395 --> 01:01:27,226
You have a dog?

1170
01:01:27,438 --> 01:01:29,037
Neighbor's.

1171
01:01:30,755 --> 01:01:32,240
I'm sorry.

1172
01:01:32,292 --> 01:01:33,698
Stop.

1173
01:01:37,035 --> 01:01:38,512
Fucking dog.

1174
01:01:38,888 --> 01:01:40,396
Shut up!

1175
01:01:46,013 --> 01:01:48,013
I have a labradoodle.

1176
01:01:48,138 --> 01:01:50,040
I named him Snoodle.

1177
01:01:56,961 --> 01:01:58,620
Sshh.. Quiet.

1178
01:02:12,049 --> 01:02:14,822
Motherfu...

1179
01:02:14,947 --> 01:02:16,999
Christ's sake!
-Beg your pardon?

1180
01:02:17,053 --> 01:02:18,477
Neighbor's dog's name.

1181
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:20,309
is Christsake..

1182
01:02:20,361 --> 01:02:21,965
Very religious.

1183
01:02:22,327 --> 01:02:25,054
All we hear all day long is
Here, Christsake.

1184
01:02:25,114 --> 01:02:27,982
Good, Christsake.
Come here, Christsake!

1185
01:02:28,107 --> 01:02:30,876
Nice name, Christsake.

1186
01:02:31,441 --> 01:02:33,519
God..

1187
01:02:34,198 --> 01:02:35,630
No no..

1188
01:02:37,622 --> 01:02:39,333
No, stop.

1189
01:02:42,398 --> 01:02:44,341
Whoa!
-Oh my god, christsake!

1190
01:02:44,395 --> 01:02:46,384
Where?

1191
01:02:50,773 --> 01:02:54,295
I just love my wife, Cameron.

1192
01:02:54,311 --> 01:02:56,217
That's lovely.

1193
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,603
No!

1194
01:03:07,112 --> 01:03:08,868
No means no!

1195
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:11,324
No!

1196
01:03:13,058 --> 01:03:16,146
Darling, little tiny darling.
Can we talk outside for a second?

1197
01:03:16,161 --> 01:03:17,510
If you insist.

1198
01:03:18,188 --> 01:03:20,088
I love you.

1199
01:03:22,168 --> 01:03:24,843
She's a pistol.

1200
01:03:27,788 --> 01:03:30,511
She's a pistol.

1201
01:03:35,336 --> 01:03:37,545
Yup, that's..

1202
01:03:38,276 --> 01:03:40,113
She doesn't like children.

1203
01:03:42,457 --> 01:03:43,844
I do.

1204
01:03:51,395 --> 01:03:54,799
Just because you've been servicing the queen,
doesn't mean you have to advertise it.

1205
01:03:54,837 --> 01:03:56,953
I'm not having an affair with Owen.

1206
01:03:56,990 --> 01:03:59,326
God, even your lies have lies.

1207
01:03:59,364 --> 01:04:02,197
Our lies are honest.
-So why are you pretending to be me?

1208
01:04:02,474 --> 01:04:04,155
there was this prick security guard..

1209
01:04:04,283 --> 01:04:07,547
I didn't want Cooney to think i.. We..
We were stalking.

1210
01:04:08,028 --> 01:04:09,251
I was winging it.

1211
01:04:09,282 --> 01:04:10,126
What an idiot.

1212
01:04:10,141 --> 01:04:14,093
Look who's preaching from the pulpit,
little miss shopping code of conduct.

1213
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,487
There's a code, what code?

1214
01:04:15,501 --> 01:04:17,250
Shut up, Mr threeway!

1215
01:04:17,376 --> 01:04:18,843
No, have you no shame!

1216
01:04:18,881 --> 01:04:19,929
For christsake.

1217
01:04:19,988 --> 01:04:21,745
He's not in here, dear.

1218
01:04:24,010 --> 01:04:25,291
Stop it.

1219
01:04:25,322 --> 01:04:28,131
After tonight we can all just flip each other off..

1220
01:04:28,161 --> 01:04:29,433
And go our merryways.

1221
01:04:29,478 --> 01:04:32,725
But sitting out there is the only way to save your..

1222
01:04:32,762 --> 01:04:35,717
Hanging by a thread business,
so i suggest..

1223
01:04:35,763 --> 01:04:37,994
We all just suck it up..

1224
01:04:38,119 --> 01:04:39,969
Put on your best phony faces..

1225
01:04:40,157 --> 01:04:42,392
And lay the bullshit on that.

1226
01:04:47,089 --> 01:04:48,386
Fine.

1227
01:04:59,527 --> 01:05:01,569
Emma, what's the book about?

1228
01:05:06,467 --> 01:05:08,322
I'll get it.
I get it.

1229
01:05:10,385 --> 01:05:12,542
Hey.
-It's the cutie..

1230
01:05:12,587 --> 01:05:15,544
What are you doing here?
-I just love your dog.

1231
01:05:15,612 --> 01:05:18,047
What is his name?

1232
01:05:18,327 --> 01:05:19,803
Christsake!

1233
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:23,583
Sorry, i was just asking.

1234
01:05:24,239 --> 01:05:26,385
Why don't you guys at the party?
It's already started.

1235
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,217
Come on.

1236
01:05:28,254 --> 01:05:30,496
Yeah, you're missing a lot of good stuff.
Just head back.

1237
01:05:30,578 --> 01:05:33,111
Yeah, good idea.
-I forgot my weed.

1238
01:05:34,543 --> 01:05:36,383
Did she just say weed?

1239
01:05:36,443 --> 01:05:37,966
No..

1240
01:05:38,637 --> 01:05:40,959
We.. like the video game thing.

1241
01:05:40,996 --> 01:05:42,436
They love games.

1242
01:05:49,247 --> 01:05:50,890
Ladies, can you come back later?

1243
01:05:50,928 --> 01:05:53,370
Cause they need the party and whatever you do..

1244
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,559
Oh my God!

1245
01:05:56,124 --> 01:05:58,890
No no..

1246
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:09,758
Ladies, ladies, i'm begging you.

1247
01:06:09,781 --> 01:06:11,650
Ladies, not now!

1248
01:06:16,530 --> 01:06:18,405
What the fuck..

1249
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,902
The naked man..

1250
01:06:22,195 --> 01:06:24,772
Best room service.

1251
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:27,209
Who the fuck are you?

1252
01:06:27,334 --> 01:06:29,274
Someone's angry.

1253
01:06:29,498 --> 01:06:32,046
You, crazy naked man.
Get out of here!

1254
01:06:32,171 --> 01:06:33,440
Get out of here now!

1255
01:06:33,471 --> 01:06:38,077
I'm gonna kill you!
-I swear, i didn't know she was married.

1256
01:06:38,311 --> 01:06:39,374
Get off me!

1257
01:06:39,498 --> 01:06:42,436
Sounds like an active game.

1258
01:06:43,529 --> 01:06:44,755
Yeah.

1259
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:47,664
I'm gonna go..

1260
01:06:47,997 --> 01:06:51,500
Check on the game real quick.

1261
01:06:57,131 --> 01:07:00,206
Hey Vincy!

1262
01:07:00,264 --> 01:07:01,538
What is this, Burning Man?

1263
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,453
He must have escaped from hospital.

1264
01:07:03,483 --> 01:07:05,460
Help me throw this guy off the balcony right now.

1265
01:07:05,513 --> 01:07:07,661
Grab!
-You!

1266
01:07:08,316 --> 01:07:10,155
I'll just see for myself.

1267
01:07:11,893 --> 01:07:14,259
Oh my God!

1268
01:07:17,076 --> 01:07:20,850
Help! They're doing things to me!

1269
01:07:21,069 --> 01:07:22,680
Oh My God!
-Oh my God!

1270
01:07:22,733 --> 01:07:25,115
Damn it.
-Oh my!

1271
01:07:28,068 --> 01:07:29,553
Miss Cooney!

1272
01:07:29,756 --> 01:07:31,444
Take this pill.

1273
01:07:31,497 --> 01:07:34,819
I'm appauled.
You should all be ashamed of yourselves.

1274
01:07:35,158 --> 01:07:37,409
Coming ladies?
-Yes.

1275
01:07:39,015 --> 01:07:40,967
Get in, get in.

1276
01:07:40,982 --> 01:07:43,432
No, no..
You're not getting in.

1277
01:07:45,188 --> 01:07:47,153
Let me just squeeze in.

1278
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:51,430
Shit!

1279
01:07:51,555 --> 01:07:53,194
Damn it!

1280
01:07:57,344 --> 01:07:58,271
New plan.

1281
01:07:58,294 --> 01:07:59,704
Stick a fork in it.

1282
01:08:00,623 --> 01:08:01,778
It's done.

1283
01:08:03,390 --> 01:08:04,829
2004.

1284
01:08:04,859 --> 01:08:08,723
Greates comeback in sport's history,
Redsox down 3-0..

1285
01:08:08,761 --> 01:08:11,774
3 outs from World Series Elimination,
facing Mariana Libera..

1286
01:08:11,822 --> 01:08:14,026
Baseball's greatest closure,
did they quit?

1287
01:08:14,064 --> 01:08:15,100
Hell no!

1288
01:08:15,204 --> 01:08:17,597
As if things aren't bad enough..

1289
01:08:17,722 --> 01:08:19,434
Now you're plugging the Redsox?

1290
01:08:19,490 --> 01:08:20,760
That's not the point.

1291
01:08:20,779 --> 01:08:22,276
It's done!

1292
01:08:22,918 --> 01:08:25,442
I just lost everything, Vince.

1293
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:29,394
Fine, you stay here quitter.

1294
01:08:29,478 --> 01:08:30,760
I'm gonna go do what i do.

1295
01:08:30,816 --> 01:08:33,454
Do what you do?
Let me tell you what you do.

1296
01:08:34,222 --> 01:08:36,549
You sell bullshit.

1297
01:08:36,586 --> 01:08:39,752
You are a bullshit salesman.

1298
01:08:39,808 --> 01:08:43,129
You swore to me that E-publishing was the future..

1299
01:08:43,255 --> 01:08:46,785
Paperless books, there's green in going green.

1300
01:08:46,823 --> 01:08:48,232
Where's the green, Vince?

1301
01:08:48,262 --> 01:08:51,031
At least i'm not afraid to try.

1302
01:08:51,153 --> 01:08:53,565
You put your whole life on hold.

1303
01:08:53,591 --> 01:08:57,595
You're just waiting for something to happen,
and it's passing you by, my friend.

1304
01:08:57,707 --> 01:08:59,178
That's no bullshit.

1305
01:08:59,234 --> 01:09:02,475
We're ready.
-Vinny, let's go go go.

1306
01:09:02,512 --> 01:09:05,358
Ready to go to this party, ladies?

1307
01:09:07,202 --> 01:09:10,744
They have house made entirely out of chocolate.

1308
01:09:19,372 --> 01:09:20,908
Where's Owen?

1309
01:09:20,984 --> 01:09:24,309
He left to select the Brazillian gir's ensemble.

1310
01:09:24,318 --> 01:09:25,943
Says she needs a man's touch.

1311
01:09:25,981 --> 01:09:27,626
Who doesn't.

1312
01:09:27,708 --> 01:09:29,261
Where's Cooney?
-She left.

1313
01:09:29,284 --> 01:09:30,979
Motherfucker!

1314
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:34,206
Isn't anyone gonna be at my party?

1315
01:09:34,222 --> 01:09:35,526
This is your fault.

1316
01:09:35,556 --> 01:09:38,569
Once they're in,
they don't get out. Understood?

1317
01:09:38,592 --> 01:09:40,778
Yes sir.
-Unless i throw them out.

1318
01:09:45,262 --> 01:09:47,946
Hey, woah woah..

1319
01:09:47,998 --> 01:09:49,781
Stop, hey guys..

1320
01:09:49,907 --> 01:09:51,334
You want a ride with us?

1321
01:09:51,373 --> 01:09:52,717
YEs!

1322
01:09:52,758 --> 01:09:55,545
Are we negotiating?
-I can't get you in, Dwayne knows what you look like.

1323
01:09:55,586 --> 01:09:58,678
We got that covered, i just need you to help out for my friends here.

1324
01:09:58,714 --> 01:10:01,040
Whatever, fine.

1325
01:10:28,091 --> 01:10:30,617
Here's to be single,
seeing doubles..

1326
01:10:30,639 --> 01:10:32,182
And sleeping triple.

1327
01:10:32,219 --> 01:10:34,841
I'm Duncan.
ANd you are?

1328
01:10:37,013 --> 01:10:38,923
How old are you?

1329
01:10:39,210 --> 01:10:40,591
Old enough.

1330
01:10:44,871 --> 01:10:47,777
Man, things people do to get into a party, go.

1331
01:10:47,989 --> 01:10:50,070
Don't let them play hard to get.

1332
01:10:51,559 --> 01:10:53,905
Matt, it's me Kate.

1333
01:10:53,953 --> 01:10:55,887
I'm here at the party, surprise.

1334
01:10:55,917 --> 01:10:58,902
Where are you? Call me, i'm here, bye!

1335
01:10:58,944 --> 01:11:00,524
Sorry, excuse me.

1336
01:11:14,527 --> 01:11:17,310
Vince is not the only one who can crash the party.

1337
01:11:49,796 --> 01:11:53,390
Welcome to the Dolce Vita Ball.

1338
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:58,139
The night belongs to you,
please enjoy it..

1339
01:11:58,193 --> 01:12:00,316
Irresponsibly!

1340
01:12:02,943 --> 01:12:05,571
Hey, fucking idiot.
You're gonna get killed out here.

1341
01:12:05,590 --> 01:12:07,277
Sorry, my bad!

1342
01:12:42,957 --> 01:12:45,109
Wow, Vince..

1343
01:12:45,234 --> 01:12:49,465
If this is the new you, i do not want to see you
going through my closet.

1344
01:12:49,550 --> 01:12:50,696
Yeah yeah.

1345
01:12:50,726 --> 01:12:52,752
And..

1346
01:12:52,818 --> 01:12:55,154
We need to talk about those 10 rules.

1347
01:12:55,221 --> 01:12:56,861
What about them?

1348
01:12:57,561 --> 01:12:59,811
They're too many.

1349
01:13:09,889 --> 01:13:12,594
Attention, come on you free loaders!

1350
01:13:12,605 --> 01:13:15,723
I will close this open bar..

1351
01:13:16,048 --> 01:13:18,390
That got your attention.

1352
01:13:18,757 --> 01:13:20,554
I am a man of few words.

1353
01:13:20,579 --> 01:13:22,612
Most of those have 4 letters.

1354
01:13:24,638 --> 01:13:26,472
Actually, i moved up to 7.

1355
01:13:26,689 --> 01:13:28,172
Fuck you.

1356
01:13:30,949 --> 01:13:35,367
It's not everyday that a fella gets to see
his boy become a man.

1357
01:13:35,591 --> 01:13:38,141
Don't worry, it's not a surprise Barmitzvah.

1358
01:13:39,619 --> 01:13:42,723
Tonight is my pride and joy's 18th birhtday.

1359
01:13:42,777 --> 01:13:45,496
So belly up to the bar
and join me in a toast..

1360
01:13:45,622 --> 01:13:46,888
To..

1361
01:13:47,293 --> 01:13:48,709
Move your asses people!

1362
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:50,337
Watch it!

1363
01:14:02,996 --> 01:14:04,353
What the hell?

1364
01:14:04,389 --> 01:14:05,923
Get off, get off me.

1365
01:14:06,224 --> 01:14:08,177
This is one hell of a coming out party.

1366
01:14:08,220 --> 01:14:09,166
Look at you.

1367
01:14:09,177 --> 01:14:11,281
He's got a fucking dress.

1368
01:14:11,324 --> 01:14:13,203
Excuse me, excuse me.

1369
01:14:14,445 --> 01:14:15,959
That's my boy.

1370
01:14:17,692 --> 01:14:19,978
Let's the fireworks begin!

1371
01:14:24,066 --> 01:14:25,736
Mambo!

1372
01:14:36,049 --> 01:14:38,226
You know you make me very proud, son.

1373
01:14:38,311 --> 01:14:40,078
If you need someone to talk to..

1374
01:14:40,121 --> 01:14:41,477
You should have come to me.

1375
01:14:41,501 --> 01:14:44,259
That lipstick's shade is all wrong on you.

1376
01:14:46,057 --> 01:14:47,913
For Christsake..

1377
01:14:56,613 --> 01:14:58,102
Oh my God.

1378
01:14:58,227 --> 01:14:59,975
It's Benny Bunny.

1379
01:15:00,198 --> 01:15:02,693
Skinny dipping!

1380
01:15:30,645 --> 01:15:33,198
It's about to make perfect unity..
-I need your help.

1381
01:15:33,263 --> 01:15:34,481
I'll talk to you in a second.

1382
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:35,494
Get away from me!

1383
01:15:35,524 --> 01:15:37,713
You gotta distract Fields,
so i can talk to Emma.

1384
01:15:37,754 --> 01:15:40,041
Has your tong cut the circulation to your brain?

1385
01:15:40,071 --> 01:15:41,933
We negotiated, i got you in..

1386
01:15:41,952 --> 01:15:43,169
I'm done, get away.

1387
01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:46,238
I don't know why you take such immediate dislike to me.

1388
01:15:46,364 --> 01:15:47,316
Save time..

1389
01:15:47,353 --> 01:15:49,065
If you don't distract Fields..

1390
01:15:49,101 --> 01:15:53,484
Even if it means taking one for the team,
i'm gonna out you for the phony homo that you are.

1391
01:15:53,609 --> 01:15:55,053
Oh no.

1392
01:15:57,187 --> 01:16:00,063
Bartender, we need something special for this beautiful lady.

1393
01:16:00,111 --> 01:16:02,034
What do you like?
Cosmo?

1394
01:16:02,239 --> 01:16:04,857
Mercedes, yatch?

1395
01:16:04,869 --> 01:16:06,261
How about my watch?

1396
01:16:10,925 --> 01:16:13,904
Eduardo, throw me another Robusto.

1397
01:16:13,941 --> 01:16:15,883
Sure, Mr Jeffery.

1398
01:16:16,008 --> 01:16:17,565
Owen..

1399
01:16:20,545 --> 01:16:21,497
Magnificent job.

1400
01:16:21,526 --> 01:16:23,625
I'm so glad you're thrilled.

1401
01:16:23,812 --> 01:16:25,882
Thrilled? I'd poop myself.

1402
01:16:27,125 --> 01:16:28,421
He's so silly.

1403
01:16:28,457 --> 01:16:30,529
If you like what i've done here..

1404
01:16:30,854 --> 01:16:34,844
Just think what i'd do with your
New Year's eve bash.

1405
01:16:34,904 --> 01:16:36,816
If the position is still open.

1406
01:16:36,889 --> 01:16:38,582
The position is open.

1407
01:16:38,602 --> 01:16:40,757
One of many positions i have in mind for you.

1408
01:16:40,781 --> 01:16:42,787
Mr Fields, thank you so much.

1409
01:16:42,836 --> 01:16:45,233
You won't be disappointed,
i promise.

1410
01:16:46,770 --> 01:16:48,447
It's strong..

1411
01:16:48,572 --> 01:16:50,178
Thank you..

1412
01:16:50,215 --> 01:16:51,437
Owen?

1413
01:16:51,475 --> 01:16:53,755
It's true, you are in love with Jeffery Fields.

1414
01:16:53,774 --> 01:16:54,707
Are you?

1415
01:16:54,745 --> 01:16:56,732
He told me but i didn't believe him.

1416
01:16:56,789 --> 01:17:01,258
To think i was a week away from the operation, bitch!

1417
01:17:01,784 --> 01:17:03,074
I can explain.
-No.

1418
01:17:03,113 --> 01:17:06,022
You're letting your true feelings
bubble to the surface.

1419
01:17:06,370 --> 01:17:08,443
No..
-No..

1420
01:17:09,121 --> 01:17:11,373
Demure doesn't become you.

1421
01:17:11,498 --> 01:17:13,267
Let's take a walk.

1422
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:16,873
A break, fellas.

1423
01:17:16,948 --> 01:17:19,426
Excuse us,
date with destiny.

1424
01:17:30,392 --> 01:17:32,334
Would you like a 16 Stogey?

1425
01:17:32,362 --> 01:17:34,604
Can you handle my things to you?

1426
01:17:34,839 --> 01:17:37,505
Cigars, senorita.

1427
01:17:38,937 --> 01:17:40,926
Don't tempt me.

1428
01:17:42,270 --> 01:17:45,338
I haven't been honest with you.

1429
01:17:45,377 --> 01:17:48,805
You will thank me for this in 7 minutes.

1430
01:17:53,334 --> 01:17:55,953
So, you pretended to be your partner..

1431
01:17:56,009 --> 01:17:58,167
Who pretended to be Owen.
-Yeah.

1432
01:17:58,195 --> 01:17:59,973
Who pretends to be gay.
-Yeah.

1433
01:18:00,010 --> 01:18:02,017
You lost your wife..
-Yeah.

1434
01:18:02,055 --> 01:18:06,040
Ben lost his fiance, all because you want to publish my book?

1435
01:18:06,165 --> 01:18:08,713
Yeah, we area really big fans.

1436
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:11,498
I'm sorry Vince, but i signed with Fields.

1437
01:18:11,513 --> 01:18:13,985
Just before i arrived,
i only drop by to tell you..

1438
01:18:14,007 --> 01:18:17,240
In person, because i thought it's the right thing to do.

1439
01:18:30,909 --> 01:18:33,720
Fields, he has multimillion dollars deals in play.

1440
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:35,074
We were talking happy meals..

1441
01:18:35,097 --> 01:18:38,269
You left your old publisher because you were against all of that comercialness.

1442
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:40,583
Stop being so bloody naive.

1443
01:18:40,929 --> 01:18:44,239
I don't mind being exploited,
if i'm making money.

1444
01:18:46,568 --> 01:18:49,008
And why should i be freezing my ass off in Sussex..

1445
01:18:49,054 --> 01:18:51,413
When i could tan it in Marbella?

1446
01:18:52,786 --> 01:18:54,648
Keep doing it for the love.

1447
01:18:59,107 --> 01:19:00,509
Are you gay?
-No.

1448
01:19:00,532 --> 01:19:02,506
Pretending to be gay?
-No.

1449
01:19:02,536 --> 01:19:04,180
Bisexual?

1450
01:19:04,232 --> 01:19:06,372
Never have the Bi yet.

1451
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:09,558
Vince, did you close Cooney yet?
Please say yes..

1452
01:19:09,596 --> 01:19:11,812
She sold out faster than the Ipad.
-No..

1453
01:19:11,851 --> 01:19:14,894
She wants theme park rides
and soft drinks..

1454
01:19:14,917 --> 01:19:16,839
Probably hocking an infomercial right now.
-No..

1455
01:19:16,877 --> 01:19:18,643
- No Vince, that's not okay.
- I know.

1456
01:19:18,673 --> 01:19:20,882
Stop..
Oh no, oh shit.

1457
01:19:21,003 --> 01:19:23,015
- We have a breach.
- I got to go.

1458
01:19:23,143 --> 01:19:24,264
What?

1459
01:19:31,006 --> 01:19:32,702
Oh my god..
Oh.

1460
01:19:32,830 --> 01:19:35,356
Oh that's not good.
That is not good.

1461
01:19:35,393 --> 01:19:37,934
Oh I didn't do that.
Okay, cool.

1462
01:19:39,050 --> 01:19:40,520
- No.. Ah. Ah.
- Uh..

1463
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:41,723
Look at you.
- Thank you.

1464
01:19:41,746 --> 01:19:44,112
No, No if I could just..

1465
01:19:44,324 --> 01:19:46,222
Oh God..
Oh..

1466
01:19:46,334 --> 01:19:48,769
Oh.. You smell like apricots.

1467
01:19:49,317 --> 01:19:51,081
Just relax and do it.

1468
01:19:51,104 --> 01:19:52,866
And vice versa.
- I..

1469
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:57,227
Help, Mr Fields..

1470
01:19:57,250 --> 01:19:58,810
That's my security ring.

1471
01:20:00,428 --> 01:20:01,483
Hello..

1472
01:20:01,528 --> 01:20:02,907
Are you busy?

1473
01:20:03,141 --> 01:20:04,565
Kinda busy.

1474
01:20:04,973 --> 01:20:06,910
We have a security breach.

1475
01:20:10,128 --> 01:20:11,964
Kate. Shh.. shh..

1476
01:20:12,046 --> 01:20:13,396
Security is looking for me Kate.

1477
01:20:13,433 --> 01:20:15,310
- Out of the bush.
- Be quiet.

1478
01:20:15,371 --> 01:20:17,570
Why are you in Hamptons?
I'm serious, tell me the truth right now.

1479
01:20:17,631 --> 01:20:20,773
Because like an idiot I thought I could safe Cameron from herself.

1480
01:20:20,803 --> 01:20:22,411
- What?
- Ben, look at me.

1481
01:20:22,456 --> 01:20:24,106
I'm not cheating on you.

1482
01:20:24,232 --> 01:20:26,172
But..
- But what Kate?

1483
01:20:26,232 --> 01:20:28,886
Who's XL condoms are in the bedroom?

1484
01:20:29,157 --> 01:20:32,652
You of all people now that I don't wear XL condoms.

1485
01:20:32,691 --> 01:20:34,417
- Right.
- So what the hell's going on?

1486
01:20:34,431 --> 01:20:38,224
We are way to sober to figure this out, can we go get a drink?

1487
01:20:41,675 --> 01:20:43,783
- You take care of it?
- No sir Mr.Fields.

1488
01:20:43,867 --> 01:20:46,504
If I am copulating I do not wish to be disturbed.

1489
01:20:46,527 --> 01:20:48,464
Okay, I apologize sir.
Okay.

1490
01:20:50,853 --> 01:20:51,757
Fuck!

1491
01:20:51,882 --> 01:20:53,813
Two mojitos please.

1492
01:20:54,551 --> 01:20:55,742
Cool party huh?

1493
01:20:55,764 --> 01:20:57,525
Yeah, it's getting better.

1494
01:20:59,959 --> 01:21:02,302
Got to get much better.

1495
01:21:02,348 --> 01:21:04,421
Kitty Kate, how great?

1496
01:21:04,488 --> 01:21:05,770
Kitty Kate?

1497
01:21:05,815 --> 01:21:07,879
Wait, I'm sorry.
You two guys know each other?

1498
01:21:07,947 --> 01:21:11,505
She was my high school prom date,
We were just laughing about it this morning.

1499
01:21:11,776 --> 01:21:13,873
You have breakfast with her?

1500
01:21:13,919 --> 01:21:15,705
You've already hooked up with the brazilian bimbo?

1501
01:21:15,719 --> 01:21:18,002
I'm not a bimbo chikita, I'm a professional.

1502
01:21:18,038 --> 01:21:19,833
- Oh there is no doubt you're a..
- Bitch!

1503
01:21:19,848 --> 01:21:21,988
- Get off me. What the hell?
- Wow.. wow..

1504
01:21:22,113 --> 01:21:24,235
Stop!
- Let go of my hand..

1505
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:27,212
- Please..
- Ow..
- Get off me..
-Come on..

1506
01:21:27,446 --> 01:21:30,019
- What the hell?
- I knew you were fucked up beyond believe.

1507
01:21:30,366 --> 01:21:31,677
Gaby..

1508
01:21:31,903 --> 01:21:32,966
Who the hell is this guy?

1509
01:21:32,996 --> 01:21:34,745
I'm Matt, Who are y..

1510
01:21:34,850 --> 01:21:36,152
Are you Ben?

1511
01:21:36,175 --> 01:21:39,099
- The pole vaulter?
- I can explain everything.

1512
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:41,095
Do still have feelings for him Kate?
- No.

1513
01:21:41,109 --> 01:21:43,092
Ben you ask me for a 3-way.

1514
01:21:43,138 --> 01:21:44,826
And you want one with him?
- No.

1515
01:21:44,849 --> 01:21:46,932
But i would like someone to listen.

1516
01:21:46,992 --> 01:21:48,823
Well why don't you just talk to me, Kate?

1517
01:21:48,854 --> 01:21:51,424
- I'm gonna give you guys a minute.
- Great idea.

1518
01:21:53,618 --> 01:21:55,437
I do know one thing.

1519
01:21:55,563 --> 01:21:58,931
If a girl buys an expensive dress and doesn't wear it for her man..

1520
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:02,247
That's the most expensive mistake of her life.

1521
01:22:06,234 --> 01:22:08,390
Here, before you choose..

1522
01:22:08,427 --> 01:22:11,637
Which life's path your gonna follow tonight..

1523
01:22:11,762 --> 01:22:14,184
I'm gonna give you something to remember.

1524
01:22:14,214 --> 01:22:16,754
And based on life's experience..

1525
01:22:16,776 --> 01:22:21,441
Trust me it'll have a profound life altering affect.

1526
01:22:25,095 --> 01:22:27,786
Wait, you're not married are you?

1527
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:37,844
Before we....

1528
01:22:50,005 --> 01:22:51,566
You know..

1529
01:22:52,199 --> 01:22:54,564
My lady, I am not who you think I am.

1530
01:22:54,625 --> 01:22:58,526
And I think you're masquerading as twikle toes' lifestylist Owen Manners.

1531
01:22:58,565 --> 01:23:03,133
When in reality you're the Hampton's notorious seducing all the deperate housewives.

1532
01:23:03,163 --> 01:23:05,855
All their husbands don't have a clue.

1533
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:08,719
I am who you think I am.

1534
01:23:12,642 --> 01:23:15,144
Am I who you think I am?

1535
01:23:18,662 --> 01:23:19,687
Hey..

1536
01:23:19,732 --> 01:23:21,896
Hey..
- I know you.

1537
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:24,737
Yeah you're that polevaulter.

1538
01:23:24,790 --> 01:23:27,956
- You're Kate's friend aren't you?
- Yes I am.

1539
01:23:29,101 --> 01:23:31,120
- Want a shot?
- Yeah.

1540
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:35,591
It's good..

1541
01:23:35,651 --> 01:23:36,834
Where is yours?

1542
01:23:37,557 --> 01:23:39,020
Hey..

1543
01:23:39,970 --> 01:23:43,649
Ah thank you very much..
Bottom's up, mister.

1544
01:23:47,237 --> 01:23:50,174
There you are.. Where have you been?
- Hi ladies..

1545
01:23:50,299 --> 01:23:51,735
We missed you.

1546
01:23:51,758 --> 01:23:55,074
Want to see a surprise?
-Yeah.

1547
01:24:23,248 --> 01:24:25,040
That's okay..

1548
01:24:25,529 --> 01:24:29,562
It happens to old guys like all the time.

1549
01:24:29,615 --> 01:24:32,050
We won't tell anyone, don't worry.

1550
01:24:32,306 --> 01:24:34,460
Now we can take care of each other.

1551
01:24:34,528 --> 01:24:35,808
You can watch.

1552
01:24:35,854 --> 01:24:38,913
It will be pay per view only free.

1553
01:24:39,569 --> 01:24:41,447
- Poor thing.
- Yeah..

1554
01:26:05,730 --> 01:26:07,644
I have been so stupid.

1555
01:26:07,769 --> 01:26:09,535
No, I've been stupid.

1556
01:26:09,597 --> 01:26:13,517
I have not been making very good decisions lately.

1557
01:26:14,259 --> 01:26:15,817
God..

1558
01:26:16,317 --> 01:26:20,240
Can you believe that I came out here to hook up with Hugh?

1559
01:26:20,912 --> 01:26:24,437
Didn't know whether I should hump him or burp him.

1560
01:26:27,681 --> 01:26:29,489
And worst of all..

1561
01:26:30,071 --> 01:26:33,153
I have hurt the person that I care most about.

1562
01:26:34,052 --> 01:26:35,898
Vince will understand.

1563
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:40,591
I'm talking about you.

1564
01:26:41,553 --> 01:26:44,661
Well, I nearly made the same mistake with Matt.

1565
01:26:45,116 --> 01:26:47,131
I mean at least you had fun with him, right?

1566
01:26:47,148 --> 01:26:48,527
Oh my God.

1567
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:52,272
Kate, I did not sleep with Matt, he's your ex.

1568
01:26:52,296 --> 01:26:54,034
There is a girl code.

1569
01:26:54,058 --> 01:26:57,716
It is small but it does exist.

1570
01:26:58,392 --> 01:27:00,335
We just stayed up talking all night.

1571
01:27:00,347 --> 01:27:03,434
- You're right he's a very good listener.
- That's good, yeah.

1572
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:17,018
Vince ran off with the doinks sisters.

1573
01:27:19,117 --> 01:27:21,568
Ben left with Gaby.

1574
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:50,649
I've been..

1575
01:27:50,774 --> 01:27:52,337
I've been thinking our..

1576
01:27:53,341 --> 01:27:54,566
Arrangement.

1577
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:57,284
Yeah, you uhm..

1578
01:27:57,338 --> 01:27:58,948
You wanna..

1579
01:27:59,020 --> 01:28:00,146
Divorce?

1580
01:28:00,574 --> 01:28:01,615
No.

1581
01:28:02,359 --> 01:28:03,992
I mean our rules.

1582
01:28:04,059 --> 01:28:06,420
You mean.. Your rules.

1583
01:28:07,055 --> 01:28:10,407
The thought of you with another man makes me crazy.

1584
01:28:10,425 --> 01:28:12,543
Yeah, I didn't really like it myself.

1585
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:14,361
I love you.

1586
01:28:14,663 --> 01:28:17,199
I'm terrified that I'm gonna lose you.

1587
01:28:17,770 --> 01:28:19,022
Look..

1588
01:28:19,288 --> 01:28:23,339
I've been carrying this for a while, i should've done this a long time ago.

1589
01:28:37,709 --> 01:28:39,270
Guys..

1590
01:28:39,839 --> 01:28:42,509
I'm just gonna go get my things and go to manhattan.

1591
01:28:42,552 --> 01:28:45,004
cameron, i don't want to see Ben.
Will you come with me?

1592
01:28:45,035 --> 01:28:47,467
- Of course.
- Okay.

1593
01:29:02,574 --> 01:29:07,370
- Yes, yes Gaby. God,you're so good.
- Oh yes?

1594
01:29:07,431 --> 01:29:09,154
I'm so happy.

1595
01:29:09,208 --> 01:29:11,816
This is brilliant, absolutely brilliant.
I'm serious.

1596
01:29:11,847 --> 01:29:13,004
What's it about?

1597
01:29:13,065 --> 01:29:14,288
Sex in the Hamptons.

1598
01:29:14,318 --> 01:29:15,536
Sleeping around.

1599
01:29:15,551 --> 01:29:17,245
Yeah, it's all everybody thinks about all day long.

1600
01:29:17,291 --> 01:29:19,136
That's my life story.

1601
