1
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:51,259
<i>In the land of Sparta...</i>

2
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:54,562
<i>when babies were born...</i>

3
00:00:54,634 --> 00:00:57,296
<i>the elders would
inspect them for defects.</i>

4
00:00:57,371 --> 00:01:01,865
BABY
Ah. Are you my mama?

5
00:01:01,942 --> 00:01:04,206
'Cause I'm ready to suckle a teat.

6
00:01:15,021 --> 00:01:16,716
<i>If any imperfections were found...</i>

7
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,223
<i>the baby was rejected.</i>

8
00:01:21,361 --> 00:01:22,692
<i>And if the baby...</i>

9
00:01:22,763 --> 00:01:24,856
<i>was Vietnamese...</i>

10
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:27,593
<i>Brangelina had first dibs.</i>

11
00:01:31,972 --> 00:01:33,530
Cute, huh?

12
00:01:34,775 --> 00:01:37,141
<i>Behold Leonidas...</i>

13
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,700
Ah-ooh!

14
00:01:38,779 --> 00:01:41,475
<i>... the perfect Spartan.</i>

15
00:01:47,087 --> 00:01:49,521
<i>From an early age...</i>

16
00:01:49,589 --> 00:01:51,250
<i>Leonidas was taught to fight.</i>

17
00:01:51,324 --> 00:01:53,087
Come on, you little shit! Come on!

18
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,650
You can't beat me.

19
00:01:54,728 --> 00:01:56,218
You're never gonna be
a Spartan, never.

20
00:01:56,296 --> 00:01:57,820
Take this, Granny!

21
00:01:57,898 --> 00:02:00,162
Aah!

22
00:02:02,836 --> 00:02:06,670
<i>He was tortured,
taught to show no pain.</i>

23
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,731
Tell me, Mr. Bond...

24
00:02:08,809 --> 00:02:10,401
what is the account number?

25
00:02:10,477 --> 00:02:12,911
Who the hell is Mr. Bond?

26
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:14,571
I'm Leonidas.

27
00:02:14,648 --> 00:02:16,582
You're testing my patience,
Double-Oh.

28
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,618
But I am not Double-

29
00:02:18,685 --> 00:02:19,913
Oh!

30
00:02:22,789 --> 00:02:23,915
Oh!

31
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,753
Little Miss Sunshine!

32
00:02:25,826 --> 00:02:28,659
Oh, oh-

33
00:02:28,728 --> 00:02:31,697
Here's a nice one. Oh-

34
00:02:31,765 --> 00:02:34,461
That's right. Yeah.

35
00:02:34,534 --> 00:02:37,628
No, no, no.

36
00:02:39,306 --> 00:02:42,867
Mr. Bond, I'd like you
to meet Captain Adorable.

37
00:02:42,943 --> 00:02:43,910
Good boy.

38
00:02:43,977 --> 00:02:46,605
Good boy.
Who's a good boy?

39
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:57,148
<i>Leonidas was sent into the wild...</i>

40
00:02:57,224 --> 00:03:00,591
<i>to learn how to survive.</i>

41
00:03:04,431 --> 00:03:07,764
<i>He braved the elements...</i>

42
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:10,860
<i>endured starvation.</i>

43
00:03:19,012 --> 00:03:20,104
No mayo?

44
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,842
This is bullshit!

45
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:29,220
<i>The beast stalks Leonidas...</i>

46
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:33,453
<i>red eyes glowing
like the fires of hell.</i>

47
00:03:52,012 --> 00:03:54,037
Man, you've got happy feet.

48
00:03:55,282 --> 00:03:57,978
What you laughin' at, asswipe?

49
00:03:58,051 --> 00:04:00,383
I'm about to shove
my happy foot up your ass...

50
00:04:00,453 --> 00:04:01,886
- cracker.
- Nice penguin.

51
00:04:01,955 --> 00:04:04,082
Where you going, pussy?

52
00:04:06,793 --> 00:04:09,057
I'm 'bout to make you
my bitch, Leonidas.

53
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:10,653
Lick my snowballs.

54
00:04:15,735 --> 00:04:19,466
Now eat my penguin asshole.

55
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:21,473
That Taco Bell ain't sittin' right.

56
00:04:22,642 --> 00:04:23,904
Oh, it smells!

57
00:04:23,977 --> 00:04:26,912
Ha! Caught you with your mouth open.

58
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:40,992
You dead, Leonidas.

59
00:04:41,061 --> 00:04:43,393
Say "Wassup?"
to Anna Nicole for me.

60
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:48,963
Shit! I'm stuck!

61
00:04:49,035 --> 00:04:51,003
Oh, we got a penguin pinned down!

62
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,504
Help! Help!

63
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:01,504
Oh! My ass!

64
00:05:01,581 --> 00:05:03,481
My ass hurt! Oh!

65
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,017
Why you wanna do me like that?

66
00:05:05,085 --> 00:05:07,178
Come on, man, I could hook you up.

67
00:05:07,253 --> 00:05:08,413
We could work it out.

68
00:05:08,488 --> 00:05:10,979
I'll suck your dick!

69
00:05:14,628 --> 00:05:18,462
<i>And the boy
that was cast into the wild...</i>

70
00:05:18,531 --> 00:05:21,398
<i>returned a king!</i>

71
00:05:41,054 --> 00:05:43,488
# Oh! #

72
00:05:43,556 --> 00:05:45,456
# Yeah, yeah #

73
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:46,787
# Ak' sizzle #

74
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,384
- # The bomb #
- # Get down #

75
00:05:48,461 --> 00:05:50,520
# Baby, down,
I know you love the sound #

76
00:05:50,597 --> 00:05:52,224
# When we do what we do #

77
00:05:52,298 --> 00:05:54,789
- # We get you in the mood #
- # Ak' Sent's in the building #

78
00:05:54,868 --> 00:05:57,132
- # Pick it up, pick it up #
- # Yeah #

79
00:05:57,203 --> 00:05:58,727
- # I know you love the feel #
- # Come on #

80
00:05:58,805 --> 00:06:00,432
# Let's keep it on the real #

81
00:06:00,507 --> 00:06:02,600
# This... is like the bomb #

82
00:06:02,676 --> 00:06:03,904
- # So fresh #
- Whoa!

83
00:06:03,977 --> 00:06:05,467
# The bomb, so dope #

84
00:06:05,545 --> 00:06:06,944
# The bomb, so def #

85
00:06:07,013 --> 00:06:08,742
- # The bomb #
- Boobs.

86
00:06:08,815 --> 00:06:11,113
# So cool, the bomb, so fresh #

87
00:06:11,184 --> 00:06:12,549
# The bomb, so dope #

88
00:06:12,619 --> 00:06:13,551
# The bomb #

89
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,611
Sign my rack?

90
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:17,316
# So cool #

91
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,914
And they're real, too.

92
00:06:18,992 --> 00:06:20,755
Yes!

93
00:06:23,997 --> 00:06:25,225
Marry me?

94
00:06:32,172 --> 00:06:34,265
What's that?

95
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,706
The combination to my chastity belt.

96
00:06:39,245 --> 00:06:41,839
Oh-

97
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:47,281
Leonidas!

98
00:06:55,462 --> 00:06:59,296
<i>Leonidas was stoked.</i>

99
00:06:59,365 --> 00:07:04,268
<i>He wed Margo,
and she bore him a fine son.</i>

100
00:07:04,337 --> 00:07:08,103
<i>And life in the land
of Sparta was good.</i>

101
00:07:10,276 --> 00:07:12,471
Yes! Yes! Good!

102
00:07:12,545 --> 00:07:13,773
Thanks, Dad.

103
00:07:17,984 --> 00:07:19,474
Give me your hand.

104
00:07:19,552 --> 00:07:22,316
Remember, Son: A warrior...

105
00:07:22,388 --> 00:07:24,015
must learn to take a hit.

106
00:07:26,126 --> 00:07:28,287
Fight with your head:

107
00:07:28,361 --> 00:07:30,158
think with your heart.

108
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,197
Huh?

109
00:07:31,264 --> 00:07:33,198
Give him the pile driver, honey.

110
00:07:35,235 --> 00:07:36,327
Pile driver?

111
00:07:40,907 --> 00:07:42,704
That's my boy.

112
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:51,607
My queen.

113
00:07:51,684 --> 00:07:52,708
No!

114
00:07:52,786 --> 00:07:54,219
- Captain.
- No!

115
00:07:54,287 --> 00:07:57,051
I see Leonidas is molding
our future king of Sparta...

116
00:07:57,123 --> 00:07:58,522
to be a man.

117
00:08:02,495 --> 00:08:05,191
I remember when
my father used to beat me.

118
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:08,533
Traditional rites of passage.

119
00:08:09,936 --> 00:08:12,029
No. My father was an alcoholic.

120
00:08:13,606 --> 00:08:14,402
Ow!

121
00:08:15,775 --> 00:08:16,366
Aah!

122
00:08:18,311 --> 00:08:20,108
Xerxes' messenger awaits, my king.

123
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,720
Greetings, Leonidas.

124
00:08:28,788 --> 00:08:31,416
Greetings, messenger.

125
00:08:33,593 --> 00:08:36,061
What the hell was that?

126
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:37,061
What?

127
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,222
You just kissed me!

128
00:08:38,298 --> 00:08:41,290
That is how men of Sparta
greet one another.

129
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:43,767
High fives for the women...

130
00:08:43,837 --> 00:08:46,635
and open-mouth tongue
kisses for the men.

131
00:08:54,647 --> 00:08:56,979
Ooh.

132
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,415
I get it.

133
00:08:58,484 --> 00:08:59,473
Get what?

134
00:08:59,552 --> 00:09:02,146
Uh... y-you have a...

135
00:09:02,222 --> 00:09:04,053
"free society" here.

136
00:09:04,123 --> 00:09:06,284
Yes. The freest.

137
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:08,088
Uh, not that there's
anything wrong with that.

138
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,560
I dig big black dudes.

139
00:09:16,636 --> 00:09:18,069
Yeah.

140
00:09:19,105 --> 00:09:22,939
Come, messenger, let us walk.

141
00:09:26,212 --> 00:09:29,147
The great Xerxes has
taken over the world...

142
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:30,978
with his vast Persian army...

143
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,213
and has set his sights
on his final conquest-

144
00:09:34,287 --> 00:09:35,777
Sparta.

145
00:09:38,691 --> 00:09:42,092
Let us talk
by the giant pit of death.

146
00:09:42,161 --> 00:09:43,753
Okay.

147
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,593
Xerxes is a kind god-king...

148
00:09:45,665 --> 00:09:47,098
and offers these...

149
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,464
peaceful alternatives to war.

150
00:09:51,504 --> 00:09:53,301
No blood will be shed...

151
00:09:53,373 --> 00:09:56,467
as long as you Spartan
men build his pyramids...

152
00:09:56,542 --> 00:10:00,103
your women become his sex slaves...

153
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:01,908
and your children...

154
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:03,710
work at sweatshops...

155
00:10:03,783 --> 00:10:05,546
making Nikes.

156
00:10:07,787 --> 00:10:09,721
That sounds reasonable.

157
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,050
I'm sure you would...

158
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,025
think so, Councilman Traitoro.

159
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,851
Tell Xerxes...

160
00:10:47,593 --> 00:10:50,357
...to take his proposal...

161
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,591
and shove it!

162
00:10:52,665 --> 00:10:54,360
What the hell?!

163
00:10:54,434 --> 00:10:56,493
What? He came on to me!

164
00:10:56,569 --> 00:10:57,763
I did not.

165
00:10:57,837 --> 00:11:00,032
Dawg, your wife's a ho.

166
00:11:02,642 --> 00:11:04,439
This means war!

167
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,705
Hey, hey, hey, it's cool, it's cool.

168
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:08,303
Uh, we got San Francisco...

169
00:11:08,381 --> 00:11:09,609
and West Hollywood.

170
00:11:09,682 --> 00:11:11,616
We don't need Sparta.

171
00:11:11,684 --> 00:11:13,914
I'll just tell Xerxes
it's a "no go."

172
00:11:20,893 --> 00:11:23,191
Kick his ass in.

173
00:11:25,765 --> 00:11:27,426
This is madness!

174
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,525
Madness?

175
00:11:32,338 --> 00:11:35,102
This is Sparta!

176
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,578
Why did you do that?

177
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:44,946
He was backing down.

178
00:11:47,487 --> 00:11:51,890
My lord, he will
tell Xerxes that Sparta...

179
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,926
is not for them,
so, whatever you do...

180
00:11:53,993 --> 00:11:55,654
don't kick him
into the pit of death.

181
00:11:55,728 --> 00:11:58,253
Stop kicking people
into the pit of death. Really!

182
00:11:58,464 --> 00:12:01,092
# Oh, no #

183
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:02,794
# Oh, yeah #

184
00:12:02,869 --> 00:12:05,394
# Uh-huh, yeah. #

185
00:12:05,471 --> 00:12:06,665
I don't know why y'all...

186
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:09,003
have to always get on
my back for everything.

187
00:12:09,075 --> 00:12:10,667
I'm a responsible adult.

188
00:12:10,743 --> 00:12:12,768
Look at me-
I'm booby-feeding my baby.

189
00:12:12,845 --> 00:12:14,676
Sometimes I like to
give him fried milk.

190
00:12:14,747 --> 00:12:15,941
I call 'em milk poppers.

191
00:12:16,015 --> 00:12:17,243
It's just like breast milk,
but it's fried.

192
00:12:17,316 --> 00:12:18,544
And you just pop 'em in your mouth.

193
00:12:18,618 --> 00:12:19,676
He loves 'em.
Don't you, baby!

194
00:12:19,752 --> 00:12:21,913
# Goo-goo, gah-gah #

195
00:12:21,988 --> 00:12:24,855
# Gah-gah, gah-gah-gah-gah. #

196
00:12:26,893 --> 00:12:28,622
I'm a smart shopper.

197
00:12:28,694 --> 00:12:31,527
I got this entire outfit in
an alleyway from a Mexico woman.

198
00:12:31,597 --> 00:12:32,723
# Bargain #

199
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:33,959
# Shopping #

200
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:35,330
# Yeah. #

201
00:12:35,401 --> 00:12:36,959
Why do y'all think I'm messed up?

202
00:12:37,036 --> 00:12:39,527
Shit! Do I look crazy to you?

203
00:12:43,109 --> 00:12:47,512
Oh...

204
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,276
my God!

205
00:12:50,483 --> 00:12:52,110
Aw, damn, cuz!

206
00:12:52,185 --> 00:12:53,584
There goes my palimony!

207
00:12:53,653 --> 00:12:55,245
K- Fed ain't havin' it, yo.

208
00:12:55,321 --> 00:12:57,653
K- Fed, come back to me, please!

209
00:12:57,723 --> 00:13:00,123
Please? I'll let you under my skirt.

210
00:13:00,193 --> 00:13:01,820
There goes K-Fed's cheddar, yo.

211
00:13:04,897 --> 00:13:06,330
# Oh, yeah! #

212
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,596
# Ah-ah-ah, yeah! #

213
00:13:09,669 --> 00:13:13,105
# Ooh-ooh-ooh! #

214
00:13:13,172 --> 00:13:14,469
# Yeah! #

215
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:17,176
# Yeah! #

216
00:13:18,344 --> 00:13:22,337
# I'm not gay! #

217
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,548
Leonidas.

218
00:13:26,619 --> 00:13:27,847
Ryan Seacrest?

219
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,617
How did you feel about that kick?

220
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:34,285
Let's see what the judges
have to say.

221
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,294
- Randy?
- Yo, Leo, dawg, man...

222
00:13:36,362 --> 00:13:39,160
I, I wasn't really feelin' you
on that kick, dawg.

223
00:13:39,232 --> 00:13:41,132
I don't know what happened, man.

224
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,997
It was just
all right for me, dawg.

225
00:13:43,069 --> 00:13:45,731
- I mean, just all right, dawg.
- Paula?

226
00:13:45,805 --> 00:13:49,536
Leonidas...

227
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:52,134
you...

228
00:13:52,211 --> 00:13:53,974
move me.

229
00:13:54,046 --> 00:13:55,707
Y-

230
00:13:57,483 --> 00:13:59,246
I don't-

231
00:13:59,318 --> 00:14:00,250
Simon?

232
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:01,377
Leonidas...

233
00:14:01,454 --> 00:14:03,922
I thought the kick...

234
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:07,323
was utterly... dreadful.

235
00:14:07,393 --> 00:14:08,417
Oh... Simon-

236
00:14:08,494 --> 00:14:09,859
In fact, I've seen better kicks...

237
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:11,556
from a geriatric donkey.

238
00:14:11,631 --> 00:14:12,723
Oh-

239
00:14:12,798 --> 00:14:14,823
And I'm not talking
about you, Paula.

240
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:17,335
I am sorry, King...

241
00:14:17,403 --> 00:14:21,806
but your journey ends here.

242
00:14:23,075 --> 00:14:24,940
Oh, go yourselves!

243
00:14:25,011 --> 00:14:28,174
What are y?

244
00:14:50,703 --> 00:14:53,467
Seacrest out!

245
00:14:53,539 --> 00:14:55,564
Excellent work, my king.

246
00:14:55,641 --> 00:14:59,008
It's time to consult
with the prophets.

247
00:15:12,558 --> 00:15:15,652
<i>The ancient prophets were advisers to the king.</i>

248
00:15:15,728 --> 00:15:21,189
<i>Grotesque swine, their consult
came with a bribe.</i>

249
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:27,471
Oh. Oh, Oxy 10.

250
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,633
Oh, Neutrogena.

251
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:31,176
This has an SPF.

252
00:15:31,244 --> 00:15:32,506
Th-This is all-day protection.

253
00:15:32,578 --> 00:15:34,136
Look at this.

254
00:15:34,213 --> 00:15:35,805
Exfoliator with alpha hydroxy.

255
00:15:35,881 --> 00:15:36,848
This is good for you, Glenn.

256
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,884
Rub it all over
your disgusting face.

257
00:15:40,653 --> 00:15:43,850
What need you, King Leonidas?

258
00:15:43,923 --> 00:15:45,356
Ancient prophets...

259
00:15:45,424 --> 00:15:47,324
I need your guidance.

260
00:15:47,393 --> 00:15:51,022
I'm assembling an army
of 300 to go to war with Persia.

261
00:15:51,097 --> 00:15:55,466
I'm going to take them in the rear.

262
00:15:55,534 --> 00:15:57,764
Here, here.

263
00:15:58,904 --> 00:16:00,804
And then I'm gonna reach around...

264
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,066
...and I'm gonna take them again
from the front!

265
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:06,210
What?!

266
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:07,576
Why are you sniggering?!

267
00:16:07,647 --> 00:16:09,342
Nothing.

268
00:16:09,415 --> 00:16:10,939
It's- no-nothing-

269
00:16:12,018 --> 00:16:13,315
What's so damn funny?!

270
00:16:13,386 --> 00:16:15,320
Look, it's all there for you to see!

271
00:16:15,388 --> 00:16:16,719
These are battle formations!

272
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:17,721
Battle form-

273
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,916
That's what he calls them!

274
00:16:18,991 --> 00:16:22,483
It looks like backstage
at an Elton John concert!

275
00:16:22,561 --> 00:16:23,721
Cut it out!
This isn't funny!

276
00:16:23,796 --> 00:16:25,286
This is serious business!

277
00:16:26,432 --> 00:16:28,593
No Spartan goes to war...

278
00:16:28,668 --> 00:16:30,898
without first consulting...

279
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,131
the oracle!

280
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:55,684
<i>The prophets chose only the most beautiful...</i>

281
00:16:55,761 --> 00:17:00,824
<i>of Spartan girls to be their oracle.</i>

282
00:17:02,902 --> 00:17:04,597
Oh-

283
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,365
Ugly Betty?

284
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:08,839
She has a great personality.

285
00:17:12,345 --> 00:17:13,471
Eww!

286
00:17:13,546 --> 00:17:14,911
I look like Jabba the Hutt.

287
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,345
That is hot to me.

288
00:17:36,135 --> 00:17:37,693
Oh-

289
00:17:38,604 --> 00:17:40,231
See-nah skah-nah...

290
00:17:40,306 --> 00:17:43,571
labwana no-cho dame.

291
00:17:43,642 --> 00:17:47,043
"Fo' shizel my nizzel."

292
00:17:50,116 --> 00:17:53,552
"Save the cheerleader...
save the world."

293
00:17:53,619 --> 00:17:56,349
<i>Actually, I'm, I'm not into Heroes.</i>

294
00:17:56,422 --> 00:17:58,515
"Douche bag says what?"

295
00:17:58,591 --> 00:17:59,387
What?

296
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,688
"Chest waxer says what?"

297
00:18:05,765 --> 00:18:06,663
What?

298
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,662
He walked into that one.

299
00:18:10,736 --> 00:18:12,931
What, what are you saying to me?
I don't understand.

300
00:18:13,005 --> 00:18:16,270
Go to war with Persia
and you will surely die.

301
00:18:18,944 --> 00:18:21,936
You're screwed, dude.

302
00:18:47,139 --> 00:18:48,163
What?!

303
00:18:51,877 --> 00:18:54,846
He looks like a Ken doll!

304
00:18:58,617 --> 00:18:59,879
It's cold!

305
00:19:19,472 --> 00:19:20,871
Tommy Lee?

306
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,578
Shaq?

307
00:19:30,316 --> 00:19:31,715
Borat?

308
00:19:32,918 --> 00:19:34,351
Oakland Raiders?

309
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,657
Why is my king so restless?

310
00:19:41,727 --> 00:19:45,026
Can't sleep.

311
00:19:45,097 --> 00:19:48,965
It's this whole Battle
of Thermopylae thing.

312
00:19:49,034 --> 00:19:52,936
Are you still thinking about
what that young oracle said?

313
00:19:54,507 --> 00:19:57,271
There's only one woman whose
words you should listen to.

314
00:19:58,544 --> 00:19:59,602
Oprah.

315
00:19:59,678 --> 00:20:00,975
Your wife?

316
00:20:01,046 --> 00:20:03,139
Right, right.

317
00:20:03,215 --> 00:20:05,410
How will I be tried...

318
00:20:05,484 --> 00:20:07,076
in the court of public opinion?

319
00:20:08,954 --> 00:20:12,117
Well, Harry Knowles
at "Ain't It Cool News"...

320
00:20:12,191 --> 00:20:15,752
<i>says this movie is just
a cheap rip-off of 300.</i>

321
00:20:22,535 --> 00:20:25,299
Even if the oracle
doesn't support you, I do.

322
00:20:25,371 --> 00:20:27,669
And Sparta does.

323
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,765
This could be
our last night together.

324
00:20:30,876 --> 00:20:32,434
You wanna do it?

325
00:20:32,511 --> 00:20:34,411
Like we've never done it before.

326
00:20:57,736 --> 00:21:01,103
...97... 98...

327
00:21:01,173 --> 00:21:03,641
...99...

328
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:05,267
100!

329
00:21:05,344 --> 00:21:08,404
Beat my record.

330
00:21:14,587 --> 00:21:15,679
Captain.

331
00:21:15,754 --> 00:21:17,016
My king.

332
00:21:24,663 --> 00:21:26,324
Have you assembled
my army who are ready...

333
00:21:26,398 --> 00:21:29,265
to fight to the death
for the freedom of Sparta?

334
00:21:29,335 --> 00:21:30,461
Yes, King.

335
00:21:37,176 --> 00:21:39,440
I wanted 300.

336
00:21:39,511 --> 00:21:42,275
This seems like... less.

337
00:21:42,348 --> 00:21:44,282
These were the only men
who met with your stringent...

338
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,284
specifications.

339
00:21:46,352 --> 00:21:48,616
"Hunky with deep
Mediterranean tans...

340
00:21:48,687 --> 00:21:50,086
"hot bods..."

341
00:21:50,155 --> 00:21:52,055
and, uh...

342
00:21:52,124 --> 00:21:52,954
Yes?

343
00:21:53,025 --> 00:21:54,287
"...well endowed."

344
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,622
Haawoo! Haawoo!

345
00:21:55,694 --> 00:21:56,820
Haawoo!

346
00:21:56,895 --> 00:21:58,453
Ready to fight for you, my king!

347
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:00,498
Never give up!
Never surrender!

348
00:22:00,566 --> 00:22:03,729
To infinity and beyond!

349
00:22:05,904 --> 00:22:08,031
He has a lot of heart, my king.

350
00:22:08,107 --> 00:22:09,768
And nice man boobs.

351
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:16,873
Indeed.

352
00:22:16,949 --> 00:22:19,213
These men will do.

353
00:22:19,284 --> 00:22:23,152
You are a fine captain, Captain.

354
00:22:23,222 --> 00:22:26,385
But a better friend...
there is none.

355
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,085
Thank you.

356
00:22:40,339 --> 00:22:44,270
Thank you.

357
00:22:44,343 --> 00:22:45,401
Mm-hm.

358
00:22:45,477 --> 00:22:46,409
Damn!

359
00:22:47,713 --> 00:22:50,682
He's got a huge package.

360
00:22:55,521 --> 00:22:58,285
I brought you some fudge.
Mom said that you like to pack it.

361
00:22:58,357 --> 00:23:00,086
She's a good woman.

362
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,252
Good-bye, Father.

363
00:23:02,428 --> 00:23:03,690
Farewell, my son.

364
00:23:05,497 --> 00:23:07,692
Introductions?

365
00:23:07,766 --> 00:23:10,098
King Leonidas,
this is my son, Sonio.

366
00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:11,693
My king.

367
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:14,204
Why is he not fighting?

368
00:23:14,273 --> 00:23:15,467
Well, he is not a warrior.

369
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:16,735
And he's my only son...

370
00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:19,277
destined to carry on my name.

371
00:23:20,913 --> 00:23:22,471
What do you think?

372
00:23:22,548 --> 00:23:24,641
Yummy.

373
00:23:24,717 --> 00:23:26,708
Work it, sister.

374
00:23:26,785 --> 00:23:28,878
I think he's fierce.

375
00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:31,847
# Come and give it 2 me #

376
00:23:31,924 --> 00:23:34,825
# You know you want my body,
need my body #

377
00:23:34,893 --> 00:23:36,121
# Show me them goodies... #

378
00:23:36,195 --> 00:23:37,457
And if you don't like it...

379
00:23:37,529 --> 00:23:40,054
you can kiss my fat ass!

380
00:23:42,334 --> 00:23:43,301
Ooh!
Oh!

381
00:23:43,368 --> 00:23:44,300
#... Watchin' your curves #

382
00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:45,358
# Thinking of words, baby #

383
00:23:45,437 --> 00:23:46,404
# My vision is blurred... #

384
00:23:46,472 --> 00:23:48,463
Congratulations, Sonio.

385
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,599
You're now on your way
to becoming Sparta's...

386
00:23:50,676 --> 00:23:52,109
next top warrior!

387
00:23:52,177 --> 00:23:53,144
#... right where my mind is #

388
00:23:53,212 --> 00:23:54,873
# Gimme your goody
and your body #

389
00:23:54,947 --> 00:23:56,175
# Uh! Come and give it 2 me #

390
00:23:56,248 --> 00:23:58,512
# You know you want my body,
need my body #

391
00:23:58,584 --> 00:24:00,211
# Show me them goodies #

392
00:24:00,285 --> 00:24:03,345
# You're gonna love my body,
touch my body... #

393
00:24:03,422 --> 00:24:05,117
Spartan!

394
00:24:12,397 --> 00:24:15,332
My child...

395
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,664
I shall never forget you.

396
00:24:17,736 --> 00:24:20,068
You are so small now...

397
00:24:20,139 --> 00:24:23,472
but one day you will grow
to be big and strong...

398
00:24:23,542 --> 00:24:24,839
like your father.

399
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:26,275
That's not your son.

400
00:24:27,913 --> 00:24:29,778
You asshole.

401
00:24:37,089 --> 00:24:38,647
Take care of your mother.

402
00:24:42,761 --> 00:24:43,785
Stay tough, Son.

403
00:24:49,768 --> 00:24:51,668
Come back with your shield...

404
00:24:51,737 --> 00:24:53,568
or on it.

405
00:24:53,639 --> 00:24:57,166
And if I come back on it,
I want you to move on.

406
00:24:57,242 --> 00:24:59,210
I would never.

407
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:01,371
Hell, if you died,
I'd play the field.

408
00:25:01,446 --> 00:25:02,970
To be honest...

409
00:25:03,048 --> 00:25:06,484
I've always wanted
to do a fat chick.

410
00:25:34,913 --> 00:25:36,881
The men are ready, my king.

411
00:25:36,949 --> 00:25:40,214
Good. We'll head south
to the Hot Gates...

412
00:25:40,285 --> 00:25:42,549
where we'll intercept
the Persian army.

413
00:25:42,621 --> 00:25:43,986
Where are you going?

414
00:25:44,056 --> 00:25:47,025
The oracle said if we went
to war, we'd be screwed.

415
00:25:47,092 --> 00:25:51,654
The oracle also said that
our painted-on abs look fake.

416
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:53,595
But I beg to differ.

417
00:26:02,274 --> 00:26:04,367
Give the order, Captain.

418
00:26:05,444 --> 00:26:08,038
Spartans! In formation!

419
00:26:08,113 --> 00:26:09,444
Ah-ooh!

420
00:26:09,514 --> 00:26:12,381
Spartans heading south.

421
00:26:20,158 --> 00:26:21,455
Move out!

422
00:26:24,329 --> 00:26:25,853
# Oh, no, not I #

423
00:26:25,931 --> 00:26:27,660
# I will survive #

424
00:26:27,733 --> 00:26:30,497
# Oh, as long
as I know how to love #

425
00:26:30,569 --> 00:26:32,400
# I know I'll stay alive #

426
00:26:32,471 --> 00:26:34,302
# I've got all my life to live #

427
00:26:34,373 --> 00:26:36,432
# I've got all
my love to give #

428
00:26:36,508 --> 00:26:38,169
# And I'll survive #

429
00:26:38,243 --> 00:26:40,438
# I will survive #

430
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,309
# Hey, hey #

431
00:26:42,381 --> 00:26:44,008
Woo!

432
00:26:52,925 --> 00:26:54,825
# I'll survive #

433
00:26:54,893 --> 00:26:56,758
# I will survive #

434
00:26:56,828 --> 00:26:58,955
# I will survive! #

435
00:26:59,031 --> 00:27:00,623
# Yeah #

436
00:27:00,699 --> 00:27:01,757
# Ooh... #

437
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:03,460
<i>The fearless Spartans...</i>

438
00:27:03,535 --> 00:27:06,231
<i>reached the Hot Gates...</i>

439
00:27:06,305 --> 00:27:09,968
<i>where danger lurked
around every corner.</i>

440
00:27:11,877 --> 00:27:14,675
Halt skipping!

441
00:27:18,417 --> 00:27:20,351
<i>Exhausted from thejourney...</i>

442
00:27:20,419 --> 00:27:24,321
<i>the Spartans replenished
their electrolytes.</i>

443
00:27:31,363 --> 00:27:34,196
<i>Gatorade. Is it in you?</i>

444
00:27:40,806 --> 00:27:42,706
What do you think, my king?

445
00:27:42,774 --> 00:27:45,402
We'll use the narrow
passageway of the Hot Gates...

446
00:27:45,477 --> 00:27:47,274
to funnel the Persians in...

447
00:27:47,346 --> 00:27:50,747
where their vast numbers
won't count for shit.

448
00:27:50,816 --> 00:27:53,341
Captain, have the men found
any other trails...

449
00:27:53,418 --> 00:27:55,818
that the Persians
could use to attack us?

450
00:27:55,887 --> 00:27:57,320
None, sir.

451
00:27:57,389 --> 00:28:00,916
WOMAN
I know such a road, my king.

452
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:10,267
Back off, hideous creature.

453
00:28:10,335 --> 00:28:12,496
There's a secret goat path
just above the Hot Gates.

454
00:28:12,571 --> 00:28:15,165
If the Persians found it,
they could outflank you.

455
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,707
Slow your roll, Captain.

456
00:28:18,577 --> 00:28:20,568
Reveal yourself, creature.

457
00:28:24,449 --> 00:28:25,609
Paris Hilton?

458
00:28:25,684 --> 00:28:26,708
Hey, fellas.

459
00:28:26,785 --> 00:28:28,275
What happened to you?

460
00:28:28,353 --> 00:28:30,844
Oh.
You mean the hump?

461
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:33,448
Yeah. The hump.

462
00:28:33,525 --> 00:28:35,288
It was all that,
"You're going to jail.

463
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,884
"Now you can get out of jail.

464
00:28:36,962 --> 00:28:38,259
Now you're going back to jail."

465
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:41,595
And on and on and on and on- Ugh.

466
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:43,361
It's just been really confusing.

467
00:28:43,435 --> 00:28:45,494
I mean, even Tinkerbell's
affected by it.

468
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:46,935
She hasn't moved since Saturday.

469
00:28:47,005 --> 00:28:48,905
But she still poops, which is weird.

470
00:28:48,974 --> 00:28:50,532
And me...

471
00:28:50,609 --> 00:28:53,237
they've turned me into this, like...

472
00:28:53,311 --> 00:28:55,905
totally grotesque monster!

473
00:28:55,981 --> 00:28:57,949
And I don't
even know... oh.

474
00:28:58,016 --> 00:29:00,041
# Do tha hump-de-hump... #

475
00:29:00,118 --> 00:29:02,109
Hang on a minute.

476
00:29:02,187 --> 00:29:05,452
Oh-

477
00:29:06,525 --> 00:29:07,549
Hello?

478
00:29:07,626 --> 00:29:08,786
Oh, hey, Nicole.

479
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,794
Nothing. Just some guys with swords.

480
00:29:10,862 --> 00:29:12,989
No, I'm talking about their
actual swords, Nicole.

481
00:29:13,065 --> 00:29:14,327
You're gross.

482
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:15,991
Yeah, I'm hungry.
Did you eat?

483
00:29:16,068 --> 00:29:17,433
Oh, you ate an almond?

484
00:29:17,502 --> 00:29:19,595
Oh, yeah, you're done
eating for the day.

485
00:29:19,671 --> 00:29:22,606
Okay. And then let's go to Pinkberry.

486
00:29:22,674 --> 00:29:23,834
Bye, sexy.

487
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:27,438
Look...

488
00:29:27,512 --> 00:29:29,946
it's my dream to be a Spartan.

489
00:29:30,015 --> 00:29:35,317
I want to fight for you,
my king.

490
00:29:37,389 --> 00:29:41,826
- What can you do?
- Well- Mmm.

491
00:29:41,893 --> 00:29:45,556
Have you seen my video?

492
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:48,963
I don't like the way
you handle a spear.

493
00:29:49,034 --> 00:29:51,832
You grip the shaft firmly.

494
00:29:51,903 --> 00:29:54,030
Then with one hand on the base...

495
00:29:54,106 --> 00:29:57,405
you slide the other
all the way up to the tip.

496
00:29:58,577 --> 00:30:01,341
That's hot.

497
00:30:03,515 --> 00:30:06,040
I'm sorry,
but we cannot use you.

498
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:09,247
No!

499
00:30:09,321 --> 00:30:11,516
It's not fair!

500
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:15,185
Mom!

501
00:30:17,796 --> 00:30:21,630
You'll be sorry!
You're making a terrible mistake!

502
00:30:23,235 --> 00:30:26,398
I'm not as stupid as I look!

503
00:30:29,741 --> 00:30:31,504
Help.

504
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,701
Look! Persians!

505
00:31:12,317 --> 00:31:16,617
I am the emissary
to the great god-king Xerxes...

506
00:31:16,688 --> 00:31:19,213
come to accept your surrender.

507
00:31:19,291 --> 00:31:21,486
Oh, we're not here to surrender.

508
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,720
Haawoo!

509
00:31:25,997 --> 00:31:28,591
Xerxes will enjoy making you
his slaves.

510
00:31:48,353 --> 00:31:49,581
Ow.

511
00:31:52,123 --> 00:31:53,647
Spartans!

512
00:31:53,725 --> 00:31:55,454
Yah!

513
00:31:55,527 --> 00:31:57,358
Let's battle!

514
00:31:58,863 --> 00:32:01,195
Oh, we about to stomp the yard.

515
00:32:05,537 --> 00:32:07,095
SPARTANS
We are the Spartans.

516
00:32:08,406 --> 00:32:09,532
We stomp the yard.

517
00:32:09,608 --> 00:32:11,667
Check out our buns.

518
00:32:11,743 --> 00:32:14,371
They are rock hard.

519
00:32:16,915 --> 00:32:17,847
Ooh, ooh.

520
00:32:17,916 --> 00:32:19,781
Spartans!

521
00:32:19,851 --> 00:32:20,818
Yeah!

522
00:32:25,457 --> 00:32:27,948
Persians!

523
00:32:28,026 --> 00:32:30,085
Let's show 'em
why we're national champs...

524
00:32:30,161 --> 00:32:31,560
three years runnin'.

525
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:32,654
You dig?

526
00:32:39,571 --> 00:32:41,129
Oh, come on.

527
00:32:41,206 --> 00:32:43,868
We like wearing
turbans and eating baklava.

528
00:32:43,942 --> 00:32:45,739
We like chicks with burkas...

529
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,300
that cover their ta-tas.

530
00:32:47,379 --> 00:32:50,473
Ooh, ah! Ooh, ah!

531
00:32:50,548 --> 00:32:52,914
Persians, huh!

532
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:56,879
You're joking, right?

533
00:33:01,426 --> 00:33:03,394
Man, come on.

534
00:33:04,963 --> 00:33:06,988
- # You gotta shake your ass #
- Let's go!

535
00:33:07,065 --> 00:33:08,396
# Shake your tambourine #

536
00:33:08,466 --> 00:33:10,093
# Go and get yourself a whistle,
shake your tambourine #

537
00:33:10,168 --> 00:33:11,931
# Go and get yourself

538
00:33:12,003 --> 00:33:13,061
# Shake your tambourine... #

539
00:33:13,138 --> 00:33:14,162
# Ladies! #

542
00:33:17,242 --> 00:33:23,004
# Shake, shake, shake, shake #

543
00:33:23,081 --> 00:33:24,207
# Shake your tambourine... #

544
00:33:24,282 --> 00:33:25,909
# Ladies and gentlemen #

545
00:33:25,984 --> 00:33:27,383
# E-V-E come through

546
00:33:27,452 --> 00:33:29,613
# Doin' it big like I live

547
00:33:29,688 --> 00:33:30,620
Yeah!

548
00:33:35,093 --> 00:33:37,687
# That's real, been the chick
that they talked about #

549
00:33:37,762 --> 00:33:40,697
# "God damn" is the words
that come out they mouth... #

550
00:33:40,765 --> 00:33:41,857
Oh-

551
00:33:41,933 --> 00:33:42,922
# Ask for her #

552
00:33:43,001 --> 00:33:44,229
# Yeah, she back

553
00:33:44,302 --> 00:33:46,065
- # Ladies! #
- # Shake your tambourine... #

554
00:33:56,681 --> 00:33:59,172
Oh, please, take a hike.

555
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,844
# Shake your tambourine,
go and get yourself a whistle #

556
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,945
# Shake your tambourine, go
and get yourself a whistle #

557
00:34:04,022 --> 00:34:06,081
# They be watchin' while we wiggle around
Look at 'em droolin' #

558
00:34:06,157 --> 00:34:09,092
# Niggas ain't used to this sound
I keep 'em movin' #

559
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,060
# Put your hands in the air
It's all right now #

560
00:34:11,129 --> 00:34:12,653
# We gonna keep you up

561
00:34:12,731 --> 00:34:14,892
# Now pop them bottles
Yeah, drink that up #

562
00:34:17,335 --> 00:34:18,529
Yeah!

563
00:34:49,501 --> 00:34:52,231
# Get low, get low, then

564
00:34:52,303 --> 00:34:54,100
# Hands in the air,

565
00:34:54,172 --> 00:34:55,161
# Shake your tambourine... #

566
00:34:58,743 --> 00:35:00,608
# Shake it to the floor,

567
00:35:00,678 --> 00:35:02,908
# How she keep it going on,

568
00:35:02,981 --> 00:35:05,176
# To the beat like a pro,
know you love dat #

569
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:08,083
Oh!

570
00:35:12,891 --> 00:35:15,155
Don't come up in my kitchen...

571
00:35:15,226 --> 00:35:17,387
with that weak-ass shit.

572
00:35:17,462 --> 00:35:19,089
# You gotta shake your ass #

573
00:35:19,164 --> 00:35:21,530
# Shake your tambourine, go
and get yourself a whistle and #

574
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,363
# Shake your tambourine, go and
get yourself a whistle and #

575
00:35:24,436 --> 00:35:26,233
# Shake your tambourine, go
and get yourself a whistle and #

576
00:35:26,304 --> 00:35:27,669
# Shake your tambourine... #

577
00:35:30,975 --> 00:35:34,035
# Shake your tambourine, go
and get yourself a whistle and #

578
00:35:34,112 --> 00:35:37,548
Eee! Ooh!

579
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:43,186
You got served!

580
00:36:03,441 --> 00:36:05,068
You telling me we lost?

581
00:36:05,143 --> 00:36:07,304
Dance them to the cliffs!

582
00:36:07,378 --> 00:36:09,073
No mercy!

583
00:36:09,147 --> 00:36:10,671
Come on, man,
can we talk about this?

584
00:36:10,748 --> 00:36:12,238
Yo, I just met
these dudes right here.

585
00:36:12,317 --> 00:36:13,249
I don't even know them.

586
00:36:13,318 --> 00:36:16,617
Onward! Keep dancing, boys!

587
00:36:33,571 --> 00:36:37,302
- Last one in is a rotten egg!
- Cannonball!

588
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:38,535
Marco!

589
00:36:41,846 --> 00:36:44,440
Polo!

590
00:36:45,884 --> 00:36:47,681
Hyah!

591
00:36:49,587 --> 00:36:53,284
We may have won the battle,
but they will win the war!

592
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:54,791
Hyah! What?

593
00:36:56,261 --> 00:36:58,092
Buttmeister presents...

594
00:36:58,162 --> 00:37:00,187
"Real Men of Genius."

595
00:37:00,265 --> 00:37:02,790
# Real men of genius! #

596
00:37:02,867 --> 00:37:04,300
Today we salute you...

597
00:37:04,369 --> 00:37:06,837
Mr. Warmongering Latent Homosexual.

598
00:37:06,905 --> 00:37:10,306
# Mr. Warmongering
Latent Homosexual! #

599
00:37:10,375 --> 00:37:12,707
Wearing nothing but
leather underwear and a cape...

600
00:37:12,777 --> 00:37:15,803
you charge your enemy like
an oiled-up hairless wonder.

601
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,872
# Spray-on tan! #

602
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:20,315
Sure, there's danger-

603
00:37:20,385 --> 00:37:22,353
charging rhinos,
stampeding elephants...

604
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:26,379
and that cute toga-wearing guy
named Chad.

605
00:37:26,457 --> 00:37:27,754
# Ooh! #

606
00:37:27,825 --> 00:37:29,520
You only went out on one date...

607
00:37:29,594 --> 00:37:30,822
but you'll remember it...

608
00:37:30,895 --> 00:37:32,863
forever, forever...

609
00:37:32,931 --> 00:37:35,832
# Take your daily Valtrex! #

610
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,994
Your keen instincts tell you
to cut, slice and chop...

611
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,697
every man you see.

612
00:37:40,772 --> 00:37:43,400
But enough about your career
as a hair stylist...

613
00:37:43,474 --> 00:37:45,203
let's talk war.

614
00:37:45,276 --> 00:37:47,904
# Ow! That curling
iron is hot! #

615
00:37:47,979 --> 00:37:50,447
So this Butt's for you,
King Leonidas...

616
00:37:50,515 --> 00:37:52,346
because when the going gets tough...

617
00:37:52,417 --> 00:37:54,078
the tough go antiquing.

618
00:37:54,152 --> 00:37:58,589
# Mr. Warmongering
Latent Homosexual... #

619
00:38:00,391 --> 00:38:01,790
# Yeah. #

620
00:38:03,161 --> 00:38:04,685
Queen Margo...

621
00:38:04,762 --> 00:38:06,787
we must speak.

622
00:38:08,433 --> 00:38:10,663
Loyalist, what do you want?

623
00:38:13,371 --> 00:38:15,805
Nice tomatoes.

624
00:38:15,873 --> 00:38:18,433
Your husband needs you.

625
00:38:20,345 --> 00:38:21,972
You must convince the council...

626
00:38:22,046 --> 00:38:24,446
to send more troops
to support your husband.

627
00:38:24,515 --> 00:38:26,005
My husband is dead.

628
00:38:26,084 --> 00:38:27,847
He told me to move on.

629
00:38:27,919 --> 00:38:30,820
Besides, I'm already
registered on J Date.

630
00:38:30,888 --> 00:38:32,515
A little to the right.

631
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:33,989
That's it.

632
00:38:34,058 --> 00:38:36,754
If Leonidas fails,
Xerxes will take over...

633
00:38:36,828 --> 00:38:39,456
and you will be stripped
of your crown.

634
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:41,964
I won't be queen?

635
00:38:42,033 --> 00:38:44,126
Ow! That's too hard.

636
00:38:44,202 --> 00:38:45,965
You will lose everything.

637
00:38:46,037 --> 00:38:48,028
Ow! Ooh, stop.

638
00:38:48,106 --> 00:38:50,472
Your palace, your Mercedes...

639
00:38:50,541 --> 00:38:51,667
Hi-yah!

640
00:38:51,743 --> 00:38:53,540
- Ow!
...your Nintendo Wii...

641
00:38:53,611 --> 00:38:54,703
No, no, no, no, no.

642
00:38:54,779 --> 00:38:55,871
Ow!

643
00:38:55,947 --> 00:38:58,313
...your vaginal regeneration surgeon...

644
00:38:58,383 --> 00:38:59,645
Hi... yah!

645
00:38:59,717 --> 00:39:00,979
...your gardener.

646
00:39:04,122 --> 00:39:05,885
Antonio?

647
00:39:21,806 --> 00:39:23,603
My husband needs me.

648
00:39:23,675 --> 00:39:25,267
I'll do whatever it takes.

649
00:39:25,343 --> 00:39:26,503
I will set...

650
00:39:26,577 --> 00:39:28,306
the meeting with the council.

651
00:39:28,379 --> 00:39:30,279
But in order to win their vote...

652
00:39:30,348 --> 00:39:33,215
you will need to get
Traitoro's support.

653
00:39:35,353 --> 00:39:37,617
He holds great influence...

654
00:39:37,689 --> 00:39:39,452
with the council.

655
00:39:40,792 --> 00:39:43,420
There better be a happy ending.

656
00:39:53,204 --> 00:39:55,399
King Leonidas!

657
00:39:55,473 --> 00:39:57,065
Xerxes approaches.

658
00:39:58,109 --> 00:39:59,440
<i>Xerxes.</i>

659
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:02,741
<i>He looked a lot like
that fat guy from Borat.</i>

660
00:40:08,786 --> 00:40:11,482
I am the great god-king Xerxes.

661
00:40:11,556 --> 00:40:12,716
Ooh!

662
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:13,620
Ooh!

663
00:40:16,661 --> 00:40:18,060
Ow, ow, ow!

664
00:40:18,129 --> 00:40:19,892
Not again!
That always happens.

665
00:40:21,165 --> 00:40:22,723
Ow!

666
00:40:25,803 --> 00:40:26,895
Whew!

667
00:40:40,885 --> 00:40:42,147
Damn!

668
00:40:45,323 --> 00:40:47,018
- Oh, s-sorry, Xerxes.
- It's cool.

669
00:40:47,091 --> 00:40:48,786
It's cool, cool. I'm fine.

670
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,851
I meant to do that.

671
00:40:52,196 --> 00:40:53,527
Oh, shit!

672
00:40:53,598 --> 00:40:55,225
I'll tell you, kid, you got balls.

673
00:40:55,299 --> 00:40:56,891
I come over here with a big army.

674
00:40:56,968 --> 00:40:58,526
We going to shish kebab your ass.

675
00:40:58,603 --> 00:41:01,265
Before this battle is over...

676
00:41:01,339 --> 00:41:02,931
people will know...

677
00:41:03,007 --> 00:41:05,032
that even a god-king can fall.

678
00:41:05,109 --> 00:41:07,634
Listen, Leo, I came here to talk.

679
00:41:07,712 --> 00:41:10,044
Just listen to my deal.

680
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:14,111
Ladies!

681
00:41:14,185 --> 00:41:16,619
Hi, Xerxes.

682
00:41:18,055 --> 00:41:20,353
Ah, that's probably for me.

683
00:41:21,492 --> 00:41:22,652
Hello?

684
00:41:22,727 --> 00:41:24,319
Really?

685
00:41:24,395 --> 00:41:26,363
Okay.

686
00:41:27,431 --> 00:41:28,625
That was the banker.

687
00:41:28,699 --> 00:41:29,893
He's offering...

688
00:41:29,967 --> 00:41:31,992
to buy back your briefcase...

689
00:41:32,069 --> 00:41:34,162
for a weekend getaway for two...

690
00:41:34,238 --> 00:41:36,331
in Las Vegas, Nevada...

691
00:41:36,407 --> 00:41:38,034
at the Palms Hotel and Casino!

692
00:41:38,109 --> 00:41:39,667
Ooh...

693
00:41:39,744 --> 00:41:41,006
I've always wanted to go there!

694
00:41:41,078 --> 00:41:44,479
All you have to do
is bow down to me...

695
00:41:45,516 --> 00:41:47,643
...and surrender Sparta.

696
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,314
Deal...

697
00:41:50,388 --> 00:41:51,878
or no deal?

698
00:41:53,324 --> 00:41:54,882
- Deal! -
Deal! - Take it!

699
00:41:54,959 --> 00:41:56,221
Take the deal!

700
00:41:56,294 --> 00:41:57,886
You think I should? No!

701
00:41:57,962 --> 00:41:59,122
- Take the deal!
- It's simple.

702
00:41:59,197 --> 00:42:00,425
- Take the deal!
- Come on!

703
00:42:00,498 --> 00:42:01,897
What about Sparta?

704
00:42:01,966 --> 00:42:02,990
- Hit the button!
- Come on!

705
00:42:03,067 --> 00:42:05,035
Take the deal! Take it!

706
00:42:05,102 --> 00:42:06,899
- Take it!
- Take the deal!

707
00:42:06,971 --> 00:42:08,063
Hit the button!

708
00:42:09,974 --> 00:42:10,770
Take it!

709
00:42:10,842 --> 00:42:13,538
No deal!

710
00:42:13,611 --> 00:42:16,045
Oh, great!

711
00:42:16,113 --> 00:42:18,343
By the time I'm finished with you...

712
00:42:18,416 --> 00:42:20,384
Sparta will be annihilated.

713
00:42:20,451 --> 00:42:23,079
It will be as though
you never existed.

714
00:42:23,154 --> 00:42:24,883
I will see to it that you are...

715
00:42:24,956 --> 00:42:26,446
written out of the history books.

716
00:42:27,792 --> 00:42:31,228
Well, that's fine by me, Xerxes...

717
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:33,763
because I can't read.

718
00:42:35,933 --> 00:42:39,300
<i>Xerxes didn't take rejection well.</i>

719
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:42,464
<i>From every corner of his empire...</i>

720
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:45,703
<i>he sent his most
vicious warriors to fight.</i>

721
00:42:45,776 --> 00:42:48,176
Yo mama's so ghetto,
when she breast-feeds...

722
00:42:48,246 --> 00:42:50,214
Kool-Aid comes out!

723
00:42:57,321 --> 00:42:59,881
Yo mama's so stupid,
she thought Tupac Shakur...

724
00:42:59,957 --> 00:43:01,925
was a Jewish holiday!

725
00:43:08,699 --> 00:43:10,792
Get her, Dilio!

726
00:43:10,868 --> 00:43:14,304
Yo mama's so fat, her
pants size is, um, um, um...

727
00:43:14,372 --> 00:43:16,135
"Bitch, lose some weight"!

728
00:43:18,009 --> 00:43:19,237
Your mama's so butch...

729
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:21,335
Rosie O'Donnell
wouldn't even date her.

730
00:43:21,412 --> 00:43:24,006
Uh-uh! No, you didn't!
No, you didn't!

731
00:43:24,081 --> 00:43:25,412
- Whoa!
- No, you didn't!

732
00:43:25,483 --> 00:43:28,509
Well, yo mama titties
is smaller than yours.

733
00:43:31,489 --> 00:43:33,753
Bounce some D's on that bitch!

734
00:43:33,824 --> 00:43:36,418
Your mama's so fat,
Sir Mix-A-lot decided...

735
00:43:36,494 --> 00:43:38,189
he doesn't like big butts!

736
00:43:38,262 --> 00:43:40,662
And he ain't lyin'!
Kiss that!

737
00:43:42,366 --> 00:43:43,924
Oh! Ow!

738
00:43:44,001 --> 00:43:45,468
Oh, my eyes!

739
00:43:45,536 --> 00:43:47,697
Oh! Oh!

740
00:43:47,772 --> 00:43:48,932
Walk it off.

741
00:43:49,006 --> 00:43:50,303
- How you like that, huh?
- Sit down.

742
00:43:52,376 --> 00:43:55,607
Yo, yo mama's so fat,
that when she farts...

743
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,240
Al Gore accuses her
of global warming, dawg.

744
00:43:58,316 --> 00:43:59,476
Whew!

745
00:44:00,551 --> 00:44:01,882
Cranking it up!

746
00:44:01,953 --> 00:44:05,753
Yes, well, that may be the case,
but your mama's so hairy...

747
00:44:05,823 --> 00:44:07,654
the only language she speaks...

748
00:44:07,725 --> 00:44:09,352
is Wookiee!

749
00:44:09,427 --> 00:44:11,691
Oh!

750
00:44:13,264 --> 00:44:14,993
That's it!

751
00:44:15,066 --> 00:44:16,397
Well, yo mama-

752
00:44:16,467 --> 00:44:17,957
Yo ma-

753
00:44:21,238 --> 00:44:22,296
Yes!

754
00:44:22,373 --> 00:44:24,034
Bye-bye!

755
00:44:24,108 --> 00:44:25,700
Back to the hood!

756
00:44:25,776 --> 00:44:29,177
<i>Xerxes watched
as his warriors were defeated.</i>

757
00:44:29,246 --> 00:44:32,909
<i>It sent an all-too-human chill
up his spine.</i>

758
00:44:32,984 --> 00:44:35,919
<i>Or perhaps that was
the Dentyne Ice...</i>

759
00:44:35,987 --> 00:44:37,682
<i>with cool mint crystals.</i>

760
00:44:46,364 --> 00:44:49,060
Loyalist said you wanted to see me.

761
00:44:51,335 --> 00:44:52,563
That's my urine sample.

762
00:44:54,939 --> 00:44:56,270
Tastes like asparagus.

763
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,103
Leonidas needs more troops.

764
00:44:58,175 --> 00:45:02,839
Without reinforcements,
Sparta will fall and-

765
00:45:12,023 --> 00:45:13,752
I'll do anything...

766
00:45:13,824 --> 00:45:16,384
for my husband.

767
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:18,121
Anything?

768
00:45:22,533 --> 00:45:24,125
Awesome!

769
00:45:24,201 --> 00:45:25,759
I'm so getting laid!

770
00:45:25,836 --> 00:45:28,304
Good-bye, virginity.

771
00:45:28,372 --> 00:45:30,636
I promise you,
you're not going to enjoy this.

772
00:45:30,708 --> 00:45:33,370
But I suffer from premature eja-

773
00:45:36,147 --> 00:45:37,409
Oh-

774
00:45:37,481 --> 00:45:38,641
Mmm.

775
00:45:38,716 --> 00:45:41,150
It's okay: I have crabs.

776
00:45:58,536 --> 00:46:00,595
Ooh-

777
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:12,645
Betray your beloved Spartans-

778
00:46:16,487 --> 00:46:18,421
Nice.

779
00:46:19,857 --> 00:46:23,293
and I will give you
anything you desire.

780
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,884
That's hot.

781
00:46:24,962 --> 00:46:26,759
Bow down to me.

782
00:46:28,966 --> 00:46:31,230
Bow down to the great god-king...

783
00:46:31,302 --> 00:46:32,963
Xerxes.

784
00:46:33,037 --> 00:46:34,629
I'm a Hilton.

785
00:46:34,705 --> 00:46:36,229
I don't bow.

786
00:46:37,641 --> 00:46:39,040
But I do bend over.

787
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:41,237
Ah, good.

788
00:46:41,312 --> 00:46:44,145
There's a secret goat path
into the Hot Gates.

789
00:46:44,215 --> 00:46:47,446
You could totally use it
to defeat Leonidas.

790
00:46:47,518 --> 00:46:50,544
Ah-

791
00:46:50,621 --> 00:46:52,885
And what do you desire?

792
00:46:52,957 --> 00:46:55,118
I want my record expunged.

793
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,957
Oh, and I want
that new Chanel purse.

794
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:00,790
Thank you.

795
00:47:00,865 --> 00:47:03,595
I want throwing up to be fun.

796
00:47:03,667 --> 00:47:06,261
You got something to say,
say it- I got things to do.

797
00:47:06,337 --> 00:47:08,396
What was it?

798
00:47:08,472 --> 00:47:09,769
I can't remem-

799
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,569
Oh, God, geez, yeah.

800
00:47:11,642 --> 00:47:13,439
I want to get this hump removed.

801
00:47:20,885 --> 00:47:22,147
Mmm!

802
00:47:28,292 --> 00:47:31,386
Will you please just do it?
It's really heavy and really hard to keep clean.

803
00:47:31,462 --> 00:47:33,657
Done.

804
00:47:34,798 --> 00:47:37,392
Aah!

805
00:47:49,046 --> 00:47:50,980
As long as Xerxes doesn't find...

806
00:47:51,048 --> 00:47:53,346
the secret path to the Hot Gates...

807
00:47:54,718 --> 00:47:57,516
...their vast numbers
won't count for shit.

808
00:47:59,123 --> 00:48:00,556
My king!

809
00:48:02,693 --> 00:48:04,627
Catch your breath.

810
00:48:04,695 --> 00:48:06,526
Vanilla blended.

811
00:48:06,597 --> 00:48:08,895
What is it, boy?

812
00:48:11,335 --> 00:48:13,803
Xerxes has found
the secret goat path...

813
00:48:13,871 --> 00:48:14,963
through the Hot Gates.

814
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:16,063
Aw, shit!

815
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:18,438
Damn that Paris Hilton.

816
00:48:18,509 --> 00:48:20,374
I hate her.

817
00:48:20,444 --> 00:48:21,934
He's deployed thousands
of Persian soldiers...

818
00:48:22,012 --> 00:48:23,274
that'll be here any minute.

819
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:32,553
Dilio...

820
00:48:32,623 --> 00:48:34,113
how bad are your injuries?

821
00:48:34,191 --> 00:48:37,422
Oh, it's, uh- it's
just a scratch, my king.

822
00:48:41,932 --> 00:48:43,263
You've got no eyes.

823
00:48:43,334 --> 00:48:45,734
The gods blessed me with a spare.

824
00:48:45,803 --> 00:48:47,395
No, they haven't.

825
00:48:47,471 --> 00:48:49,200
You just had the two.

826
00:48:49,273 --> 00:48:51,207
Jeremy has the spare.

827
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:58,505
I can still fight!

828
00:49:00,317 --> 00:49:01,249
Whoa! No!

829
00:49:01,318 --> 00:49:02,842
Dilio! Dilio!

830
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:06,947
Di- Dilio! Dilio! Dilio.

831
00:49:07,024 --> 00:49:08,423
Walk with me.

832
00:49:10,094 --> 00:49:12,085
No. No. No.

833
00:49:15,332 --> 00:49:18,165
Your fate is the most important.

834
00:49:18,235 --> 00:49:23,366
You must go back to Sparta...

835
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,873
and tell of our tale.

836
00:49:24,942 --> 00:49:27,103
Yes, my king.

837
00:49:27,177 --> 00:49:29,407
Any message for the queen?

838
00:49:42,226 --> 00:49:44,285
None that need be said.

839
00:49:45,696 --> 00:49:47,459
Now go, Dilio.

840
00:49:47,531 --> 00:49:50,728
Tell how 13 Spartans
fought for honor...

841
00:49:50,801 --> 00:49:53,793
for glory...
for freedom!

842
00:49:55,239 --> 00:49:57,799
Good luck, Dilio.

843
00:50:14,892 --> 00:50:17,452
Spartans!

844
00:50:24,735 --> 00:50:26,327
This is your final chance.

845
00:50:26,403 --> 00:50:29,497
Bow down to me or you will die.

846
00:50:29,573 --> 00:50:32,906
I bow for no man!

847
00:50:37,414 --> 00:50:39,644
Take a knee.

848
00:50:39,717 --> 00:50:40,843
No!

849
00:50:40,918 --> 00:50:43,512
- Curtsey.
- Enough!

850
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:47,851
Well, your sandal is untied.

851
00:50:47,925 --> 00:50:50,485
Oh... thanks very much.

852
00:50:50,561 --> 00:50:52,153
See?
Was that that difficult?

853
00:50:52,229 --> 00:50:54,129
- No, wait, no!
- Ah-tah-tah-tah-tah-

854
00:50:54,198 --> 00:50:56,530
- No, I wasn't bowing.
- No, no, no.

855
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,794
I was just doing my shoe!

856
00:50:57,868 --> 00:51:00,200
No, you acknowledged me
as your god-king.

857
00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:01,134
High-five!

858
00:51:01,205 --> 00:51:04,538
Ooh.

859
00:51:04,608 --> 00:51:06,041
What?

860
00:51:08,545 --> 00:51:10,376
What-What-What the hell is so funny?

861
00:51:10,447 --> 00:51:12,210
- You!
- Me?

862
00:51:12,282 --> 00:51:13,977
You greet like women.

863
00:51:14,051 --> 00:51:16,076
You idiots are
wearing banana hammocks...

864
00:51:16,153 --> 00:51:17,279
and you're laughing at me?

865
00:51:17,354 --> 00:51:18,844
Now you're pissing me off.

866
00:51:18,922 --> 00:51:20,150
I'm getting everybody.

867
00:51:20,224 --> 00:51:22,920
Hello. Where you at?

868
00:51:22,993 --> 00:51:24,221
I know where I'm at.

869
00:51:24,294 --> 00:51:26,057
Bring in my vast army.

870
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:27,222
You 13...

871
00:51:27,297 --> 00:51:28,821
putz are no match...

872
00:51:28,899 --> 00:51:30,491
for my massive Persian army.

873
00:51:30,567 --> 00:51:32,296
They number in the millions!

874
00:51:37,508 --> 00:51:39,408
That's just a blue screen.

875
00:51:39,476 --> 00:51:40,875
Stupid.

876
00:51:40,944 --> 00:51:42,878
It's a visual effect.

877
00:51:42,946 --> 00:51:44,811
It's going to be digitally
inserted later.

878
00:51:44,882 --> 00:51:47,817
And the army is quite
impressive, as you can imagine.

879
00:51:54,525 --> 00:51:56,186
Gentlemen, may I present...

880
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:58,626
Queen Margo.

881
00:52:24,221 --> 00:52:26,280
Come on, baby.
I'm gettin' a chubby.

882
00:52:28,525 --> 00:52:31,323
Boner alert. Boner alert.

883
00:52:31,395 --> 00:52:33,260
Okay, boys, make it rain!

884
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:35,298
# Do the D-A-N-C-E,
1-2-3-4 fight #

885
00:52:35,365 --> 00:52:40,064
# Stick to the B-E-A-T,
get ready to ignite #

886
00:52:40,137 --> 00:52:43,595
# You were such a P-Y-T,
catching all the light #

887
00:52:43,674 --> 00:52:47,166
# Just easy as A-B-C, that's how
you make it right... #

888
00:52:51,815 --> 00:52:54,511
Good councilmen...

889
00:52:54,585 --> 00:52:56,018
I implore you.

890
00:52:56,086 --> 00:53:01,114
Your king, my dear
husband, needs your help.

891
00:53:01,191 --> 00:53:02,920
Sparta will fall...

892
00:53:02,993 --> 00:53:06,292
if you don't agree
to send the rest of our army.

893
00:53:18,976 --> 00:53:20,944
Gentlemen, our only
hope for survival...

894
00:53:21,011 --> 00:53:23,741
is to surrender to Xerxes
and beg for his forgiveness.

895
00:53:23,814 --> 00:53:28,012
Do not be swayed by the words
of this common prick-tease...

896
00:53:28,085 --> 00:53:30,178
with crabs all up in her coochie.

897
00:53:30,254 --> 00:53:32,415
Ooh-

898
00:53:32,489 --> 00:53:34,684
Oh, no, you didn't.

899
00:53:34,758 --> 00:53:36,817
Yes. Yes, I did.

900
00:53:42,099 --> 00:53:45,865
<i>Queen Margo unleashed
a venomous rage...</i>

901
00:53:47,771 --> 00:53:51,935
<i>... much like Tobey Maguire
in Spider-Man 3.</i>

902
00:54:01,485 --> 00:54:02,850
I'm evil.

903
00:54:08,625 --> 00:54:09,649
Made of sand.

904
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:21,428
Ohh!

905
00:54:26,276 --> 00:54:27,140
Oh, no.

906
00:54:29,146 --> 00:54:30,477
Ooh!

907
00:54:36,353 --> 00:54:38,048
Oh... cute.

908
00:54:38,121 --> 00:54:40,487
Gross.

909
00:54:51,535 --> 00:54:53,594
What is it?

910
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:54,796
Oh! Oh!

911
00:54:54,871 --> 00:54:57,806
Oh, God!
Oh! Oh, my God.

912
00:55:01,612 --> 00:55:03,273
How you like me now, Sandman?

913
00:55:03,347 --> 00:55:04,939
Oh, no.

914
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:09,311
Dust-busting bitch! No!

915
00:55:13,423 --> 00:55:16,324
No!

916
00:55:25,702 --> 00:55:27,465
Ah-

917
00:55:31,842 --> 00:55:33,639
Well, tickle my nipples
with a feather.

918
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:36,304
Xerxes is in Traitoro's top five.

919
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:38,371
Grumble, grumble, grumble-

920
00:55:38,448 --> 00:55:40,882
Traitoro was a... traitor?

921
00:55:40,951 --> 00:55:42,782
Duh!

922
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:44,778
All in favor...

923
00:55:44,855 --> 00:55:47,323
of sending more troops...
say aye.

924
00:55:47,391 --> 00:55:52,124
Aye! Aye! Aye!
Aye! Aye! Aye! Aye! Aye-

925
00:56:15,218 --> 00:56:16,515
Spartans!

926
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:21,223
We have you surrounded.

927
00:56:21,291 --> 00:56:23,418
Lay down your weapons!

928
00:56:23,493 --> 00:56:25,324
Come and get them!

929
00:56:25,395 --> 00:56:27,056
Formation!

930
00:56:33,537 --> 00:56:34,697
Um-

931
00:56:34,771 --> 00:56:38,207
A Spartan always protects
another man's rear.

932
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,009
Adjust your sword, boy.

933
00:56:45,082 --> 00:56:46,606
It's digging into my back.

934
00:56:49,453 --> 00:56:50,784
But I'm not wearing my sword.

935
00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:54,784
Carry on then.

936
00:56:54,858 --> 00:56:56,689
My son.

937
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:01,527
Today...
you are truly a Spartan.

938
00:57:01,598 --> 00:57:02,587
Thanks, Father.

939
00:57:04,968 --> 00:57:05,935
Attack!

940
00:57:09,306 --> 00:57:11,467
Steady, Spartans!

941
00:57:21,718 --> 00:57:23,879
Remember this day, boys!

942
00:57:23,954 --> 00:57:27,151
For today is the day you die!

943
00:57:27,224 --> 00:57:29,784
- Huh?
- What? Huh?

944
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:30,554
What?

945
00:57:30,627 --> 00:57:32,618
I- I mean they die.

946
00:57:32,696 --> 00:57:35,494
Today's the day they die-
that's what I meant to say.

947
00:57:38,468 --> 00:57:39,560
Go!

948
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:56,250
Oh, what a bunch of dumb shits.

949
00:57:59,256 --> 00:58:00,780
God, that smarts.

950
00:58:00,857 --> 00:58:03,690
I am gonna go Hercules on your ass!

951
00:59:32,482 --> 00:59:33,779
Ghost Rider!

952
00:59:37,153 --> 00:59:39,713
You're going to hell.

953
00:59:50,033 --> 00:59:52,126
Stop, drop and roll!

954
00:59:52,202 --> 00:59:53,635
Stop, drop and roll!

955
01:00:06,917 --> 01:00:09,249
Yo!

956
01:00:18,862 --> 01:00:20,261
No!

957
01:00:21,231 --> 01:00:23,324
Yo, Sonio.

958
01:00:25,068 --> 01:00:26,831
I'm gonna knock your block off.

959
01:00:26,903 --> 01:00:28,734
Oh, shit.

960
01:00:29,906 --> 01:00:31,771
Sonio!

961
01:00:43,687 --> 01:00:47,316
You'll pay for this, Balboa.

962
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:48,357
Go for it.

963
01:00:53,863 --> 01:00:55,763
Adult diapers?

964
01:01:22,525 --> 01:01:28,555
Botox... overdose.

965
01:01:35,638 --> 01:01:37,970
Yes!

966
01:01:39,109 --> 01:01:41,009
Yeah!

967
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:45,206
Yeah!

968
01:01:49,719 --> 01:01:51,482
Yes!

969
01:01:55,625 --> 01:01:57,889
Xerxes!

970
01:02:07,737 --> 01:02:11,537
It's a- a beautiful death.

971
01:02:14,110 --> 01:02:16,010
It's actually not that attractive.

972
01:02:40,970 --> 01:02:43,131
# I'm a Barbie girl #

973
01:02:43,206 --> 01:02:45,538
# In the Barbie world #

974
01:02:45,608 --> 01:02:47,906
# Life in plastic,
it's fantastic #

975
01:02:47,977 --> 01:02:50,445
# Come on, Barbie, let's go party! #

976
01:02:50,513 --> 01:02:52,140
# Ah-ah-ah-yeah #

977
01:02:52,215 --> 01:02:53,773
# Come on, Barbie,
let's go party #

978
01:03:06,362 --> 01:03:06,987
Ooh!

979
01:03:18,408 --> 01:03:19,739
Shit!

980
01:03:27,217 --> 01:03:30,482
Enough of this gratuitous
video game violence!

981
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:53,368
Waah!

982
01:03:57,580 --> 01:03:58,877
Ah-

983
01:03:58,948 --> 01:04:00,939
Aha!

984
01:04:01,017 --> 01:04:02,644
A Transformer cube!

985
01:04:11,728 --> 01:04:14,629
Okay, baby, let's transform.

986
01:04:48,565 --> 01:04:51,500
I... am Xerxestron...

987
01:04:51,568 --> 01:04:55,595
equipped with advanced
alien technology.

988
01:04:59,175 --> 01:05:02,338
Leave Britney alone!

989
01:05:02,412 --> 01:05:04,175
He is a god-king.

990
01:05:04,247 --> 01:05:06,340
Please-

991
01:05:12,922 --> 01:05:15,914
Leave her alone!

992
01:05:15,992 --> 01:05:18,051
She's a human!

993
01:05:18,127 --> 01:05:20,527
Oh, oh, ain't that a bitch.

994
01:05:28,404 --> 01:05:31,168
<i>Leonidas was true to his word.</i>

995

<i>A god-king did fall.</i>

996
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:36,670
<i>But unfortunately, right on them.</i>

997
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,797
I- I- I just-

998
01:06:01,304 --> 01:06:03,431
Oh-

999
01:06:04,807 --> 01:06:06,468
Ooh.

1000
01:06:06,542 --> 01:06:08,066
Queen Margo.

1001
01:06:08,144 --> 01:06:09,611
- Yeah.
- Oh.

1002
01:06:33,436 --> 01:06:35,836
<i>Leonidas and the Spartans...</i>

Today... we stand against
30,000 Persians.

1007
01:06:56,259 --> 01:07:00,195
But we now have 100,000 soldiers!

Follow me, boys.

01:13:40,529 --> 01:13:41,928
Yay.

1160
01:13:52,441 --> 01:13:56,138
If you can dodge a golf ball,
you can dodge a sword.

1161
01:13:57,046 --> 01:13:59,037
Ha! You missed.

1162
01:14:00,182 --> 01:14:01,809
Ow!

1163
01:14:01,884 --> 01:14:04,318
He can outflank us now, my king.

1164
01:14:08,090 --> 01:14:09,421
Men!

1165
01:14:13,829 --> 01:14:16,320
We are facing certain death.

1166
01:14:16,398 --> 01:14:18,457
Cherries.

1167
01:14:18,534 --> 01:14:20,399
But...

1168
01:14:20,469 --> 01:14:23,233
the joke's on them,
because they don't know...

1169
01:14:23,305 --> 01:14:26,604
that dying in battle
is the greatest honor...

1170
01:14:26,675 --> 01:14:28,734
for any Spartan!

1171
01:14:31,313 --> 01:14:33,804
Ah-hoo.

1172
01:14:33,883 --> 01:14:37,284
God, that's a shitty plan.

1173
01:14:37,353 --> 01:14:39,651
Look, Leonidas...

1174
01:14:39,722 --> 01:14:41,587
war is not the answer.
Heh-heh.

1175
01:14:42,258 --> 01:14:44,158
Trust me, I know.

1176
01:14:44,226 --> 01:14:46,786
No! War is the answer!

1177
01:14:58,107 --> 01:14:59,836
Where am I?

1178
01:15:03,279 --> 01:15:06,305
Spidey, you're fired.

1179
01:15:17,393 --> 01:15:19,520
ELLEN DeGENERES: Hi.
How are you, Leonidas?

1180
01:15:19,595 --> 01:15:20,857
Ellen.

1181
01:15:20,930 --> 01:15:22,420
Listen, I don't know
why you're so upset.

1182
01:15:22,498 --> 01:15:24,227
You look great.
You know, the cape is great.

1183
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:25,392
Love the... diaper.

1184
01:15:25,467 --> 01:15:26,593
I- I'd wear something very similar...

1185
01:15:26,669 --> 01:15:27,829
for Portia on Friday nights.

1186
01:15:27,903 --> 01:15:29,063
We get frisky.

1187
01:15:29,138 --> 01:15:31,129
Hello, Leonidas.

1188
01:15:31,207 --> 01:15:33,835
Wow, is it hot in here?

1189
01:15:33,909 --> 01:15:37,037
Okay, Portia, Portia,
women, women, women.

1190
01:15:37,112 --> 01:15:38,841
Women, you like
women.

1191
01:15:38,914 --> 01:15:40,040
I can see by your-

1192
01:15:40,115 --> 01:15:41,673
your reaction, you're not amused.

1193
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:44,742
<i>It's the same reaction anyone
who went to see Mr. Wrong had.</i>

1194
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:47,186
Uh, let's play a game-
maybe we could play a game.

1195
01:15:47,256 --> 01:15:48,416
How about "Who Sneezed?"

1196
01:15:48,490 --> 01:15:49,514
It's a real easy game.

1197
01:15:49,592 --> 01:15:51,025
We close our eyes
and someone sneezes...

1198
01:15:51,093 --> 01:15:52,526
and you guess who.

1199
01:15:52,595 --> 01:15:54,722
If it was you, you win- 'cause
obviously, you know.

1200
01:15:54,797 --> 01:15:55,821
Listen, chill out.

1201
01:15:55,898 --> 01:15:57,559
Let's just dance, shall we? Come on.

1202
01:15:57,633 --> 01:16:00,124
That's right. Oh, boy.

1203
01:16:00,202 --> 01:16:01,499
Okay.

1204
01:16:01,570 --> 01:16:02,901
There you go, you're
getting the hang of it.

1205
01:16:02,972 --> 01:16:05,532
- You know, back and forth-
- No, I can't do this!

1206
01:16:07,009 --> 01:16:08,499
Yo mama's so ugly, if she was...

1207
01:16:08,577 --> 01:16:10,374
on the Spice Girls,
her name would be...

1208
01:16:10,446 --> 01:16:12,778
Dookie Spice!

1209
01:16:12,848 --> 01:16:14,509
Doo-doo!

1210
01:16:14,583 --> 01:16:16,380
Leonidas.

1211
01:16:18,287 --> 01:16:20,380
You should try Scientology.

1212
01:16:20,456 --> 01:16:22,287
I'm gonna set Katie free.

1213
01:16:23,959 --> 01:16:24,948
Yes!

1214
01:16:25,027 --> 01:16:26,756
I had to buy
a million and one glitters...

1215
01:16:26,829 --> 01:16:28,558
with my own money,
and I had to buy-

1216
01:16:28,631 --> 01:16:31,099
I put them on by hand, Simon...

1217
01:16:31,166 --> 01:16:35,034
and my reputation is all I have,
and for you to sit here...

1218
01:16:35,104 --> 01:16:37,732
telling me that
I'm not intennigent-

1219
01:16:37,806 --> 01:16:39,569
inte-
that I'm not intenni-

1220
01:16:39,642 --> 01:16:41,200
- Let me start over.
- Intelligent. Yeah.

1221
01:16:41,277 --> 01:16:42,437
- Hang on.
- Intelligent. Yeah.

1222
01:16:42,511 --> 01:16:44,376
I looked everywhere.

1223
01:16:44,446 --> 01:16:46,505
Don't you hate when you're
on an airplane, you know...

1224
01:16:46,582 --> 01:16:48,675
and the captain's, like,
"If you look out the window...

1225
01:16:48,751 --> 01:16:50,548
to your left, you're gonna
see another plane"?

1226
01:16:50,619 --> 01:16:52,484
Am I right? See what
I'm talking about?

1227
01:16:52,554 --> 01:16:53,885
Another plane? Right?

1228
01:16:53,956 --> 01:16:55,446
Don't you hate when you're
in the supermarket...

1229
01:16:55,524 --> 01:16:56,889
you know, and you're in aisle three.

1230
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:58,256
And, like, " Clean up
on aisle three."

1231
01:16:58,327 --> 01:16:59,817
You know? And you're, like,
"What am I doing here?"

1232
01:16:59,895 --> 01:17:01,294
I'm in aisle three, huh? Right?

1233
01:17:01,363 --> 01:17:03,797
You're all my fans, right?
You all love me, right?

1234
01:17:03,866 --> 01:17:05,333
<i>Who saw Employee of the Month?</i>

1235
01:17:05,401 --> 01:17:06,800
Okay, that's cool.

01:17:06,869 --> 01:17:08,097

Sorry, I didn't hear
what you said...

1245
01:17:26,922 --> 01:17:28,219
because
I can't understand you...

1246
01:17:28,290 --> 01:17:29,985
'cause you talk like this.
