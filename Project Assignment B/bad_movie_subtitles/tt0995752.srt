1
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,014
Here she comes

2
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:22,676
Lies in her hair

3
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,013
With poison lips and deadly tongue

4
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,520
She's a highway to hell

5
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:34,364
And she knows it well

6
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:35,956
She's a high..

7
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:42,201
Sometimes when I'm immersed
in my thoughts I wonder

8
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:45,709
Highway to hell

9
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,210
About how you..

10
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,041
Have been made

11
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,175
To hell

12
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,514
For me

13
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:55,644
Baby, she's a

14
00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:00,055
Your place is with the
stars, and I ponder

15
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:09,568
You've been brought down
to earth for us to be

16
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,021
Mrs. Makwana used to say that
the world is a pond..

17
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:37,358
...and our actions are
stones thrown into it.

18
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:42,124
If the actions are good,
you get a happy wave..

19
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:45,534
...but if they're bad
you get a storm.

20
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:49,038
I always had to listen to her,
because she wasn't just Mrs. Makwana..

21
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:52,043
...she was my mother! And when
she said these things..

22
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,272
...only one word rang in my head.

23
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:58,175
Bullshit!

24
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,280
Double bullshit with cherry on top!!

25
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:04,048
So guys the next time mummy says
something, listen to her..

26
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:06,182
...I mean it could save your life.

27
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:11,119
If I had understood this six months
ago, I would not be here.

28
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:14,165
But six months ago, I
was a different guy.

29
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:18,332
Six months back I was someone
else, I was somewhere else.

30
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,131
Six months back this was my world..

31
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,334
...where even Hindi is spoken
with a British accent.

32
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:28,368
Where an ordinary Jitendra Kumar
Makwana becomes Jimmy Cliff.

33
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:30,139
How may I help you?

34
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,149
The smartest executive
at Smartnet Call Centre

35
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:37,620
THAT'S ME! Six months ago I was
only interested in two things.

36
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:38,747
Hi Jimmy!

37
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:43,158
Women.. and work! And I was
pretty good at both.

38
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:47,159
Not only did I speak English,
I also taught it. Two jobs!

39
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,259
Life was pretty good. India
was rocking and so was I.

40
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,101
Good morning class.

41
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:57,108
Good morning sir.

42
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:58,609
How may I help you?

43
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,303
How may I help you?

44
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:01,778
Superb! Okay.

45
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:03,706
DAY

46
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:05,180
DAY

47
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:06,675
EIGHT

48
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,810
EIGHT

49
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:09,778
PLANE

50
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:11,117
PLANE

51
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:12,248
RAIN

52
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,382
RAIN

53
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:14,514
DAY

54
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:15,651
DAY

55
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:17,786
These were the call centre
executives of the future.

56
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:20,127
Tomorrow's Jimmy Cliffs
and Janet Jacksons.

57
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:22,224
But today I wasn't assessing
their accents.

58
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:23,700
I was looking at their faces.

59
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,866
My last three girlfriends
were all from here.

60
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:28,197
Jimmy I love you.

61
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,331
Yummy yummy Jimmy!

62
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:30,466
Jimmy you're so hot!!

63
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,807
Normally, I get the bimbettes
and I'm okay with that.

64
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:38,212
But not any more.. I want a change.

65
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:41,514
I mean pizzas and burgers everyday
give you a bad stomach.

66
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:48,418
Now I wanted a new girlfriend.
Someone like I've never known.

67
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:55,224
Someone.. with a flavor so unique.
Separate from all others.

68
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,460
Just someone very special.

69
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:03,169
That was the first time
I saw lightning..

70
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,903
...tear the sky in broad daylight..

71
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:08,540
That was the first time I saw her..

72
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:23,627
She was beautiful..

73
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:41,274
If I were smart.. I should
have run away from her.

74
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,710
I ran but I ran towards her.

75
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,282
Hey come in. Come in, please.

76
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,456
Umbrella got blown away or
did u forget to bring it?

77
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:58,292
It was sunny when I left my house.

78
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:01,330
Are you new to Bombay?

79
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:06,292
It suddenly starts raining here,
without even a warning.

80
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:08,336
You also arrived without a warning.

81
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:10,602
The rain had no idea you
were stepping out.

82
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:13,836
My name is Jimmy.. Jimmy Cliff.

83
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,243
I teach here.

84
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:18,681
I know. I'm here to meet
with you. Pooja Singh

85
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:22,413
Nice to meet you Pooja. So tell
me.. what can I do for you?

86
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:24,353
Have you come for coaching?

87
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:25,685
Do you take private tuitions?

88
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,517
Private?

89
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:31,824
Yes, if someone is unable to come
here.. would you go over?

90
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:38,362
Any time you say. Whatever payment
you ask. Please Sir..

91
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,398
This was my last chance to say no.

92
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:45,499
But I'd never said no
to a beautiful girl.

93
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:52,408
You live here?

94
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:53,777
No, this is my office.

95
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:55,344
Office?

96
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,389
You have to teach my
boss English, not me.

97
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:01,522
I thought if you meet him, everything
can be discussed.

98
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:10,865
You know.. this is the biggest
problem with us men.

99
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,293
The moment we see a woman,
we think of..

100
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,431
So much sex, that we
forget the basics.

101
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:19,536
Of course, she never said
SHE needed a teacher.

102
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:23,681
And here I was, braking again,
and again.. shit!

103
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:27,877
And Sir.. whatever terms you have,
please tell them to me.

104
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,850
Okay. I'll come in on one condition.

105
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:30,979
What?

106
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:34,391
Stop this 'sir' thing. You're
making me feel like an old man.

107
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:38,724
Oh, is this the new professor?
Guruji.. I'm Misir.

108
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,321
Bhaiyyaji has been waiting for
you for such a long time.

109
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:43,391
Please do come in.. come
in maharaj. Bhaiyyaji...!

110
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,704
Bhaiyyaji

111
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:02,512
This is Mr. Jimmy, Jimmy Cliff.

112
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:10,422
Hundred percent English! Good morning.

113
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:14,556
Greetings! Please come..
Welcome.. Welcome!

114
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:17,429
No, please don't say Namaste.

115
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:22,032
From where I come, a teacher is
equal to God. Right Misir...?

116
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:24,371
Correct! It seems as though
the Lord Krishna himself..

117
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:25,774
...has come to Sudama's home.

118
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:32,382
Guruji, what will you have.. cold
drinks, hot drinks? - Hot drinks?

119
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:33,509
No, thank you.

120
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,986
This is your first visit. You must
have something. Hey, Pintu..

121
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,113
Yes Bhaiyyaji.

122
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:44,395
Pintu.. Please get some snacks
organized for Guruji.

123
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:45,521
Yes Bhaiyyaji..

124
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,462
No I.. I.. I just ate something
some time back.

125
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,627
I'm really not hungry. Thank you,
thank you for offering though.

126
00:09:57,397 --> 00:10:04,747
See Misir, when he speaks, he
sounds just like George Bush.

127
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:05,974
George Bush?

128
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:07,812
George..
- Busss..

129
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:14,083
Pooja, you have done wonderfully

130
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:18,827
Guruji, just teach me English the way
you speak it. That's all I want!

131
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:20,489
L.. er.. whoaa.. er..

132
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:22,430
Guruji takes coaching
classes for English..

133
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,560
...and also works in a call centre.

134
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,728
Well time might be a problem.

135
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,500
Problem.. Problem is no problem.

136
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:34,835
See misir, his arrival has already
improved my English!

137
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:44,885
Guruji, from now on, you are
Dronacharya and I am Arjun.

138
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:50,524
Wherever you say, whenever
you say I will be present..

139
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:54,463
Unless I hunt the bird of the English
language I will not rest..

140
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:57,024
...and I will not leave your feet.
- Whoaa.. er..

141
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,663
Bhaiyyaji is requesting so nicely..
please agree Sir.

142
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:03,469
No.. no.. no.
- Bhaiyyaji.. snacks!

143
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:06,203
Forget the bloody snacks and
fall at Guruji's feet. Quick.

144
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:07,604
No.. no.. that's
really not necessary.

145
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,077
Hold his feet
- Here..

146
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:10,579
So you are agree Sir?

147
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:15,146
I am agree? I had to watch it.

148
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:18,553
I hope while I taught them English
I wouldn't forget what I know..

149
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:20,589
I am agree.

150
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:24,623
Man I was loving this whole
Indian traditional thing.

151
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,492
All these grown up men calling me..

152
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:27,623
Guruji

153
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:31,601
Thanks guys! And then
there was Pooja..

154
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:36,571
...now that was a dish
I was dying to taste!

155
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:40,103
So Guruji, decision's made.

156
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:44,914
After your morning classes finish,
will begin my tutoring.

157
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:49,609
Don't worry about the money.
Education costs nothing.

158
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:53,651
I mean, it's priceless.

159
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:57,019
In three months..

160
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,256
...I have a crucial meeting
with a foreign delegation.

161
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,627
Just make my English
good enough for it.

162
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:04,264
I'll try my best Bhaiyyaji.

163
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,100
But you will have to
promise me one thing.

164
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,597
From today onwards whatever you
say just try saying it in English

165
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,641
But that's the.. problem.

166
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:13,767
You just need to make an effort..
read the English newspaper,

167
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:14,937
...listen to the English
news bulletin..

168
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:17,546
I will be here tomorrow
onwards and hopefully..

169
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:20,676
...In three months, you will
be speaking English fluently.

170
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,011
Just like George Busss ..

171
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,146
A hundred cents..

172
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:30,791
Pooja was a naive.

173
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:32,928
And I was a player.

174
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:37,032
But I had decided that whether
Bhaiyyaji learns English or not,

175
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:40,163
Pooja will definitely learn
the language of my love!

176
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,036
Jack and Jill ..

177
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,633
Jack .. and Jill ..

178
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:47,769
Went up the hill ..

179
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:48,904
Went up the hill ..

180
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:51,778
To fetch a pale of water.

181
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:04,686
Pooja was an entirely new experience
for me. - Listen..

182
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:07,658
She was a nice girl and
very traditional..

183
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:08,994
Really sweet

184
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:10,693
Thanks.

185
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,968
She gave me a card!

186
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:17,700
No one had given me a card
since the tenth grade.

187
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:19,275
But, it was also sweet.

188
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:22,745
I mean I thought it was really silly

189
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:27,615
Jack and Jill, went up the hill..

190
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:31,247
Stamp , Sweet , Sun.
- .. to fetch a pale of water

191
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:33,781
T.. for top

192
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:34,950
Twinkle twinkle..

193
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,084
...little star

194
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,822
How I wonder..
- what you are

195
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:39,724
Up above there in the sky..
- Huh...?

196
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,290
Huh...?

197
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:45,700
...and broke his crown, and
Jill came tumbling after

198
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:53,736
Jimmy Cliff..

199
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,640
Bhaiyyaji has a friend called
Mr. Snehal Desai..

200
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:59,183
...whose number he's misplaced.

201
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,114
Is it possible for you to
get it from your database?

202
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:10,719
Sure. Take it down.. 982172749,

203
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:12,788
Thanks

204
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,332
Don't hang up.. please

205
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:19,735
I'm at VT station

206
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:21,030
I'm coming..

207
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:54,270
Oh sorry.. what's this?

208
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:56,696
Money. It's come for the new office..

209
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:58,106
...that Bhaiyyaji is going to open.

210
00:14:58,831 --> 00:14:59,901
Cash...?

211
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:01,775
Ya, it comes every month.

212
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,371
Bhaiyyaji has twenty
restaurants in UP.

213
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:05,916
All the revenue is collected
and sent here.

214
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:08,379
There is something called the bank...?

215
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,712
The bank is where it goes guruji!

216
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:12,085
Tomorrow morning, it
will go to the bank!

217
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:17,386
Er.. there's something
I want to tell you..

218
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,187
What?

219
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:22,799
Guruji, I am waiting.

220
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:31,099
Humty Dumty sat on a wall, Humty
Dumpty had a great fall,

221
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,403
Humty Dumty sat on a wall,

222
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:37,914
Bhaiyyaji was murdering the English
language everyday. - Humty Dumty..

223
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:42,112
And I.. I was slowly losing myself
in the magic of Pooja's eyes.

224
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:46,319
I was thinking of just one
girl for the entire day..

225
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:50,852
And suddenly I felt fear. Does
she even think about me?

226
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,492
Does she love me as
much as I love her?

227
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:59,829
I'm downstairs. I wanted
to tell you something..

228
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:04,503
I wanted to tell you that when
you laugh, your eyes twinkle..

229
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:10,840
I wanted to tell you that I
miss you in the evenings..

230
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:14,848
I don't know how to tell
you without saying it..

231
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:18,855
Saying that I'm falling in
love with you..l love you.

232
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:26,920
Bohemian heart

233
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:35,872
Wandering, lost bohemian heart

234
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:42,129
Hastening with all its zest

235
00:16:50,877 --> 00:17:00,821
<i>TI</i>

236
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:21,250
Oh I'll conquer every star in the sky

237
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:23,981
Into one knot the sun and moon tie

238
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,250
And celebrate this everlasting high

239
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:29,191
I am but a rootless pilgrim

240
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,994
Oh I'll conquer every star in the sky

241
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,194
Into one knot the sun and moon tie

242
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,863
And celebrate this everlasting high

243
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:43,305
I am but a rootless pilgrim

244
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:44,932
Homeless and a vagabond

245
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:48,001
Roaming from one land to another

246
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,947
Somebody stop me please..

247
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,575
Enchanted by a spell so fond

248
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,314
I can't explain it any further

249
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:01,882
I'm desperate for release..

250
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:03,894
I'm lost in love

251
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,359
I'm lost in love

252
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:10,128
I'm sacrificed, I'm destroyed

253
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:13,898
I'm nothing but a moving void

254
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,065
I'm lost

255
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:21,043
I'm lost in love

256
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:54,006
Alone I stand, leaving all else behind

257
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:58,105
Word of honor now futile I find

258
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:03,620
I look at every star
straight in the eye

259
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:07,590
I've reached far beyond
every moonlit sky

260
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:11,952
To whom my story of woe do I tell

261
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:14,225
Rescue me from this heavenly hell

262
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:21,136
Somebody.. Anybody..

263
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,366
I'm lost in love

264
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:25,431
I'm lost in love

265
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:29,310
I'm sacrificed, I'm destroyed

266
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:33,180
I'm nothing but a moving void

267
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:35,378
I'm lost

268
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:40,151
I'm lost in love

269
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:08,415
The path told me that I'll get weary

270
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:12,282
Return halfway, you'll find it scary

271
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:18,257
Don't go any further
for a tempest slashes

272
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:22,163
Thunder cracks and lightning flashes

273
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:28,603
But I am the fanatic
that moved his lip

274
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:31,540
Keep me company on this lonesome trip

275
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:35,443
Say yes before my eye begins to drip

276
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,309
I'm lost in love

277
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:40,179
I'm lost in love

278
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,584
I'm sacrificed, I'm destroyed

279
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:47,556
I'm nothing but a moving void

280
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:50,059
I'm lost

281
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:54,656
I'm lost in love

282
00:20:55,121 --> 00:21:02,130
Hastening with all my zest..

283
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:14,149
I'm lost in love

284
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:20,154
I'm lost in love

285
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:25,161
I'm lost in love

286
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:34,333
I'm lost in love

287
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:41,476
I'm lost in love

288
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:52,180
I'm lost in love

289
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:54,656
I'm sacrificed, I'm destroyed

290
00:21:54,713 --> 00:22:00,664
I'm nothing but a moving void

291
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:16,338
TASHAN! Tashan the style..

292
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:24,519
...the good luck, the bloody formula.

293
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:30,753
Here, here, delegation come..

294
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:36,231
...talk, shake hands, smile,
ok tata bye bye..

295
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:45,166
...but Bhaiyyaji feels first
impression is the last impression.

296
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:47,575
Bhaiyyaji's Tashan was
an 'English' speech.

297
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:50,180
A speech like none other..

298
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:53,843
...with language that no one
had ever heard or even seen.

299
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:58,244
Happy to lots you being today..

300
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:05,753
...lots happy, because the person,

301
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:10,628
who till today your temple's
steps not climbing,

302
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:15,667
who till today in front of
you his head not bowing..

303
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:16,798
Deewar.

304
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,341
It's Bhaiyyaji's most favorite film!

305
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:22,469
Who till today in front of you
hands not outstretched..

306
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:26,372
...that person in front
of you standing is.

307
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:35,420
I knowing you lots happy
today, lots happy.

308
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:42,288
Because today I am losing,
but you knowing..

309
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:46,692
...while I standing here, that lady..

310
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:53,609
That lady whose forehead rubbing
your fourkhat stone,

311
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:57,305
So much so that the stone idiot
becoming thin person..

312
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:59,246
There's no English word
for 'Chaukhat' guruji..

313
00:23:59,305 --> 00:24:01,307
In Hindi 'Chau' means 4,
so he made it 'Fourkhat'

314
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:07,551
I of you nothing ask, but asking today

315
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:10,494
...asking today.

316
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:15,322
My crime's punishment
my mother doesn't give.

317
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:19,661
My crime's punishment
my mother doesn't give.

318
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:25,331
I myself surrender.
I myself surrender.

319
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:29,940
You do what you do, you do.

320
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:36,351
God, just give me my mother back.

321
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:41,992
My mother.. return.

322
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:48,623
My mother, return me please ..

323
00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:55,034
My mother return me please.
Please God.. please.

324
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:18,359
Bhaiyyaji's speech was like
a double edged sword.

325
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:21,591
The foreign delegation will think
that it is some Indian tradition..

326
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,322
...and definitely finalize his deal.

327
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:27,729
Ahaiyyaii!

328
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,939
In the middle of all this,
the love story of mine..

329
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:36,910
...that was blossoming was
completely bilingual.

330
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:39,549
Whether you say it in English
or in Hindi, it was great.

331
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:41,409
I was on top of the world!

332
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:51,358
How and why? how and why? How?

333
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:55,093
I said how come?? HOW???

334
00:25:57,056 --> 00:26:01,903
How did you get the courage? I can
throw you on the streets if I like.

335
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:04,098
Who are you.. huh?

336
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:07,543
I gave you a job, gave you respect..

337
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:11,376
...and you.. you worthless
maidservant.

338
00:26:12,371 --> 00:26:15,716
Remain within your limits.
Remain within your limits.

339
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:24,559
If I throw you out, you will
end up at a dance bar..

340
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:26,996
...or brothel, like Umrao Jaan.

341
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,393
You don't mean that Bhaiyyaji.

342
00:26:28,454 --> 00:26:33,403
Guruji please..this is an internal
matter that you know nothing of.

343
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:37,439
Kindly do not poke your nose
in matters that are private.

344
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,600
Thank you.

345
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:49,409
What he's thinking? Bhaiyyaji
villain, shouting ladies?

346
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:51,146
But not knowing truth.

347
00:26:52,745 --> 00:26:55,419
Should I telling truth Pooja?

348
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:06,425
I made a mistake Bhaiyyaji,
please forgive me.

349
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:12,701
I would have shot Bhaiyyaji
if I had my way.

350
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:16,703
Listen, tomorrow we'll
go there together..

351
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:18,437
...and throw his useless
job in his face.

352
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:20,041
You needn't work there any more.

353
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,451
I cannot leave this job.

354
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:25,450
Why?

355
00:27:27,546 --> 00:27:29,184
My life is very complicated.

356
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,123
Your life and my life are
not separate any more..

357
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:39,834
Listen, before I met you,
I only loved myself.

358
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:45,541
After I met you, I have
learnt true love.

359
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:51,680
Please forget me. You're
not my destiny.

360
00:27:53,038 --> 00:28:00,889
My destiny is this job, this debt..
my father's debt to Bhaiyyaji.

361
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:06,221
I haven't even scattered
my father's ashes yet.

362
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:11,165
I thought that when I clear the debt..

363
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:15,899
...I'll go to Haridwar
and scatter them.

364
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,705
I've been working for
him since I was 16..

365
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:22,543
...and deducting a part
of my salary every month.

366
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:26,113
Bhaiyyaji says he himself
doesn't like it..

367
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:29,048
...but the interest alone has
become one and a half crores.

368
00:28:33,846 --> 00:28:35,553
I asked him for the accounts
this morning.

369
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:38,752
And you saw how he shouted
at me like I was a beggar.

370
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:41,522
And then later he came
to me and said sorry.

371
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,224
He said he was feeling bad
about what happened.

372
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:48,536
He said he wants to help
me but was hesitating.

373
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:52,037
He said he'd forego the
entire debt and interest.

374
00:28:52,765 --> 00:28:54,039
Marry me Pooja, he said.

375
00:28:55,534 --> 00:28:57,605
There's never any debt between
husband and wife silly!

376
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,543
He said that there is an auspicious
time after Diwali.

377
00:29:00,606 --> 00:29:04,611
Oh shut up Pooja.. Marriage?

378
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:32,710
We will return Bhaiyyaji's money.

379
00:29:34,006 --> 00:29:36,577
How? Where will one and
a half crores come from?

380
00:29:37,743 --> 00:29:38,813
By train..

381
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:42,590
Every month Bhaiyyaji's
money came into..

382
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:43,820
...one of Victoria Terminal's lockers.

383
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:50,589
The key to that locker was only with
Pooja but now Pooja, was with me.

384
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:54,267
After repaying Bhaiyyaji's
loan (with his own money)..

385
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,329
...we would run far away
into our little world.

386
00:29:56,395 --> 00:30:00,605
That was the plan. I should've
been scared.. but I wasn't.

387
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,079
In our country, people don't
even get caught for murder.

388
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,341
We were only running away with
the money of a small baker.

389
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:13,679
It's more than the usual.

390
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:27,294
How much do you think it is?

391
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:33,366
I don't know. I've never seen
so much money before.

392
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:40,981
Okay. Remove Bhaiyyaji's amount
and keep it separate.

393
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:42,877
I'll be right back.

394
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:44,011
Where are you going?

395
00:30:44,076 --> 00:30:46,750
Office. I need to submit
my leave application..

396
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:48,824
...and there's some
stuff in my locker.

397
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:52,086
You be careful and do
not open the door.

398
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:56,159
I'm taking my keys with me. Jesus!

399
00:30:57,389 --> 00:31:01,030
When I reached the call centre my
supervisor pushed me into a briefing.

400
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:04,866
I was getting late but how could I
tell him that there's stolen money..

401
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,671
...lying in my house that
I need to run with.

402
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:09,873
I had to stay and there I met..

403
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:13,676
My name is A.C.P. K.S. Hooda,
Kuldeep Singh.

404
00:31:14,673 --> 00:31:16,311
Village: Khadkhodha Jilla
Hissar, Haryana.

405
00:31:18,143 --> 00:31:20,783
Anyway, jokes apart..it's not really
a joke. I'm just laughing!

406
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:24,691
Now, my name and address is
of no importance to you.

407
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:26,821
However, the names..

408
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:31,300
...and addresses that I'm going
to tell you are very important.

409
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:36,062
Yes, run the slide show. And the
names are Mr. Jagan Shah..

410
00:31:36,695 --> 00:31:39,938
...Mr. Satish Jindal
and Mr. Snehal Desai.

411
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:42,706
Their extremely private and..

412
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:44,372
...sensitive information
has been leaked..

413
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:45,710
...from this call centre.

414
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:49,045
Where they stay, their
mobile numbers..

415
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:52,782
...land line numbers, office
addresses, etc, etc.

416
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:53,914
So many things are there.

417
00:31:54,746 --> 00:32:01,425
I'm not saying that you all are
culprits but someone is there.

418
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:05,724
In the last two months these three..

419
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:08,738
...gentlemen have received
extortion threats..

420
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:11,274
...for large amounts that vary from
10 lakhs to 5 crore rupees.

421
00:32:12,164 --> 00:32:14,735
And all these threats have
gone from one man..

422
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,475
...whose name is Lakhan Singh,
aka, Bhaiyyaji.

423
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,755
Bhaiyyaji is an upcoming
underworld king from UP.

424
00:32:26,478 --> 00:32:29,322
Contract killing, murder, kidnapping..

425
00:32:29,481 --> 00:32:32,428
...and land dealings are things
he can do with his eyes closed.

426
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:34,225
And he does them, every other day.

427
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,490
This Gabbar Singh has two henchmen.

428
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:38,996
One is Mr. Balakram Misir..

429
00:32:39,224 --> 00:32:41,761
...and the other is Mr. Anand
Mohan Tiwari, aka Pintu.

430
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,134
Pooja, don't leave the
house at any cost.

431
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:49,037
Do you know that Bhaiyyaji is
one of UP's biggest dons?

432
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:51,781
Ms. Pooja's phone is with us Guruji.

433
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:57,512
It was Guruji. He's calling
Bhaiyyaji a don.

434
00:32:57,576 --> 00:32:59,783
But isn't Bhaiyyaji a killer?

435
00:32:59,945 --> 00:33:01,015
Moron! He's a smuggler.

436
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:02,782
Don't you remember? He
started with killing..

437
00:33:02,848 --> 00:33:04,418
...and then moved on to smuggling.

438
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:10,292
Pooja.. Pooja.. Pooja where
are you? Pooja come on!

439
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:13,802
We've got to go. You don't know..
Bhaiyyaji is.. Pooja..

440
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:23,378
I flirt, I trick I cheat!

441
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:31,844
Hello Guruji! You've stolen my money?

442
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:37,825
Tsk.. tsk.. My God that's
funny!! Very funny!

443
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:57,837
I'm here to meet you. Pooja Singh..
Do you take private classes?

444
00:33:58,103 --> 00:34:00,583
So are you agreeable sir?
I'm at VT station.

445
00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:03,409
The information has been leaked
from this call centre.

446
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:12,487
My father's debt.. I vowed
to repay every penny..

447
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:14,192
I've never seen so much money before..

448
00:34:14,853 --> 00:34:17,424
You've stolen my money?

449
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:19,330
I've destroyed you, haven't I?

450
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,606
Why did they steal the money?

451
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:36,318
How should I punish that
ungrateful Pooja?

452
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:39,148
And Guruji turned out to be a snake?

453
00:34:40,612 --> 00:34:45,618
So many questions..my
brain is getting fried.

454
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:53,468
But Bhaiyyaji's feels that no matter
what kind of question it is..

455
00:34:54,993 --> 00:35:02,411
The answer is available only in one
place - by the banks of the Ganges.

456
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:12,315
O Lord! In this unknown land of Ashok
Vatika I, Sita, am in solitude.

457
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:16,651
Surrounded by demons on every side,
I need thee and call upon thy name.

458
00:35:16,715 --> 00:35:18,456
Hey.. At least call Ravan!

459
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:21,589
Where is Ravan?

460
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,990
Ravan...!!

461
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:24,291
Oh.. Ravan..

462
00:35:27,025 --> 00:35:29,665
Bachchan, Bachchan Pande

463
00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:32,636
He'll show you the night
in broad daylight

464
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:36,406
Bachchan, Bachchan Pande. BACHCHAN!

465
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:53,554
Ready!

466
00:35:55,420 --> 00:36:03,965
Ha.. Ha.. Ha! Lankans! Look
outside of your houses.

467
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:08,102
These are the morons who
came to burn me down.

468
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:11,980
All the air is out eh? Flat tires!
Haa.. thu! (spits).

469
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:16,718
Now if anyone raises their head
in front of me, I will..

470
00:36:21,213 --> 00:36:22,988
Parvatiya, what are you doing here?

471
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,719
She's Sita, you idiot! Parvati is
the heroine of the Shiv-Puran.

472
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:33,731
Shut up Jackass! If you know
so much about the story..

473
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:36,204
Why don't you become Ravan?

474
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:39,369
Come on?? Enact Ravan's
part.. come on???

475
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:42,505
Dhanpau
- Yup..

476
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:44,736
Note down this dimwit's
name and address.

477
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:48,411
Later tonight, we'll teach him
a lesson or two in private.

478
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:51,414
Don't you have any shame, acting
in front of these losers?

479
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,080
My mother told me to.

480
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:55,082
That mother of yours
will rest in peace..

481
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:56,216
...only after she makes you a heroine.

482
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:58,557
Please take your lines.

483
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:03,395
Oh yes, lines. Am saying them. Just
get up. Oh..er.. Rajdhoot..

484
00:37:03,655 --> 00:37:05,100
Its Meghdhoot, MEGHdhoot.

485
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:07,136
Ya, whatever 'dhoot'..
stand there, quickly.

486
00:37:09,494 --> 00:37:15,035
O Sita, stop being stubborn. Don't
waste your tender youth..

487
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:20,516
...on that worthless Ram. Marry me!
You'll live like a queen.

488
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:23,246
Which lamebrain has
written these lines?

489
00:37:23,308 --> 00:37:24,378
You wrote these lines?

490
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:26,479
Er.. no. Not me.
- Who wrote these lines?

491
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:28,685
You wrote these lines?

492
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,760
No, the original was
written by Tulsidas.

493
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:32,494
I've just written the screenplay.

494
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,793
Tulsidas wrote these lines - Marry
me and you'll live like a queen..

495
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:37,060
Otherwise you'll never be able to..

496
00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:38,192
...show your trashy face
to anyone again.

497
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,167
Am I Ravan or Mogambo??

498
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:42,433
But that line is Gabbar's.

499
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:47,438
You.. You writers are sons of.. your
mother should've been barren.

500
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:48,739
Who made you a writer?

501
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,074
Mr. Tiwari told me that these are..

502
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:51,205
...the kind of lines
that work these days.

503
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,680
Where is Tiwari? Tiwari.. Tiwari!

504
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:54,812
You gave the main role to the
biggest ruffian in town?

505
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:56,677
Please go, he's calling you.

506
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:59,279
Quickly, otherwise he'll come here
and beat the shit out of you.

507
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:02,086
Tiwari! Come here and let
me strangle you nicely.

508
00:38:03,081 --> 00:38:04,151
Hello sir.

509
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:07,424
Yes, Mr. Tiwari, who am I?

510
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:09,156
Ravan, sir.

511
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,633
Hey Dhanpat, who am I in real life?

512
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:15,261
Bachchan Pande.

513
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:17,432
BACHCHAN PANDE!!

514
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,110
Sir, I am Bachchan Pande.

515
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:24,147
I have a little bit of respect around
here. Somebody bring a chair.

516
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:26,140
I am enacting Ravan's part.

517
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:29,114
So, if Ravan is not held in
high esteem by the people..

518
00:38:29,174 --> 00:38:31,120
...how will they have respect for me!

519
00:38:32,577 --> 00:38:34,113
Sir, you should play Ram's part.

520
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,282
Oh just give Bachchan Ram's part...!

521
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:38,721
The audience is waiting for you sir.

522
00:38:39,117 --> 00:38:41,324
I request you to become Ram
and continue this Ramlila.

523
00:38:41,453 --> 00:38:45,128
And let the show go on!

524
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,135
Sir, if you become Ram,
I will feel very humbled.

525
00:38:50,295 --> 00:38:53,868
There is no greater honor for me than
to meet my end at your hands.

526
00:38:53,932 --> 00:38:58,142
My my, I'm no Shah Rukh Khan. I'm
better off with Ravan's part.

527
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:00,145
I can't do all this. What say, writer?

528
00:39:00,205 --> 00:39:02,185
I'm warning you right now,
Sita will go only with Ram.

529
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:03,875
Don't ask me to change
it at the nth hour.

530
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,780
Give you an inch, you
take a yard.. huh?

531
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:09,155
No, no. Of course it
can be changed sir.

532
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:11,356
Thank your stars that the phone rang.

533
00:39:12,884 --> 00:39:18,163
Hello.. yes Chachi. Yes,
I'm leaving immediately.

534
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,867
Bachchan, Bachchan Pande

535
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:34,250
Power is the force that runs the world

536
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:37,180
The sword of power am I

537
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:46,195
Provoking me will be your mistake

538
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,194
Be destroyed in the blink of an eye

539
00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:57,600
Bachchan, Bachchan Pande

540
00:39:57,662 --> 00:40:00,575
He'll show you the night
In broad daylight

541
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:04,279
Bachchan, Bachchan Pande. BACHCHAN!

542
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:11,615
Good evening Chachi!
The recovery is done.

543
00:40:11,676 --> 00:40:15,214
Bachchan, I told you to make
him understand gently.

544
00:40:15,313 --> 00:40:16,417
He's the son of the freaking
Home Minister.

545
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:18,960
Chachi, that schmuck starting
shouting in English.

546
00:40:19,217 --> 00:40:21,857
That's why Bachchan sir lost
it and taught him a lesson.

547
00:40:21,953 --> 00:40:23,227
Bachchan Pandey, the people
you've messed with..

548
00:40:23,288 --> 00:40:25,529
...this time are beyond my reach.

549
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,227
If they decide to return your
lesson with an encounter..

550
00:40:27,292 --> 00:40:28,862
...I won't be able to
do anything Sushila.

551
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,498
You're going to organize an
encounter.. of my Bachchan?

552
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:36,273
Chachi had brought me
up like her own son.

553
00:40:37,569 --> 00:40:40,243
She was having an affair
with Inspector Bajpai..

554
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:43,252
...thanks to which I had gotten
out of trouble a lot of the time.

555
00:40:43,341 --> 00:40:46,447
Yes.. But today it seemed as though
fate was not on my side.

556
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:47,989
Yes Bhaiyyaji. You don't
need to worry at all.

557
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:52,626
This boy of mine is more
efficient than Thakur.

558
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:56,457
Yes.. Yes.. he is a recovery king.

559
00:40:56,721 --> 00:41:00,897
He'll bring them back from hell
Bhaiyyaji! Yes, I'll send him.

560
00:41:00,992 --> 00:41:03,836
Yes.. Yes.. okay. Just
let me hear his voice?

561
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:08,267
I'm going to send you to Bhaiyyaji.

562
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:11,872
Whoo.. hoo! Going to work
for Bhaiyyaji is like..

563
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,279
...like telling a boy
who plays cricket on..

564
00:41:13,338 --> 00:41:14,908
...the streets to join
the world cup team.

565
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:19,017
What Amitab Bachchan is to
the people of Allahabad..

566
00:41:19,277 --> 00:41:20,950
Bhaiyyaji is to us, natives of Kanpur.

567
00:41:22,347 --> 00:41:24,020
They call him the pride of Kanpur.

568
00:41:24,516 --> 00:41:26,291
They say Bhaiyyaji made his..

569
00:41:26,351 --> 00:41:29,594
...beginnings right here
in Chaman Ganj.

570
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:39,604
Bhaiyyaji used to be
a rickshaw puller.

571
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:44,303
Not for anyone though. He was
the favorite of Vickram Tiger..

572
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:47,316
...who was a hi-fi goon of Kanpur.

573
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:50,986
Such people have more
enemies than friends.

574
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:56,387
The end is coming. The end is here.

575
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:03,464
The magic of your craft
makes judgment draw near

576
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:07,526
The magic of your craft
makes judgment draw near

577
00:42:08,793 --> 00:42:09,863
Go closer..

578
00:42:17,836 --> 00:42:21,443
If towards the foe you will
just lift your gaze

579
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:26,850
Move.

580
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:29,858
If towards the foe you will
just lift your gaze

581
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:34,787
Into his eye look, leaving
him burnt ablaze

582
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:38,891
The magic of your craft
fills all with fear

583
00:42:38,957 --> 00:42:43,531
The magic of your craft
fills all with fear

584
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:48,101
Move out of the way.

585
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:10,592
When those thugs killed Vickram
Tiger and escaped - nobody knows.

586
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:16,404
Bhaiyyaji was very upset that in
spite of his desperate efforts..

587
00:43:16,461 --> 00:43:18,998
...he was not able to
save Vickram Tiger.

588
00:43:21,733 --> 00:43:23,406
Although, it did turn out
pretty well for him..

589
00:43:23,468 --> 00:43:26,039
...as he got to keep the gold that
Vickram Tiger was carrying.

590
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:31,948
After that, Bhaiyyaji began to rise
in a way that was unstoppable.

591
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:36,854
He is where he is only because
of his own strength and acumen.

592
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:40,153
I've also heard that Bhaiyyaji has
an enormous hideout in Bombay.

593
00:43:41,419 --> 00:43:42,489
A city of gold.

594
00:43:44,756 --> 00:43:46,497
Light is chic and night is trend

595
00:43:46,591 --> 00:43:48,434
We are made of a unique blend

596
00:43:48,526 --> 00:43:52,633
Every state is ecstasy,
not just a fantasy

597
00:43:52,764 --> 00:43:56,871
Grey is the life that we have led,
our fury can burn the sun dead

598
00:43:56,968 --> 00:43:59,073
Shameful and shameless have we been

599
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:01,081
Innocence untouched and still keen

600
00:44:01,172 --> 00:44:05,177
Alexander's fatal arrow have we evaded

601
00:44:05,443 --> 00:44:09,448
The oceans have we consumed
and mutated

602
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:13,489
Alexander's fatal arrow have we evaded

603
00:44:13,718 --> 00:44:17,530
The oceans have we consumed
and mutated

604
00:44:17,622 --> 00:44:25,837
We don't await the fortunes
of destiny's sanction

605
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:31,471
We are of the extraordinary fashion

606
00:44:31,636 --> 00:44:35,550
Oh yes, our zest brings life to LIFE

607
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:53,224
Pintu.. Bhaiyyaji's here

608
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:57,139
Bhaiyyaji, he has a very
large business empire.

609
00:44:57,228 --> 00:45:00,141
Mr. Snehal Rasik Bhai Desai
- Owns a factory.

610
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:01,505
We tried to make him
understand that for..

611
00:45:01,566 --> 00:45:03,512
...the smooth functioning
of the factory..

612
00:45:03,568 --> 00:45:04,876
...he must give us a
generous donation.

613
00:45:04,969 --> 00:45:07,245
Otherwise, the factory might get
burnt down.. and turn to ashes.

614
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:09,242
Pintu.

615
00:45:13,511 --> 00:45:17,254
You'll die the death of a
dog..Do you know who I am?

616
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,256
I know who you are.

617
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:29,263
The question is do you know who I am?

618
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:35,636
I am the Sachin Tendulkar and
the Brian Lara - Combined!

619
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:41,277
Aaaaaaaaaa.. ( shouting with pain )

620
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:44,277
My pleasure.

621
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:48,182
Hey.. Hey Ali! Get rid of him
and clean this place up.

622
00:45:48,279 --> 00:45:49,917
Ali won't be able to do much..
Everyone come in.

623
00:45:50,014 --> 00:45:51,288
This is your job for today.

624
00:45:53,184 --> 00:45:55,221
Bhaiyyaji was my hero

625
00:45:55,553 --> 00:45:57,965
- international, multinational,
every national!

626
00:45:58,055 --> 00:46:00,228
It didn't get bigger than him.

627
00:46:01,025 --> 00:46:02,095
Greetings Bhaiyyaji

628
00:46:06,564 --> 00:46:07,668
You are Bajpai's son?

629
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:10,075
I am Bajpai's son. This is Bachchan.

630
00:46:10,168 --> 00:46:11,238
Misir..

631
00:46:19,043 --> 00:46:21,717
Bajpai says you are can
find anything? - Yes.

632
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,616
Finding from hell also?

633
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:25,785
Yes.. yes..

634
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:27,123
If that's the case, I welcome you!

635
00:46:36,327 --> 00:46:41,072
Er.. Bhaiyyaji, my English
is not very strong but..

636
00:46:41,699 --> 00:46:46,341
But it is a privilege to meet you.

637
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,617
I don't want to say too
much, except that..

638
00:46:48,673 --> 00:46:50,346
...now you don't need to
worry about anything.

639
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:55,687
I will throw that English professor
at your feet in the next two days.

640
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:59,158
If I can't, my name will no
longer be Bachchan Pande.

641
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:07,626
You don't need to find Guruji.
Guruji has come by himself!

642
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:15,834
This is Guruji. Surrendered
himself yesterday.

643
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:17,635
He says that he does not
have anything with him..

644
00:47:17,702 --> 00:47:19,648
...Pooja took all the
money and ran away.

645
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:24,184
Oww.. Jesus...!

646
00:47:24,709 --> 00:47:27,087
Just saying hello in
Kanpuriya tradition.

647
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:28,748
Look, I don't have the money.

648
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:30,651
Beating me up is not
going to produce it.

649
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,691
I haven't hit you for the money.

650
00:47:32,817 --> 00:47:34,262
I hit you for your cheap character.

651
00:47:35,086 --> 00:47:37,965
How did you even think
of cheating Bhaiyyaji?

652
00:47:38,656 --> 00:47:40,226
If you have revere for
Bhaiyyaji so much, ..

653
00:47:40,291 --> 00:47:41,395
...why don't you go and catch Pooja?

654
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:51,970
Which brings me to my next question.
Where is the girl?

655
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:53,673
How in heaven's name will I know..

656
00:47:53,738 --> 00:47:55,411
...If I knew where she is,
wouldn't I be with her?

657
00:47:55,673 --> 00:47:57,414
Why_would I be sitting here
getting beaten up by you?

658
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,244
So the girl has all the money?

659
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:01,050
Yes, Einstein.

660
00:48:02,146 --> 00:48:06,424
If I don't understand something, I
consider it an insult. Understood?

661
00:48:08,152 --> 00:48:12,328
Bhaiyyaji, I can tell from his
eyes that he's not lying.

662
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:14,701
I can spot a liar anywhere.

663
00:48:14,959 --> 00:48:21,740
Hmmm.. so you tell me,
what should we do now?

664
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:29,112
Bhaiyyaji, when a person runs away,
he goes to two kinds of places.

665
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:32,710
He either goes to a place where
he has a support system or..

666
00:48:32,777 --> 00:48:36,748
...he goes to a place where
he's always wanted to go.

667
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:38,451
For example..Haridwar

668
00:48:39,717 --> 00:48:40,787
Haridwar?

669
00:48:40,885 --> 00:48:44,094
Yes! She's gone to immerse her
father's ashes in Haridwar.

670
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:48,930
Oww.. Jesus man! Now why'd you hit me?

671
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:51,466
You should have told us
this earlier, bonehead.

672
00:48:51,729 --> 00:48:53,140
Do you think this is
some kind of joke?

673
00:48:56,967 --> 00:49:01,040
Bachchan, have you used this before?
It's an 8mm German pistol.

674
00:49:01,472 --> 00:49:05,181
Keep it. Take Guruji and find Pooja.

675
00:49:07,745 --> 00:49:10,385
Bring Pooja, Guruji and, most
important - the money back to me.

676
00:49:11,382 --> 00:49:15,762
But if anybody is naughty,
kill them and throw their..

677
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:22,499
...bodies into the nearest river or
pond. Guruji, do you understand?

678
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:23,863
Yes Bhaiyyaji, I do.

679
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,031
Huh?.. What? What? What?

680
00:49:25,096 --> 00:49:26,769
Yes, Bhaiyyaji. I understand
that if I make any mistake..

681
00:49:26,864 --> 00:49:28,502
English, please..

682
00:49:29,467 --> 00:49:30,775
Okay, I understand that
if anything goes wrong..

683
00:49:33,504 --> 00:49:35,381
Er.. I understand that, and I..

684
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:39,444
And I won't do anything
naughty. I promise.

685
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:44,518
How he speaks Bachchan..like
music to my ears.

686
00:49:45,249 --> 00:49:48,787
The man is a snake but when
he speaks English..

687
00:49:48,953 --> 00:49:51,433
Fully George Bush! Complete ..

688
00:49:51,522 --> 00:49:57,302
Tsk.. tsk.. Prince Charlie!
Prince Charlie..Charlie

689
00:49:57,928 --> 00:50:00,169
Charlie!!Charlie.. ha ha!

690
00:50:00,231 --> 00:50:02,006
Ha.. ha.. ha...!

691
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:15,187
And then there's this
'Indian foreigner'.

692
00:50:15,813 --> 00:50:17,258
Does the bastard even
think in English?

693
00:50:17,949 --> 00:50:19,360
So this was my destiny.

694
00:50:19,817 --> 00:50:24,562
Roam around with a wild gorilla
and look for Pooja. Pooja..

695
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:27,836
Here I was with my head on the
block and wherever she is..

696
00:50:27,892 --> 00:50:31,567
...she must be having
a ball. Bloody bitch!

697
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:38,272
Intoxicating eyes

698
00:50:38,436 --> 00:50:40,575
Deceiving with sublime lies

699
00:50:40,838 --> 00:50:43,580
Tints grey on clear blue skies

700
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,582
I'm drugged by these eyes

701
00:50:46,844 --> 00:50:49,154
My heart is but a cluster of ties

702
00:50:49,447 --> 00:50:52,053
Be mine in vain it cries

703
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:57,850
<i>TI</i>

704
00:51:11,602 --> 00:51:14,139
I flirt, I trick, I cheat

705
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:16,512
Stealing your soul is no great feat

706
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:19,110
I tease, I play, I defeat

707
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:22,089
You'll never find me,
I vanish in a beat

708
00:51:30,888 --> 00:51:33,630
I flirt, I trick, I cheat

709
00:51:33,891 --> 00:51:36,269
Stealing your soul is no great feat

710
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:38,464
I tease, I play, I defeat

711
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:41,008
You'll never find me,
I vanish in a beat

712
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,475
I am the morning dew

713
00:51:43,634 --> 00:51:45,910
I combine day with night's hue

714
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:48,016
I am your purest view

715
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:51,018
How will you escape my mesmeric charm

716
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:53,554
Don't! Don't you dare..
try to give me that stare

717
00:51:53,644 --> 00:51:55,555
Don't look at me like that lover!

718
00:51:55,646 --> 00:51:58,490
Don't! Don't you dare..
try to give me that stare

719
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:00,562
Don't look at me like that, boy!

720
00:52:00,651 --> 00:52:03,461
Don't! Don't you dare..
try to give me that stare

721
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:04,998
Don't look at me like that lover!

722
00:52:05,089 --> 00:52:08,161
Don't! Don't you dare..
try to give me that stare

723
00:52:08,259 --> 00:52:10,432
Don't look at me like that, boy!

724
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:12,666
I flirt, I trick, I cheat

725
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:15,570
Stealing your soul is no great feat

726
00:52:35,419 --> 00:52:39,367
I am the night sinking
all the stars in sight

727
00:52:39,456 --> 00:52:45,134
Every turn I bloom,
at each sigh of gloom

728
00:52:45,229 --> 00:52:49,405
I am that spell which
your willpower dispel

729
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:54,176
I will coax you without
you smelling a hoax

730
00:52:54,572 --> 00:52:56,609
I am the emotion of a broken heart

731
00:52:56,707 --> 00:52:59,278
The thought that provokes a poet's art

732
00:52:59,376 --> 00:53:01,378
I am the light, I am delight

733
00:53:01,479 --> 00:53:04,255
How will you escape my mesmeric charm

734
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:07,056
Don't! Don't you dare..
try to give me that stare

735
00:53:07,151 --> 00:53:09,188
Don't look at me like that lover!

736
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:12,197
Don't! Don't you dare..
try to give me that stare

737
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:14,200
Don't look at me like that boy!

738
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:17,032
Don't! Don't you dare..
try to give me that stare

739
00:53:17,161 --> 00:53:18,640
Don't look at me like that lover!

740
00:53:18,729 --> 00:53:21,733
Don't! Don't you dare..
try to give me that stare

741
00:53:21,999 --> 00:53:24,104
Don't look at me like that boy!

742
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:28,444
Oh.. I flirt, I trick and I cheat

743
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:32,310
intoxicating eyes

744
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,545
Deceiving with sublime lies

745
00:53:34,745 --> 00:53:37,225
Tints grey on clear blue skies

746
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:40,759
I'm drugged by these eyes

747
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,224
My heart is but a cluster of ties

748
00:53:43,487 --> 00:53:45,626
Be mine in vain it cries

749
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:50,468
I am the secret that seals your lips

750
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:55,768
The sand that from your hand slips

751
00:53:56,266 --> 00:54:00,339
I am the drop that thunders on you

752
00:54:00,437 --> 00:54:05,477
The unquenchable thirst
you will never adieu

753
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:08,055
I am the strategy behind all cons

754
00:54:08,212 --> 00:54:10,249
The unsolved web of numerous pawns

755
00:54:10,347 --> 00:54:12,691
I am the light, I am delight

756
00:54:12,783 --> 00:54:15,457
How will you escape my mesmeric charm

757
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:18,362
Don't! Don't you dare..
try to give me that stare

758
00:54:18,556 --> 00:54:20,433
Don't look at me like that lover!

759
00:54:20,524 --> 00:54:23,300
Don't! Don't you dare..
try to give me that stare

760
00:54:23,394 --> 00:54:25,305
Don't look at me like that, boy!

761
00:54:25,396 --> 00:54:27,171
I flirt, I trick, I cheat

762
00:54:27,664 --> 00:54:30,110
Stealing your soul is no great feat

763
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,305
I tease, I play, I defeat

764
00:54:32,403 --> 00:54:35,111
You'll never find me,
I vanish in a beat

765
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:36,809
I am the morning dew

766
00:54:37,541 --> 00:54:40,078
I combine day with night's hue

767
00:54:40,177 --> 00:54:41,622
I am your purest view

768
00:54:41,812 --> 00:54:44,725
How will you escape my mesmeric charm

769
00:54:44,815 --> 00:54:47,591
Don't! Don't you dare..
try to give me that stare

770
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:49,755
Don't look at me like that lover!

771
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:52,528
Don't! Don't you dare..
try to give me that stare

772
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:54,625
Don't look at me like that, boy!

773
00:54:54,725 --> 00:54:57,535
Don't! Don't you dare..
try to give me that stare

774
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:59,505
Don't look at me like that lover!

775
00:54:59,597 --> 00:55:02,237
Don't! Don't you dare..
try to give me that stare

776
00:55:02,333 --> 00:55:04,836
Don't look at me like that, boy!

777
00:55:11,842 --> 00:55:14,413
This is the fastest way
to catch missing people.

778
00:55:14,545 --> 00:55:16,115
Here.. this.. this. In this country..

779
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:19,627
...people will even sell their
mother for ten lakhs.

780
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:20,753
That's bullshit.

781
00:55:20,851 --> 00:55:22,330
Especially people like you..

782
00:55:27,124 --> 00:55:28,432
By the way, what did
you think of Pooja?

783
00:55:31,862 --> 00:55:33,864
Would you steal 25 crores for her?

784
00:55:40,471 --> 00:55:42,451
Okay.. Will you kill her if
Bhaiyyaji tells you to?

785
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:44,219
He didn't say anything like that.

786
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,519
But if he asked me to kill you I
wouldn't hesitate for a second.

787
00:55:47,611 --> 00:55:50,182
I'll park two bullets straight
inside your brain

788
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,359
What? You'll kill me? Just like that??

789
00:55:54,284 --> 00:55:58,323
This is what I came to Mumbai
for.. to be a shooter.

790
00:55:58,422 --> 00:56:01,699
Bang bang!! I'll bury you right
here if you don't shut up now.

791
00:56:02,793 --> 00:56:03,863
Psycho!

792
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:08,601
Now what happened?

793
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:14,682
It's none of your business..
I'm feeling hot.

794
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:16,249
Just sit here quietly.

795
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:28,548
Have you seen her?

796
00:57:37,821 --> 00:57:40,392
Have you seen her
- No I'm not.

797
00:58:05,616 --> 00:58:10,861
Hey?!.. why?

798
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:13,799
You're in India, listen
to Indian music.

799
00:58:14,024 --> 00:58:16,368
Man! .. dude, music has no language.

800
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:18,667
If Bachchan Pande says there is a
language, then there is a language.

801
00:58:18,729 --> 00:58:20,299
Is that understood? Now,
shut your gob..

802
00:58:20,364 --> 00:58:21,502
...and sit there before I change
the shape of your face.

803
00:58:53,764 --> 00:58:54,834
Watch it!

804
00:59:20,524 --> 00:59:22,902
The story thus far has been told
by this 'English' dimwit..

805
00:59:23,093 --> 00:59:27,007
But what is going to happen now?
.. that he doesn't know.

806
00:59:27,497 --> 00:59:30,569
Neither does his mother,
nor does anyone's mother.

807
01:00:46,943 --> 01:00:49,981
Got a light ? Huh?.. Match box?

808
01:00:50,447 --> 01:00:51,517
What?

809
01:00:52,015 --> 01:00:53,551
At least give me a cigarette..

810
01:00:54,051 --> 01:00:55,121
Bitch!

811
01:00:55,218 --> 01:01:02,193
Oh no.. you're not happy to
see me? Why.. naughty boy!

812
01:01:02,459 --> 01:01:04,029
I would've been a happy
man if you had died.

813
01:01:06,697 --> 01:01:09,109
Besides, what the hell were
you doing in our car?

814
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:12,480
Thanks to your advertisements..

815
01:01:12,536 --> 01:01:16,109
...there was no place safer
than your car for me.

816
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:18,210
So..

817
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,550
Who's the hunk?

818
01:01:25,482 --> 01:01:26,620
Hunk?

819
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:34,994
He's quite a stud! You're
not jealous, are you?

820
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:46,606
Hi hunk! The cold doesn't bother you?

821
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:50,511
Here.. happy? Now tell me
where is Bhaiyyaji's money?

822
01:01:51,575 --> 01:01:54,146
You think I have 25 crores
hidden in here?

823
01:01:54,244 --> 01:02:00,251
Don't even try to be over-smart
with me. Just answer my question.

824
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:02,629
Are you also from Kanpur?

825
01:02:03,887 --> 01:02:10,270
Yes.. is there a problem? Look,
I'm not like this moron.

826
01:02:10,594 --> 01:02:12,540
I don't talk much but when I do..

827
01:02:12,596 --> 01:02:17,102
...Ram & Laxman here talk with me..

828
01:02:17,768 --> 01:02:19,543
Whether you're a man or a woman..

829
01:02:19,603 --> 01:02:22,015
...there's only one treatment
for traitors.

830
01:02:22,105 --> 01:02:24,551
So tell me straight..

831
01:02:24,608 --> 01:02:28,920
...or I'll whack you so hard you'll
forget your mother and father

832
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,650
Rajasthanwhat?

833
01:02:31,715 --> 01:02:32,785
Speak loudly.

834
01:02:33,283 --> 01:02:35,285
Money. Rajasthan.
- Lets go..

835
01:02:36,553 --> 01:02:37,930
We can't go like this?
- Why?

836
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,295
We'll reach heaven before
we get to Rajasthan.

837
01:02:40,824 --> 01:02:41,962
Have you heard of pneumonia?

838
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,094
Nothing will happen to you.

839
01:02:44,227 --> 01:02:45,865
Nothing will happen
to you Bheem Singh!

840
01:02:46,062 --> 01:02:47,939
But we don't bathe in
the Ganges everyday.

841
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:49,304
Lets go after our clothes dry.

842
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:53,138
Alright. I'll be back in 5 minutes.

843
01:02:57,841 --> 01:02:59,616
We are those that sleep
in peace.. lala..

844
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:01,950
Excuse me.. can you dry this, please..

845
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:05,582
I'm not your grandfather's
slave - Please ..

846
01:03:08,251 --> 01:03:10,731
You've destroyed this entire country
with your 'please, please'. Give..

847
01:03:10,887 --> 01:03:13,333
And this.. - Yuck! ..what is this?
- Bra..

848
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:15,331
I know that. I'm not
going to touch it.

849
01:03:15,725 --> 01:03:17,227
You don't dry your vest?

850
01:03:17,327 --> 01:03:19,807
Yes I do but I'm not going
to.. this.. good Lord!

851
01:03:19,863 --> 01:03:22,036
This is like a vest for us.

852
01:03:22,232 --> 01:03:23,336
There's hardly anything
to be coy about.

853
01:03:23,867 --> 01:03:26,609
When there are posters with women in
tiny bikinis displayed all over..

854
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:29,014
...I'm sure you have a good look.

855
01:03:29,106 --> 01:03:31,347
I'm not that type, understand?

856
01:03:31,608 --> 01:03:35,351
Ah.. so what type are you?
The other type?

857
01:03:38,749 --> 01:03:40,854
No, not the other type either.
Put it here.

858
01:03:44,621 --> 01:03:48,364
These people wear all kinds of
weird things. Hey! ..dry this.

859
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:52,169
Haha! Why? ls there an electric
current going through?

860
01:03:52,295 --> 01:03:54,639
Ayee.. quiet. Shut up!

861
01:03:54,698 --> 01:03:56,371
I won't tolerate all this chatter,
you understand?

862
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:59,837
I'll give you one tight whack and
then everything will be understood.

863
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:01,649
Now dry your clothes quickly and come.

864
01:04:01,805 --> 01:04:03,375
I'm waiting there.. Move it.

865
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:10,954
Haha! Foool...!!!

866
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:13,385
Jimmy..

867
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:14,720
What?

868
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:16,857
Can we start again please?

869
01:04:19,656 --> 01:04:20,726
Huh?

870
01:04:21,024 --> 01:04:23,368
Take me.. with you.

871
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:25,400
There's enough for the two of us.

872
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,676
Remember what you said..in
this country..

873
01:04:28,732 --> 01:04:34,410
...If you have the money and a little
smartness, you'll never get caught.

874
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:45,418
I've got the money and
you've got the brain.

875
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:51,995
Just you, me and 25 crores!

876
01:04:54,324 --> 01:04:55,701
How many times do you think..

877
01:04:55,759 --> 01:04:57,363
...you can make a fool out of me
with the same bloody lollypop?

878
01:05:04,134 --> 01:05:06,080
You'll have to be alive
to become a fool..

879
01:05:06,703 --> 01:05:07,773
Huh?

880
01:05:08,371 --> 01:05:09,441
What do you think?

881
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:11,715
After Bhaiyyaji gets his money back..

882
01:05:11,775 --> 01:05:13,083
...he's going to give us character
certificates and bid us farewell?

883
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:14,847
Do you even know his name?

884
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:20,023
Lakhan Singh Ballebaaz, aka Bhaiyyaji.

885
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:23,728
He would get his picture
printed on the currency..

886
01:05:23,787 --> 01:05:26,233
...notes instead of Gandhi-ji,
if he could.

887
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:27,860
He's a terror.

888
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:31,265
Cricket bats, hockey sticks,
football shoes and

889
01:05:32,462 --> 01:05:37,172
even tennis rackets are his murder
weapons. Do you know why?

890
01:05:38,301 --> 01:05:39,905
'Coz killing people is
his favorite sport!

891
01:05:40,003 --> 01:05:42,483
The entire river's dried up
but your clothes haven't?

892
01:05:42,872 --> 01:05:45,182
As if its Draupadi's saree
that just won't dry.

893
01:05:45,976 --> 01:05:49,753
Useless freaks..their English
clothes don't seem to dry only.

894
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:52,760
And now I've got to piss..
Where can I go?

895
01:05:58,989 --> 01:06:03,870
If anyone can save us from Bhaiyyaji,
its him. Captain wallop.

896
01:06:04,394 --> 01:06:07,500
Him?.. Mr. By-the-banks-of-the-Ganges?

897
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:10,503
If he's on our side,
we might just escape.

898
01:06:11,001 --> 01:06:12,503
But why would he be on our side?

899
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:22,220
He knows about us. Same lollypop..
and the same trick.

900
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:25,319
But the fool's different.

901
01:06:27,384 --> 01:06:29,864
Wow! You've actually become smart
after being made a fool!

902
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:34,197
I was good for you. But now what?

903
01:06:34,958 --> 01:06:37,529
Now I am going to rape you

904
01:06:40,797 --> 01:06:41,867
Nice

905
01:06:54,978 --> 01:06:56,980
One sec let me .. umm ..er ..

906
01:06:57,080 --> 01:07:04,191
Help! How dare you try to
de-flower me? Bachchan!

907
01:07:04,287 --> 01:07:07,928
Help!! Please leave
me for God's sake..

908
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:11,562
Why would I leave such a good
thing for God. Haha!!

909
01:07:13,830 --> 01:07:14,934
You're overacting

910
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:16,101
You are over critical

911
01:07:16,933 --> 01:07:18,913
Please.. help!!

912
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:21,914
Shameless woman, I'll teach
such a lesson that..

913
01:07:25,008 --> 01:07:29,081
No matter how shameless a woman is,
a lady's honor is still honor.

914
01:07:29,212 --> 01:07:30,953
This is none of your
business Bachchan.

915
01:07:32,082 --> 01:07:34,392
And she does not have any honor
whatsoever, she's a bloody bitch.

916
01:07:34,484 --> 01:07:37,431
You know the mess I'm in because
of her...? You know...!

917
01:07:37,587 --> 01:07:39,430
You're not an angel either..

918
01:07:40,523 --> 01:07:45,165
You can have her too. She's quite
hot. Hey.. I don't mind.

919
01:07:48,365 --> 01:07:49,969
What happened? Broke a tooth?

920
01:07:51,134 --> 01:07:58,313
Didn't even shake, loser.
I hate you Pooja.. bitch!

921
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:03,348
Are your clothes dry?

922
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:04,948
Why don't you check?

923
01:08:18,895 --> 01:08:21,341
You see this woman. She's
a not nice girl..

924
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:23,542
Very bad girl, I'm telling you

925
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:32,446
Down, down..

926
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:34,114
What happened?
- Police.

927
01:08:34,911 --> 01:08:36,982
How do you know? That man had
come to the call centre.

928
01:08:37,047 --> 01:08:38,458
He knows Bhaiyyaji's entire history

929
01:08:39,916 --> 01:08:41,088
Where's my phone gone?

930
01:08:42,085 --> 01:08:43,155
Shhhhh.. Shhhh..

931
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:51,297
Speaking

932
01:08:51,928 --> 01:08:53,066
Good evening Bhaiyyaji

933
01:08:54,030 --> 01:08:55,668
Have you found that unfaithful bitch?

934
01:08:56,666 --> 01:08:57,940
(Aside) Now if I knew
this much English,

935
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,604
I would've been in the IPS or IAS.

936
01:09:00,336 --> 01:09:02,009
(Into phone) Umm.. Bhaiyyaji,
can you please speak louder?

937
01:09:02,105 --> 01:09:03,948
Have you found the bastard
lady, Pooja Singh?

938
01:09:04,307 --> 01:09:06,082
Have you found Pooja?
That traitor woman?

939
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:07,245
I have found her.

940
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:08,380
Yes, yes Bhaiyyaji.

941
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:09,957
Going to collect the money which
she's hidden in Rajasthan.

942
01:09:10,046 --> 01:09:11,116
But there's a small problem.

943
01:09:11,181 --> 01:09:13,491
The master-ji seems to have
recognized a police officer here.

944
01:09:13,683 --> 01:09:15,390
His name is ACP Hooda.

945
01:09:16,185 --> 01:09:20,691
He's dangerous..has been on
my back for some time now.

946
01:09:22,959 --> 01:09:24,597
Bhaiyyaji if you like, I
could get rid of him..

947
01:09:24,961 --> 01:09:29,273
Tsk.. tsk.. Stay away from
him Bachchan. It's risky.

948
01:09:29,699 --> 01:09:31,508
Don't get seen by him, okay?

949
01:09:31,701 --> 01:09:35,513
Okay. I want_ed t9 ask you _one__
question Bhalyyajl.. er..Bhalyyajl

950
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:37,982
Haha! Bachchan, are you
thinking I am one..

951
01:09:38,041 --> 01:09:43,616
...of the contestants of Who
wants to be a millionaire???

952
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:49,394
What are you meant for? Huh?

953
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:56,627
Eating cherry pie? Don't ask
questions, answer first.

954
01:10:03,166 --> 01:10:05,737
Baby, you carry on

955
01:10:11,675 --> 01:10:14,019
Haha! He's saying that you are very..

956
01:10:14,077 --> 01:10:15,750
Shut up schmuck.

957
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:19,251
I don't need to understand the
language to know what he just said.

958
01:10:19,349 --> 01:10:21,454
Don't teach me, useless fool.

959
01:10:22,085 --> 01:10:23,496
He has a habit of interrupting people.

960
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:28,127
You keep quiet, slut. Hey Bachchan,
keep her away from me or..

961
01:10:28,525 --> 01:10:30,766
Or what Jeetuuuuu???

962
01:10:31,094 --> 01:10:32,539
Bachchan will break your arm and..

963
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:33,767
...throw it into the gutter
Jeetenderrrrrr!

964
01:10:36,366 --> 01:10:40,041
Hey.. hey.. stop. Stop it ..

965
01:10:40,103 --> 01:10:44,677
...stop this cat & dog fight
or I give you both one each..

966
01:10:44,741 --> 01:10:46,243
Aaah.. I hate you
- Piss off.

967
01:10:55,819 --> 01:10:58,163
Hey lady..why are you
cutting your jeans?

968
01:10:59,055 --> 01:11:02,366
Hey..why are you cutting your jeans??

969
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:05,530
Tashan

970
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:16,344
Now don't think I was staring

971
01:11:17,307 --> 01:11:20,186
Why? Am I that bad?

972
01:11:46,536 --> 01:11:48,209
Any clues?
- No Sir.

973
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:51,581
Hooda.. here? How??

974
01:11:51,674 --> 01:11:52,744
Who Buddha?

975
01:11:52,842 --> 01:11:54,583
Not Buddha, ACP Hooda. Come on, run.

976
01:11:54,677 --> 01:11:57,419
I want those three. These
are useless, let them go.

977
01:11:59,349 --> 01:12:01,124
Okay, move it..Come on hurry up!

978
01:12:03,453 --> 01:12:04,864
Move it.. move it..
- Run.. run..

979
01:12:08,124 --> 01:12:10,570
Namastey. Namastey..Hi Namastey.

980
01:12:11,127 --> 01:12:13,334
Whoa..
- Oooo .. Jesus

981
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:14,702
Check every bed, bag and box.

982
01:12:14,764 --> 01:12:16,641
Tapad, check those black boxes.

983
01:12:16,866 --> 01:12:18,436
Can't trust these rascals
for a second.

984
01:12:18,568 --> 01:12:21,879
All the equipment should be here.
Why it hasn't reached man?

985
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:23,514
Come on just send the extras.

986
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:24,710
What program are you making?

987
01:12:24,807 --> 01:12:28,880
Sir, shooting sir.. of an English
film. Hollywood sir, Hollywood.

988
01:12:29,612 --> 01:12:31,353
Hey.. prodigy of Spielberg.

989
01:12:31,481 --> 01:12:32,551
Have you joined Hollywood?

990
01:12:33,149 --> 01:12:37,723
Speak in a language that
you know. Speak in Hindi.

991
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:38,890
Sir, I have all permissions with me.

992
01:12:39,155 --> 01:12:41,260
You can check. They're
very famous people.

993
01:12:41,491 --> 01:12:42,799
Please don't kill me , please.

994
01:12:43,159 --> 01:12:44,638
I am a friend of India.
I'm making a movie.

995
01:12:44,727 --> 01:12:45,797
Its.. its called Holy Widows.

996
01:12:45,895 --> 01:12:47,806
It's a good movie, it's
not like the other crap.

997
01:12:47,897 --> 01:12:50,605
It's definitely going to be
nominated for the Oscars.

998
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:55,181
He says that he's making a
film called Holy Widows..

999
01:12:55,238 --> 01:12:56,911
...and is a friend of India.

1000
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,251
Tell him we're going
to be in his film.

1001
01:12:59,442 --> 01:13:00,921
We are going to be in your movie.

1002
01:13:01,477 --> 01:13:02,547
Doing what?

1003
01:13:02,645 --> 01:13:03,715
What will we do?

1004
01:13:03,813 --> 01:13:04,917
Sing a song, what else?

1005
01:13:05,181 --> 01:13:06,251
Singing a song

1006
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:08,290
There is no song in my film

1007
01:13:08,551 --> 01:13:09,621
He says there's no song in his film.

1008
01:13:09,686 --> 01:13:10,756
Now there is!

1009
01:13:10,853 --> 01:13:13,663
Dude this is India. There
is song for everything.

1010
01:13:22,198 --> 01:13:27,198
<i>TI</i>

1011
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:07,478
When I see a white white face

1012
01:14:07,677 --> 01:14:09,657
My heart begins to race

1013
01:14:09,712 --> 01:14:13,990
I'm hitting on you in any case!

1014
01:14:22,592 --> 01:14:24,629
When I see a white white face

01:14:24,694 --> 01:14:26,332
My heart begins to race

1016

I'm hitting on you in any case!

1017
01:14:29,065 --> 01:14:31,807
When I see a white white face

01:14:33,269 --> 01:14:35,271
When I see a white white face

1019
01:14:35,338 --> 01:14:37,284
My heart begins to race

1020

I'm hitting on you in any case!

1021
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:40,748
Oh very, Oh very

1022

Oh very happy in my heart

1023
01:14:43,846 --> 01:14:45,553
It dances away

1024
01:14:45,715 --> 01:14:47,626
Very happy in my heart

1025
01:14:47,683 --> 01:14:49,822
It dances away

1026
01:14:49,886 --> 01:14:51,024
It dances

1027
01:14:51,087 --> 01:14:52,498
It dances

1028
01:14:52,555 --> 01:14:54,501
It dances in a sway

1029
01:14:54,557 --> 01:14:56,730
Oh happy in my heart

1030
01:14:56,792 --> 01:14:58,772
It dances away

1031
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:31,027
Oh can't stop my feet..

1032
01:15:32,995 --> 01:15:37,569
Can't stop my feet, oh
this tormenting beat

1033
01:15:39,635 --> 01:15:43,344
I just can't stop my feet,
it is like torture sweet

1034
01:15:43,406 --> 01:15:45,352
Standing steadfast in
the scorching heat

1035
01:15:45,408 --> 01:15:47,410
Locked is our gaze as we meet

1036
01:15:47,477 --> 01:15:49,582
Don't hide your feelings

1037
01:15:49,645 --> 01:15:52,489
Tell me of these sweet tidings

1038
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:54,084
Oh very, Oh very

1039

Oh as pink as a rose, your cheek glows

1049
01:16:34,657 --> 01:16:38,833
As blue as the sky,
your eyes make me fly

1050
01:16:38,961 --> 01:16:41,464
A face as pure as the untouched moon

1051
01:16:41,531 --> 01:16:43,477
And hair as black as a cloud in June

1052
01:16:43,532 --> 01:16:48,072
I can't hide it any further, my
heart beats for you with fervor

1053
01:16:48,137 --> 01:16:49,844
Oh my heart beats for you

1054
01:16:49,906 --> 01:16:52,147
Louder every time you're in view

1055
01:16:52,742 --> 01:16:56,053
For the premier of your
heart, one chance

1056
01:16:59,081 --> 01:17:05,498
I'll buy out the theatre
by booking advance

1057
01:17:07,757 --> 01:17:09,862
Yes, for the premier of my heart

1058
01:17:09,926 --> 01:17:15,501
Of the booking, many want part!

1059
01:17:15,564 --> 01:17:17,441
Oh very, Oh very

1060

Oh very happy in my heart,
it dances away

Very happy in my heart, it dances away

1062
01:17:26,242 --> 01:17:27,949
Oh it dances

1063

It dances

1064
01:17:29,212 --> 01:17:31,192
It dances in a sway

1065
01:17:31,247 --> 01:17:35,525
Oh happy in my heart, it dances away

1066
01:17:35,585 --> 01:17:37,690
When I see a white white face

01:17:37,753 --> 01:17:39,664
My heart begins to race

1068

I'm hitting on you in any case!

1069

It dances

1079
01:18:04,614 --> 01:18:05,786
It dances

1080
01:18:05,848 --> 01:18:07,623
It dances in a sway

1081
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:11,153
Oh happy in my heart, it dances away

1082

01:18:24,166 --> 01:18:29,946
Oh very, very happy in my
heart, it dances away

1086
01:18:38,581 --> 01:18:42,654
Hey Olga.. if you are ever in
Bombay .. What is your problem?

1087
01:18:43,586 --> 01:18:44,656

you are a huge star

1092
01:18:53,796 --> 01:18:55,275
I told him you're Amitabh Bachchan.

1093
01:18:55,598 --> 01:18:58,272
Listen, if you're ever in L.A,
please give me a call.

1094
01:18:58,334 --> 01:19:04,615
We'll do lunch okay. Thanks,
thanks really.

1095
01:19:05,541 --> 01:19:07,543
Hey, hey Harvey! Ya .. Guess what man?

1096
01:19:07,610 --> 01:19:11,148
We got a song. For Holy Widows.
Stars this huge Indian star.

1097
01:19:11,213 --> 01:19:12,283
You are going to love it.

1098
01:19:27,730 --> 01:19:34,306
I had never seen a girl
so close.. felt strange.

1099
01:19:36,639 --> 01:19:40,086
People look so innocent when they're
asleep.. just like children.

1100
01:19:41,143 --> 01:19:43,714
She looked like she
couldn't hurt a fly..

1101
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:45,591
I don't know why I wished that she'd..

1102
01:19:45,648 --> 01:19:47,184
...keep sleeping on my
shoulder.. forever

1103
01:19:47,650 --> 01:19:49,596
And I'd keep sitting here forever.

1104
01:20:08,104 --> 01:20:09,276
Good .. good.

1105
01:20:10,039 --> 01:20:11,109
You didn't sleep?

1106
01:20:14,210 --> 01:20:16,622
If I had slept, you would've
run away again!

1107
01:20:20,616 --> 01:20:22,254
No, if I run now, I'll run with you.

1108
01:20:22,618 --> 01:20:25,360
I get a really good sleep
on your shoulder!

1109
01:20:31,227 --> 01:20:34,333
Pooja, I think you've messed up your
life after falling into bad company.

1110
01:20:40,636 --> 01:20:43,139
Sometimes, what's right for you
can be wrong for someone else.

1111
01:20:43,639 --> 01:20:45,380
Now Bhaiyyaji may be a big don..

1112
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:48,788
...but when he takes
Pooja Singh's name..

1113
01:20:49,712 --> 01:20:51,123
...he'll take it with a little respect.

1114
01:20:57,186 --> 01:20:58,256
Are you married?

1115
01:21:02,791 --> 01:21:07,206
Will you marry me? I'm serious..
this is not a joke.

1116
01:21:09,165 --> 01:21:10,235
Will you elope with me?

1117
01:21:24,347 --> 01:21:29,763
Pooja has a rare quality and it's a
quality in very successful people.

1118
01:21:30,753 --> 01:21:32,426
She never wastes any time.

1119
01:21:34,023 --> 01:21:38,768
Bachchan I'm not scared of
Bhaiyyaji.. if you are with me.

1120
01:21:41,096 --> 01:21:42,200
But are you with me??

1121
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:44,768
Twenty-five crores is a lot of money.

1122
01:21:47,102 --> 01:21:51,983
And I'm the bonus!

1123
01:21:58,047 --> 01:22:02,996
The further you go away from
me, the closer I'll come.

1124
01:22:03,919 --> 01:22:08,732
Night eyes.. your black night eyes.

1125
01:22:08,857 --> 01:22:11,098
Pooja, can you hear
that groaning sound?

1126
01:22:13,295 --> 01:22:17,471
Night eyes, night eyes,
your black night eyes.

1127
01:22:18,067 --> 01:22:23,073
Your eyes, your eyes, biting,
biting black eyes.

1128
01:22:23,138 --> 01:22:28,486
Night eyes, night eyes,
your black night eyes.

1129
01:22:28,744 --> 01:22:30,985
Guruji, sing with me!

1130
01:22:31,347 --> 01:22:36,820
Your eyes, your eyes, biting,
biting black eyes!

1131
01:22:36,886 --> 01:22:40,959
Hello my dear Pooja! Welcome, welcome!

1132
01:22:41,424 --> 01:22:47,238
First you did Guruji, and now
you're doing Bachchan also?

1133
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:49,271
Good afternoon Bhaiyyaji.

1134
01:22:49,331 --> 01:22:55,213
God bless you son. About Pooja
one thing is fantastic.

1135
01:22:56,172 --> 01:23:00,780
Money stealing by fraud..

1136
01:23:00,843 --> 01:23:05,849
...and then hiding it in beautiful
places. Pooja money where is?

1137
01:23:51,093 --> 01:23:54,040
Hey Misir, I'll bet you 500?

1138
01:23:54,329 --> 01:23:55,467
For what?

1139
01:23:56,165 --> 01:23:57,838
After getting the money..

1140
01:23:57,900 --> 01:24:00,005
...Bhaiyyaji will first blow Ms.
Pooja's brain out, and then Gurujis.

1141
01:24:00,402 --> 01:24:04,441
You idiot, you've spent so much time
with Bhaiyyaji.. He's going first.

1142
01:24:04,507 --> 01:24:05,918
So make it a 1000 then?

1143
01:24:07,309 --> 01:24:10,188
You enjoy losing, don't you?!

1144
01:24:11,513 --> 01:24:12,583
We'll see..

1145
01:24:15,117 --> 01:24:16,596
It looks too small

1146
01:24:17,853 --> 01:24:18,923
It's one crore

1147
01:24:19,188 --> 01:24:21,930
You stole twenty-five,
and are returning one?

1148
01:24:22,925 --> 01:24:26,338
I have learnt a couple things
while working with you.

1149
01:24:27,229 --> 01:24:28,606
The money is in different places.

1150
01:24:30,065 --> 01:24:32,944
Very good! How many places?

1151
01:24:33,368 --> 01:24:34,438
Seven

1152
01:24:34,503 --> 01:24:35,573
Why only seven?

1153
01:24:37,539 --> 01:24:38,609
Tashan

1154
01:24:40,542 --> 01:24:46,049
Very slick Pooja! I
am a fan of Tashan.

1155
01:24:48,150 --> 01:24:51,620
Now listen to my Tashan.

1156
01:24:53,322 --> 01:25:00,069
I want every dime of mine
back to me in seven days.

1157
01:25:03,565 --> 01:25:04,908
Seven days is not enough.

1158
01:25:07,403 --> 01:25:15,652
Pooja, you bring me my money, or you
won't live to see another day.

1159
01:25:31,927 --> 01:25:34,430
The foreign delegation is
coming in seven days.

1160
01:25:35,531 --> 01:25:38,944
The money should be with me by then.

1161
01:25:39,935 --> 01:25:45,476
You go with them, and after
you've got all the money..

1162
01:25:46,208 --> 01:25:50,350
...finish both of them.

1163
01:25:57,286 --> 01:25:59,357
You will become a part
of Bhaiyyaji Eleven!

1164
01:26:01,623 --> 01:26:03,159
I'll get a suit made for you.

1165
01:26:04,293 --> 01:26:09,641
But, if anything goes wrong, I'll
be playing cricket with your balls.

1166
01:26:11,366 --> 01:26:13,437
What happened? Not happy?

1167
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:18,046
Bhaiyyaji, there couldn't
be a happier moment for me.

1168
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:19,710
Please smile then.

1169
01:26:50,072 --> 01:26:51,574
Officers.. surround them.
Seal the area.

1170
01:26:52,074 --> 01:26:53,144
Cover them completely.

1171
01:27:20,569 --> 01:27:21,775
Get down.

1172
01:27:31,313 --> 01:27:32,792
The bloody bullets always finish
just when you need them.

1173
01:27:33,115 --> 01:27:35,618
Don't worry Bachchan.

1174
01:27:46,728 --> 01:27:47,798
STOP!

1175
01:27:48,397 --> 01:27:51,310
Bhaiyyaji, I know you're
out of bullets.

1176
01:27:52,067 --> 01:27:55,139
Surrender now if you know
what's good for you.

1177
01:28:08,517 --> 01:28:09,689
Bastard

1178
01:28:14,556 --> 01:28:16,092
Go Bachchan.

1179
01:28:16,492 --> 01:28:19,166
Bachchan Bachchan Pande

1180
01:28:19,228 --> 01:28:22,175
He'll show you the night
in broad daylight

1181
01:28:22,231 --> 01:28:25,110
Bachchan, Bachchan Pande

1182
01:28:25,167 --> 01:28:28,114
Bachchan, Bachchan Pande

1183
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:46,131
Pooja, here.

1184
01:28:51,726 --> 01:28:54,138
I am the spectrum that leaves you dumb

1185
01:28:54,663 --> 01:28:57,872
Pay heed to the words
of Bachchan Pande

1186
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:00,874
I am the victor whose words are numb

1187
01:29:00,936 --> 01:29:03,473
A, B,C,D.. I am an atom bomb

1188
01:29:03,739 --> 01:29:06,345
From the banks of the
Ganges extends my fame

1189
01:29:06,642 --> 01:29:09,384
Bachchan Pande is my name

1190
01:29:09,678 --> 01:29:12,420
I row my boat that can
any current tame

1191
01:29:12,481 --> 01:29:15,826
And for all my credits
I solely take blame

1192
01:29:50,853 --> 01:29:51,923
Should I kill you

1193
01:29:53,655 --> 01:29:54,929
It'd be nicer if you don't.

1194
01:29:59,861 --> 01:30:02,467
Alright, something you
can remember me for!

1195
01:30:03,532 --> 01:30:06,445
Sucker..taking the easy way out again.

1196
01:30:06,869 --> 01:30:11,409
You're the one who said you're
safest next to the enemy.

1197
01:30:11,473 --> 01:30:13,714
That day I ran straight to Hooda.

1198
01:30:14,543 --> 01:30:16,216
The police were looking
for me because..

1199
01:30:16,278 --> 01:30:18,724
...I had leaked the information
from the call centre.

1200
01:30:19,281 --> 01:30:21,591
But I wasn't as worried about the
police as I was about Bhaiyyaji.

1201
01:30:22,350 --> 01:30:24,227
Hooda told me that the
only way out of..

1202
01:30:24,286 --> 01:30:25,560
...the mess was to help the
police to catch Bhaiyyaji,

1203
01:30:25,621 --> 01:30:26,964
by surrendering myself to him.

1204
01:30:27,656 --> 01:30:31,934
He said it was my only hope
and I knew he was right.

1205
01:30:34,496 --> 01:30:36,840
By the way, why were your
men shooting at me?

1206
01:30:36,898 --> 01:30:39,469
That's 'coz nobody else knows
you're working for the police.

1207
01:30:40,369 --> 01:30:41,973
Oh, like top secret stuff
eh? Really cool!

1208
01:30:44,306 --> 01:30:45,376
So nobody else knows?

1209
01:30:46,408 --> 01:30:48,854
Tell me, does Bhaiyyaji have any
idea that you work for us?

1210
01:30:49,578 --> 01:30:52,252
After I saw you in Ladakh, I
created such a big noise..

1211
01:30:52,314 --> 01:30:54,260
...that it seemed as though you were
chasing me, and not Bhaiyyaji!

1212
01:30:55,784 --> 01:30:58,594
The world to me is a
blind and dark place

1213
01:30:58,820 --> 01:31:01,426
I'm like the wind throwing
smoke in your face

1214
01:31:01,857 --> 01:31:04,633
No deed do I do that makes
me fall from grace

1215
01:31:04,693 --> 01:31:07,674
If you blabber too much, you'll
be struck by my mace

1216
01:31:13,669 --> 01:31:16,343
The soil by the Ganges is
full of my fame's grain

1217
01:31:16,405 --> 01:31:19,750
I am Bachchan Pande,
the sane and insane

1218
01:32:22,571 --> 01:32:24,812
Ah.. it seems like we've almost
cornered Bhaiyyaji! Cool.

1219
01:32:24,873 --> 01:32:25,943
Where are you going?

1220
01:32:26,007 --> 01:32:27,077
I'm coming with you.

1221
01:32:27,142 --> 01:32:28,849
No.. you wait here. Why?

1222
01:32:28,910 --> 01:32:31,982
You see, you are a delicate
darling from the call centre.

1223
01:32:32,414 --> 01:32:34,360
Now if someone were to shove
a gun on you like this..

1224
01:32:34,416 --> 01:32:37,090
...you'll be peeing in your pants.

1225
01:32:37,352 --> 01:32:38,558
All this bloodshed..

1226
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:51,636
Hello Prince Charlie!
Saving your life..

1227
01:32:53,702 --> 01:32:56,911
...yours affectionately,
the Bhaiyyaji!!

1228
01:34:04,439 --> 01:34:08,444
Hooda was dead. There were only
two people in this story..

1229
01:34:08,510 --> 01:34:11,514
...that were not criminals,
ACP K S Hooda and me.

1230
01:34:12,113 --> 01:34:14,787
But now, to stay alive,
I had to be like them

1231
01:34:15,450 --> 01:34:16,793
Dangerous..

1232
01:34:19,521 --> 01:34:20,966
Cunning..

1233
01:34:24,125 --> 01:34:25,695
And a Kanpuriya.

1234
01:35:10,839 --> 01:35:16,016
Prayers

1235
01:35:16,077 --> 01:35:17,147
Smelling nice

1236
01:35:18,179 --> 01:35:19,249
Not for you

1237
01:35:19,581 --> 01:35:22,790
Listen whatever you want
to do, do it tonight.

1238
01:35:23,184 --> 01:35:24,254
Why?

1239
01:35:24,953 --> 01:35:28,526
Because if you make friends with the
hangman, hanging might be smoother.

1240
01:35:30,925 --> 01:35:32,131
Bachchan is our hangman?

1241
01:35:32,193 --> 01:35:36,835
Yes, I heard Bhaiyyaji
speaking to him.

1242
01:35:37,599 --> 01:35:43,606
So.. whatever you plan on doing,
do it now, babes!

1243
01:35:53,214 --> 01:35:56,127
It's so dark, I could hardly make
out the east from the west.

1244
01:35:57,152 --> 01:35:58,290
You pray everyday?

1245
01:35:59,888 --> 01:36:02,129
Normally, early in the morning,
not in the evening.

1246
01:36:02,757 --> 01:36:03,963
So what do you do in the evenings?

1247
01:36:04,893 --> 01:36:07,134
I drink.. okay?

1248
01:36:44,199 --> 01:36:45,610
Now don't presume that just because
I've had two drinks with you..

1249
01:36:45,667 --> 01:36:47,613
...It means that I'm on your side.

1250
01:36:49,170 --> 01:36:51,343
The nonsense you've
done with Bhaiyyaji

1251
01:36:52,674 --> 01:36:54,085
doesn't deserve forgiveness.

1252
01:36:54,275 --> 01:36:56,619
And you need not imagine that just
because I'm sitting with you..

1253
01:36:56,678 --> 01:36:59,682
...It means that I'll listen
to anything you say.

1254
01:37:00,949 --> 01:37:04,192
Given one chance and I'll be
out of here, money and all!

1255
01:37:04,252 --> 01:37:05,322
I know.

1256
01:37:11,059 --> 01:37:12,629
Anyway, this place is quite beautiful

1257
01:37:13,228 --> 01:37:14,298
And me?

1258
01:37:15,964 --> 01:37:17,170
And I'm not beautiful?

1259
01:37:17,232 --> 01:37:19,644
Of course you're beautiful,
very beautiful.

1260
01:37:20,835 --> 01:37:21,905
Liar!

1261
01:37:21,970 --> 01:37:23,040
I swear.

1262
01:37:23,104 --> 01:37:24,174
Swear on whom?

1263
01:37:24,238 --> 01:37:26,240
I swear on my aunt, on Omprakash,
on electricity.

1264
01:37:28,309 --> 01:37:30,789
Swearing on aunts and uncles
doesn't mean anything.

1265
01:37:30,845 --> 01:37:31,915
Really?

1266
01:37:32,113 --> 01:37:35,651
You only swear on someone that
you can't live without.

1267
01:37:36,985 --> 01:37:39,659
Someone on whom you can't bear
to see the slightest scratch

1268
01:37:42,724 --> 01:37:43,862
ls there anyone like this?

1269
01:37:53,201 --> 01:37:58,844
I can only swear on one person
Pooja, but I won't.

1270
01:38:04,012 --> 01:38:05,082
What are you looking at?

1271
01:38:08,283 --> 01:38:09,353
A cycle.

1272
01:38:11,319 --> 01:38:13,697
She rode her cycle in such fury..

1273
01:38:13,755 --> 01:38:16,167
...It moved with the
speed of a jet plane!

1274
01:38:20,228 --> 01:38:22,367
Hey.. why hasn't the electricity
come back yet?

1275
01:38:23,031 --> 01:38:24,442
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

1276
01:38:25,266 --> 01:38:26,438
How much longer?

1277
01:38:26,768 --> 01:38:29,044
How do I know what this
wire has in mind?

1278
01:38:29,104 --> 01:38:30,708
When the electricity returns..

1279
01:38:30,772 --> 01:38:31,876
...It will get to your house
automatically, okay.

1280
01:38:34,776 --> 01:38:36,778
Hey.. why'd you remove the air?

1281
01:38:36,911 --> 01:38:39,721
When the electricity returns
and comes to my house..

1282
01:38:39,781 --> 01:38:42,455
...the air will automatically
fill up, okay??

1283
01:38:43,384 --> 01:38:44,727
I had been stealing electricity
for seven years..

1284
01:38:44,786 --> 01:38:47,426
...but that was the first
time I got a shock.

1285
01:38:47,722 --> 01:38:48,792
It felt good.

1286
01:38:49,390 --> 01:38:51,734
I felt as though I could
handle shocks like this..

1287
01:38:51,793 --> 01:38:54,273
...for the rest of my
life for this girl.

1288
01:39:13,948 --> 01:39:15,757
She used to live right opposite..

1289
01:39:15,817 --> 01:39:17,888
...the vegetable market,
and I didn't know her.

1290
01:39:18,820 --> 01:39:21,426
But I wanted to know her.

1291
01:40:04,132 --> 01:40:06,203
Electricity.. er.. is
electricity coming?

1292
01:40:06,334 --> 01:40:10,282
Silly goose, the sun is bright and
shining. There's light everywhere!

1293
01:40:13,208 --> 01:40:16,314
You want some? Won't
cry now, will you?

1294
01:40:17,946 --> 01:40:27,230
Here.. eat.

1295
01:40:28,423 --> 01:40:30,425
That day I could've eaten
a zillion chillies.

1296
01:40:30,491 --> 01:40:32,129
Gudiyaaa.. Coming..

1297
01:40:32,193 --> 01:40:38,166
...because that was the day
I learnt her name. Gudiya!

1298
01:40:40,268 --> 01:40:41,338
Hey" Si")! 900se!!

1299
01:40:42,170 --> 01:40:45,845
Silly goose, your brain's loose!
You're just a bag of juice!

1300
01:40:45,907 --> 01:40:49,855
She didn't know my name but I didn't
mind being a silly goose..

1301
01:40:49,911 --> 01:40:54,860
...or an idiot or even
a donkey for her.

1302
01:40:54,916 --> 01:40:58,591
Silly goose, your brain's loose!
You're just a bag of juice!

1303
01:40:58,853 --> 01:41:01,026
Silly goose, your brain's loose!
- Silly goose, brain's loose..

1304
01:41:01,089 --> 01:41:02,591
You're just a bag of juice!

1305
01:41:04,926 --> 01:41:07,236
Hey silly goose, this
is an all-girls school.

1306
01:41:07,295 --> 01:41:09,866
I know that.
- Did you follow me here?

1307
01:41:09,931 --> 01:41:12,377
Yes.. I mean no.. ummm..
What's your name?

1308
01:41:12,534 --> 01:41:13,604
Gudiya!

1309
01:41:14,001 --> 01:41:16,208
I mean what is your school name?

1310
01:41:16,871 --> 01:41:23,083
Kumari Udiyan School. I'll meet
after school and tell you!

1311
01:41:23,878 --> 01:41:24,948
Where?

1312
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:26,486
At the old ghats.

1313
01:41:28,416 --> 01:41:32,193
It was not yet time for school to
be out, but I went there early.

1314
01:41:32,487 --> 01:41:33,898
I had decided that come what may..

1315
01:41:33,955 --> 01:41:36,094
...I was going to find out
Gudiya's real name today.

1316
01:41:36,457 --> 01:41:38,368
And as soon as she'd tell me her name,

1317
01:41:38,426 --> 01:41:41,100
I'll give her bangles.. pink bangles.

1318
01:41:41,362 --> 01:41:42,432
Hey

1319
01:41:43,564 --> 01:41:45,475
It's him, he's the one.

1320
01:41:45,533 --> 01:41:47,137
Been stealing electricity
have you, smarty pants?

1321
01:41:49,237 --> 01:41:50,307
Hey"

1322
01:41:50,371 --> 01:41:52,180
Yes.. the electricity
department is ours.

1323
01:41:52,307 --> 01:41:53,377
If anyone steals from it, we will.

1324
01:41:54,476 --> 01:41:55,546
Get up scoundrel..

1325
01:42:05,587 --> 01:42:08,466
I think he bled a couple
liters of blood.

1326
01:42:10,124 --> 01:42:11,933
I'm not sure but thanks to that..

1327
01:42:11,992 --> 01:42:13,562
...I spent the next two
years in the remand home.

1328
01:42:15,529 --> 01:42:18,203
When I came back, there was no
sign of Gudiya or her house

1329
01:42:18,933 --> 01:42:21,004
I heard later that it was
actually her aunt's house.

1330
01:42:23,571 --> 01:42:25,016
I looked for her everywhere
desperately..

1331
01:42:27,275 --> 01:42:28,948
...but I didn't even know her name..

1332
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:35,617
...or where she was from.
She just disappeared.

1333
01:42:36,951 --> 01:42:43,698
Since that day I sometimes call
myself a silly goose. Makes me smile.

1334
01:42:47,228 --> 01:42:52,473
On a bad day after a couple drinks..

1335
01:42:53,301 --> 01:42:55,975
...I thrash the living daylights
out of some idiot..

1336
01:42:56,037 --> 01:42:58,176
...from the electricity department.

1337
01:43:00,174 --> 01:43:02,154
And then I go home and
sleep peacefully.

1338
01:43:13,554 --> 01:43:15,727
It's not such a depressing story.

1339
01:43:18,493 --> 01:43:21,269
I just told you because you asked.

1340
01:43:24,665 --> 01:43:29,705
Now you go.. who would you swear on?

1341
01:43:31,472 --> 01:43:32,542
Silly goose..

1342
01:43:34,609 --> 01:43:35,679
I am Gudiya.

1343
01:43:37,345 --> 01:43:42,727
I've always been like this but at
least you could've recognized me..

1344
01:43:44,552 --> 01:43:49,092
You're such a donkey. My official
name is Pooja Singh.

1345
01:43:51,359 --> 01:43:53,032
I went to the ghats that day after..

1346
01:43:53,094 --> 01:43:54,767
...school was over and
waited for two hours.

1347
01:43:55,229 --> 01:43:57,266
My aunt came to pick me up
but I was refusing to go..

1348
01:43:59,100 --> 01:44:00,773
That was the day my
father passed away.

1349
01:44:06,707 --> 01:44:08,778
I lost a lot on that day Bachchan.

1350
01:44:11,712 --> 01:44:13,783
I never went back to Kanpur after..

1351
01:44:15,650 --> 01:44:17,186
...that but I remember
every single thing.

1352
01:44:18,052 --> 01:44:20,794
The school, the chillies, the
pan shop at the corner..

1353
01:44:21,656 --> 01:44:24,068
...the market on Ram Devi
four-cross on Mondays, ..

1354
01:44:24,391 --> 01:44:26,564
...Imperial Talkies and Nigaar
Talkies right opposite each other..

1355
01:44:32,667 --> 01:44:35,807
...the tea stall near my school..

1356
01:44:37,138 --> 01:44:41,086
...and boys who ran behind
the girls' rickshaws..

1357
01:44:42,310 --> 01:44:44,221
Who went behind your rickshaw?

1358
01:44:44,745 --> 01:44:47,282
I used to cycle to school, silly goose

1359
01:44:52,420 --> 01:44:56,163
You.. you.. mean..

1360
01:44:57,692 --> 01:44:58,762
Yes..

1361
01:44:59,160 --> 01:45:00,833
Gudiya..

1362
01:45:02,630 --> 01:45:05,167
Yes. I've never sworn
on anyone till today.

1363
01:45:12,706 --> 01:45:15,585
You don't believe I'm Gudiya?

1364
01:45:21,182 --> 01:45:22,820
Will you believe it if I jump?

1365
01:45:27,788 --> 01:45:29,790
I would do anything
for you silly goose.

1366
01:45:50,678 --> 01:45:54,888
I don't even know what I'm
supposed to say now..

1367
01:45:59,687 --> 01:46:00,757
I love you.

1368
01:46:18,706 --> 01:46:19,776
What happened?

1369
01:46:23,444 --> 01:46:25,321
Gudiya, I feel shy.. I can't say it..

1370
01:46:38,259 --> 01:46:40,261
I can't say it Gudiya

1371
01:46:47,735 --> 01:46:48,941
What an actress?!

1372
01:46:54,575 --> 01:46:55,952
What comes after I love you?

1373
01:46:56,711 --> 01:46:57,781
After I love you?

1374
01:46:57,845 --> 01:46:58,915
What do you say after I love you?

1375
01:47:00,814 --> 01:47:07,459
Oh.. okay, listen. After I love you..
open the topmost button..

1376
01:47:07,522 --> 01:47:08,592
Opened.

1377
01:47:08,656 --> 01:47:13,298
Not yours, hers. Then, baby
I love you so much!

1378
01:47:13,361 --> 01:47:14,863
...And open her next button..

1379
01:47:14,929 --> 01:47:18,775
You're such a one track mind..
always a dirty mind

1380
01:47:18,833 --> 01:47:19,903
Fine don't ask me then man

1381
01:47:24,438 --> 01:47:28,250
Jimmy.. Jimmy.. Okay, if my feelings

1382
01:47:28,309 --> 01:47:32,257
towards her are bigger than love..

1383
01:47:32,312 --> 01:47:34,417
...as in a lot more than just love..

1384
01:47:34,648 --> 01:47:39,529
For something like that.. in
your English.. to a girl..

1385
01:47:39,586 --> 01:47:40,997
What do I say? What do I say?

1386
01:47:42,790 --> 01:47:46,761
Dude, people take forever
to just get to love.

1387
01:47:46,828 --> 01:47:48,501
No one's ever gone beyond that!

1388
01:47:49,930 --> 01:47:53,673
And you've got such a complicated
language for what? Nonsense.

1389
01:47:54,869 --> 01:47:58,476
Besides, who are you so
madly in love with?

1390
01:48:01,842 --> 01:48:04,482
Gudiya.. Gudiya..

1391
01:48:05,279 --> 01:48:07,885
Gudiya.. whose Gudiya?

1392
01:48:08,616 --> 01:48:13,031
Pooja! But I'll only call her
Gudiya once we're married.

1393
01:48:13,287 --> 01:48:14,357
Married...?

1394
01:48:14,422 --> 01:48:16,368
Yes.. you know like in
the English movies..

1395
01:48:16,423 --> 01:48:19,302
There is a way in which
they propose to a girl..

1396
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:21,863
Stylish, suave and so romantic!!

1397
01:48:26,300 --> 01:48:27,472
But.. but here I am, an illiterate.

1398
01:48:27,935 --> 01:48:34,045
If someone's arm needs to be ripped
off, I know what needs to be done.

1399
01:48:35,376 --> 01:48:38,323
But if I need to ask
a girl to marry me..

1400
01:48:38,379 --> 01:48:41,383
...my tongue becomes
a knot. I get shy.

1401
01:48:43,650 --> 01:48:50,397
So I thought.. there's no one better
than Jimmy Sir to help me.

1402
01:48:51,692 --> 01:48:55,333
If you can give me some
tips on how to propose..

1403
01:48:55,396 --> 01:48:59,970
...maybe I can bring
up marriage with her.

1404
01:49:01,569 --> 01:49:02,639
See ..

1405
01:49:03,003 --> 01:49:04,073
Bachchan..

1406
01:49:08,676 --> 01:49:09,746
Shall we go?

1407
01:49:18,986 --> 01:49:20,056
Let's go!

1408
01:49:21,155 --> 01:49:26,155
<i>TI</i>

1409
01:50:02,396 --> 01:50:05,570
Into the skies, and beyond

1410
01:50:05,633 --> 01:50:08,705
Come with me, my fond

1411
01:50:08,903 --> 01:50:12,146
Past all horizons we see

1412
01:50:12,206 --> 01:50:15,415
Forever, together we'll be

1413
01:50:16,477 --> 01:50:19,617
Lying on a blanket of clouds

1414
01:50:19,746 --> 01:50:23,159
Wrapped underneath the stars

1415
01:50:23,217 --> 01:50:28,758
We'll steal a moment that's just ours

1416
01:50:28,822 --> 01:50:32,167
Into the skies, and beyond

1417
01:50:32,493 --> 01:50:35,167
Come with me, my fond

1418
01:50:35,629 --> 01:50:38,769
Past all horizons we see

1419
01:50:38,833 --> 01:50:42,906
Forever, together we'll be

1420
01:51:23,477 --> 01:51:28,859
Look at this land we've
found along our way

1421
01:51:29,883 --> 01:51:36,095
Where the shadows of night
drown into the arms of day

1422
01:51:37,090 --> 01:51:40,196
Let us celebrate these lanes

1423
01:51:40,561 --> 01:51:43,508
Soaked in love so insane

1424
01:51:43,831 --> 01:51:48,871
Making all dreams come true

1425
01:51:50,571 --> 01:51:53,518
I could keep my eyes shut tight

1426
01:51:53,740 --> 01:51:56,846
Follow you into an infinite night

1427
01:51:56,910 --> 01:52:02,519
This instant at one signal from you

1428
01:52:03,050 --> 01:52:06,259
Oh may spring come when
time stands still

1429
01:52:06,587 --> 01:52:09,727
And be filled with scrolls
of prayer and goodwill

1430
01:52:09,857 --> 01:52:15,603
Of love so true, it
moves a poet's will

1431
01:52:15,662 --> 01:52:18,973
Into the skies, and beyond

1432
01:52:19,032 --> 01:52:22,241
Come with me, my fond

1433
01:52:22,303 --> 01:52:25,682
Past all horizons we see

1434
01:52:25,739 --> 01:52:29,812
Forever, together we'll be

1435
01:52:29,944 --> 01:52:33,289
I may not be good looking ,
I may not be too quick.

1436
01:52:33,614 --> 01:52:40,293
I know I laugh funnily, in
fact I'm a bit of a dick.

1437
01:52:42,055 --> 01:52:47,164
And nothing ever will change it
if you be mine forever more..

1438
01:52:47,628 --> 01:52:53,635
Like Beckham I will bend it
forever and ever forever!

1439
01:53:07,081 --> 01:53:08,287
I love you..

1440
01:53:23,230 --> 01:53:28,737
Never before have I seen
such a beautiful sight

1441
01:53:30,104 --> 01:53:36,680
I'm in a universe so different,
it feels so right

1442
01:53:37,211 --> 01:53:40,215
The sun stirs towards you

1443
01:53:40,681 --> 01:53:43,685
Teases the night with its hue

1444
01:53:43,950 --> 01:53:49,366
Sitting immovable by your windowsill

1445
01:53:50,190 --> 01:53:53,694
At this the moon's temperature
did rise

1446
01:53:53,961 --> 01:53:57,033
Melting away into an empty guise

1447
01:53:57,097 --> 01:54:02,843
And bringing my eyes to a fill

1448
01:54:03,237 --> 01:54:06,810
Then I'll steal the sun's light

1449
01:54:06,874 --> 01:54:09,787
Adorn it on you so bright

1450
01:54:10,043 --> 01:54:15,721
That dawn will break at your sight

1451
01:54:15,783 --> 01:54:19,026
Into the skies, and beyond

1452
01:54:19,086 --> 01:54:22,067
Come with me, my fond

1453
01:54:22,322 --> 01:54:25,735
Past all horizons we see

1454
01:54:25,792 --> 01:54:29,171
Forever, together we'll be

1455
01:54:29,997 --> 01:54:33,410
Lying on a blanket of clouds

1456
01:54:33,467 --> 01:54:36,414
Wrapped underneath the stars

1457
01:54:36,737 --> 01:54:42,346
We'll steal a moment that's just ours

1458
01:54:42,409 --> 01:54:45,754
Into the skies, and beyond

1459
01:54:45,813 --> 01:54:48,851
Come with me, my fond

1460
01:54:49,016 --> 01:54:52,429
Past all horizons we see

1461
01:54:52,486 --> 01:54:55,990
Forever, together we'll be

1462
01:54:56,056 --> 01:54:59,128
Into the skies, and beyond

1463
01:54:59,192 --> 01:55:03,436
Come with me, my fond

1464
01:55:26,386 --> 01:55:27,456
My phone's ringing.

1465
01:55:27,721 --> 01:55:29,860
Bachchan, where have you reached?

1466
01:55:30,057 --> 01:55:33,470
Sir, I've got the last bag in my
hand. All bags with the full amount.

1467
01:55:33,727 --> 01:55:37,470
Good. Pooja's not
misbehaving is she?

1468
01:55:37,731 --> 01:55:43,010
No Bhaiyyaji, Pooja is
on her best behavior.

1469
01:55:43,069 --> 01:55:44,139
And guruii?

1470
01:55:44,204 --> 01:55:46,013
Behaving like good boy

1471
01:55:46,273 --> 01:55:51,018
Rascal! You're speaking English
as smoothly as melting butter

1472
01:55:51,278 --> 01:55:53,884
I've picked up a little Bhaiyyaji!

1473
01:55:53,947 --> 01:55:56,086
And now, do you know
what you have to do?

1474
01:55:56,750 --> 01:55:58,229
What Bhaiyyaji?

1475
01:55:59,219 --> 01:56:02,098
Load the gun with two bullets.

1476
01:56:03,290 --> 01:56:07,966
Blow Mr. Guru]I's brains
out and smile.

1477
01:56:14,968 --> 01:56:17,847
Tie a weight and throw
the body into the sea.

1478
01:56:19,506 --> 01:56:22,783
However, I think that..

1479
01:56:22,843 --> 01:56:27,314
...Pooja is a very smart girl.

1480
01:56:28,782 --> 01:56:34,323
I like her Tashan. I want her alive.

1481
01:56:35,923 --> 01:56:40,201
You bring her to me tomorrow.

1482
01:56:41,795 --> 01:56:48,007
It is an auspicious day.
I will marry her.

1483
01:56:49,203 --> 01:56:54,812
By the power invested
in me, etc etc...

1484
01:56:55,409 --> 01:56:59,824
Are they next to you?

1485
01:57:00,547 --> 01:57:03,551
- Yes sir.

1486
01:57:10,357 --> 01:57:11,427
This was not a phone
call from Bhaiyyaji..

1487
01:57:11,491 --> 01:57:12,561
...It was the alarm clock
of my destiny ringing.

1488
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:15,306
I was back on earth in two seconds.

1489
01:57:16,430 --> 01:57:17,841
But in those two seconds, I realized
that no matter how many times..

1490
01:57:17,897 --> 01:57:20,434
...I find Gudiya again,
she would never be mine.

1491
01:57:34,581 --> 01:57:35,855
Hey!

1492
01:57:51,131 --> 01:57:53,611
You can't do this Bachchan..you
are not a killer

1493
01:58:10,884 --> 01:58:11,954
Gudiya

1494
01:58:16,357 --> 01:58:17,427
Do you have to go?

1495
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:21,230
Bhaiyyaji is only concerned about..

1496
01:58:21,294 --> 01:58:22,967
...his money, which I'm
going to give him.

1497
01:58:23,897 --> 01:58:24,967
He'll never agree.

1498
01:58:26,033 --> 01:58:29,242
He will, don't worry. I'll tell
him that you both ran away.

1499
01:58:30,370 --> 01:58:33,112
Worst comes to worst, he'll hit
me.. torture me.. I'll be fine.

1500
01:58:33,506 --> 01:58:35,110
I can handle this.

1501
01:58:40,514 --> 01:58:43,984
But after all this, you
meet at the ghats, okay?

1502
01:58:47,521 --> 01:58:48,932
I'll be waiting.

1503
01:58:49,656 --> 01:58:53,001
I'm not very good with goodbyes..

1504
01:58:56,396 --> 01:59:01,072
Just keep this.. as.. everything.

1505
01:59:02,936 --> 01:59:07,544
And take care of yourself, okay.

1506
01:59:09,075 --> 01:59:10,145
Ove English!

1507
01:59:14,014 --> 01:59:17,154
You know, you're quite a
bastard but I like you.

1508
01:59:18,552 --> 01:59:22,967
Hey by-the-banks-of-the-Ganges,
you are a dude man. Thanks.

1509
01:59:23,490 --> 01:59:24,560
Same to all of us

1510
01:59:27,961 --> 01:59:31,238
Make sure Gudiya reaches Kanpur
safely. And if she doesn't.

1511
01:59:31,298 --> 01:59:33,972
...I'll hunt you down from the very
bottom of the pit of hell..

1512
01:59:34,034 --> 01:59:36,981
...and make a big fat hole in your
pretty little face, okay!! Bye.

1513
01:59:37,371 --> 01:59:38,441
Good luck.

1514
01:59:46,380 --> 01:59:47,450
Let's go!!

1515
01:59:48,715 --> 01:59:49,989
All the best dude.

1516
02:00:01,728 --> 02:00:05,540
Oh please, stop it Pooja, he's not
even looking at you any more.

1517
02:00:08,001 --> 02:00:12,416
Actually you know what, I love
this. You're such a brilliant actress!

1518
02:00:13,673 --> 02:00:16,017
So moved by the departure
of her love..

1519
02:00:16,076 --> 02:00:18,613
...after making a complete idiot
out of him. Brilliant!!

1520
02:00:20,013 --> 02:00:21,356
Please deny us the pleasure
of such fine acting..

1521
02:00:22,482 --> 02:00:24,018
I am Gudiya silly goose.

1522
02:00:26,019 --> 02:00:29,023
If you could, you'd try to make a
fool out of God and satan together

1523
02:00:29,089 --> 02:00:35,768
You're not a Gudiya, you're an
evil doll. Now what happened?

1524
02:00:36,029 --> 02:00:38,031
Are you feeling bad or is your
acting prowess still on display?

1525
02:00:42,035 --> 02:00:46,450
I haven't spoken truer words in
my life. I really am Gudiya.

1526
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:48,451
Deenanath!

1527
02:00:49,042 --> 02:00:50,112
Yes mam.

1528
02:00:50,176 --> 02:00:51,450
Deenanath, what connection
have you gotten us?

1529
02:00:51,645 --> 02:00:53,056
That boy takes money to
provide electricity..

1530
02:00:53,113 --> 02:00:55,389
...but there never is any power.

1531
02:00:55,782 --> 02:00:57,659
No TV, no fans.. you're
completely useless.

1532
02:00:58,318 --> 02:01:02,391
Gudiya, will you please
go and have a look.

1533
02:01:02,456 --> 02:01:05,403
We had an illegal electricity
connection in our house.

1534
02:01:05,459 --> 02:01:09,066
Teach him a lesson that
he won't forget.

1535
02:01:09,663 --> 02:01:11,199
And when stolen electricity goes,

1536
02:01:11,665 --> 02:01:13,076
you experience a higher
level of anger.

1537
02:01:13,600 --> 02:01:17,070
When I get pissed off,
I don't spare anyone.

1538
02:01:18,071 --> 02:01:20,073
It was the first time I saw the boy
that stole electricity for us ..

1539
02:01:20,140 --> 02:01:21,551
...looked like complete donkey.

1540
02:01:23,076 --> 02:01:25,078
After that day, even if there
was no electricity in the ..

1541
02:01:25,144 --> 02:01:27,351
...entire neighborhood, our
house always had electricity.

1542
02:01:30,083 --> 02:01:33,087
He seemed like a bit
of crook to me..

1543
02:01:33,153 --> 02:01:36,691
...and also a birdbrain.
But I liked dumbos a lot!

1544
02:01:38,491 --> 02:01:40,698
I was very excited when I went
to meet him at the ghats.

1545
02:01:43,563 --> 02:01:46,635
But I met someone else there.

1546
02:01:52,439 --> 02:01:54,578
Vickram Tiger was my father's name..

1547
02:01:56,376 --> 02:01:59,118
...but all of Kanpur trembled
at the mention of him.

1548
02:02:00,380 --> 02:02:05,193
They said he resembled the
fierceness of a tiger. But that day..

1549
02:02:44,424 --> 02:02:49,772
Grant me this request dear cloud

1550
02:02:50,163 --> 02:02:56,239
Go and burst and speak out loud

1551
02:02:57,237 --> 02:03:00,912
Tell my father that
you are a disguise

1552
02:03:02,175 --> 02:03:11,186
Tell him you are his daughter's eyes

1553
02:03:28,935 --> 02:03:31,211
I knew what had actually
happened to my father..

1554
02:03:31,271 --> 02:03:33,683
...but I couldn't say anything then.

1555
02:03:59,232 --> 02:04:03,374
I lived from that day on only
to destroy Bhaiyyaji.

1556
02:04:08,241 --> 02:04:10,243
First I crucified Gudiya..

1557
02:04:12,645 --> 02:04:14,249
And a cold Pooja took her place.

1558
02:04:18,584 --> 02:04:21,588
A girl who could not be trusted.

1559
02:04:26,259 --> 02:04:30,332
Who used anything that came her way.

1560
02:04:34,267 --> 02:04:35,337
Including you.

1561
02:04:42,342 --> 02:04:44,822
...and landed in the
middle of all this.

1562
02:04:47,881 --> 02:04:53,297
He gave life to Gudiya again.
You don't believe me...?

1563
02:04:56,890 --> 02:04:58,369
This is probably the
first time I do..

1564
02:05:01,361 --> 02:05:02,965
But Bhaiyyaji's going
to kill Bachchan.

1565
02:05:05,765 --> 02:05:06,835
What?

1566
02:05:10,303 --> 02:05:11,441
There's no money in
the bags he took.

1567
02:05:55,615 --> 02:06:00,030
Bachchan, kindly tell
me where the money is?

1568
02:06:00,620 --> 02:06:04,500
Bhaiyyaji I swear, I would
never betray you.

1569
02:06:06,826 --> 02:06:10,364
Just give me two days and I'll
bring your money back..

1570
02:06:10,430 --> 02:06:13,377
...from that English
speaking traitor.

1571
02:06:13,966 --> 02:06:15,036
And Pooja?

1572
02:06:16,770 --> 02:06:18,374
She has nothing to do with this.

1573
02:06:24,511 --> 02:06:29,859
You love her, you dirty fellow!
Look at the irony Misir.

1574
02:06:32,519 --> 02:06:36,524
I wanted a murderer and I ended
up with a bloody Romeo.

1575
02:06:36,790 --> 02:06:37,996
Bad..
- Luck

1576
02:06:39,992 --> 02:06:41,403
Listen dear Romeo.

1577
02:06:45,531 --> 02:06:49,411
You can love Pooja all you want..

1578
02:06:49,469 --> 02:06:53,747
...but she will marry only me.

1579
02:06:55,475 --> 02:07:01,426
I think this punishment should
suffice for the both of you.

1580
02:07:11,424 --> 02:07:13,700
I will never let that happen
as long as I live.

1581
02:07:22,902 --> 02:07:23,972
Bhaiyyaji ..

1582
02:07:51,931 --> 02:07:55,743
Now I have Romeo, Juliet
and Prince Charlie!

1583
02:07:56,069 --> 02:07:57,207
We brought your money

1584
02:07:58,604 --> 02:08:00,140
Please take it and let Bachchan go

1585
02:08:00,206 --> 02:08:01,810
No.. no.. no.. My dear Pooja..

1586
02:08:03,476 --> 02:08:06,821
...I'm sorry but that's
not what I had in mind.

1587
02:08:07,947 --> 02:08:11,485
Bhaiyyaji, money and Pooja..

1588
02:08:11,551 --> 02:08:16,022
...both are yours.

1589
02:08:17,490 --> 02:08:19,902
Just let me go.

1590
02:08:21,561 --> 02:08:23,973
What's the hurry Mr. Guruji?

1591
02:08:25,231 --> 02:08:28,508
Besides, why didn't you
run with the money..

1592
02:08:28,568 --> 02:08:32,846
...and the girl, when you could?

1593
02:08:32,905 --> 02:08:35,249
I ran with your money once and
I've been running ever since.

1594
02:08:35,642 --> 02:08:36,985
My life turned upside down.

1595
02:08:37,510 --> 02:08:40,650
If I ran again, you wouldn't
even leave me with a life.

1596
02:08:42,648 --> 02:08:45,527
Why are you doing this? This
is not what we discussed.

1597
02:08:45,585 --> 02:08:47,792
How else would I have brought
you here my dear?

1598
02:08:48,120 --> 02:08:49,190
What did you think?

1599
02:08:49,656 --> 02:08:53,536
That I'm going to risk my life to
save you and your hairy gorilla?

1600
02:08:53,927 --> 02:08:58,933
No way sweetheart! Does
it hurt? Good..

1601
02:08:59,933 --> 02:09:03,278
...because when you left
me in my own house,

1602
02:09:03,536 --> 02:09:04,879
I also felt something like this.

1603
02:09:10,743 --> 02:09:16,750
This is my house.
Any slapping, I do.

1604
02:09:18,017 --> 02:09:20,623
Now I'll show you
the real Bhaiyyaji.

1605
02:09:21,688 --> 02:09:25,636
This is the real Bhaiyyaji
from Kanpur.

1606
02:09:26,893 --> 02:09:30,568
The Bhaiyyaji who killed
your father..

1607
02:09:30,630 --> 02:09:34,578
...stabbed him to death.

1608
02:09:34,901 --> 02:09:38,178
Raise that hand again and
its broken, you son of a..

1609
02:09:42,976 --> 02:09:45,855
Now I'm going to smash
your bloody brains..

1610
02:09:46,045 --> 02:09:47,115
Bhaiyyaji, please.

1611
02:09:47,180 --> 02:09:48,591
Smash them, come on.

1612
02:09:49,048 --> 02:09:50,322
I also have one Tashan..

1613
02:09:54,320 --> 02:09:56,061
I like Tashan.

1614
02:10:11,604 --> 02:10:18,214
Just saying hello in my own style.
Enjoyed beating me up did you?

1615
02:10:23,349 --> 02:10:25,693
Right that's it. That's
it you bastard..

1616
02:10:26,886 --> 02:10:28,832
...I am going to kill you
right here right now.

1617
02:10:28,888 --> 02:10:30,890
Bhaiyyaji please, please
give me that gun.

1618
02:10:30,957 --> 02:10:32,630
I want to kill him right
here right now.

1619
02:10:32,691 --> 02:10:34,364
I want to blow his head off.
Give me your gun.

1620
02:10:37,630 --> 02:10:44,912
When you speak English, even
Bramha cannot deny you.

1621
02:10:45,104 --> 02:10:47,380
Give me the gun Bhaiyyaji,
I want to kill him.

1622
02:10:58,651 --> 02:11:05,728
Bhaiyyaji, TASHAN lS.. You are the
fifty-third card on the deck.

1623
02:11:05,925 --> 02:11:07,666
The joker!

1624
02:11:07,726 --> 02:11:14,405
And I'm the third king, Don't you
see, I'm the sovereign ruler.

1625
02:11:14,467 --> 02:11:20,247
Do you remember this film?
Black stone?

1626
02:11:20,673 --> 02:11:23,847
Bhaiyyaji, I am a bit a of a
bastard but you didn't know that.

1627
02:11:23,910 --> 02:11:27,016
I may be English in my ways, but
deep down, I'm purely Indian.

1628
02:11:27,680 --> 02:11:31,753
Pooja, would you please
free Mr. Bachchan Pande?

1629
02:11:31,817 --> 02:11:33,694
And Bachchan, if my clan
fails to continue..

1630
02:11:33,753 --> 02:11:35,824
...I will hunt you
down and kill you.

1631
02:11:37,023 --> 02:11:40,698
Mr. Misir, Mr. Pintu, kindly
drop your guns ..

1632
02:11:40,760 --> 02:11:43,764
...otherwise I'll have to blow
Bhaiyyaji's beautiful brain ..

1633
02:11:43,830 --> 02:11:45,707
...on this piece of shit
you call a carpet.

1634
02:11:51,170 --> 02:11:57,917
Bhaiyyaji, I've respected you
since I was a little boy.

1635
02:11:58,444 --> 02:11:59,718
But you're not what
I thought you to be.

1636
02:12:00,312 --> 02:12:02,724
From this day forward..

1637
02:12:02,782 --> 02:12:04,728
...If you ever dare to look at my
Gudiya with your dirty eyes..

1638
02:12:04,784 --> 02:12:06,730
...I swear I'll pull
out your blooming..

1639
02:12:06,786 --> 02:12:08,732
...eyeballs and play
marbles with them.

1640
02:12:09,722 --> 02:12:11,724
And yes, this wonderful
little rotten..

1641
02:12:11,790 --> 02:12:14,396
...kingdom you've made
for yourself here

1642
02:12:15,995 --> 02:12:17,736
I will burn it down to nothing..

1643
02:12:17,797 --> 02:12:19,208
...and put the ashes
into your beady eyes.

1644
02:12:21,934 --> 02:12:24,414
O English brother!
Thank you.. really.

1645
02:12:24,737 --> 02:12:25,807
It's okay Bachchan.

1646
02:12:26,205 --> 02:12:29,414
Common, we've got a long way to
take these creeps. After you..

1647
02:12:56,302 --> 02:12:57,372
BASTARD!

1648
02:13:32,405 --> 02:13:36,820
They've got the style, they've
got the good luck..

1649
02:13:37,810 --> 02:13:39,483
...and they have the formula.

1650
02:13:40,012 --> 02:13:43,960
But I, Bhaiyyaji, am
the original bastard.

1651
02:13:49,355 --> 02:13:50,425
I've got the TASHAN.

1652
02:14:23,322 --> 02:14:24,858
I had never imagined that
to save my own life..

1653
02:14:24,924 --> 02:14:27,131
...I would have to take another's.

1654
02:14:27,860 --> 02:14:29,396
I never thought that
I could fire a gun.

1655
02:14:29,862 --> 02:14:31,273
But when the situation is such,

1656
02:14:31,530 --> 02:14:33,476
you learn to pull the
trigger automatically.

1657
02:14:33,866 --> 02:14:35,868
I knew that now, either
I won't survive this..

1658
02:14:35,935 --> 02:14:38,541
...or I'll slay Bhaiyyaji
and walk out of here.

1659
02:14:46,879 --> 02:14:47,949
Jimmy..

1660
02:19:06,872 --> 02:19:08,408
Bachchannnn!

1661
02:20:07,933 --> 02:20:10,812
You can go to your father now.

1662
02:20:17,743 --> 02:20:19,745
Romeo Pande huh?

1663
02:22:38,350 --> 02:22:44,631
You're very happy today,
very happy..

1664
02:23:12,451 --> 02:23:14,988
I wasn't naive or even
straight forward,

1665
02:23:16,788 --> 02:23:18,597
but I do have a little
innocence in me.

1666
02:23:19,391 --> 02:23:22,395
In our country, no matter how
much of a loser or dumbo..

1667
02:23:22,460 --> 02:23:25,407
...or Jackasses people are, when
the time comes they are the ones..

1668
02:23:25,463 --> 02:23:28,410
...who come to each other's rescue.

1669
02:23:40,412 --> 02:23:43,552
My life didn't change much. I
still work in a call centre.

1670
02:23:44,016 --> 02:23:50,023
India's first call centre with only
female employees! And I own it!!

1671
02:23:52,023 --> 02:23:54,025
We even got an award from
some feminist NGO. Right?

1672
02:23:55,760 --> 02:23:59,105
I mean, that's like eating your
cake and getting a medal for it!

1673
02:23:59,431 --> 02:24:01,638
My life changed as much
as it should have.

1674
02:24:02,033 --> 02:24:05,446
Nowadays, I get up every morning
with a fresh zest.

1675
02:24:05,970 --> 02:24:07,449
I don't go near anything wrong or..

1676
02:24:07,506 --> 02:24:09,179
...Illegal because I've
reached my shore.

1677
02:24:09,441 --> 02:24:11,443
After all, I'm not some
wild bull on the loose..

1678
02:24:11,509 --> 02:24:13,511
...my wife keeps me on
a very tight leash.

1679
02:24:13,712 --> 02:24:15,453
And I love it!!

1680
02:24:16,581 --> 02:24:20,461
Our life is normal.. As normal
as everyone else's.

1681
02:24:23,054 --> 02:24:24,192
But who knows what normal is?

1682
02:24:24,722 --> 02:24:28,727
It's quite a subjective word. All
we know is that what is life..

1683
02:24:29,194 --> 02:24:30,798
Without TASHAN!

1684
02:24:30,862 --> 02:24:32,205
I mean what's life without a little

1685
02:24:32,464 --> 02:24:33,534
TASHAN
