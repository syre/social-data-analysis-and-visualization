00:00:17,498 --> 00:00:21,742
<i>* I feel in my heart</i>

2
00:00:21,769 --> 00:00:25,478
<i>* Our love has been
roaming apart</i>

3
00:00:25,506 --> 00:00:28,680
<i>* And when
I try talking to you</i>

4
00:00:28,709 --> 00:00:30,689
<i>* See what
you're going through</i>

5
00:00:30,711 --> 00:00:33,783
<i>* It's hard to know
where to start...</i>

6
00:01:21,896 --> 00:01:25,776
<i>* I know in my heart</i>

7
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,474

up to you</i>

8
00:01:29,503 --> 00:01:32,643

doesn't know</i>

9
00:01:32,673 --> 00:01:34,482
<i>* If it has a chance

10

11
00:01:57,464 --> 00:02:00,035
<i>* I feel in my heart</i>

12
00:02:00,067 --> 00:02:05,745
<i>* Love dreams,
so it seems...</i>

13
00:02:15,582 --> 00:02:17,584
Ladies and gentlemen,
it gives me great pleasure

14
00:02:17,651 --> 00:02:19,528
to introduce my best friend...

15
00:02:19,553 --> 00:02:21,658
best-selling author--
ladies and gentlemen,

16
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:24,499
a big round of applause
for Wes Wilson.

17
00:02:25,693 --> 00:02:28,469
Thank you.
Making my way up to the stage.

18
00:02:28,495 --> 00:02:31,942
Yes. Yeah. Thank you.

19
00:02:31,966 --> 00:02:34,674
Thank you. Yes.

20
00:02:35,703 --> 00:02:37,910
Hey. What's going down?

21
00:02:37,938 --> 00:02:39,713
You're smooth.

22
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:43,051
Boy, yes! Thank you, thank you.

23
00:02:43,077 --> 00:02:45,148
Thank you,
thank you very much.

24
00:02:47,715 --> 00:02:50,662
Just wanna say it's a great
honor to be here this evening

25
00:02:50,684 --> 00:02:53,961
and it truly does warm
my heart and soul

26
00:02:53,988 --> 00:02:55,865
to see these gorgeous couples.

27
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:59,132
It just makes me think,
"Man, I am one heck of a writer!"

28
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:01,036
Yes!

29
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:03,905
- That you are!
- Now seriously, I remember...

30
00:03:03,931 --> 00:03:07,105
way back when... when this was just
an idea floating around in my head.

31
00:03:07,134 --> 00:03:09,842
And I talked to my agent here,
Martin Rivera,

32
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,783
who told me to forget all about it.

33
00:03:12,806 --> 00:03:14,581
Way to go, Martin!

34
00:03:14,608 --> 00:03:19,682
No, seriously, relationships--
the key is commitment, time

35
00:03:19,713 --> 00:03:23,251
and, most importantly, honesty.

36
00:03:23,683 --> 00:03:27,663
Yes. No, but seriously,
honesty-- honesty is the key.

37
00:03:27,688 --> 00:03:30,726
And if that fails, role-playing.

38
00:03:30,758 --> 00:03:33,568
All right. Perfect.

39
00:03:33,594 --> 00:03:36,973
Thank you very much.
Hold it up there.

40
00:03:36,997 --> 00:03:39,204
Right. Yeah.

41
00:03:39,233 --> 00:03:41,713
We did it!

42
00:03:45,339 --> 00:03:46,750
Oh, yeah.

43
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:50,221
Here we go, ladies.

44
00:03:50,244 --> 00:03:52,019
Thank you very much.

45
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:57,057
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you very, very much.

46
00:03:57,084 --> 00:03:59,928
Yes! Role-play, role-play!

47
00:04:01,054 --> 00:04:04,592
Okay. Thanks.
Thank you very much.

48
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:07,834
Be whoever you want to be.
Enjoy yourself.

49
00:04:07,861 --> 00:04:11,968
All right, let's have plenty of people
on the dance floor.

50
00:04:14,101 --> 00:04:15,774
- Ladies.
- Pleased.

51
00:04:15,803 --> 00:04:18,283
- That look is working for you.
- You're better looking in person.

52
00:04:18,305 --> 00:04:21,311
Thank you, darling.

53
00:04:31,385 --> 00:04:34,730
Hey, can I have a vodka
and tonic, please?

54
00:04:34,755 --> 00:04:36,200
Coming right up.

55
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,328
- Hey.
- Hey.

56
00:04:39,326 --> 00:04:42,205
I have kind of seen
you around.

57
00:04:45,365 --> 00:04:48,403
I'm-- I'm Wes.
I'm a writer.

58
00:04:49,636 --> 00:04:53,015
- No kidding.
- You probably saw the speech there.

59
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,852
I got...
a national best-seller.

60
00:04:58,912 --> 00:05:01,950
I'm actually working
on a new book now.

61
00:05:01,982 --> 00:05:04,690
Really? What is it about?

62
00:05:04,718 --> 00:05:06,891
It's all about
how to talk to women,

63
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,867
but I'm only on page 10.
How am I doing?

64
00:05:11,091 --> 00:05:13,867
No, seriously,
you are absolutely gorgeous,

65
00:05:13,894 --> 00:05:15,931
and, just purely
for research purposes,

66
00:05:15,963 --> 00:05:18,807
is there anything I could say that
would get you to come up to my room?

67
00:05:18,832 --> 00:05:20,834
- No.
- Why not?

68
00:05:20,868 --> 00:05:24,406
Because you're just a writer.

69
00:05:33,981 --> 00:05:37,019
Okay.

70
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,656
A challenge.

71
00:05:39,686 --> 00:05:42,758
You kicked your shoes off.
They're over there somewhere.

72
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:44,200
Hey, buddy.

73
00:05:46,426 --> 00:05:48,463
Creepy.

74
00:05:51,265 --> 00:05:55,008
- Nice dress.
- Thank you.

75
00:06:01,975 --> 00:06:04,387
I'm on my way.

76
00:06:04,411 --> 00:06:08,723
- Hey, do you wanna dance?
- Okay, this one's for the lovers.

77
00:06:28,068 --> 00:06:31,174
Just follow me.

78
00:06:47,521 --> 00:06:50,502
Samantha?

79
00:06:50,524 --> 00:06:54,131
Samantha?

80
00:06:54,161 --> 00:06:56,937
Yes.

81
00:06:58,232 --> 00:06:59,438
Yes.

82
00:06:59,466 --> 00:07:03,471
- Would you marry me?
- Would you marry me?

83
00:07:03,503 --> 00:07:05,346
Yes.

84
00:07:05,872 --> 00:07:08,114
Yes!

85
00:07:11,011 --> 00:07:14,322
Happy day, darling!

86
00:07:14,348 --> 00:07:18,023
They're getting married!

87
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:21,090
You love doing that,
don't you?

88
00:07:21,121 --> 00:07:23,158
I plan on doing it
the rest of my life.

89
00:07:29,196 --> 00:07:32,109
<i>* Feel the heat</i>

90
00:07:32,132 --> 00:07:36,842
<i>* Then you'll see
I never say goodbye...</i>

91
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,841
Thank you very much!

92
00:07:40,874 --> 00:07:43,286
Mrs. Wilson,
ladies and gentlemen.

93
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,950
Now then,
let's get out of here.

94
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:48,550
- Hey.
- Marty? Marty Marty Marty.

95
00:07:48,582 --> 00:07:51,062
This is the girl I was telling
you about. This is Samantha.

96
00:07:51,084 --> 00:07:52,995
Samantha, this is Marty;
Marty, Sam.

97
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,899
Nice to finally meet you.
He said you were beautiful

98
00:07:55,922 --> 00:07:58,027
and he wasn't lying.
This is amazing. Hi.

99
00:07:58,058 --> 00:08:02,006
- Thank you.
- So, engaged? Already.

100
00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:04,373
- Yes.
- That's very quickly.

101
00:08:04,398 --> 00:08:06,878
Congratulations.

102
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,074
- It was love at first sight.
- Yes, it was.

103
00:08:10,103 --> 00:08:12,310
Well, when you know, you know?

104
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:14,979
Hey, that's actually
a good title for another book,

105
00:08:15,008 --> 00:08:18,854
maybe a follow-up to this. All right,
you guys, this is uncomfortable.

106
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,917
Um, you know what? There are
a couple of people I want you to meet.

107
00:08:21,948 --> 00:08:24,929
Marty, I love you.
We'll do it another time, okay?

108
00:08:24,951 --> 00:08:27,864
- Hold your body close to me...
- See you soon, Marty!

109
00:08:27,888 --> 00:08:29,424
Later.

110
00:08:30,023 --> 00:08:32,063
Okay.

111
00:08:34,194 --> 00:08:36,707
Let's get you home.

112
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,406
Chilly, yeah.
Here you go, sweetie.

113
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:42,880
- Thank you.
- My God!

114
00:08:42,903 --> 00:08:45,110
What a night. What a night.

115
00:08:45,138 --> 00:08:48,312
- I had a great time tonight.
- It was pretty perfect, wasn't it?

116
00:08:48,342 --> 00:08:51,448
Oh my God. I gotta tell you,
you just look absolutely gorgeous.

117
00:08:51,478 --> 00:08:55,220
You are the most beautiful...

118
00:08:56,149 --> 00:08:58,027
Baby.

119
00:09:06,893 --> 00:09:10,102
Wes!

120
00:09:12,532 --> 00:09:15,638
Alicia,

121
00:09:15,669 --> 00:09:18,240
where have you been?

122
00:09:18,271 --> 00:09:21,047
Where are my diamonds, Alicia?

123
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:25,250
Maybe I didn't explain to you

124
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:28,487
our retirement policy...

125
00:09:28,515 --> 00:09:30,552
there isn't one.

126
00:09:32,586 --> 00:09:35,157
Leave him alone.

127
00:09:35,188 --> 00:09:38,328
What's it like to lie
to the man you love?

128
00:09:41,528 --> 00:09:44,168
Hey, what's going on here?

129
00:09:47,968 --> 00:09:49,948
Go to hell!

130
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:54,385
Last chance, Alicia.
What's it gonna be?

131
00:09:54,408 --> 00:09:57,218
Let him go.
I will get them for you.

132
00:10:16,196 --> 00:10:20,167
Fuck! Son of a bitch!
I'm gonna fuck you up.

133
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,702
Wes!

134
00:10:24,204 --> 00:10:29,176
You idiot! Put her in the car.

135
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:48,471
Sam!

136
00:10:50,363 --> 00:10:54,175
Where the hell
are you taking her?

137
00:10:58,071 --> 00:11:00,176
Dude, what happened?

138
00:11:00,207 --> 00:11:03,552
- Sir, hang in there, sir.
- 911. What's the emergency?

139
00:11:05,178 --> 00:11:07,419
There has been a robbery.
Someone's been mugged.

140
00:11:07,447 --> 00:11:09,324
- Are you with the victim now?
- God.

141
00:11:09,349 --> 00:11:10,726
Yes.

142
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,253
<i>Okay, I'm gonna
need your location.</i>

143
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,090
<i>732, copy.</i>

144
00:11:39,112 --> 00:11:42,150
Service road 54,
under the I-90 overpass.

145
00:11:42,182 --> 00:11:45,095
I've got a possible 10-29 Victor.

146
00:11:45,118 --> 00:11:47,257
<i>Be safe, 732.</i>

147
00:13:26,586 --> 00:13:29,829
Um, I'm really sorry
that it's taken me

148
00:13:29,856 --> 00:13:33,201
so long to get
this together for you,

149
00:13:33,226 --> 00:13:36,366
but it's,
it's pretty standard, Mr. Wilson.

150
00:13:36,396 --> 00:13:40,276
By Washington state law,
her assets will remain in trust

151
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,645
until either a year passes
and the court declares her dead,

152
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:47,413
or her body is recovered.

153
00:13:48,808 --> 00:13:52,312
That's it right there.

154
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,952
Uh, Mr. Wilson,
do you understand?

155
00:13:59,386 --> 00:14:01,662
You okay, buddy?

156
00:14:01,688 --> 00:14:05,602
- Yeah, go ahead.
- Okay. Well...

157
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:09,698
you can continue to live
in the house that you both shared.

158
00:14:09,729 --> 00:14:12,903
She also had a checking account

159
00:14:12,932 --> 00:14:16,709
at First Savings Bank in Seattle,

160
00:14:16,736 --> 00:14:20,343
and a safety deposit box
at Washington Trust in Spokane.

161
00:14:20,373 --> 00:14:23,217
- You, of course, get--
- Spokane?

162
00:14:23,243 --> 00:14:26,486
Uh, yeah. You--
you didn't know about that?

163
00:14:26,513 --> 00:14:29,892
Until you called,
I didn't know she had a lawyer.

164
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,796
I guess we all have
little secrets, right?

165
00:14:36,956 --> 00:14:40,301
D-d-do you have
any other questions?

166
00:14:40,326 --> 00:14:43,307
How long have you been married?

167
00:14:45,665 --> 00:14:48,805
I don't know, 11 years, I guess.

168
00:14:48,835 --> 00:14:50,815
Do you love your wife?

169
00:14:52,672 --> 00:14:54,674
Yeah, very much.

170
00:14:54,707 --> 00:14:58,280
Well, cherish every moment.

171
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,952
Um, okay. Well, listen,

172
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:04,518
thanks so much for coming in

173
00:15:04,551 --> 00:15:06,997
and please just feel free
to contact me.

174
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,364
- Thank you very much.
- Sure.

175
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:11,699
Here you go.

176
00:15:13,993 --> 00:15:16,701
- I'm going on lunch, okay?
- Yeah.

177
00:15:35,482 --> 00:15:39,328
I'll tell you anything
that you want.

178
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,960
Um, look, he-- he--

179
00:15:45,992 --> 00:15:48,802
he gets the house,
he gets some cash

180
00:15:48,828 --> 00:15:51,775
and a-- and a--
and a box.

181
00:15:51,798 --> 00:15:55,678
- A safety deposit box.
- When does he get access?

182
00:15:55,702 --> 00:15:58,342
Um, in a-- in a year,

183
00:15:58,371 --> 00:16:01,477
when the court gives
its full authorization to the bank.

184
00:16:01,508 --> 00:16:03,852
It's all-- it's all right here
and it's all legal.

185
00:16:08,014 --> 00:16:11,552
Sir, listen to me,
I swear to God...

186
00:16:11,584 --> 00:16:14,064
I won't say a word to anybody.
I promise.

187
00:16:14,087 --> 00:16:16,431
I really don't give a shit.

188
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:20,799
Every person you tell,
I'm gonna send a piece of your wife,

189
00:16:20,827 --> 00:16:23,501
a piece of your kids--
a ear, finger, an eye.

190
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:26,739
- It doesn't matter to me.
- Okay, you know what?

191
00:16:26,766 --> 00:16:28,973
They-they don't--
I'm telling you right now.

192
00:16:29,002 --> 00:16:31,676
I-I-- listen to me.
Listen to me, okay?

193
00:16:31,704 --> 00:16:36,483
Look, I-I already told you I'm not
gonna say anything to anybody.

194
00:16:38,111 --> 00:16:40,682
No, no.

195
00:16:55,695 --> 00:16:58,835

200
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:13,751
- Hey, there's my guy.
- Hey.

201
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,885
How is the sequel coming?

202
00:17:15,915 --> 00:17:18,361
- Great. Just great.
- That good?

203
00:17:18,684 --> 00:17:22,389
I'm just having
a hard time getting motivated.

204
00:17:22,422 --> 00:17:25,528
That would get me motivated
right there.

205
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:29,535
Nah. She doesn't really look
like the relationship type.

206
00:17:29,562 --> 00:17:31,803
Who said anything
about a relationship?

207
00:17:31,831 --> 00:17:34,869
All you need is to go...
in and out.

208
00:17:34,901 --> 00:17:37,780
It's actually a good possible title.
Remind me to write that down.

209
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:41,814
Look, it's time for you to start
thinking about casual dating again.

210
00:17:41,841 --> 00:17:44,981
- Yeah, I'll start thinking about it.
- You'd better start thinking about it!

211
00:17:45,011 --> 00:17:48,390
Because I literally live vicariously
through you. If you're not having sex,

212
00:17:48,414 --> 00:17:50,894
I'm not having sex. I'm getting
pretty fucking horny over here.

213
00:17:50,917 --> 00:17:52,157
I can tell.

214
00:17:52,185 --> 00:17:54,665
A couple of nights out
with some chicks like this

215
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:57,497
will straighten you right out.
You can maybe have that one

216
00:17:57,523 --> 00:17:59,525
or that one.
Hi.

217
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:01,004
Hi.

218
00:18:01,027 --> 00:18:04,941
As a motivational speaker, you really
leave something to be desired.

219
00:18:04,964 --> 00:18:08,138
You just gotta give me some time.
I know it's been a year,

220
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:10,909
but I was really madly in love
with Sam. It's how it is.

221
00:18:10,937 --> 00:18:12,974
I'm not asking you to stop
thinking about her.

222
00:18:13,006 --> 00:18:15,782
I'm just saying
every guy needs a little...

223
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,448
I'm taking care of myself.

224
00:18:18,478 --> 00:18:20,458
Sure you do. All right,
I'm gonna go have a smoke

225
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,687
- and leave you with some people.
- I thought you quit.

226
00:18:22,715 --> 00:18:24,854
Ah, good health is only gonna
keep me in bad marriage.

227
00:18:24,884 --> 00:18:27,922
Yeah. Hello.

228
00:18:27,954 --> 00:18:31,993
Wes-- Wes Wilson.
There we go.

229
00:18:33,459 --> 00:18:35,029
Good luck finding love
in the 21st century.

230
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:42,941
Hi.

231
00:18:43,569 --> 00:18:46,644
Thank you.

232
00:18:46,673 --> 00:18:50,519
Oh! Excuse me. I'm sorry.

233
00:18:50,543 --> 00:18:52,853
Whoa, hey! God.
Everybody okay?

234
00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:55,917
- Okay, yeah.
- No, I'm fine.

235
00:18:55,949 --> 00:18:58,555
Pick up a few of these things.

236
00:18:58,984 --> 00:19:00,655
I'm Wes.

237
00:19:00,687 --> 00:19:02,724
I am Nicole
and I know who you are.

238
00:19:02,755 --> 00:19:05,736
Of course, well, there's a huge
standee of me there.

239
00:19:05,758 --> 00:19:07,965
Look,

240
00:19:07,994 --> 00:19:11,498
I'm just gonna put it right there.
I am a big fan

241
00:19:11,531 --> 00:19:13,477
and I write for the Seattle
"Woman's Book Weekly"

242
00:19:13,499 --> 00:19:16,105
and I would just love
to do an interview with you.

243
00:19:16,135 --> 00:19:18,672
Oh, well, thank you very much.
I'm flattered.

244
00:19:18,705 --> 00:19:23,085
You're welcome. Not many writers
get a best-seller their first time out.

245
00:19:23,109 --> 00:19:25,646
Ah, beginner's luck.

246
00:19:25,678 --> 00:19:28,181
I read it twice.
Some really good stuff in there.

247
00:19:28,214 --> 00:19:30,091
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

248
00:19:30,116 --> 00:19:32,562
So did it help?
Are you married?

249
00:19:32,585 --> 00:19:35,759
- Uh, no-- no wife.
- Girlfriend?

250
00:19:35,788 --> 00:19:38,598
No-no, just me...
all alone.

251
00:19:38,624 --> 00:19:42,629
- So what's wrong with you?
- Pretty much everything.

252
00:19:42,662 --> 00:19:45,268
It doesn't look like it from here.

253
00:19:45,298 --> 00:19:48,643
Uh, thank you.

254
00:19:48,668 --> 00:19:49,874
Step right up.

255
00:19:49,902 --> 00:19:54,612
Uh, so the interview?
Does this weekend work?

256
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,881
I'm kind of busy
this weekend, actually.

257
00:19:56,909 --> 00:19:59,617
- What about tonight?
- Tonight?

258
00:19:59,646 --> 00:20:01,853
- Well--
- No time like the present.

259
00:20:01,881 --> 00:20:03,792
Here's my address.

260
00:20:03,816 --> 00:20:07,662
Um, okay. Yeah, tonight.
Tonight could be good.

261
00:20:07,687 --> 00:20:10,224
Great.
So we meet around 7:00?

262
00:20:10,256 --> 00:20:13,032
- 7:00! 7:00. Nice to meet you.
- Okay. Nice to meet you.

263
00:20:15,928 --> 00:20:17,100
- Hi there.
- Hi.

264
00:20:19,732 --> 00:20:23,043
There you go.
Good luck.

265
00:20:23,469 --> 00:20:25,640
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

266
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:28,311
Your book is very inspirational.

267
00:20:28,341 --> 00:20:31,015
I've always said
it's not just for women.

268
00:20:31,043 --> 00:20:35,287
I was in a relationship--
well, I thought I was in a relationship.

269
00:20:35,714 --> 00:20:38,158
But then I read your book.

270
00:20:38,184 --> 00:20:40,664
It was like you opened up
my mind and my eyes

271
00:20:40,686 --> 00:20:44,600
- and I saw things in a whole new light.
- Thank you very much.

272
00:20:44,624 --> 00:20:46,297
This girl I was seeing, well--

273
00:20:46,325 --> 00:20:48,703
she wasn't the girl
I thought she was.

274
00:20:48,728 --> 00:20:52,608
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
What happened?

275
00:20:52,632 --> 00:20:56,603
She just disappeared.

276
00:20:58,004 --> 00:21:00,883
Uh, well, would you
like me to sign it?

277
00:21:00,907 --> 00:21:02,853
I can dedicate the book,
if you like.

278
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,253
I want you to make it out
to my new girlfriend.

279
00:21:05,278 --> 00:21:08,088
- Okay.
- Audrey.

280
00:21:08,114 --> 00:21:12,824
I want you to put, "Diamonds
are a girl's best friend..."

281
00:21:12,852 --> 00:21:15,093
"Diamonds are...

282
00:21:15,121 --> 00:21:18,193
a girl's best friend.

283
00:21:18,224 --> 00:21:21,671
Wes Wilson."

284
00:21:21,694 --> 00:21:24,004
There you go.

285
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:26,636
I'll make sure
this one doesn't disappear.

286
00:21:30,837 --> 00:21:32,510
Nice, huh?

287
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,509
Fan base is expanding.
This is big. This is really big.

288
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,696
Hello?

289
00:21:54,727 --> 00:21:58,140
Hello?
Dude, I know you're there,

290
00:21:58,164 --> 00:22:01,236
sitting there watching the machine
as I talk, little bastard.

291
00:22:01,267 --> 00:22:04,646
Look, remember, this is just
an interview with a super hot girl

292
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:06,741
with a super hot body,
all right?

293
00:22:06,772 --> 00:22:09,343
Just have fun.
Maybe she'll inspire you.

294
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:12,413
Don't forget to tell me all about it.

295
00:22:12,445 --> 00:22:15,892
- You know I love this shit.
- All right.

296
00:23:08,734 --> 00:23:11,977
- Wes?
- Hi.

297
00:23:12,004 --> 00:23:14,109
You can see me? Hi.

298
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:17,314
- Come on up.
- What do I push?

299
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,055
Hi.

300
00:23:26,085 --> 00:23:27,996
How long have you been
out there?

301
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,000
Feels like my whole life.

302
00:23:30,022 --> 00:23:32,502
You wanna come in?

303
00:23:32,525 --> 00:23:35,404
- Sure. Yeah.
- Come in. Get out of the rain.

304
00:23:35,428 --> 00:23:38,136
Well, let me get you
out of these clothes here.

305
00:23:38,164 --> 00:23:40,474
Don't you think we should talk first?

306
00:23:40,499 --> 00:23:44,072
- I mean--
- You'll find a robe behind my door.

307
00:23:44,103 --> 00:23:46,811
- Are we going out though?
- It's a mess outside.

308
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:49,786
I thought we'd stay in.

309
00:23:49,809 --> 00:23:52,380
Okay.

310
00:23:53,412 --> 00:23:55,289
Oh, gosh.

311
00:23:55,314 --> 00:23:58,261
- It's a nice place you have here.
- Thanks. It's a rental.

312
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,323
- What?
- You in that robe.

313
00:24:03,356 --> 00:24:07,065
Oh. It's cozy.

314
00:24:07,093 --> 00:24:09,437
- Let's open some wine.
- Thank you.

315
00:24:09,462 --> 00:24:12,841
- I take it you don't date much, huh?
- It's been a little while.

316
00:24:12,865 --> 00:24:14,867
Is there a reason?

317
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,971
Uh, well, it's kind of a long story.

318
00:24:17,003 --> 00:24:18,914
I was in this, um--

319
00:24:18,938 --> 00:24:21,441
uh, well, I'm writing
a new book and--

320
00:24:21,474 --> 00:24:24,318
- Oh, really? What is it about?
- I don't know.

321
00:24:26,245 --> 00:24:29,124
Hey, you should laugh.
I'm completely lost-- writer's block.

322
00:24:29,148 --> 00:24:31,287
- Well, you know what they say.
- What do they say?

323
00:24:31,317 --> 00:24:33,297
- Write what you know.
- I don't think

324
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:35,799
anybody would be too interested
in my dull life.

325
00:24:35,821 --> 00:24:38,495
You'd be surprised. I mean,
my readers are sure interested.

326
00:24:38,524 --> 00:24:41,164
Right, right, the interview.

327
00:24:41,193 --> 00:24:43,833
After dinner...

328
00:24:43,863 --> 00:24:46,469
when we're more relaxed.

329
00:24:47,499 --> 00:24:48,945
Good?

330
00:24:48,968 --> 00:24:51,608
Yummy.

331
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:57,019
So I didn't really wanna be a writer.

332
00:24:57,042 --> 00:24:59,818
I wanted to be a teacher.

333
00:24:59,845 --> 00:25:03,918
Yeah? Well,

334
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:07,193
what's something only your closest
friends would know about you?

335
00:25:07,219 --> 00:25:09,597
I'm a hell of a dancer!

336
00:25:09,622 --> 00:25:11,898
- Really?!
- Yeah.

337
00:25:11,924 --> 00:25:14,063
I'll show you some love here.

338
00:25:16,295 --> 00:25:18,795
Yeah, here we go.

339
00:25:20,232 --> 00:25:22,041
Big moves.
Ready?

340
00:25:22,068 --> 00:25:23,979
Okay. Hey, yep!

341
00:25:24,003 --> 00:25:26,313
- Look at that-- skibbitydoo!
- Impressive.

342
00:25:26,738 --> 00:25:29,182
Spinning! Oh, shit.

343
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:32,382
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I think I just hurt myself.

344
00:25:34,246 --> 00:25:36,688
Okay, okay.

345
00:25:37,016 --> 00:25:38,620
- Wes?
- Yeah?

346
00:25:38,651 --> 00:25:40,494
Are you ever gonna
put your clothes back on?

347
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:42,362
No.

348
00:25:42,388 --> 00:25:46,165
Well, in that case...

349
00:25:49,361 --> 00:25:51,100
Whoa, easy.

350
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,601
Afraid I'll take advantage?

351
00:25:53,632 --> 00:25:57,478
I'm horrified at the thought
of not remembering.

352
00:25:57,503 --> 00:26:00,279
Oh, trust me, you'd remember.

353
00:26:05,945 --> 00:26:08,448
All right, um,
I'll go get my notebook

354
00:26:08,481 --> 00:26:11,462
and maybe your clothes.

355
00:26:53,259 --> 00:26:55,466
What...

356
00:26:55,494 --> 00:26:57,667
the hell?

357
00:27:12,745 --> 00:27:15,624
Hi, Wes. The interview
we did was published today

358
00:27:15,648 --> 00:27:17,888
and I'll bring home a copy for you.

359
00:27:18,317 --> 00:27:21,594
I thought we could celebrate.
I'm gonna pick up some stuff tonight.

360
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:24,624
Do you want pasta or fish...

361
00:27:24,657 --> 00:27:26,967
or I don't know,
maybe you wanna go out.

362
00:27:26,992 --> 00:27:30,337
Maybe you're tired of my cooking.

363
00:27:30,362 --> 00:27:32,239
Hello?
Are you there?

364
00:27:32,264 --> 00:27:34,676
Wes?

365
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,671
Anyways we can decide later. All right,
I'll see you soon, honey. Goodbye, babe.

366
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:56,465
Oh, Jesus!

367
00:27:56,489 --> 00:27:58,594
I forgot that stupid cat.

368
00:28:04,463 --> 00:28:06,568
Hello?!

369
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:08,601
I have a gun.

370
00:28:53,479 --> 00:28:56,483
Wes, where are you, buddy?

371
00:28:56,515 --> 00:28:59,655
Yeah, I'm down here--
in the cellar.

372
00:29:01,553 --> 00:29:03,430
Where are you, man?

373
00:29:03,855 --> 00:29:05,594
Oh shit.

374
00:29:09,395 --> 00:29:11,739
- I'm in here. Get in here!
- Yeah.

375
00:29:11,764 --> 00:29:16,611
I got the check for the thing.

376
00:29:17,703 --> 00:29:19,614
What the hell is this?

377
00:29:19,638 --> 00:29:23,518
I have absolutely no idea. Sam got
this house from some little old guy.

378
00:29:23,542 --> 00:29:27,490
As far as I know, she hated guns,
hated small spaces.

379
00:29:27,513 --> 00:29:29,424
Maybe he was one
of those weapons wackos,

380
00:29:29,448 --> 00:29:33,260
like the guys who sell knives on the
home-shopping network or something.

381
00:29:33,285 --> 00:29:36,323
I think this is a little high tech
for that little old guy.

382
00:29:36,355 --> 00:29:39,632
Somebody was just in here.

383
00:29:50,569 --> 00:29:54,584
Sam, what the hell were you into?

384
00:29:54,607 --> 00:29:57,520
Is there anything
you're not telling me, man?

385
00:29:57,543 --> 00:30:01,491
I'm just as much in the dark
as you are.

386
00:30:10,389 --> 00:30:12,426
What am I signing here?

387
00:30:12,458 --> 00:30:14,734
It's just a release form.

388
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:19,641
And in it you will find
Samantha's death certificate,

389
00:30:19,665 --> 00:30:22,669
an authorization letter
and the key to her safety deposit box.

390
00:30:22,701 --> 00:30:24,874
You will need all 3
to gain access.

391
00:30:24,903 --> 00:30:29,818
Also in there is the final papers
and the deed for your house.

392
00:30:29,842 --> 00:30:32,914
That's, that's everything.

393
00:30:32,945 --> 00:30:37,257
- I can't believe it's been a year.
- Well, I guess time flies, doesn't it?

394
00:30:38,817 --> 00:30:40,558
Uh, well--

395
00:30:40,586 --> 00:30:43,499
What happened to your finger?

396
00:30:43,522 --> 00:30:47,629
Uh, well, I-- I have
a bit of a woodworking hobby

397
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:50,539
- and I cut it with a table saw.
- Ouch.

398
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:55,569
Um, Maggie, would you
excuse us for a second?

399
00:31:00,305 --> 00:31:02,546
Mr. Wilson,

400
00:31:02,574 --> 00:31:04,576
how well did you know
Samantha?

401
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:08,456
Because I actually
never met her.

402
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,859
See, I had her will on file
with instructions to contact you

403
00:31:11,884 --> 00:31:13,955
if anything
should happen to her.

404
00:31:15,254 --> 00:31:17,598
Well, in February
I went to pay her taxes,

405
00:31:17,623 --> 00:31:20,866
but her Social came back
as non-existent.

406
00:31:20,893 --> 00:31:24,534
I tried to contact her
at her workplace-- Atlantic Traders.

407
00:31:24,563 --> 00:31:29,308
I just-- I tried again thinking
that maybe I had the wrong number.

408
00:31:30,402 --> 00:31:34,976
Mr. Wilson, Atlantic Traders--
it doesn't exist.

409
00:31:36,241 --> 00:31:38,414
Um, well, I-I--

410
00:31:38,444 --> 00:31:40,890
I guess that's it.

411
00:31:45,818 --> 00:31:48,822
Well, be careful
with that table saw.

412
00:32:49,047 --> 00:32:51,094
Hi, honey.

413
00:32:54,486 --> 00:32:56,488
Wes, what happened?

414
00:32:56,522 --> 00:32:59,332
You know, I can't find a single thing
to tell me who she was or--

415
00:32:59,358 --> 00:33:02,032
her job didn't exist,
her name didn't exist!

416
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:06,338
- Baby.
- "Finding Love in the 21st Century,"

417
00:33:06,365 --> 00:33:09,312
by Wes Wilson-- fraud!
I couldn't tell you the first thing

418
00:33:09,334 --> 00:33:11,371
about the woman
I was gonna marry!

419
00:33:11,403 --> 00:33:13,781
Wes, I've always had this belief

420
00:33:13,806 --> 00:33:16,650
you can spend a lifetime with
someone and never really know them.

421
00:33:16,675 --> 00:33:20,589
Oh, God, is that supposed to help?

422
00:33:20,612 --> 00:33:24,025
Nic, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
said that. It was rude.

423
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:26,393
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

424
00:33:26,418 --> 00:33:28,364
This has nothing to do with you.

425
00:33:28,387 --> 00:33:30,594
If you want some answers,
why don't you just go to Spokane

426
00:33:30,622 --> 00:33:34,468
and open that safety deposit box, okay?
I mean, who knows what can be inside?

427
00:33:34,493 --> 00:33:36,370
I'll go with you.

428
00:33:36,395 --> 00:33:38,602
This doesn't concern you.

429
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:42,510
Baby, everything about you
concerns me, okay?

430
00:33:42,534 --> 00:33:45,378
I care about you.
I worry about you.

431
00:33:45,404 --> 00:33:47,611
Please. Okay?

432
00:33:50,442 --> 00:33:52,513
I really wanna thank you

433
00:33:52,544 --> 00:33:55,855
for coming along with me
on this journey.

434
00:33:55,881 --> 00:33:57,883
It's been great.

435
00:33:57,916 --> 00:34:00,863
So what do you think
is in the box?

436
00:34:00,886 --> 00:34:03,025
I don't know.
It could be more guns.

437
00:34:03,055 --> 00:34:05,968
Crazy, I don't know what
she was doing with that arsenal.

438
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,570
I guess I really didn't know her
all that well.

439
00:34:29,848 --> 00:34:31,919
Oh, yeah.

440
00:34:38,724 --> 00:34:41,728
Just a little nervous.

441
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,003
We just gotta go slow.
It's been a little while.

442
00:34:46,464 --> 00:34:48,508
This is very--

443
00:34:52,571 --> 00:34:55,177
Yeah, this could be
a long session.

444
00:34:55,607 --> 00:34:57,084
All right.

445
00:34:57,109 --> 00:34:59,487
- Shit, get off me!
- What? What?

446
00:34:59,511 --> 00:35:01,616
Someone's on the balcony.

447
00:35:01,647 --> 00:35:04,059
- What are you talking about?
- I'm serious.

448
00:35:04,082 --> 00:35:06,926
What are you talking about?

449
00:35:06,952 --> 00:35:09,660
I don't see anyone.

450
00:35:09,688 --> 00:35:13,158
I tell you
somebody is out there.

451
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:17,003
Well, it's a good thing
they left.

452
00:35:17,029 --> 00:35:19,635
I could have shown you
how tough I am.

453
00:35:19,665 --> 00:35:22,839
Just how tough are you?!

454
00:35:22,868 --> 00:35:25,412
Yes, you are a tough woman.

455
00:35:27,873 --> 00:35:30,547
Uh, it's been so long

456
00:35:30,575 --> 00:35:32,179
since I've been with a--

457
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:36,022
- Hey, you know what it says here?
- What's that?

458
00:35:36,048 --> 00:35:38,790
That "all relationships
should be based

459
00:35:38,817 --> 00:35:41,821
on a certain kind of commonality."

460
00:35:41,853 --> 00:35:43,890
- A what?
- Commonality.

461
00:35:43,922 --> 00:35:48,029
That "the opposites may attract,
but in reality it's the very attraction

462
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:52,008
that leads to the demise of the same
relationship in the long run."

463
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:55,842
Like 2 fucking potheads
can stay together forever, right?

464
00:35:55,867 --> 00:35:58,177
Yeah yeah, this guy is smart.

465
00:35:58,203 --> 00:36:02,743
Listen to this: "If one likes
camping in the outdoors,

466
00:36:02,774 --> 00:36:05,186
and the other is inclined
to like room service,

467
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:09,022
the relationship could be put
under constant stress

468
00:36:09,047 --> 00:36:11,994
because both parties
don't share a common interest."

469
00:36:12,017 --> 00:36:15,692
- Sounds like a contract.
- That's is what it says.

470
00:36:15,721 --> 00:36:19,191
"Because ultimately
all relationships

471
00:36:19,224 --> 00:36:21,534
are like a contract."

472
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,234
I ought to write a fucking book.

473
00:36:24,262 --> 00:36:26,799
Yeah.
"Both parties have to agree

474
00:36:26,832 --> 00:36:30,678
whether consciously
or subconsciously

475
00:36:30,702 --> 00:36:32,579
to be there for each other."

476
00:36:32,604 --> 00:36:36,575
Fucking deep. This guy's got
some head on his shoulders.

477
00:36:36,608 --> 00:36:38,144
Yeah.

478
00:37:05,737 --> 00:37:08,240
This girl I was seeing,

479
00:37:08,273 --> 00:37:11,186
well, she wasn't the girl
I thought she was.

480
00:37:14,746 --> 00:37:16,748
She just...

481
00:37:16,782 --> 00:37:18,887
disappeared.

482
00:37:48,113 --> 00:37:50,218
Mr. Wilson.

483
00:37:50,248 --> 00:37:53,195
Hey, "diamonds are
a girl's best friend," right?

484
00:37:53,618 --> 00:37:56,290
Your book helped me
get in where I fit in.

485
00:37:56,321 --> 00:37:59,302
- Oh, good.
- My name is Isaac Kahn.

486
00:37:59,324 --> 00:38:02,100
I'm here on behalf
of Atlantic Traders.

487
00:38:02,127 --> 00:38:05,870
- Really?
- I take it Samantha never mentioned us.

488
00:38:05,897 --> 00:38:08,969
No, no, she never mentioned
anybody she worked with.

489
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,310
Well, we're here to help.

490
00:38:11,336 --> 00:38:14,909
Why don't you get in the car
and we'll talk?

491
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:19,014
I don't think so.

492
00:38:19,044 --> 00:38:22,116
Mr. Wilson, we're very sorry
about your loss

493
00:38:22,147 --> 00:38:24,354
and are here to assist
in any way we can.

494
00:38:24,382 --> 00:38:26,191
So what is this about?

495
00:38:30,188 --> 00:38:34,068
Several small matters have
been brought to my attention.

496
00:38:34,092 --> 00:38:36,265
Inventory she handled for us

497
00:38:36,294 --> 00:38:39,207
has been mixed up
in her personal assets.

498
00:38:39,231 --> 00:38:41,404
What kind of stuff
did she do for you guys?

499
00:38:41,433 --> 00:38:44,312
- Assorted buying and selling overseas.
- Really?

500
00:38:44,336 --> 00:38:46,316
Alicia--

501
00:38:46,338 --> 00:38:50,343
Samantha was one of my best employees,
a major loss to the company.

502
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:54,255
So a year later with condolences?
Where were you when I called last year?

503
00:38:54,279 --> 00:38:56,725
Well, I do travel a lot

504
00:38:56,748 --> 00:39:00,821
and I never received any messages.
My sincerest apologies.

505
00:39:00,852 --> 00:39:03,958
I really needed answers last year.
So, thank you,

506
00:39:03,989 --> 00:39:05,991
thank you very much.

507
00:39:10,729 --> 00:39:12,367
Have some coffee.

508
00:39:18,403 --> 00:39:22,044
He's gonna regret that one.

509
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:47,732
Excuse me, ladies. Sorry.

510
00:39:49,801 --> 00:39:51,974
Oh, shit.

511
00:39:57,209 --> 00:39:59,450
- Easy!
- Watch out!

512
00:39:59,478 --> 00:40:01,389
Get the fuck out of here!

513
00:40:04,215 --> 00:40:05,922
Come on!

514
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:11,326
- Up here.
- Hey, hey!

515
00:40:16,328 --> 00:40:18,899
Wait!

516
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:25,076
Over there!

517
00:40:37,148 --> 00:40:39,458
- Yeah?
- Do you have him yet?

518
00:40:39,484 --> 00:40:41,862
- We lost him, boss. Sorry.
- Of course you did.

519
00:40:41,886 --> 00:40:43,991
- Meet me in the alley.
- Let's go!

520
00:40:52,263 --> 00:40:53,367
Hey!

521
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:01,511
Shit.

522
00:41:26,965 --> 00:41:29,605
Don't kill him.

523
00:41:33,405 --> 00:41:35,476
Get me out of here, Chauncey.

524
00:41:35,507 --> 00:41:38,113
- Yes, sir.
- Hey!

525
00:41:38,543 --> 00:41:40,282
After him!

526
00:41:43,848 --> 00:41:47,295
Hey, where is he going?!

527
00:41:53,925 --> 00:41:57,031
You put me
in a peculiar spot, Mr. Wilson.

528
00:41:57,062 --> 00:41:58,598
Oh, shit.

529
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:02,544
You chose to be rude
when I tried to be nice.

530
00:42:02,567 --> 00:42:06,140
So now we do it this way.

531
00:42:09,007 --> 00:42:10,577
- You will go to the bank--
- What?

532
00:42:10,608 --> 00:42:15,114
a simple withdrawal.
Your fiancée stole something from me

533
00:42:15,146 --> 00:42:17,023
and I want it back.

534
00:42:17,048 --> 00:42:18,619
No!

535
00:42:22,887 --> 00:42:26,858
I trust we will see you
at the bank at 11:00 AM?

536
00:42:26,891 --> 00:42:30,600
And if you and your lady friend
wanna make it home in one piece,

537
00:42:30,628 --> 00:42:33,404
you'll do as I say.

538
00:42:34,399 --> 00:42:37,505
Wait, wait, wait...
This is crazy.

539
00:42:37,535 --> 00:42:39,572
Samantha couldn't
have stolen anything.

540
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:45,649
My dear boy,
you have no idea.

541
00:42:45,677 --> 00:42:47,918
Why don't you tell me then?

542
00:42:51,415 --> 00:42:53,458
Oh, my ribs.

543
00:43:05,964 --> 00:43:07,966
Oh, God.

544
00:43:16,674 --> 00:43:19,245
Hey, watch it, man.

545
00:43:23,415 --> 00:43:26,191
He's been gone way too long.

546
00:43:26,217 --> 00:43:28,094
I understand.

547
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:29,723
Someone's at the door.
I gotta go.

548
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:33,634
Nicole?

549
00:43:34,959 --> 00:43:36,302
Oh, sh--

550
00:43:36,327 --> 00:43:39,103
Jesus Christ, don't shoot me.
I just went to get some breakfast.

551
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:41,132
Jesus, baby, what happened?

552
00:43:41,166 --> 00:43:43,612
Oh, shit, yeah.

553
00:43:43,635 --> 00:43:47,606
Some guy from Sam's work--
not so nice.

554
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:50,119
He said she stole
something of his.

555
00:43:50,141 --> 00:43:52,280
He thinks it's
in her safety deposit box.

556
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:54,517
What? This is crazy.
We should call the police.

557
00:43:54,546 --> 00:43:58,119
No! No, no, he knows where I live.
He knows all about you.

558
00:43:58,149 --> 00:44:00,493
- Me?
- Yeah. He called you "my lady friend."

559
00:44:00,518 --> 00:44:02,498
Now I'm scared.
What are we gonna do?

560
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,227
He wants me to go the bank,

561
00:44:04,255 --> 00:44:07,202
give him whatever the hell's
in the safety deposit box.

562
00:44:07,225 --> 00:44:09,728
You see this?
It's only gonna get worse.

563
00:44:09,761 --> 00:44:14,176
- I'm just gonna do what he says.
- They really worked you over.

564
00:44:14,199 --> 00:44:17,271
You should see the other guys.
They're perfectly fine.

565
00:44:17,302 --> 00:44:19,304
Listen,

566
00:44:19,337 --> 00:44:21,681
I really don't think
you should come with me.

567
00:44:21,706 --> 00:44:24,312
- Why?
- Clearly, it's not safe.

568
00:44:24,342 --> 00:44:29,087
After this, you're not leaving me
here alone, okay? I'm going with you.

569
00:44:29,113 --> 00:44:32,583
All right. Oh, Christ,
I'm just a writer.

570
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:36,790
It hurts.
My head, it--

571
00:44:44,495 --> 00:44:47,305
- Somebody wants to see you.
- Oh, come on, let's get--

572
00:44:48,332 --> 00:44:50,074
Oh, Jesus!

573
00:44:51,102 --> 00:44:52,706
Get off him! Get off him!

574
00:44:52,737 --> 00:44:54,313
Enough!

575
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:57,542
Let's go.

576
00:45:01,379 --> 00:45:03,416
So...

577
00:45:03,448 --> 00:45:05,450
okay.

578
00:45:06,518 --> 00:45:09,795
Inside the car, please,
Mr. Wilson.

579
00:45:10,221 --> 00:45:12,062
I'm getting out of there!

580
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:14,070
Okay.

581
00:45:34,212 --> 00:45:37,523
Once again for me,
if you will, Mr. Wilson.

582
00:45:37,548 --> 00:45:40,722
I go into the bank,
get the contents of the box,

583
00:45:40,752 --> 00:45:44,495
put it in this bag
and hand it over to you.

584
00:45:44,522 --> 00:45:47,503
And if you don't do as I ask?

585
00:45:47,525 --> 00:45:50,734
- You will kill Nicole.
- And who else?

586
00:45:50,762 --> 00:45:54,300
- Me.
- Excellent student, Mr. Wilson.

587
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:59,570
- I'll be back as soon as possible.
- Okay.

588
00:46:09,614 --> 00:46:11,150
What the hell is this?

589
00:46:11,182 --> 00:46:13,560
Mr. Boone will
accompany you inside.

590
00:46:13,585 --> 00:46:15,826
- Why?
- Insurance, Mr. Wilson.

591
00:46:15,854 --> 00:46:18,596
The girl isn't enough?

592
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:21,433
They rarely are.

593
00:46:23,428 --> 00:46:25,533
See you in a minute.

594
00:46:34,906 --> 00:46:37,250
Hi, what's your name?

595
00:46:37,275 --> 00:46:38,879
Excuse me.
Miss, where are the boxes?

596
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:41,686
- What?
- Sorry. The...

597
00:46:41,713 --> 00:46:43,784
safety deposit boxes.
I need to get in there.

598
00:46:43,815 --> 00:46:46,523
- I need to see your key.
- Oh, right.

599
00:46:46,551 --> 00:46:48,724
I also have a letter
from the court

600
00:46:48,753 --> 00:46:52,166
authorizing me.
And the death certificate's here.

601
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:54,466
- Passport.
- Right.

602
00:46:54,492 --> 00:46:56,699
Passport. Hang on.

603
00:46:56,728 --> 00:46:59,937
- There it is.
- Please have a seat.

604
00:47:01,299 --> 00:47:03,870
Sign here, please.

605
00:47:16,581 --> 00:47:21,690
You know that book you wrote talking
about gender roles and relationships?

606
00:47:21,719 --> 00:47:26,225
You know, the guy should cook
for his wife once a week?

607
00:47:26,257 --> 00:47:29,170
Any recipes you recommend?

608
00:47:29,193 --> 00:47:31,605
Mr. Wilson, how do you do?

609
00:47:31,629 --> 00:47:33,506
- I'm Jeff McKenzie.
- Yeah, hi.

610
00:47:36,666 --> 00:47:38,510
Well, then,

611
00:47:38,536 --> 00:47:41,449
- I'm very sorry to hear of your loss.
- Thank you.

612
00:47:41,472 --> 00:47:43,577
If you will.

613
00:48:04,362 --> 00:48:05,602
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

614
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:07,940
If you need anything else...

615
00:48:07,966 --> 00:48:09,775
Okay.

616
00:48:09,801 --> 00:48:12,611
- Open it!
- I'm opening it.

617
00:48:14,872 --> 00:48:16,249
Okay.

618
00:48:21,979 --> 00:48:25,688
Come on, let me just-- just let me
have a look inside the thing.

619
00:48:25,716 --> 00:48:28,424
Damn thing.
Come on, man.

620
00:48:28,453 --> 00:48:30,933
- This belongs to us. Thank you.
- Yeah.

621
00:48:34,025 --> 00:48:37,495
Psycho, psycho, psycho.

622
00:48:46,037 --> 00:48:49,314
Come on, let me just have
a look in the box. Come on!

623
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:51,286
Hey. No!

624
00:48:51,309 --> 00:48:54,415
- Wes.
- Shit.

625
00:48:54,445 --> 00:48:57,289
- Are you all right? Come here.
- Get what he wanted?

626
00:48:57,315 --> 00:49:00,023
- I don't know. There was a case.
- Honey, what was in it?

627
00:49:00,051 --> 00:49:02,292
- I don't know. He just took it.
- Anything else?

628
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,856
- Mr. Wilson?
- That was it.

629
00:49:03,888 --> 00:49:05,993
You left your bag in the vault.
Is everything all right?

630
00:49:06,023 --> 00:49:07,798
Just keep it.

631
00:49:07,825 --> 00:49:11,034
All right, let's just get
out of here. Come on.

632
00:49:11,062 --> 00:49:14,441
Ah, thank God
they didn't hurt you.

633
00:49:22,607 --> 00:49:24,382
What are we gonna do?

634
00:49:24,409 --> 00:49:27,390
Let's go back to the hotel,
pack and get out of this nightmare.

635
00:49:50,835 --> 00:49:53,509
They got what they wanted.
Sam is gone.

636
00:49:53,537 --> 00:49:55,813
I just wanna move on
with my life.

637
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:59,845
Yeah, maybe you're right.
Sam would have wanted it that way.

638
00:49:59,877 --> 00:50:02,983
She's trying to fuck with us.

639
00:50:03,014 --> 00:50:05,620
I won't let that happen.

640
00:50:16,594 --> 00:50:19,803
I've got an idea. We make this whole
thing move a little bit faster.

641
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:23,937
Why don't you go get the car,
I'll get the bags?

642
00:50:23,968 --> 00:50:26,380
Okay, I'll see you in a minute.

643
00:50:40,517 --> 00:50:42,623
Okay.

644
00:50:48,893 --> 00:50:51,464
Wes.

645
00:50:51,495 --> 00:50:55,807
- Oh, holy shit!
- I'm so sorry.

646
00:50:55,833 --> 00:50:58,746
Oh, this is crazy. This is not
happening. Who the hell are you?

647
00:50:58,769 --> 00:51:01,978
- I have put you through so much.
- You've put me through so much?

648
00:51:02,006 --> 00:51:04,646
You have no idea what the hell
I've been through. This is insane.

649
00:51:04,675 --> 00:51:07,383
Wes, you need to listen.
I don't have much time.

650
00:51:07,411 --> 00:51:09,118
What the hell
are you doing here?

651
00:51:09,146 --> 00:51:13,094
Please. This is just crazy. Tell me--
tell me this is a dream, please.

652
00:51:14,151 --> 00:51:16,097
It's not.

653
00:51:17,922 --> 00:51:20,425
I'm only here to warn you.

654
00:51:20,458 --> 00:51:22,096
But you're a little late.

655
00:51:22,126 --> 00:51:26,040
Wes, this is really important.
I need you to meet me under the bridge

656
00:51:26,063 --> 00:51:27,974
near the clock tower, alone.

657
00:51:27,999 --> 00:51:30,536
Now hold-- hold on.
You've been dead for a year.

658
00:51:30,568 --> 00:51:33,447
I've been chased around
by these fricking weirdoes.

659
00:51:33,471 --> 00:51:35,678
Now you want me to follow you
to God knows where?

660
00:51:35,706 --> 00:51:37,879
I mean, didn't you care
about me at all?

661
00:51:37,909 --> 00:51:39,980
Of course.

662
00:51:40,011 --> 00:51:42,491
I was trying to protect you.

663
00:51:42,513 --> 00:51:44,424
Well, you're doing a hell of a job.

664
00:51:44,448 --> 00:51:47,429
I've barely been gone a year
and you're already screwing around.

665
00:51:47,451 --> 00:51:50,625
Oh, no. Time out, time out.
You were supposed to be dead.

666
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:53,431
That woman you're with
wants what Isaac wants.

667
00:51:53,457 --> 00:51:56,199
That's insane, completely insane.

668
00:51:56,227 --> 00:51:58,434
I know I have
a lot of explaining to do.

669
00:51:58,462 --> 00:52:00,942
- You think?
- But the less you know the better.

670
00:52:00,965 --> 00:52:03,036
So then it's true.
You did steal from him?

671
00:52:03,067 --> 00:52:06,571
Look, meet me by the clock tower
in the park. And lose the girl.

672
00:52:06,604 --> 00:52:08,641
What?

673
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:11,151
- Oh my God.
- I have to go.

674
00:52:11,175 --> 00:52:12,848
- What?
- We need to split up.

675
00:52:12,877 --> 00:52:15,153
Remember, clock tower,
lose the girl.

676
00:52:33,063 --> 00:52:34,736
Yeah, he's upstairs.

677
00:52:37,802 --> 00:52:40,840
Okay. I'll wait for your instructions.

678
00:52:40,871 --> 00:52:42,873
All right.

679
00:53:08,266 --> 00:53:11,110
Hey, honey.
How have you been?

680
00:53:11,135 --> 00:53:14,947
Good, just pretending
to be dead for a year.

681
00:53:18,776 --> 00:53:20,016
Get down!

682
00:53:21,344 --> 00:53:23,048
Oh, Jesus!

683
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:26,695
Let's go!

684
00:53:30,021 --> 00:53:31,227
What the hell?

685
00:53:31,255 --> 00:53:34,702
Oh, Jesus.

686
00:53:34,725 --> 00:53:37,228
Come on, this way.

687
00:53:37,661 --> 00:53:39,673
Get out of the way!

688
00:53:41,232 --> 00:53:44,236
- Watch out! Wes--
- The gun--

689
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:50,217
- God, he's shooting.
- Get out of my way.

690
00:54:14,932 --> 00:54:17,105
I've got him!

691
00:54:17,134 --> 00:54:19,171
- Hang on.
- Hold him back.

692
00:54:19,203 --> 00:54:21,308
You're going down!

693
00:54:28,045 --> 00:54:30,616
Wes, get down.

694
00:54:52,703 --> 00:54:54,808
You killed him!

695
00:54:54,838 --> 00:54:58,809
- What the hell is going on?!
- I worked for Isaac.

696
00:54:58,843 --> 00:55:02,017
- Wow, I didn't know you at all, did I?
- Look,

697
00:55:02,046 --> 00:55:05,357
I stole $10 million in diamonds
and a list of Isaac's special contacts.

698
00:55:05,382 --> 00:55:07,760
He wants it back.

699
00:55:07,785 --> 00:55:10,129
What the hell kind of business
is this guy in?

700
00:55:10,154 --> 00:55:14,102
He smuggles guns,
weapons, jewels-- whatever.

701
00:55:14,124 --> 00:55:16,263
- So what? He thinks I have the gems?
- Well, we will.

702
00:55:16,293 --> 00:55:18,830
And he won't stop
until we're dead and he has it all.

703
00:55:18,863 --> 00:55:21,104
So what? What-what-what
what do we do?

704
00:55:21,131 --> 00:55:23,771
So lose the girl
and meet me where I said.

705
00:55:23,801 --> 00:55:25,606
I have a plan.

706
00:55:25,936 --> 00:55:28,109
Just trust me.

707
00:55:33,911 --> 00:55:36,892
I'm just a writer!

708
00:55:36,914 --> 00:55:40,088
- Honey, do you have the keys?
- Yeah, I do.

709
00:56:07,711 --> 00:56:09,987
It's a nice spring day.

710
00:56:15,419 --> 00:56:20,198
Cops. And I've got
the murder weapon-- perfect.

711
00:56:38,809 --> 00:56:40,811
Check it out.

712
00:57:57,921 --> 00:58:00,925
Coffee, please. Black.

713
00:58:04,294 --> 00:58:06,296
Thank you.

714
00:58:09,934 --> 00:58:12,312
I love this town.

715
00:58:12,336 --> 00:58:15,317
My dad used to bring me here
when I was little.

716
00:58:18,275 --> 00:58:20,915
Was he in the spy game as well

717
00:58:20,944 --> 00:58:23,823
or did you just
fall into it yourself?

718
00:58:23,847 --> 00:58:26,521
He sold refrigeration equipment.

719
00:58:26,550 --> 00:58:28,826
Believe it or not,
that was my next guess.

720
00:58:28,852 --> 00:58:32,231
Wait, is that code
for "He iced people"?

721
00:58:32,256 --> 00:58:35,931
The only icing he did
was for restaurants.

722
00:58:35,959 --> 00:58:38,235
You made it sound
like they were dead.

723
00:58:38,262 --> 00:58:40,037
They are.

724
00:58:40,064 --> 00:58:42,135
That wasn't a lie.

725
00:58:42,166 --> 00:58:44,112
You know, I never
really lied to you.

726
00:58:44,134 --> 00:58:46,876
- I just never--
- Never told me the truth.

727
00:58:48,071 --> 00:58:50,449
Don't even try it.

728
00:58:50,474 --> 00:58:53,182
Come on, please.

729
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:55,952
- I was in love with you.
- Please, Wes,

730
00:58:55,979 --> 00:58:58,391
just try to understand.

731
00:59:09,193 --> 00:59:11,332
So how have you been,

732
00:59:11,361 --> 00:59:14,433
asides from being
a thief and a liar?

733
00:59:14,465 --> 00:59:16,467
- I don't like your tone.
- You don't like my tone?

734
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:19,504
Oh, I'm sorry. You'll have to excuse me.
I'm not used to having conversations

735
00:59:19,536 --> 00:59:21,948
- with my dead fiancée every day.
- Are you done?

736
00:59:21,972 --> 00:59:24,612
I'm not-- I'm just getting started.
Do you understand

737
00:59:24,641 --> 00:59:26,882
you just killed
another human being?

738
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:29,982
- It's not the first time.
- Jesus Christ!

739
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:35,328
- You know, I went to the bridge--
- You were followed.

740
00:59:35,352 --> 00:59:38,299
- Followed?
- Where's the girl?

741
00:59:38,322 --> 00:59:40,359
She's got a name, by the way.
Her name is Nicole.

742
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:43,428
- And I ditched her like you told me to.
- She's not who she pretends to be.

743
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:46,441
Oh, you've said that already.
Please. She's a nice girl.

744
00:59:46,463 --> 00:59:49,137
She's got nothing to do
with any of this.

745
00:59:49,166 --> 00:59:50,941
She'll leave you
when she gets what she wants.

746
00:59:50,968 --> 00:59:54,575
Hey, listen, honey,
not everyone is a liar like you.

747
00:59:54,605 --> 00:59:57,415
- Wes.
- 'Cause I'm-- I'm a dead man.

748
00:59:57,441 --> 01:00:00,445
Isaac knows where I live.
If he can kill me here,

749
01:00:00,477 --> 01:00:03,287
he can kill me there.
I mean, there's-- there's no escape.

750
01:00:03,313 --> 01:00:05,418
- I can protect you.
- Oh, please.

751
01:00:05,449 --> 01:00:09,420
- Look, you have to believe me.
- I can't even believe my own eyes.

752
01:00:10,421 --> 01:00:12,731
Oh, shit.

753
01:00:17,127 --> 01:00:19,971
Nicole, how's the Bureau?

754
01:00:19,997 --> 01:00:22,443
- How does it feel to be alive?
- You two know each other?

755
01:00:22,466 --> 01:00:25,003
She's been tracking me
for years.

756
01:00:25,035 --> 01:00:26,639
So, Wes, anything
you wanna tell me?

757
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:28,308
Me?
Who the hell are you?

758
01:00:28,338 --> 01:00:29,442
She's a fed.

759
01:00:29,473 --> 01:00:33,182
Wait, wait a sec. You both are in
on this? I don't believe it.

760
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:36,316
- I told you. She wants the diamonds.
- No, we want the list.

761
01:00:36,346 --> 01:00:39,520
I've cared about 2 women in my life
and they've both lied to me.

762
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:43,157
Not little white lies, but big,
huge get-me-killed kind of lies.

763
01:00:43,186 --> 01:00:45,188
I have to go.

764
01:00:47,491 --> 01:00:50,404
Come on, girls. Girls!

765
01:00:50,927 --> 01:00:53,340
Oh, nice!

766
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,672
Ladies, please.

767
01:01:13,550 --> 01:01:14,756
Leave him alone.

768
01:01:14,785 --> 01:01:17,095
That was my pint!

769
01:01:19,523 --> 01:01:21,161
Oh, Jesus Christ.

770
01:01:32,703 --> 01:01:35,377
Crazy fricking women.

771
01:01:35,406 --> 01:01:37,682
Taxi! Hey, taxi!

772
01:01:39,476 --> 01:01:41,046
Oh, come on.

773
01:01:41,078 --> 01:01:42,785
Oh, come on, what the hell?

774
01:01:46,283 --> 01:01:48,388
Hey, that's my beer.

775
01:01:49,653 --> 01:01:51,792
Guys, come on.
Listen, listen.

776
01:01:51,822 --> 01:01:55,770
I have had it with this.
I cannot-- come on.

777
01:01:55,792 --> 01:01:57,794
Hey, please don't put me
in this trunk.

778
01:01:57,828 --> 01:01:59,705
Please. Come on.
I'm claustrophobic.

779
01:01:59,730 --> 01:02:01,710
I don't care what kind
of disease you have.

780
01:02:01,732 --> 01:02:05,305
You son of a--
help me, please. Help me, please.

781
01:02:05,335 --> 01:02:08,950
Oh, God. Oh, God.

782
01:02:09,773 --> 01:02:13,778
Help! Come on!
Let me the hell out of here!

783
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:17,189
Oh, God.

784
01:02:26,423 --> 01:02:28,198
Wes, let's go.

785
01:02:28,225 --> 01:02:29,702
Wes?

786
01:02:30,127 --> 01:02:32,437
- Come on, girlie.
- Hey, hey!

787
01:02:32,463 --> 01:02:34,340
Where are you going?

788
01:02:51,448 --> 01:02:53,553
Hello? Hello?!

789
01:02:53,584 --> 01:02:56,531
- Where are you?
- Sam. Sam! Sam!

790
01:02:56,553 --> 01:02:58,692
I'm in the truck of a car!

791
01:02:58,722 --> 01:03:01,703
- Well, what are you doing there?
- Oh, this is my thing.

792
01:03:01,725 --> 01:03:03,671
It's what I do.
I'm just relaxing.

793
01:03:03,694 --> 01:03:06,834
- Where are they taking you?
- They failed to mention that

794
01:03:06,863 --> 01:03:09,742
- before they threw me in here.
- This is very, very bad.

795
01:03:09,766 --> 01:03:11,871
I don't even understand.
Why did you even leave?

796
01:03:11,902 --> 01:03:15,748
- Because you're both insane!
- Nice. That's very funny,

797
01:03:15,772 --> 01:03:18,480
very cute.

798
01:03:18,508 --> 01:03:21,887
Oh, God, I'm a dead man.
I'm a dead man!

799
01:03:23,747 --> 01:03:25,749
Okay. Well, just relax.

800
01:03:25,782 --> 01:03:28,262
Do you have any idea
where you are?

801
01:03:28,285 --> 01:03:31,198
I don't know, I hear traffic.

802
01:03:31,221 --> 01:03:33,394
- What happened? Are you okay?
- We just hit a bump.

803
01:03:33,423 --> 01:03:37,530
Major pothole.
Drive a little safer, would you?

804
01:03:37,561 --> 01:03:39,234
- Jackass!
- Shut up!

805
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:41,402
You almost gave me
a heart attack.

806
01:03:41,431 --> 01:03:44,742
Oh, wow. Jesus,
I'm so sorry to hear that.

807
01:03:44,768 --> 01:03:47,681
The guy drives like a lunatic.

808
01:03:47,704 --> 01:03:50,150
You have no idea
what I've been through.

809
01:03:50,174 --> 01:03:52,882
Are you actually gonna
guilt-trip me right now?

810
01:03:52,910 --> 01:03:56,380
Wes, if I hadn't died that night,
we would both be dead right now.

811
01:03:56,413 --> 01:03:59,189
Oh, what? So you're gonna say
you did all this shit for me?

812
01:03:59,216 --> 01:04:02,197
- Thanks a lot.
- No. Don't you get it?

813
01:04:02,219 --> 01:04:04,221
I stayed dead
for the both of us.

814
01:04:04,254 --> 01:04:06,495
Hey, hey, while we're at it,

815
01:04:06,523 --> 01:04:09,766
one question:
"Why were you even with me?"

816
01:04:10,193 --> 01:04:12,501
I had enough of your bullshit.

817
01:04:12,529 --> 01:04:14,736
Huh? God!

818
01:04:14,764 --> 01:04:18,906
I felt normal
when I was with you.

819
01:04:18,935 --> 01:04:20,812
You know, I--

820
01:04:20,837 --> 01:04:23,818
I never had to pretend.
I could just be myself.

821
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:26,753
Oh, Christ,
I don't have any bars!

822
01:04:26,777 --> 01:04:29,690
Wes, say something.

823
01:04:30,747 --> 01:04:32,556
Wes?!

824
01:04:35,886 --> 01:04:38,298
Damn it!

825
01:04:43,393 --> 01:04:45,634
Come on, let me out of here!

826
01:04:45,662 --> 01:04:47,835
- I said shut the fuck up!
- Damn it!

827
01:04:49,799 --> 01:04:51,801
My book!

828
01:04:53,003 --> 01:04:55,540
Son of a bitch has no respect.

829
01:05:22,699 --> 01:05:24,679
Come on, Wes!

830
01:05:27,671 --> 01:05:29,708
God, where are you?

831
01:05:31,708 --> 01:05:33,813
Shit.

832
01:05:35,745 --> 01:05:37,747
Where are you?

833
01:05:53,397 --> 01:05:55,001
Oh, God.

834
01:05:55,031 --> 01:05:57,875
- Which ear, the right or the left?
- Please. You don't have to do this.

835
01:05:57,901 --> 01:06:00,609
I won't tell anybody
about you guys' existence. I swear.

836
01:06:00,637 --> 01:06:04,585
Did she honestly think there was
anywhere on this entire planet

837
01:06:04,608 --> 01:06:07,782
- that she could hide from me?
- You seem like nice fellas. Come on.

838
01:06:07,811 --> 01:06:09,757
- Kill him.
- No, no, no, wait, wait.

839
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:11,691
- No ear?
- No. Listen, listen.

840
01:06:11,715 --> 01:06:14,457
I'll put in my next book.
How does that sound?

841
01:06:14,484 --> 01:06:18,398
Like having my balls licked
by a porcupine.

842
01:06:18,421 --> 01:06:20,298
Kill him.

843
01:06:20,323 --> 01:06:22,428
You kill me, you get nothing.

844
01:06:25,695 --> 01:06:28,005
Can I get that?

845
01:06:29,366 --> 01:06:31,745
I know that hurt.

846
01:06:32,769 --> 01:06:34,544
Wes?

847
01:06:34,571 --> 01:06:36,983
No, Alicia.
Or is it Sam?

848
01:06:37,007 --> 01:06:39,715
Let me talk to Wes!

849
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:43,350
I know my diamonds are nearby.
Shall we go get them?

850
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:47,522
- And no, that is not a question.
- I need him to get the package.

851
01:06:48,785 --> 01:06:52,733
So many problems and distractions.

852
01:06:52,756 --> 01:06:55,930
Okay. Come to the corner
of Washington and First.

853
01:06:55,959 --> 01:06:58,735
And please don't make me
hurt him.

854
01:06:58,762 --> 01:07:00,806
I swear to God, Isa--

855
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:05,846
God damn it!

856
01:07:27,557 --> 01:07:31,471
Hello?! I'm actually
quite good in here now.

857
01:07:31,494 --> 01:07:33,440
Very comfortable, quite cozy.

858
01:07:33,463 --> 01:07:36,501
I said shut the fuck up!

859
01:07:56,419 --> 01:07:58,899
You've been
a very naughty girl, Alicia.

860
01:07:58,922 --> 01:08:00,924
Where's Wes?

861
01:08:00,957 --> 01:08:02,959
What? No kiss?

862
01:08:11,568 --> 01:08:14,515
What? Come on, come on!

863
01:08:14,538 --> 01:08:18,076
- Let me out of here, you--
- Wes, we're gonna get you out.

864
01:08:18,108 --> 01:08:21,487
- He has to go in alone.
- Is that you, Sam?

865
01:08:21,511 --> 01:08:23,889
Get me the hell out of here.

866
01:08:27,717 --> 01:08:31,028
Hi, honey. There's some good stuff
in here. You should read it.

867
01:08:34,457 --> 01:08:36,459
All right, what the hell is going on?

868
01:08:36,493 --> 01:08:39,906
- Sweetie, you have to go in the bank.
- Another bank?

869
01:08:39,930 --> 01:08:41,705
What am I supposed
to do in there now?

870
01:08:41,731 --> 01:08:44,007
Look, everything you need
is inside.

871
01:08:48,672 --> 01:08:51,846
Don't be a hero, Mr. Wilson,

872
01:08:51,875 --> 01:08:56,483
or I'll put 2 more holes in her,
and I don't mean the good kind.

873
01:08:56,513 --> 01:08:59,722
I can't believe I signed
a book for this guy.

874
01:09:00,784 --> 01:09:03,060
Stay close, sweetheart.

875
01:09:11,494 --> 01:09:14,498
This is unbelievable.

876
01:09:15,599 --> 01:09:18,045
Oh, okay.

877
01:09:21,705 --> 01:09:23,514
Good morning, sir.

878
01:09:24,641 --> 01:09:27,121
Hi. I need to get in
to the safety deposit box.

879
01:09:27,143 --> 01:09:29,987
- Passport.
- Right. Of course.

880
01:09:30,013 --> 01:09:32,118
My fiancée, she passed away.

881
01:09:33,048 --> 01:09:36,062
She died, yep.
Rest in peace.

882
01:09:36,086 --> 01:09:38,862
Put your right hand
on the screen, please.

883
01:09:38,889 --> 01:09:40,527
Right.

884
01:09:42,525 --> 01:09:43,866
High tech.

885
01:09:49,166 --> 01:09:51,168
- Your key.
- Thank you.

886
01:09:51,201 --> 01:09:53,306
You're welcome. This way.

887
01:10:15,191 --> 01:10:16,932
Jackass.

888
01:10:47,190 --> 01:10:49,761
"Dearest, I will make
this up to you in ways

889
01:10:49,793 --> 01:10:52,774
you cannot even begin to imagine.
I always knew I loved you.

890
01:10:52,796 --> 01:10:55,140
And this time I promise
never to let go.

891
01:10:55,164 --> 01:10:58,145
Most importantly, my love,
please walk out the back door."

892
01:11:24,861 --> 01:11:29,207
Sir? Sir? You can't go
that way. Sir.

893
01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:32,873
Shit!

894
01:11:39,008 --> 01:11:41,215
There he goes.

895
01:11:44,247 --> 01:11:47,160
Open the door.
Get out of the car!

896
01:11:47,583 --> 01:11:49,322
What the fuck, you son of a--

897
01:11:49,352 --> 01:11:52,356
No, no, no, you simple bastard.
Go after him!

898
01:11:52,388 --> 01:11:54,629
Bring me my diamonds!

899
01:11:54,657 --> 01:11:57,365
I haven't shot anyone
in a long time.

900
01:12:07,937 --> 01:12:09,439
Wes, what are you doing?

901
01:13:17,106 --> 01:13:18,915
- God!
- Hey!

902
01:13:18,942 --> 01:13:21,047
- What are you doing?
- Hey, come back here!

903
01:13:32,021 --> 01:13:34,023
Yeah!

904
01:14:23,206 --> 01:14:25,914
Let's go.
Come on! Come on!

905
01:14:59,107 --> 01:15:01,486
Aye aye.

906
01:15:16,893 --> 01:15:19,271
Come on!

907
01:15:23,466 --> 01:15:25,969
Come on!

908
01:15:38,047 --> 01:15:39,526
Holy shit.

909
01:15:39,549 --> 01:15:42,359
Sam, what the hell
are we doing?

910
01:15:42,385 --> 01:15:46,060
Oh my God.

911
01:15:57,266 --> 01:15:59,576
- Where's the list?
- What list?

912
01:15:59,602 --> 01:16:01,980
I was hired to get
a list of Isaac's clients.

913
01:16:02,005 --> 01:16:04,952
What clients?
Who are you people?

914
01:16:04,974 --> 01:16:08,012
I can't leave empty-handed.

915
01:16:08,044 --> 01:16:10,547
- Sorry, babe.
- So now you're gonna shoot me.

916
01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:13,584
I don't believe it. Here, look.
See it for yourself. There is no list.

917
01:16:20,690 --> 01:16:24,160
- Wes, grab the case.
- Thank God.

918
01:16:24,193 --> 01:16:27,504
- Give me that.
- Here.

919
01:16:27,530 --> 01:16:31,000
- So you don't go away empty-handed.
- The list?

920
01:16:31,034 --> 01:16:33,310
Names, numbers--
it's all there.

921
01:16:33,336 --> 01:16:36,010
I never did those things
your people said I did.

922
01:16:36,038 --> 01:16:38,609
I was the thief. Once I figured out
what else was going on,

923
01:16:38,641 --> 01:16:40,484
that's when I tried to get out.

924
01:16:40,510 --> 01:16:42,690
I'll pass that along.

925
01:16:48,518 --> 01:16:50,555
Get down here.

926
01:16:50,586 --> 01:16:52,429
I'll cover you guys. Go!

927
01:16:55,958 --> 01:16:57,960
Let's go.

928
01:17:01,531 --> 01:17:03,477
Go!

929
01:17:24,353 --> 01:17:26,697
Ah, see there?
There's Nicole. Stop the car.

930
01:17:26,722 --> 01:17:29,259
Come on, you gotta pick her up.
She gave us cover.

931
01:17:29,292 --> 01:17:31,067
- Stop the car!
- Okay, fine.

932
01:17:31,093 --> 01:17:33,095
You can't just leave her
out here.

933
01:17:35,431 --> 01:17:37,308
Thanks.

934
01:17:37,333 --> 01:17:41,748
All right, we're all together.
Let's go. Go, go, go!

935
01:17:41,771 --> 01:17:44,411
Thank you, Nicole,
for the cover there.

936
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:47,250
Look, why don't you drop me off
on the next corner here?

937
01:17:47,276 --> 01:17:50,086
I can go for a latte
and a deep-tissue.

938
01:17:50,112 --> 01:17:51,489
Shut up, Wes!

939
01:17:51,514 --> 01:17:54,495
Sweetness just keeps pouring
right out of you, you know that?

940
01:17:54,517 --> 01:17:56,428
He's right behind us!

941
01:17:56,452 --> 01:17:58,557
- Check the glove box.
- Perfect.

942
01:17:58,588 --> 01:18:00,660
Hold on!

943
01:18:03,793 --> 01:18:06,637
Jesus, she's crazy!

944
01:18:12,635 --> 01:18:15,047
I'm gonna be sick!

945
01:18:15,071 --> 01:18:16,516
God, no!

946
01:18:20,443 --> 01:18:22,650
Whoa! Hey!
Watch it!

947
01:18:22,678 --> 01:18:23,958
Hold on!

948
01:18:33,723 --> 01:18:35,532
I think we've lost him.

949
01:18:49,439 --> 01:18:52,420
Just do me a favor.
What do they say in mob terms?

950
01:18:52,441 --> 01:18:54,580
- Just take me out.
- That would be getting whacked.

951
01:18:54,610 --> 01:18:58,422
- Whacked, wiped-out, whatever.
- Look, just tell me one thing,

952
01:18:58,447 --> 01:19:01,155
- are you in love with her?
- Love is a beautiful thing.

953
01:19:01,184 --> 01:19:04,290
People meet. They fall in love.
They have normal relationships.

954
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,300
- She's using you.
- Just sit back there

955
01:19:06,322 --> 01:19:08,063
- and enjoy the ride, missy.
- Girls, girls,

956
01:19:08,090 --> 01:19:11,469
didn't you learn anything
from my book?

957
01:19:11,494 --> 01:19:16,170
Chapter 7: "Communication Is
the Key to Any Successful Relationship."

958
01:19:17,834 --> 01:19:19,541
- Jesus!
- Get down!

959
01:19:19,568 --> 01:19:21,548
I'm gonna kill
these sons of bitches!

960
01:19:27,410 --> 01:19:29,686
Look out!

961
01:19:33,382 --> 01:19:35,259
I don't care anymore!

962
01:19:35,284 --> 01:19:36,763
Cut them off!

963
01:19:36,786 --> 01:19:39,232
Do it!

964
01:19:40,389 --> 01:19:42,835
- What are you doing?
- I'm going in the park.

965
01:19:42,858 --> 01:19:46,135
What!
Don't go in the park!

966
01:19:46,162 --> 01:19:48,472
Stay on them!

967
01:19:48,497 --> 01:19:51,171
To the bridge.

968
01:19:52,368 --> 01:19:55,349
There's pedestrians everywhere.
You're gonna kill somebody.

969
01:19:55,371 --> 01:19:58,215
You know what?
Just a little support would be nice.

970
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:01,187
You know what?
I don't like anything you do-- nothing.

971
01:20:01,210 --> 01:20:04,487
Nothing! Shit!

972
01:20:16,492 --> 01:20:18,472
You got 'em!
You got 'em!

973
01:20:21,163 --> 01:20:23,237
Get down!

974
01:20:24,333 --> 01:20:28,543
Shoot him! Shoot him!

975
01:20:28,571 --> 01:20:31,347
I think you lost 'em!
Nice driving.

976
01:20:31,374 --> 01:20:32,478
Fuck you!

977
01:20:40,415 --> 01:20:42,628
Nice work, honey!

978
01:20:55,198 --> 01:20:56,778
Oh, Jesus.

979
01:20:57,199 --> 01:20:59,338
We gotta get out!

980
01:21:02,338 --> 01:21:03,544
Shit.

981
01:21:05,774 --> 01:21:07,715
I'm alive!

982
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:14,259
Wes, help me.

983
01:21:20,422 --> 01:21:22,402
- Come on, honey.
- The case.

984
01:21:22,425 --> 01:21:24,336
Just leave it.

985
01:21:27,463 --> 01:21:29,704
Oh, come on! Nicole!

986
01:21:29,732 --> 01:21:31,302
I'm a big girl. Just go.

987
01:21:35,371 --> 01:21:37,681
Up this hill, come on!

988
01:21:37,707 --> 01:21:40,313
Get back. What are you doing.
Come on, let's go.

989
01:21:40,442 --> 01:21:41,821
- Come on!

990
01:21:41,844 --> 01:21:44,484
They're getting away!

991
01:21:52,688 --> 01:21:55,328
Up here.

992
01:21:59,028 --> 01:22:01,804
Get through there.
Come on.

993
01:22:01,831 --> 01:22:04,334
Shit, he's coming.

994
01:22:09,505 --> 01:22:11,084
Come on!

995
01:22:17,212 --> 01:22:19,290
Go go go!

996
01:22:19,315 --> 01:22:20,817
Oh God.

997
01:22:22,818 --> 01:22:24,855
Shit!

998
01:22:24,887 --> 01:22:26,594
Come on, let's go!

999
01:22:28,324 --> 01:22:29,528
Wes!

1000
01:22:31,026 --> 01:22:33,529
Ah! I'm shot!

1001
01:22:33,562 --> 01:22:36,736
- Oh, God!
- Drop it!

1002
01:22:36,766 --> 01:22:39,508
I'll finish him.

1003
01:22:39,535 --> 01:22:42,311
- Drop it.
- It stings.

1004
01:22:42,738 --> 01:22:44,045
God!

1005
01:22:44,073 --> 01:22:46,073
God!

1006
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:53,793
- Wes?
- God.

1007
01:22:53,816 --> 01:22:56,319
Somebody get an ambulance!

1008
01:22:56,352 --> 01:22:59,925
We need help!
Call an ambulance!

1009
01:23:04,026 --> 01:23:07,439
- Somebody help!
- God! The pain!

1010
01:23:07,463 --> 01:23:09,602
Apply pressure.
Apply pressure.

1011
01:23:09,632 --> 01:23:11,873
- Right here.
- I got it, I got it, I got it.

1012
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:14,676
- Oh, guys!
- Okay. You're okay.

1013
01:23:16,972 --> 01:23:19,043
You're okay.
Just relax. Just relax, Wes.

1014
01:23:19,074 --> 01:23:22,886
Don't get up. Don't get up.

1015
01:23:22,912 --> 01:23:25,791
I've never seen my own blood.
It's too much!

1016
01:23:25,814 --> 01:23:29,762
- Where is she going? Oh my God! Jesus!
- Just relax. You're okay.

1017
01:23:29,785 --> 01:23:31,355
You're okay. You're okay.

1018
01:23:33,389 --> 01:23:36,529
- You're okay, Wes.
- The pain!

1019
01:23:36,559 --> 01:23:38,630
- It's fine, okay.
- Jesus.

1020
01:23:38,661 --> 01:23:42,336
I'm passing out,
I can feel it.

1021
01:24:26,008 --> 01:24:28,852
Nice to see you again, Isaac.

1022
01:24:32,180 --> 01:24:34,786
Seat belts must remain fastened

1023
01:24:34,817 --> 01:24:37,923
until we reach
our cruising altitude.

1024
01:24:41,657 --> 01:24:44,866
I had a dream once
and you took that from me.

1025
01:24:44,894 --> 01:24:48,034
So now I'm gonna take all of yours.

1026
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:08,191
Hope you took
your flying lessons.

1027
01:25:08,217 --> 01:25:09,628
You wonderful little--

1028
01:25:22,464 --> 01:25:24,944
<i>Pull up, pull up!</i>

1029
01:25:28,570 --> 01:25:31,210
<i>Terrain coming.</i>

1030
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:33,083
<i>Pull up, pull up.</i>

1031
01:25:36,979 --> 01:25:39,653
So in the end
Isaac's plane crashes

1032
01:25:39,681 --> 01:25:43,493
- and Sam parachutes to safety.
- Okay.

1033
01:25:43,519 --> 01:25:45,965
So Sam is still alive
leading a double life.

1034
01:25:47,988 --> 01:25:50,095
This is good stuff.

1035
01:25:50,126 --> 01:25:52,003
All right, check this out, man.

1036
01:25:52,027 --> 01:25:55,941
"She stole millions of dollars worth
of gems from a relentless madman.

1037
01:25:55,964 --> 01:25:59,844
Now he will hunt her to the ends of
the earth and beyond to get them back."

1038
01:25:59,868 --> 01:26:02,041
This is good.
You know what we should do?

1039
01:26:02,071 --> 01:26:04,483
Let's change Spokane to Paris.

1040
01:26:04,506 --> 01:26:06,247
I think it's much better.

1041
01:26:06,275 --> 01:26:08,551
I don't know, Marty.

1042
01:26:08,577 --> 01:26:11,615
Real life can be pretty
damn exciting sometimes.

1043
01:26:13,549 --> 01:26:15,586
Is this about the check?
Where are you going?

1044
01:26:31,767 --> 01:26:33,542
Excuse me.

1045
01:26:33,569 --> 01:26:36,778
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought
you were somebody else.

1046
01:26:48,984 --> 01:26:53,091
<i>* I know in my heart</i>

1047
01:26:53,122 --> 01:26:57,571
<i>* I can make it all
up to you</i>

1048
01:26:57,593 --> 01:27:00,073
<i>* This feeling of love
doesn't know</i>

1049
01:27:00,095 --> 01:27:01,972
<i>* If it has a chance
to grow</i>

1050
01:27:01,997 --> 01:27:03,999
<i>* Time will tell what you do...</i>

1051
01:27:04,032 --> 01:27:05,909
I'm Sam.

1052
01:27:05,935 --> 01:27:07,312
I'm a spy.

1053
01:27:07,336 --> 01:27:09,247
No kidding.

1054
01:27:09,271 --> 01:27:11,581
Is there anything
I could say

1055
01:27:11,607 --> 01:27:14,144
that could get you
back to my place?

1056
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:16,952
- No.
- Why not?

1057
01:27:16,979 --> 01:27:20,586
Because you're just a spy.

1058
01:27:20,616 --> 01:27:22,960
You know,
I'm not really just a writer.

1059
01:27:22,985 --> 01:27:24,987
No?

1060
01:27:26,889 --> 01:27:28,630
Isaac was right.

1061
01:27:28,657 --> 01:27:31,934
Diamonds truly are
a girl's best friend.

1062
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:38,800
Subtitles: Arigon

1063
01:28:14,670 --> 01:28:17,879
I couldn't help but overhear
you guys talking.

1064
01:28:17,906 --> 01:28:20,147
- I understand you're an agent?
- That's right.

1065
01:28:20,175 --> 01:28:22,655
I got this idea for a book.

1066
01:28:22,678 --> 01:28:26,148
It's a cookbook with recipes
for couples in trouble.

1067
01:28:26,181 --> 01:28:28,661
- Who else knows about this?
- Nobody.

1068
01:28:28,684 --> 01:28:32,996
Well, a few, but they're
not around anymore.

1069
01:28:33,022 --> 01:28:35,730
Let's keep it that way.
Martin Rivera.

1070
01:28:35,758 --> 01:28:37,931
Nice to meet ya.
