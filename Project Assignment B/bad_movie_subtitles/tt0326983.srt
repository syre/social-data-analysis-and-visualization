1
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,200
I must say that certainly won this round.

2
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:12,000
Right for you is all boxing match in which he must win each round, Vijay.

3
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,400
Do not run away to marry?
- Not at all.

4
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,900
Marry with the consent of their parents, or else had become a monk.

5
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,800
Prayers, palanquin (covered litter) and work all day I guess I'll be very boring.

6
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,800
Or will I marry Nita on the Internet or in court.

7
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,500
But will you marry me, right?

8
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,200
That's enough for me.

9
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,600
Atul, you promised me in the name of our friendship that ...

10
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,800
... until I find my Preity you will not marry.

11
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,100
Congratulations, Radzhesh ... You will die a bachelor.

12
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,700
Do not worry. You and I will be married together.

13
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,300
Pinky will take the clutches of her mother.

14
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,600
You are my friend, my companion!

15
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
It seems that he conceived a new joke.

16
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,900
And he laughs before it is told.

17
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,500
He just could not finish any.
- Go ahead

18
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,200
Enjoy.

19
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,200
One girl who would marry his mother asked ...

20
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,700
... What is the first marriage night?
- I do not know.

21
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,600
The girl and asked her sister but she also knew.

22
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,500
I finally asked an elderly woman about seventy years ...

23
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,700
She said: "My dear girl, these things do not learn."

24
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,500
"No school that you be taught. But if you still have some reservations ...

25
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,700
"I do not mind if they replace."

26
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,400
Who are you?

27
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,700
Do not you recognize me? Did you forget to Move?

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,800
You came in that state because the girl you love.

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,500
An accident. Ripped from the clutches of death ...

30
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,700
... to congratulate them. I wish I had gone to the hospital rather than come here.

31
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,200
For a while I would hang portraits of flowers.

32
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,300
Thank you for saving me the cost to buy you flowers.

33
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,200
I did not come here as a pauper. Here's diamond necklace.

34
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,200
On behalf of me and Rashmi. The two of you.

35
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,800
Radzhesh, Ashok was very proud of the wealth of his family.

36
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,900
Please do not ignore it.
- What you say ...

37
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,400
... who knows the character of Ashok?

38
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,800
Rashmi ...

39
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,200
I, uh ...

40
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,900
Will not you say something?

41
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,100
I ...
- Go!

42
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,900
What is it, Radzhesh? Have you invited beggars to their wedding?

43
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,500
Here's some money. Pray for us all.

44
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,600
Get them.

45
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,600
Ella.

46
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,800
You called me a beggar. Forget your wealth ...

47
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,900
This is money that will give you the wedding my Rakshmi.

48
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,100
And you will drop music.

49
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,800
Look, Vijay ... this will be fun.

50
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,400
This is the end of yet another Romeo.

51
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,300
If there is one who can embrace this girl ...

52
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:47,200
and return without obtaining a slap it would give him $ 500.

53
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,600
Here are 500 of me.
- And me too.

54
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,700
Me too.

55
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,400
Who of us will go?

56
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,700
No.

57
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,700
Cowards. I will go.

58
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,000
He stepped on the table!

59
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,800
Have you no shame? You're in love with me, and hugged him.

60
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,300
Who is he? What connection you have with him?

61
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,700
He was like a brother. He had a sister that looked just like me.

62
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,500
She died in an accident. Then what's wrong with her sister to hug his brother?

63
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,800
Hey ... have you gone mad? take my money.

64
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,100
I can read lips. Hugged you after you called your sister.

65
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,500
Will you return my money or should they tell you a and to the other?

66
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,300
One moment ... you're my brother, here.

67
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,100
Look what hunger to read his face. Let him go and hit a shoulder.

68
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,300
Atul, what will happen tonight?
- Tonight is his first wedding night.

69
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,100
Then what is still here?
- I guess that makes plans for your family!

70
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,600
Guys what you are saying?
- I starved ...

71
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,600
Worry about your guests. Go!
- Go and celebrate their first wedding night!

72
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,900
It will not come back hungry from this room.

73
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
What happened, Radzhesh?

74
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,400
My wife ...

75
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,300
Go and look what happens with his wife.

76
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
Call an ambulance. Quick!

77
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,500
Open door.
- Beat the January

78
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,200
You look here and you over there.

79
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,100
What happened with your wife, Radzhesh?

80
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,600
Tell us Radzhesh ...

81
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,100
Bride's clothes.
- Searched everywhere. Nobody.

82
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,400
We must immediately call the police.

83
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,300
When you enter that room you find someone else there?

84
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,500
There was nobody else.
- Where Radzhesh met this girl?

85
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,700
We do not know.
- And how is the girl?

86
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,100
And do not know.
- Only those clothes ...

87
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,200
is impossible to find the murderer. If someone can give us a clue ...

88
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,400
murder of that girl that none of you know anything.

89
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,200
One time, Inspector. I shot the girl during the wedding.

90
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,800
I can show you these photos.
- Great.

91
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,700
Go and quickly bring these photos.
- I'll get them.

92
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,700
The girl just came out!

93
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,500
How is this possible? Who was she?

94
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,500
Today I am only a spirit ... but until recently I had a massage

95
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,600
I had friends and also ...

96
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:59,400
What a shame. Not to say you love a girl who crazy!

97
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,400
What should I do, the Wild? Rashmi is in love with Ashok.

98
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,900
No, Prem. Rashmi's mother is ill with cancer.

99
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,100
But Ashok is the one who pays the cost of her treatment

100
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,300
Rashmi is helpless. Otherwise, no girl will not allow ...

101
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,000
someone as arrogant as Ashok to get close to it.

102
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,300
With what you said seems to remove a thorn from my body.

103
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,500
Will immediately go to Rashmi and will tell you what I feel for her.

104
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,600
What is it?
- It should tell you something.

105
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,900
First tell me what to tell her of it.

106
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,600
What is it?
- Well, I ...

107
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,600
what say? Nothing for sure.

108
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,600
Oh yeah ... I can not remember anything. What I wanted to say?

109
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,700
I forgot.

110
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,600
Move reminded me of a joke. ... Like it

111
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,600
I'm famous for two things, too. ... My memory

112
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:04,000
And?
- And ... forgot

113
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,800
You gave lessons in love the premium. Why not give me the opportunity for me?

114
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,100
I'll prove it, best of all.

115
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,300
Really? Then go.
- Where?

116
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,200
When the director.
- Just a joke Wild!

117
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,300
And you became so serious?
- If you knew that ...

118
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,300
there would be picking on you. Right? Let's go.

119
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,400
What happens hero?
- You broke your heart or your head?

120
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,900
Broken head I'll complain. Alas, today I am heartbroken.

121
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,900
Why God entitle only girls to break our hearts?

122
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,800
This is your problem. How does God deal with the heart stuff and girls?

123
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Everybody knows that its atheist, Atul. Do not try to affecting us now.

124
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,600
Come on, Madan.

125
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:59,000
Vivek, you are a friend for whom I killed and I also gave her life for him.

126
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,700
Do not stop any of you guys to believe in God.

127
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,300
But I do not believe in someone whom I have not seen. Point on the issue.

128
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:13,100
Atul, every human being must believe in God, to some extent at least.

129
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,800
I am sure they will soon be something that happens to affect your faith.

130
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,900
Why leave the house and dorm came in the middle of the period?

131
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,500
Actually, my father is not well behaved.

132
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,500
Since my mother insisted it away.

133
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,000
You?

134
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,600
How come?
- Through the window.

135
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,100
If you do not mind and will also close the windows.

136
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:00,600
As you know, strengthen personal relationships behind closed doors.

137
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,200
You guys are so shameless, no respect for anyone.

138
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,600
Respect it?

139
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,300
If we start to respect anyone who would rape then?

140
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,400
Let me go!

141
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,700
Leave me alone!

142
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,300
Them sufficiently punished for being touched my Wild.

143
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,400
For attempted rape, however, they must be nakazani.Yu

144
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:37,700
Sir, this is shameful guys feel ashamed to call them students.

145
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,100
Today, women have entered the hostel and tried to rape one of the girls.

146
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,300
If I was a former graduate of this college ...

147
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,500
I would give them to the police or I would arrange them yourself so ...

148
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,400
that even their parents would not know them.

149
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,000
Take them to the police!
- No, sir.

150
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,000
You've devoted my entire life to build the reputation of this college.

151
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,100
You are our ideal.

152
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:10,300
For their shameful actions you will punish them.

153
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,400
What a shame!

154
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,300
Students from my college ...?

155
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:23,100
Except both of you, I will take care ...

156
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,200
none of you both not to be accepted into any of the colleges in the city.

157
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,900
Forgive us, sir. We made a mistake.

158
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,700
This will destroy our lives, sir.

159
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:39,100
We had lost his mind, sir. Sir, give my word to you

160
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,100
We never perform such an error. Please forgive us, sir!

161
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:47,900
If there is anyone in this world who can forgive is Wild.

162
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,200
Wild, we know that not deserve forgiveness

163
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:56,600
but we ask you ... please forgive us.

164
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,800
God forgives even the first sin.

165
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,600
Forgive them. Anyone can make a mistake.

166
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,800
If they had done such a thing of Preity, what would you do then?

167
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,100
I was going to break their heads and extremities.

168
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,300
But now they ask for your forgiveness. Forgive them.

169
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,300
If someone asks me for sure so I'll forgive him.

170
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,000
Wild, I want to say something.

171
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,000
Just as they look even heart of the dead will begin to fight.

172
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,100
They are energetic young men ... imagine what they feel.

173
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,600
Hey! You convince you it or try to criticize her?

174
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,800
Trying to convince her.

175
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,700
Wild, please forgive them.

176
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,600
Wild, or throw chop asked to vote in a democratic way ...

177
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,800
The result will be the same ... you'll have to forgive them.

178
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:57,500
Wild must make a compromise after all they ask so much.

179
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,900
Otherwise you will think that you're too proud of its beauty, right?

180
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,200
Come on, forgive them.

181
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,700
I will tell you a joke. You Wild to laugh ...

182
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:14,200
and say that you forgive. Wife asks her husband how ...

183
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:20,200
Kings have lived hundreds of women who had in the past.

184
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,400
Wife said: "Forget about how women feed their ..."

185
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,100
"Imagine a king ate a can a hundred women!"

186
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,100
It seems that she forgive them.

187
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,100
"Let's go, my love ..."

188
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,500
"Let me look into your eyes and forget the outside world."

189
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,300
"Where?" Where? "

190
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,000
"There ..."

191
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,600
"To have fun, to get everything from my youth."

192
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,000
"My love, you're right girl for me."

193
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,900
"Let's go, my love ..."

194
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,800
"Let me look into your eyes and forget the outside world."

195
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,300
"Where?" Where? "

196
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,700
"There ..."

197
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,600
"To have fun, to get everything from my youth."

198
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,900
"My love, you're right man for me."

199
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,000
"You're trembling. You're intoxicating as wine."

200
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,900
"You bewitch and steal the heart of this poor Pandzhabets.

201
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,700
"Nestled in my arms, even if it gets slow ..."

202
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
"The way you talk makes my heart flutters its wings."

203
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,400
"My beloved mad, you probably his magician."

204
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,800
"So listen to my request, this is what I want."

205
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,200
"Let's go, my love ..."

206
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,600
"Let me look into your eyes and forget the outside world."

207
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,100
"Where?" Where? "

208
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,800
"There ..."

209
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,500
"To have fun, to get everything from my youth."

210
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,000
"My love, you're right man for me."

211
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,600
"My love, you're right girl for me."

212
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,600
"Let all the world envy us."

213
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,200
"Let us continue to love."

214
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,200
"We Dihana mix ..."

215
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,000
"We'll have fun and dance bangra.

216
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,100
"You are so beautiful that won my heart."

217
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:03,100
"Never stray from me."

218
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,500
"Let's go, my love ..."

219
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,300
"Let me look into your eyes and forget the outside world."

220
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,000
"Where?" Where? "

221
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,300
"There ..."

222
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,200
"To have fun, to get everything from my youth."

223
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,600
"My love, you're right girl for me."

224
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,800
"My love, you're right man for me."

225
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,600
I will always dance at weddings for other people?

226
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,100
Will there be a day when others will dance at our wedding?

227
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,500
Others will dance on our wedding too.

228
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,400
"But I'm going to London on business tonight, the Wild."

229
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,400
As soon returned and will fix a date for our wedding.

230
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,200
This I came to tell me?

231
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,100
This came to tell you in the dorm that day ...

232
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,300
but could not because of those bastards.

233
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,200
Why do not you say you want the bride to finish first?

234
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,100
My last exams are in two months.

235
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
What time will you fly an airplane?

236
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,600
You will send me to the airport.

237
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,800
My brother will come there.

238
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,700
Brother ...

239
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:23,700
always been with me and I never lacked anything.

240
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:29,400
Now you go to London, and I feel like everything goes with you.

241
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:37,800
Vivek, you can reveal your heart because your younger than me.

242
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,000
I'll be back in a few months.

243
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,500
You can learn a lot in my absence.

244
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,700
If you do not finish will receive half of the shares in the company ...

245
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:54,800
as the will of the Father. You know that. ... I say this

246
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:00,400
I am your brother. Right?
- Stepbrother you say?

247
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,200
Do not laugh again to say a word.

248
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,600
Sorry, brother. You'll never pronounce that word.

249
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,300
"Come to me ..."

250
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,900
"Come ..."

251
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:01,400
'My life will sacrifice for you. "

252
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:08,700
"My life, I will pay for you."

253
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:16,700
"Even in death, I will love you."

254
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,800
"Come to me ... do it ..."

255
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,100
How did you end up there at midnight, Wild?

256
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:54,900
I do not know. I felt as though someone was calling me.

257
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:59,500
Whose voice was the Wild? Male or female?

258
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,900
It's not like you. Male or female, go on further!

259
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,800
I am glad that they saw coming out of the door.

260
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,300
Girls go to college. I will be prepared and will come shortly.

261
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,800
Can I come, Vasundra?

262
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,600
Can I come, Vasundra?

263
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:43,300
You think you can scare me by hiding and calling me?

264
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,600
Come out and show if you have courage! Come on!

265
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,600
I expect it here for centuries.

266
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,000
I do not want to hear anything said by you.

267
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:17,100
You have no wine. Man forget his past life, every time when it is born.

268
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,100
Stay at least in the name of the connection we share through the ages.

269
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:24,300
Neither I have lived for centuries or something between us.

270
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,000
So why lose control of themselves and come obsessed with my song?

271
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:33,300
In your heart you know that you and I share the indestructible link Vasundra.

272
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,100
Vasundra, what ...? My name is Wild.

273
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,600
No matter how they are called in this life ...

274
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,400
your real name is Vasundra. And I'm point.

275
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:48,000
We were two of the same type. You and I were cobras, love one another.

276
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,000
Cobra? My favorite?
- Yes, Vasundra to.

277
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,700
There was only one difference between us.

278
00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:04,200
I was a snake with supernatural powers. And upon completion of one hundred years ...

279
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:08,000
I also would acquire such forces.
Supernatural forces, and snakes?

280
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,100
I can not understand anything.
- I know everything.

281
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,400
Currently used as a cobra, get the diamond that lies on my head ...

282
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:21,400
and put it on his lips. You will remember everything.

283
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:40,400
"Come to me"

284
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:46,300
"Come to me"

285
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,800
"Come to me"

286
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,700
"Come to me"

287
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:41,700
"My life, I will pay for you."

288
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:48,200
"Even in death, I will love."

289
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:59,300
"My life, I will pay for you."

290
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:05,600
"Even in death, I will love you."

291
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:54,200
"This is a promise of one who loves you ..."

292
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,000
"This promise will never be compromised."

293
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:05,000
"This is the sense of unity of the one who loves you ..."

294
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,200
"We'll never be apart."

295
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,100
"I long for you every moment."

296
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:21,500
"Love is the great promise of any other oath."

297
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:27,000
"That promise made by love, will indeed honor"

298
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,700
"Come to me"

299
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:16,300
"Even if heaven and earth no longer exist ..."

300
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,800
"Even when the seasons change ..."

301
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:29,800
In the air permeated with romance, you and I will live. "

302
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:38,000
"Love is not afraid of the world."

303
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:43,700
"Love never dies."

304
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:49,500
"In each incarnation I'll have."

305
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:54,100
"Come to me"

306
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:59,100
"Come to me"

307
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,200
Snake

308
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,500
And his companion.

309
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,800
You ruined my years of repentance.

310
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:33,400
Tonight, when the full moon is exalted in heaven I would have met with the Creator.

311
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,400
But you hindered me to do it.

312
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:42,700
Zmiyo, you can accept any form that you want but I damn.

313
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:51,400
Sunset with your sweetheart that you love so much die.

314
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:04,500
And you will live alone cursed life.

315
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:10,800
Ruth, a priest! How to Meditate here will know ...

316
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,600
we never had to make the mistake of coming here.

317
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:23,500
Not a mistake! This is sin! A sin deserves punishment.

318
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:32,300
Correct us not thus! Wisdom you ought to forgive us.

319
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:37,200
Have mercy, forgive us!
- Impossible!

320
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:41,200
Like an arrow that is placed on the bow ...

321
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,300
like life can not continue when the body is absorbed by the fire ...

322
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,600
also my curse can not be repealed!
- One without the other we can not live.

323
00:37:53,900 --> 00:38:00,600
God is love. We do not divide. Do not do it ...

324
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:05,200
Our sin was inadvertent. Forgive us, priest.

325
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:11,800
Without each other we can not live!
- My curse is irreversible.

326
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:22,100
Not even God can not annul it.
- No! If you are relentless ...

327
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:26,800
then we are also steadfast. Or will forgive us ...

328
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:30,300
or we will beat both this scale and will kill him.

329
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,200
"Forgive our priest."

330
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,600
Give us your forgiveness.

331
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,000
Honor.

332
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,100
Forgiveness.

333
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,300
Forgive us.

334
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,900
Have mercy.

335
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,300
Forgive me.

336
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,200
Stop.

337
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:07,300
I can not revoke his curse but I can mention time.

338
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:13,900
But it will be extremely difficult.
- I will do everything.

339
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,600
Vasundra! You can not leave me.

340
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,200
Vasundra! I can not live without you.

341
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,900
Vasundra! You can not leave me.

342
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,300
No! You can not leave me.

343
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:50,500
To return it must pass a very long vigil.

344
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,800
To get it back, I'll be waiting ages.

345
00:39:54,300 --> 00:40:01,100
In the 21st century will Vasundra reborn in a woman.

346
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:07,000
Then your love will be immortal.

347
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:15,900
I can not see anyone except my Vasundra. Bless me to not see anyone else.

348
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,200
Then inside this baobabovo tree you'll live ...

349
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:29,900
will go out only when they called Vasundra.

350
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:34,800
During the long wait you'll be given a gift ...

351
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:41,800
of mystical power that will make you invincible to all ...

352
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:52,300
except in the hands of someone endowed with divine power.

353
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,600
So enter the tree.

354
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,600
Capi.

355
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:34,100
Will determine the date of the wedding as soon as I get back.

356
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,800
Vasundra ... wait.

357
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:04,000
Why did you leave?
- I wonder what to do

358
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,900
Many lives ago, you were my beloved.

359
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:16,900
If we were meant to be together why the Lord sent someone my way?

360
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:20,100
People do not answer every question life.

361
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:26,700
If God has created this puzzle when the time comes he will unveil.

362
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,100
But ...

363
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,400
time

364
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:39,800
Hurry, do not have much time.
- Always quick! Listen ...

365
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:45,000
Tomorrow we will organize a party in Fort Nagda. The Day of Lovers. Should come.

366
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:48,800
All right. I'll be there.
- Eleven hours. Nagda Fort.

367
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,400
Will be in Fort Nagda is eleven o'clock.

368
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,900
What is this? One's horoscope?
- Menu.

369
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,900
And the guest list.
- I hope no one left.

370
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:15,000
Budget is limited. Here 50,000 for tomorrow night.

371
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:21,100
But remember, do not forget the hot drinks.

372
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:25,400
Will you drink?
- No we will drink canned milk.

373
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:29,200
Ashok, we all participate not only you. No hard alcohol.

374
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,200
What are you doing? Hard to find such a sponsor.

375
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:41,700
What?
- Nothing! You are our bank ...

376
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,600
Our finance minister, our ATM largest us hope.

377
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:51,900
Stop these jokes. Transport and entertainment who make decisions?

378
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:57,200
Madan, accept the call, please?

379
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,200
Who, me? You could ...
- What the ...?

380
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:03,400
Why do not you? Radzhesh cried.
- I will.

381
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,600
Who is that?
- Radzhesh.

382
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,800
Call Atul. I'm Wild.
- It deals with the party tomorrow.

383
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:20,300
I can not come to the party.
- We call Atul.

384
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,600
Radzhesh What happened?
- None of the group should not come here.

385
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,900
What is it ...?
- I'll explain later.

386
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:36,300
Just do what I say. Now get out.

387
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:44,500
What's Wild? Radzhesh said it will not come to party

388
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:51,600
I'm upset. I will not.
- Then we will cancel the party.

389
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,400
Talk to Move. Here you go.

390
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:04,400
Rashmi also came to the party. ... If you are nearby

391
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,500
I can interact in a frank conversation with Rashmi.

392
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,500
I can not.

393
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,000
People die because of your friends. And you can not come to party.

394
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,400
Guys why do you oppress?
- So far they're not forced.

395
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:30,200
But if you come to the party, we will bring the. Force.

396
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:40,800
Wild, if you have any problems on the party tomorrow will send you my new car.

397
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,900
Hey Vivek, speaks with the Wild. Come on, man.

398
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:55,500
In the name of my love should come.

399
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:01,300
We will not allow you to leave.
- Vivek, why insist?

400
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,400
Hey, who is this house?
- Yours.

401
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,600
Then what Radzhesh on my phone?
- Talk to your girlfriend.

402
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:14,900
Admonished in January For tomorrow's party.
- His girlfriend knows my number?

403
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,400
She even knows the numbers of his favorite telephone booths.

404
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:25,200
Wild, everybody wants to come to the party.

405
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:31,000
Moreover, the time the party changed to ten o'clock in the evening.

406
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:37,700
So you could go back in the dorm earlier. So I'll see you in just ten.

407
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:40,800
Well there will be exactly at ten o'clock.

408
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,500
Eleven, right? Here, it is returned.

409
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:47,900
Happy news?
- I just made them.

410
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:04,600
Clever, eh? You imitate all over the Wild?

411
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:12,500
We went out for her bad name, we will now give her a lesson.

412
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:25,900
- Best quality is that you always accurate.

413
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:30,000
I can verify his watch over you. ... Unfortunately

414
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:32,900
now it's in your injury.
- Stop with this nonsense.

415
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:40,200
Where are the others?
- They called after ten, right?

416
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,400
Before you arrive you will be raped.

417
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,800
Then we will rape you celebrate.

418
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:57,000
You're trapped! This is a very simple plan which skroih when you refused to come to the party.

419
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:04,900
May refuse to friends, right? So all your friends did so to come here.

420
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Was not it Vijay that they asked to come at ten instead of eleven o'clock?

421
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,000
So here we are.

422
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,800
And now the host and guests will face.

423
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:23,200
And look, no one will break the door to save you this time.

424
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,900
Do not get me come closer.

425
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,800
How about a race?

426
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,400
Whether you can do to be saved or we will be able to rape you?

427
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,000
What happened to the Wild?

428
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,600
Call an ambulance!
- Stop!

429
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:11,900
Nobody close to me.

430
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:17,400
But ... Why?
- You secretly flesh! Fraudulent bums.

431
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:21,600
Seduced me have given me confidence.

432
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:27,700
What have we done? Why do we blame?

433
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:34,900
Once stabbed me back now do on compassionate? No need.

434
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:42,700
You have no right to suspect us!
- I uttered the names of your friends.

435
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:49,800
Even God is not you forgive me who have done.

436
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,800
What is this sin we have done?
- All are equally responsible ...

437
00:51:55,100 --> 00:52:01,100
about what those two did. They colluded to ruin me.

438
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,800
You are criminals! Sinners!

439
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,800
Vasundra! Who you do it?

440
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:20,400
Well that came and peppers. I've been raped.

441
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:23,100
And they are responsible for this.

442
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:33,000
Now this body is destroyed. And if your love is true ...

443
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:38,000
then you will kill every one of them.

444
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,400
This happened to me.

445
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:18,400
You killed one. Now I killed another one.

446
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:23,600
Not spare any of them. Nobody should live.

447
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:28,300
Your forces have their limits as only a spirit.

448
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:38,100
Spirit can take control of destruction. But I'm a mystical serpent power.

449
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:42,400
My power is unlimited.

450
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:46,700
There is no form which can not accept.

451
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:55,500
For our enemies, I have prepared a terrible death.

452
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,800
While they are reborn in my next life ...

453
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:01,100
their people will live in fear.

454
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:13,100
Why are you sulky? What happened to you? Come

455
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:19,300
I can not forget the innocent face of the Wild!
- Rather than forgive ...

456
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:22,200
we had it down to the police.
- They tainted our friendship.

457
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:26,900
They deserved to die like dogs. Good!
- He who digs a grave to another person, himself falls into it.

458
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:31,300
If he had not killed them myself I'd do it.

459
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:35,500
But who was he? And what was his connection with the Wild?

460
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:42,400
Why called it Vasundra? Has some mystery in all this, right?

461
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:47,400
I hope not to embroil it, whatever it is.

462
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:53,300
Could this lead to mass destroy us?

463
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:57,700
Since our images are now saved in the eyes of that mystical snake.

464
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,300
He will not spare us.
- What nonsense! It was just a bad dream.

465
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:14,900
Will do little party on the farm. Guys want to come there, because I will have birthday.

466
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:25,900
Now what was it?

467
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:41,300
They've bought from the junkyard? Breaks every time I go to a party.

468
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:49,200
Siim You know, the real problem is that he loves more than me.

469
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:52,400
When you're above that his heart stopped beating.

470
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:59,600
Now how do we get there on time?

471
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,600
Your bike breaks down there?
- Yes.

472
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:15,400
Why such a beautiful girl Driving this brakma? Buy a new bike.

473
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:18,900
We'll take it?
- I'm off to to Poona.

474
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:21,100
You go to where?
- Lonavla.

475
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:24,100
But there is more room for seating.
- Can be done seated?

476
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:31,500
Not one of you two will sit in my lap. You're very heavy and will hurt me.

477
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:36,200
In his lap you ...? What will endure?
- He is too old to even be your father.

478
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,200
Settled himself comfortably.

479
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:49,000
Take care of it.
- Do not worry.

480
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:13,900
Killed me.

481
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:19,800
No, not me. Sit up front. Honey, will you come back to me?

482
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:24,900
Join.

483
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:29,800
Do not push so you butso one.

484
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:34,100
Was it a loud slap?
- Now what I do that?

485
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:50,600
Sit.

486
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:01,100
Going to the party to celebrate the birthday of a friend? - How do you know?

487
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,100
Even know his name. Atul.

488
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:12,300
Who are you?
- Unknown, they ride on your last trip.

489
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:15,000
I do not understand ...

490
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:18,000
Do you understand?

491
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:19,200
How did this happen ...?
- Not an accident. He was killed.

492
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,300
On his neck a scar from a motorcycle tire.

493
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:27,500
Our cameras are mounted nearby. But strange ...

494
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:31,600
no bike was not spotted. Intelligent killer. But do not worry, you'll catch him.

495
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:16,100
"Your beauty makes my heart beats strong."

496
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:22,900
"Your beauty makes my heart beats strong."

497
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:30,800
"When you see tomorrow? In eleven or twelve?"

498
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:48,300
"My beauty makes your heart beating strongly."

499
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:53,100
"Guys like you always hover over me ..."

500
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:55,900
"Even at eleven or twelve '

501
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:17,900
"Crazy about you."

502
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:23,200
"I lost my heart somewhere in your hair."

503
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:29,000
"We will not give your heart to anyone, get out, brush off immediately."

504
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:33,800
"Tell me only when you will enjoy the fruit of our love."

505
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,700
"In eleven or twelve?"

506
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,300
"Your hesitation leaving my wound."

507
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:03,300
"My heart is faint pink in your countries."

508
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:09,300
"I'm like a cloud that you soon will not capture."

509
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:14,300
"Oh, when then you will zavalish?

510
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:19,400
"In eleven or twelve?"

511
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:38,600
"Do not stay long to look in my eyes."

512
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:43,700
"I want to kiss a few hugs."

513
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:49,600
"Boy, stay away from me."

514
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,500
"I know it will end up killing me, but when will it happen?"

515
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:57,400
"In eleven or twelve?"

516
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:19,200
"Come on baby, let's have fun."

517
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:24,200
"I will flatter every day."

518
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:30,400
"Look into my eyes, intoxicating, will leave you speechless"

519
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:35,300
"God knows when it will stop being so stubborn."

520
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:40,400
"In eleven or twelve?"

521
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:07,200
"I pray for a hug."

522
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:12,000
"When will I see?"

523
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:18,100
"Come, let us hear the melody of your bracelets.

524
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:23,200
"When do you want? In eleven or twelve?"

525
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:38,500
"Your beauty makes my heart beats strong."

526
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:45,700
"When you see tomorrow? In eleven or twelve?"

527
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:09,800
Stop the music and dance.
- What is Vijay?

528
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,400
Why stop the fun?
- For a man who is among us ..

529
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:15,900
who killed Radzhesh and Madan. and he just killed Viktor.

530
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:20,100
What are you talking about? Victor is right here.

531
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:23,100
He is a murderer who killed Victor.
- Vijay! Be managed.

532
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:26,000
Are you crazy?
- This dance with you ...

533
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:29,300
Victor is a murderer! Trust me!
- No, he did not say

534
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:33,700
If he is not Victor, then who?
- Mystical snake! He killed Victor.

535
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:35,900
I just saw the body of Victor.

536
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:42,200
Was fooling your friends just because you want to see me dead?

537
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:47,000
Then you're the one snake and not me!
- I'll kill you.

538
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:50,200
He said that I'm a murderer. Have you ever been dead comeback?

539
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:53,800
Siim not come with me to the party?

540
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:59,500
Come on, Siim, what in truth?
- Victor and I came together.

541
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:04,100
Siim not believe him! He can take any form that pleases.

542
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:08,300
He will speak in any language and we will kill one.

543
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:12,600
Did we call all snakes? What's this melodrama?

544
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:16,700
This is the truth! Vijay is trying to prove that I am your enemy.

545
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:19,200
But I will prove that Vijay is that snake.

546
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:23,800
If you do not believe me let's face the mirror.

547
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,600
It may not reflect the accepted form. Do not drop.

548
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:31,300
Come on, let's see.
- Let's see what is the truth.

549
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:34,800
Vijay! You're right!

550
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:37,900
Stop.

551
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:43,300
Only because of stupidity you get out of it. If you had believed me ...

552
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,400
I would kill him.

553
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,500
Abdul are not kidding?

554
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:23,400
Come inside.

555
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:29,400
Not close to me, Shaman. My time has expired.

556
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:36,100
Friends ...

557
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,400
can leave you bathed in tears. could no longer amuse you.

558
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:46,500
Forgive me. And take care of my girlfriend.

559
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:03,000
Victor and Abdul. Two innocent dead. I'm convinced. All will die.

560
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:09,200
Vivik right. He is no ordinary snake and Wild was not a simple girl.

561
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:15,600
If they have supernatural powers, we need you to sit quietly and wait?

562
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:21,100
Together, we can easily capture.
- Above all we must understand ...

563
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:24,200
what is his power and how it was left to him yet?

564
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:29,900
Because you guys I spared you. But next time it will catch the tail ..

565
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:35,900
and beat him until he dies.
- But how will we catch?

566
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:40,200
Let me tell you something ... they are transcendental death.

567
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:47,500
So you will be able to harm them. The truth is that ...

568
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:53,700
where science ends mysticism begins.

569
01:14:55,500 --> 01:15:01,500
I'm a Professor of Parapsychology. If you really want to find a solution ...

570
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:04,300
then come with me.

571
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:22,600
Wild look, we're your friends. They are your friends.

572
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:25,800
Wherever you go, come.

573
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,400
Appear to be Wild.

574
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,300
Come here.

575
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Welcome.

576
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:05,600
You called me here?
- Radzhesh Madan and they insulted.

577
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,400
And you killed them. Then what is the fault of Abdul and Victor.

578
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:13,600
Why kill them?
- None of them is innocent.

579
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,400
Each of them was to blame for my demise.

580
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:21,500
What are you trying to prove?
- Don 't you invite to the party?

581
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:25,000
Yes, I did. But what?
- I called to cancel the invitation.

582
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:28,500
Then why you said it would cancel the party if they come to him?

583
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:32,300
You never call home. We are not talking.

584
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:37,700
And Vijay and certainly never asked me to come at ten instead of eleven o'clock.

585
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:42,900
Thee madness has led to suicide. You delirium.

586
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:48,000
Ashok had to send you your new car to take me? Err you?

587
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:51,100
New car? I do not understand this?
- The truth is that ...

588
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:57,100
all you colluded to put my trap. ... And now you want

589
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:01,900
to prove that I am a liar?
- Nobody is conspiring.

590
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:04,600
This trap, this plot is the fruit of your imagination.

591
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:09,000
Wild consider. What will we gain from the destruction of your life?

592
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:13,000
We respect personal ties. We do not participate in the rape.

593
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:21,100
The votes will not delete your sins. Know that we will only kill you one by one.

594
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:34,800
Can bullets kill the spirit? I will not call again Wild.

595
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:40,400
I'm not wrong! Anyway, I'm not scared of these ghosts.

596
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:48,300
I got it! If you remember Radzhesh could mimic all their friends.

597
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:52,600
Then Radzhesh played a dirty trick to lure wild.

598
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:56,500
When completing preparations for the party at home ...

599
01:17:56,700 --> 01:18:00,400
Radzhesh talked with someone over the phone.

600
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:04,500
When I asked Madan he answered that he was convinced his girlfriend to come to the party.

601
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:08,100
The party none of them was with a girlfriend.

602
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:13,300
Then I am sure. You are innocent.

603
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:19,500
Our lives are in your hands! Save us, sir.

604
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:36,400
With powerful spirits is only by God.

605
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:41,300
From him come all the forces in front of him all forces were powerless.

606
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:47,700
While wearing these pendants ...

607
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:56,100
no snake can not hurt you.
- Excuse me, but I do not believe in all this.

608
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:00,800
Sir, please let me keep the medallion.

609
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,800
Please, Attila brings it.
- Something I do not understand?

610
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,700
Something does not believe? Not to put it.

611
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:16,600
Stop, please.

612
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,700
Being in love does not mean that I will encourage your every whim.

613
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:25,700
I do not want anything bad for you. If not for the Lord can use it as a fashion ornament.

614
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:30,200
I will not put anything that has connection with God or religion.

615
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,400
Then I am also adamant. Will they get to put it.

616
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:41,700
Being relentless is a good thing.

617
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:47,300
Atul, this is for your protection!
- This little medalyonche you?

618
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:49,600
I keep to myself.

619
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:52,500
Whatever happens, you will wear it.

620
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:54,600
Don 't be stupid.

621
01:19:55,900 --> 01:19:56,900
Let's go.

622
01:19:58,100 --> 01:20:01,200
Let me ... not 't be silly!
- Please, put it down.

623
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:03,700
Get out! I will not put it!
- Me! Please!

624
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:08,500
I do not believe in all this!
- Do not be so hard! Put it.

625
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,500
Don 't be stupid.

626
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:12,200
Get out.

627
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:11,500
Come here immediately.
- Will be even before I closed.

628
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:56,400
"Honey! You're great."

629
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:06,800
"I lost my heart in you, you're my favorite."

630
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:17,800
"Honey! You're great."

631
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:27,900
"I lost my heart on you, you're my favorite."

632
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:25,600
"When two loving hearts are pushing one another, it's intoxicating."

633
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:32,600
"When you hold your life becomes more fun."

634
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:39,800
"When I gave you sweet talk?"

635
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:46,900
"I never knew when you fell in love."

636
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:53,800
"Love is simple. It is a great story for youth."

637
01:23:54,500 --> 01:24:01,500
"I lost my heart on you, you're my favorite."

638
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,300
"Honey! You're great."

639
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:44,200
"I rest a moment without you."

640
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:51,200
"Without you my heart will stop beating."

641
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:58,400
"I know you crazy, I've seen this folly."

642
01:24:58,700 --> 01:25:05,400
"And baby, you distracting me."

643
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:13,200
"You keep me fascinated by love, you're great."

644
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:20,300
"I lost my heart on you, you're my favorite."

645
01:25:20,700 --> 01:25:25,700
"Honey! You're great."

646
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:25,000
In this episode of supernatural forces ...

647
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:28,600
let me introduce you to someone who says that ...

648
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:33,200
can make the impossible ... possible! I will say ...

649
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:38,000
it is a world wonder if he can transform ...

650
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:41,900
a beautiful woman.

651
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:58,400
Now transformed into a parrot and talk like one.

652
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:15,200
My friend, your art of magic transformation ...

653
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:23,300
I left with the audience completely silent. Now we will show you their true form.

654
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:26,800
Why not?

655
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:36,500
Before you know its true nature, let's stop for commercials.

656
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:18,300
Hey where is our guest?

657
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:26,200
Is there a true form? Or bird flew?

658
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:30,000
First guest disappears, then the host persuades us that.

659
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:32,400
Really think about the audience stupid?

660
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:38,500
As host, my job is to answer questions from the audience.

661
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:46,000
Nobody was deceived in this show. If you still have any questions ..

662
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:48,000
here I am.

663
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,400
Who are you?

664
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:58,400
I am he.

665
01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:05,100
Look at the face of death, your time is over.

666
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:08,800
Or you have come to his own death?

667
01:29:09,100 --> 01:29:10,800
Let's solve.

668
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:16,700
Doctor, how is Atul?
- Saved his life, but ...

669
01:36:16,900 --> 01:36:18,800
But what?
- He was in a coma.

670
01:36:27,100 --> 01:36:31,200
We arrived at the place of the party. But why Prem has not yet come?

671
01:36:31,300 --> 01:36:36,400
Move it? I organized this party just for you. Why are you called her Move here?

672
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:41,400
Move is a good boy, Ashok. There will be no matter if he came here.

673
01:36:41,700 --> 01:36:45,700
Important for me. I hate this filthy beggar.

674
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:48,800
You may hate him because he is poor.

675
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:54,200
But it is my very good friend and always will be.

676
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,600
Help!

677
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:07,900
Rashmi is drowning! Somebody save her!

678
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:13,600
Come here ... I do not watch. Jump into the water!

679
01:37:13,700 --> 01:37:15,700
Somebody save the queen!

680
01:37:15,900 --> 01:37:18,900
She is drowning! Can not you see! Jump in the water.

681
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:53,500
You can swim very well. So why pretend you're drowning?

682
01:37:53,900 --> 01:37:58,800
I wanted to know if you will jump into the water to save me.

683
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,900
How to jump into the water? I can not swim.

684
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Move also knows how to swim.

685
01:38:04,300 --> 01:38:08,000
But he cares about his own life when it comes to my rescue.

686
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:11,900
Saying you love someone very easily.

687
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:15,200
But it is difficult to prove.

688
01:38:15,700 --> 01:38:20,500
A man who cares about his own skin when someone is drowning ...

689
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:24,900
can not be my favorite. He is a selfish.

690
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:31,500
Rashmi here?
- Yes. It is inside.

691
01:38:40,900 --> 01:38:43,900
So remember that today my birthday?

692
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:49,800
If any thing I remember is that you and your birthday.

693
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:51,900
Really?
- Yes, Rashmi.

694
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,500
Do not even know how to greet me for my birthday.

695
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:09,100
I ...? With a kiss?

696
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:12,400
Come on, Move. Kiss me on the cheek.

697
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:43,000
Dwarf! Touch you to the moon?

698
01:39:45,100 --> 01:39:47,100
How dare you ...?

699
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:56,300
Hold on, Ashok. Move not to blame.

700
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:58,500
I asked him to give me a kiss to celebrate my birthday.

701
01:39:58,600 --> 01:40:00,100
Stop the bullshit!

702
01:40:08,700 --> 01:40:14,100
Since college, I noticed that like a dog chasing Rashmi!

703
01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:22,200
Bastard! How dare to approach so close to Rashmi?

704
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:32,200
Bastard! Stand up!
- Ashok, do not hit.

705
01:40:32,700 --> 01:40:36,100
I promise that you will never see him near me.

706
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:38,300
Oh really? Get out of my way!

707
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:40,500
You will see him with you only if live!

708
01:40:46,900 --> 01:40:48,300
Please do not hit him, Ashok.

709
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:51,500
Mercy of his life as a gift for my birthday, please!

710
01:40:53,700 --> 01:40:57,300
Okay, honey. I will spare his life as insist.

711
01:40:57,900 --> 01:40:59,900
Otherwise I had to kill today.

712
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:03,200
Let me go to the farm. ... As usual

713
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:07,000
I organized a big party to celebrate your birthday.

714
01:41:07,700 --> 01:41:12,400
Let's go ... watching it boiled my blood.

715
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:14,800
Get out of my way.

716
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:19,600
So far, my heart was broken today and my body was also injured.

717
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:22,000
Nice way to reward my love.

718
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:58,000
"God is love, my love ..."

719
01:41:58,200 --> 01:42:00,200
"What will the world be without love?"

720
01:42:00,600 --> 01:42:05,800
"You and I will never be apart. We are in love."

721
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:21,400
"God is love, my love ..."

722
01:42:21,500 --> 01:42:23,500
"What will the world be without love?"

723
01:42:23,700 --> 01:42:29,000
"You and I will never be apart. We are in love."

724
01:42:54,100 --> 01:42:59,400
"I had to mourn them and I also grieve."

725
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:04,900
"We are engulfed by desire."

726
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:14,100
"You're not yourself nor me ..."

727
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:19,400
"We're madly in love."

728
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:28,100
"Love is a beautiful, young love is ..."

729
01:43:28,200 --> 01:43:30,500
"What will the world be without love?"

730
01:44:20,900 --> 01:44:22,900
Rashmi Where are you going?

731
01:44:23,900 --> 01:44:27,200
Today is a special day. Today is your birthday.

732
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:40,700
Bastard! How dare you enter my house and touch me?

733
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:42,400
I will ...

734
01:44:51,700 --> 01:44:55,000
Bastard! He tried to stapchesh gentle flower?

735
01:44:57,200 --> 01:44:59,200
How dare you even touch her?

736
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:07,500
They suffer from the college.

737
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:10,000
Now, I will repay you for all the humiliation.

738
01:45:44,900 --> 01:45:46,900
Forget it! Do not hit!

739
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:50,400
It will neither live nor will they bother anymore.

740
01:45:51,300 --> 01:45:55,000
Gives you freedom as a gift for your birthday.

741
01:46:23,300 --> 01:46:25,700
He killed my master!

742
01:46:36,900 --> 01:46:39,200
Get him! He killed my master!

743
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:40,900
Get him!

744
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:21,200
Tell me now why Ashok killed?

745
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:29,200
When the police deal with them, even at the hard criminals propyavat.

746
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:34,500
Why killing Ashok? Why?

747
01:47:37,400 --> 01:47:40,600
You may not hitting innocent man like that?

748
01:47:40,900 --> 01:47:43,000
You say that you, Rashmi Sharma?

749
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:45,400
You are witness to the murder of Ashok.

750
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:51,900
Yes. And I brought with me the most - best lawyer in town, Mr Banerjee.

751
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:55,400
This is ...

752
01:48:00,100 --> 01:48:02,000
Move it is innocent.

753
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:06,900
It is true that the Move and hassle Ashok is a party.

754
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:12,600
But Ashok suddenly slipped and hit his head stone.

755
01:48:13,700 --> 01:48:15,700
And it killed him.

756
01:48:17,300 --> 01:48:22,800
This statement would justify a premium in court.

757
01:48:23,200 --> 01:48:25,200
Nobody can punish my client.

758
01:48:35,100 --> 01:48:39,000
Why give false testimony? Why did you do?

759
01:48:39,200 --> 01:48:41,100
Because I love you.

760
01:48:47,300 --> 01:48:50,000
And I was such a jerk. Idiot!

761
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:56,200
I could not say love Rashmi ... and she said it to me today.

762
01:48:58,700 --> 01:49:00,200
Let the meeting begin.

763
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:04,700
Who saw kill your master?

764
01:49:04,700 --> 01:49:09,400
This man, who is here, sir ... he killed my lord!

765
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:12,100
Yes, sir! I saw the murder happened.

766
01:49:12,300 --> 01:49:17,100
This is the man who killed my master! It is, sir.

767
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:22,700
Your Honor, these witnesses have worked for the deceased.

768
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:25,700
How can anyone believe their testimony?

769
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:30,500
They can also demonstrate their loyalty to their master ...

770
01:49:30,900 --> 01:49:36,200
by blaming an innocent person. Therefore please the court ...

771
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:39,400
to allow Ms. Rashmi Sharma to appear as a witness.

772
01:49:39,700 --> 01:49:40,800
Have the permission of the court.

773
01:49:59,300 --> 01:50:02,700
Miss Rashmi, Ashok Kedzhrival who killed?

774
01:50:04,200 --> 01:50:08,200
Mr. Judge was killed by Ashok ... this guy!

775
01:50:08,700 --> 01:50:10,700
His name is Prem.

776
01:50:13,300 --> 01:50:15,600
This guy is a monster!

777
01:50:17,100 --> 01:50:18,800
He is the devil!

778
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:21,100
He is a thug!

779
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:26,600
He killed my Ashok drop without mercy.

780
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:31,900
When I prayed to spare the life of me, he Ashok kicked aside.

781
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:40,900
He is a killer!

782
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,600
People like him should be hung in the courtroom.

783
01:50:54,700 --> 01:50:57,200
I would like to ask of Ms. Rashmi few questions.

784
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,800
No need to ask her any questions.

785
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:06,900
Since Rashmi said that I am a murderer ...

786
01:51:07,300 --> 01:51:14,500
no sense of more questions. Everything Rashmi said is true.

787
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:24,300
What a good reward you can get for your love?

788
01:51:26,700 --> 01:51:28,900
Please, sir, sentencing.

789
01:51:29,100 --> 01:51:34,500
In view of the testimony and confessions of the accused ...

790
01:51:34,900 --> 01:51:37,400
That court ...

791
01:51:38,100 --> 01:51:42,200
Prem Srivastava guilty to the murder of Ashok Kedzhrival.

792
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:48,300
According to Article 302 of Indian Penal Code ...

793
01:51:49,500 --> 01:51:52,700
this court ordered Srivastava Move to death by hanging.

794
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:11,400
What do Rashmi? You Move sent to the gallows!

795
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:12,500
Why?

796
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:36,400
Already free.

797
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:45,300
Move who wanted to save, was sentenced to death for me.

798
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Death by hanging.

799
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:06,400
When Atul come to mind?
- It's hard to say.

800
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:10,200
Patient can emerge from the coma any time or not at all out.

801
01:53:11,500 --> 01:53:13,500
Everything will be fine.

802
01:56:57,500 --> 01:56:59,300
What happened?
- Nothing.

803
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:04,100
Why cried, Vijay?

804
01:57:09,500 --> 01:57:11,900
Sir, I do not mean nothing to students.

805
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:21,000
But he appeared to me again, sir.
- Such behavior ...

806
01:57:21,700 --> 01:57:24,100
you, spoil the atmosphere of the whole class.

807
01:57:26,900 --> 01:57:31,100
Did you say that, sir? Know what is our problem.

808
01:57:31,700 --> 01:57:34,200
You know what we go through.
- Guys are themselves guilty of ...

809
01:57:34,400 --> 01:57:36,700
, in which the switch.

810
01:57:46,200 --> 01:57:49,000
They decided to marry ...

811
01:57:49,300 --> 01:57:54,600
Radzhu, son of Oberon, my childhood friend.

812
01:57:55,900 --> 01:57:59,300
Until yesterday, I wanted to marry Vijay.

813
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,500
What made you change your decision so suddenly?

814
01:58:02,600 --> 01:58:06,400
I do not want my daughter to become a widow so young.

815
01:58:06,600 --> 01:58:10,300
What would you say if I was married and Vijay ...

816
01:58:10,400 --> 01:58:14,200
But you still do not marry him. It does not exist.

817
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:19,600
I do not want to argue on this topic.
- Then listen to my decision.

818
01:58:19,900 --> 01:58:22,300
If I ever get married it will be only for Vijay.

819
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:26,700
And for anyone else!

820
01:58:29,500 --> 01:58:34,500
Anything can happen in boxing ring.
- What do you mean?

821
01:58:34,900 --> 01:58:39,400
Today you have a boxing match with Vijay, right Radzhu?

822
01:58:40,500 --> 01:58:45,200
In the paint, anyone can be hit to a place that can be deadly ...

823
01:58:45,500 --> 01:58:47,500
without becoming suspicious about the police.

824
01:58:50,200 --> 01:58:54,600
Finals of College Boxing Championship begin ...

825
01:58:55,100 --> 01:58:58,700
just six hours.

826
01:59:23,100 --> 01:59:26,500
You are my disciple. Indisputable winner!

827
01:59:27,100 --> 01:59:28,800
Mohammed Ali retired.

828
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:32,200
Mike Tyson spends half his time in prison.

829
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:35,800
I gave up boxing. Makes me sneeze.

830
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:39,100
Furthermore, three of us, no one else ...

831
01:59:39,300 --> 01:59:45,300
to dare to challenge you. So go! Begin with a hit!

832
01:59:46,900 --> 01:59:49,300
Dark terms will help you win the championship.

833
01:59:49,400 --> 01:59:51,200
Where is your competitor?

834
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
Vijay has not come, sir.

835
01:59:56,700 --> 01:59:59,000
Vijay categorically refused to come, sir.

836
02:00:07,100 --> 02:00:11,800
Promise me that you will give me what I wanted today.

837
02:00:13,200 --> 02:00:17,200
My life began with you. And ends with you.

838
02:00:17,700 --> 02:00:21,600
However, if there is still something you want ... I asked.

839
02:00:22,200 --> 02:00:23,900
You can even ask for my life.

840
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:27,600
I want to fight in today's boxing championship.

841
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:32,700
Will not participate in this competition.

842
02:00:36,100 --> 02:00:37,400
Hurry up and announce the name of the winner.

843
02:00:38,100 --> 02:00:41,900
The group of judges decided that the winner is ...

844
02:00:42,100 --> 02:00:43,400
Hold.

845
02:00:59,800 --> 02:01:01,700
What is this drama?

846
02:01:54,900 --> 02:01:58,600
When he attack the right, hit him in the teeth left.

847
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:08,300
Director, my student was having engine.

848
02:02:08,500 --> 02:02:13,000
Required time to warm up. But watch out for your electric machine.

849
02:02:13,300 --> 02:02:15,900
Several strong impact and will not be able to reset it again.

850
02:02:16,100 --> 02:02:19,800
Because we inflict blows ... and send them to dress!

851
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
Forget it!

852
02:03:20,300 --> 02:03:22,300
I told him to leave.

853
02:03:35,400 --> 02:03:37,900
Nice shot landed on it!

854
02:03:38,500 --> 02:03:43,300
Cause its another one ... and will be brought to his home on a stretcher.

855
02:03:43,600 --> 02:03:45,900
Do not worry, brother ... I will.

856
02:03:47,300 --> 02:03:53,000
Watch out for her little boy director. My man is fierce.

857
02:05:32,900 --> 02:05:36,800
Vijay could kill the mat in the form of Radzhu, Vasundra.

858
02:05:37,100 --> 02:05:40,700
But why stop here?
- Because this is Vijay ...

859
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:44,000
who called me in the fort at ten o'clock instead of eleven.

860
02:05:45,400 --> 02:05:47,400
There at that place was raped.

861
02:05:48,100 --> 02:05:50,100
It is the - biggest traitor.

862
02:05:51,300 --> 02:05:54,900
Therefore I want to be one that will kill him.

863
02:05:55,200 --> 02:05:56,700
Just me!

864
02:06:05,800 --> 02:06:10,500
Vijay did everything possible to find the locket. It seems I've lost it somewhere.

865
02:06:10,700 --> 02:06:12,200
After they finish their work ...

866
02:06:12,200 --> 02:06:15,200
will go to the director and will take another medallion.

867
02:06:15,500 --> 02:06:19,500
It's nothing. I won a championship just to show the world.

868
02:06:20,700 --> 02:06:25,100
But my real enemy is still alive. I do not want it to defeat e ...

869
02:06:25,200 --> 02:06:29,900
I want to kill him.
- Good will ...

870
02:06:30,100 --> 02:06:32,300
you will succeed in this mission.

871
02:06:44,700 --> 02:06:46,500
What do Vijay?

872
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:51,600
What happened, Preity? Not hurt, right?

873
02:06:51,600 --> 02:06:53,700
Missing anything. Please go.

874
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:23,600
Wait, what Vijay ... you?

875
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:27,000
Someone tries to kill me ... but I will not let him!

876
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,900
Vijay! What are you? Will not let you go anywhere!

877
02:08:11,200 --> 02:08:14,200
Put it ... leave it, I told you!

878
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:51,200
What happened? Why are you scared?
- Save it! Save Vijay!

879
02:08:51,400 --> 02:08:55,400
Someone is trying to push Vijay! Not know who he is.

880
02:08:55,700 --> 02:08:58,800
But I can not see how it dies! Please help him!

881
02:09:30,400 --> 02:09:32,200
Forget it! Forget it!

882
02:10:15,700 --> 02:10:19,300
Parwan Province could you borrowed 500?'ll Pay you back tomorrow.

883
02:10:19,600 --> 02:10:24,400
I gave you and 1000 but only if you return them today.

884
02:10:24,500 --> 02:10:27,800
Oh no ... I told you that you will return them tomorrow.

885
02:10:28,100 --> 02:10:30,600
I tell them to come back today and tomorrow you say?

886
02:10:30,800 --> 02:10:33,300
Will you back tomorrow.
- Who will see tomorrow?

887
02:10:33,500 --> 02:10:37,900
Do not let today's work tomorrow. And what we do now was to do later.

888
02:10:38,100 --> 02:10:41,100
Tomorrow, right?
- Today.

889
02:10:44,500 --> 02:10:46,900
What is this? What sport?

890
02:10:47,800 --> 02:10:52,700
Nikki gives the 1000 rupees and sporihme about when I will return them.

891
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,400
She said tomorrow and I today.

892
02:10:56,600 --> 02:11:02,500
Nicky here you 1000 rupees, when you return them.

893
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
She had to return them to me at all.

894
02:11:10,100 --> 02:11:13,400
What are you talking about, Preity? Vijay And I was dead too?

895
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:16,800
Vijay was killed ...

896
02:11:29,500 --> 02:11:33,400
What is this? Never taste even a drop of alcohol and now open a bottle?

897
02:11:33,400 --> 02:11:39,200
Parwan Province, I am very upset. Get out.
- I will not let you touch the alcohol.

898
02:11:39,700 --> 02:11:41,800
I will not let you drink it!
- Go away, Parwan Province.

899
02:11:41,900 --> 02:11:43,700
No way. No.

900
02:11:44,100 --> 02:11:46,600
How you will behave after drunk?

901
02:11:50,100 --> 02:11:53,500
Please come here quickly. How will it behave after it drunk?

902
02:11:53,600 --> 02:11:57,200
Our people will throw rotten tomatoes with eggs.

903
02:11:57,300 --> 02:11:59,400
Wrong is right?

904
02:12:00,700 --> 02:12:03,300
What is it?
- There is a call for you. Please be polite.

905
02:12:04,500 --> 02:12:07,900
Vivek, please because I do not get drunk.

906
02:12:08,100 --> 02:12:10,500
And please come to the show starting now.

907
02:12:33,400 --> 02:12:34,800
And it begins like this

908
02:12:35,900 --> 02:12:37,600
Dzhevadbhay asleep.

909
02:12:38,700 --> 02:12:41,000
Dzhevadbhay was asleep.

910
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:43,600
Dzhevadbhay is fast asleep.

911
02:12:44,400 --> 02:12:46,300
All around people are awake.

912
02:12:50,100 --> 02:12:52,800
When Dzhevadbhay is fast asleep.

913
02:12:53,800 --> 02:12:56,300
Dzhevadbhay asleep.

914
02:12:56,800 --> 02:12:58,700

All people in the neighborhood are awake ...

918
02:13:36,200 --> 02:13:38,900
Dzhevadbhay when sleeping.

919
02:15:05,600 --> 02:15:09,400
Riots occurred in Mumbai where Dzhevadbhay sleep ...

920
02:15:09,500 --> 02:15:13,200
He dreams and people exchange blows.

921

So hell get out of here.

922
02:16:03,800 --> 02:16:07,300
He was drunk and snoring ...

923
02:16:07,500 --> 02:16:11,400
while people in the neighborhood meeting with his death.

924
02:16:30,900 --> 02:16:33,600
Dzhevadbhay is awake.

925
02:16:34,600 --> 02:16:37,500
and looks good.

926
02:16:38,800 --> 02:16:41,400
Dzhevadbhay was awake ...

927
02:16:42,500 --> 02:16:45,200
and people in the neighborhood fled pell-mell.

928
02:17:26,600 --> 02:17:27,700
Who is that?

929
02:17:27,800 --> 02:17:30,400
Do not you recognize the voice of death?

930
02:17:30,400 --> 02:17:32,400
Who is that?
- No whining.

931
02:17:33,600 --> 02:17:38,600
For 24 hours they'll finish.

932
02:17:44,300 --> 02:17:46,700
Director home?
- No, sir. it does not.

933
02:17:47,500 --> 02:17:51,200

934
02:17:51,300 --> 02:17:53,600
please ask him to come to my house. I have very urgent business with him.

935
02:17:53,700 --> 02:17:54,900
It is very important.

936
02:17:59,200 --> 02:18:03,100
Vivek is! I'ma Vicki ...

937
02:18:03,400 --> 02:18:07,400
Why are you so nervous?
- There is a demon ...

938
02:18:07,400 --> 02:18:12,300
a Satan, I do not know what exactly, nobody knows. One by one ...

939
02:18:12,400 --> 02:18:17,300

940
02:18:17,800 --> 02:18:21,800

- He wants to kill you? What is the name?

941
02:18:22,100 --> 02:18:26,100

- Please save me.

942
02:18:26,500 --> 02:18:28,900

I'll be there in a few hours. Just stand there I come.

944
02:18:40,400 --> 02:18:45,400
Mary told me that you came home and I was very nervous.

945
02:18:47,400 --> 02:18:55,500
He gave me an ultimatum. 24 hours.
- Above all, discard this medallion.

946
02:18:56,900 --> 02:19:02,000
What are you saying ...?
- While wearing it ...

947
02:19:02,200 --> 02:19:10,000
none of them can not attack them. But this time I want to be attacked.

948
02:19:11,100 --> 02:19:15,500
I invented everything. Once they are gone.

949
02:19:19,300 --> 02:19:22,700
So go ahead ... Discard medallion.

950
02:19:40,500 --> 02:19:42,500
You ...?
- Because this pendant ...

951
02:19:42,500 --> 02:19:48,000
I could not touch. And you would never depressed ...

952
02:19:48,200 --> 02:19:54,200
unless the director does not tell you. Now your death will be remarkable.

953
02:21:07,700 --> 02:21:11,100
If you had not occurred he would kill me.

954
02:21:12,900 --> 02:21:15,100
Where is your locket?

955
02:21:15,500 --> 02:21:21,900
He prevaplati in you and convinced me to throw him out.

956
02:21:22,400 --> 02:21:24,600
I'll give you another necklace.

957
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:32,800
Brother ...! Very well done for coming! Thank God!

958
02:21:35,800 --> 02:21:39,400
Vivek now I'm here. So it should no longer worry.

959
02:21:46,200 --> 02:21:50,800
Not even the desire of the Angel of Death will help you not die now.

960
02:21:51,300 --> 02:21:57,800
Brother ... What do you mean?
- Let me demonstrate my words.

961
02:21:58,100 --> 02:22:04,700
But why do you kill me?
- You're not my real brother.

962
02:22:05,300 --> 02:22:09,200
Should I give half of his company of his step brother?

963
02:22:10,700 --> 02:22:17,100
Brought my brother to win by hard work I've done it?
- But I've never wanted anything.

964
02:22:17,300 --> 02:22:23,100
But this does not mean you never ask me. Under the guise of recent murders ...

965
02:22:23,700 --> 02:22:29,300
I will get rid of one obstacle standing in my way. And what I will do ...

966
02:22:30,100 --> 02:22:32,000
someone else will take the blame.

967
02:23:19,700 --> 02:23:23,400
Do not worry, I'm here.'ll Call an ambulance immediately.

968
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:32,900
Go to the house of Karan Sachs. There you will find the murderer and the body.

969
02:23:33,100 --> 02:23:36,200
We need an ambulance.
- There will not be available until the hour.

970
02:23:49,600 --> 02:23:52,500
Very good coming. Should drive his brother to hospital.

971
02:23:54,400 --> 02:23:56,400
Help me!

972
02:23:56,600 --> 02:23:59,800
What happened? Who stabbed?
- He.

973
02:23:59,900 --> 02:24:04,200
Vivek, look, that's me, Kara. Your brother Karan.

974
02:24:04,800 --> 02:24:07,700
You called me, so I'm here.

975
02:24:07,900 --> 02:24:11,600
Look, that was not me.
- It was they stabbed.

976
02:24:11,700 --> 02:24:16,700
I was not ... he looked just like me!

977
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,600
He disappeared through the wall.

978
02:24:19,900 --> 02:24:25,300
So it means today and murderers do not escape through the walls disappear? Stop with this melodrama.

979
02:24:25,700 --> 02:24:28,500
Arrest him! I will drive him to hospital.

980
02:24:29,500 --> 02:24:35,500
I would finish the last of the bastards but there was his brother ...

981
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,700
A murder of an innocent is a sin.

982
02:24:40,900 --> 02:24:44,500
Wild! Glad you came. Vivek was in the hospital.

983
02:24:44,700 --> 02:24:48,000
Someone tried to kill him! You have to understand how it is for me.

984
02:24:56,300 --> 02:24:59,800
Now surely understand that I am away from you.

985
02:25:00,100 --> 02:25:02,200
But when ... how all this happened?

986
02:25:03,300 --> 02:25:07,100
I bet my trap and raped me.

987
02:25:07,300 --> 02:25:11,900
I had no choice but to commit suicide.

988
02:25:12,200 --> 02:25:17,200
Not Wild, did not have to do this. Have you no faith in my love?

989
02:25:17,800 --> 02:25:23,700
Really fell in love with your body? Not Wild, I fell in love with you.

990
02:25:28,700 --> 02:25:32,900
Just tell me what were they?'ll Kill them all.

991
02:25:33,200 --> 02:25:40,700
I sent six of them in the clutches of death. Remains only one. Brother.

992
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:44,700
What are you talking about the Wild? He would not even making fun of you.

993
02:25:44,900 --> 02:25:50,100
Fun, I forgave. But he played very sneaky number.

994
02:25:50,400 --> 02:25:54,100
Impossible! He knows that you would marry me.

995
02:25:54,300 --> 02:25:59,200
And assume that they will respect as a mother. Never even in my sleep ...

996
02:25:59,300 --> 02:26:02,600
Maybe if you were a real brother but he is your brother.

997
02:26:04,100 --> 02:26:06,100
I will kill him.

998
02:26:12,800 --> 02:26:16,800
We will be happy to know that your brother is alive

999
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:26,800
'll Be sorry to know it I'll kill him. Soon.

1000
02:26:29,800 --> 02:26:31,800
You will kill my brother right?

1001
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:36,000
You want to kill my brother right? I'll kill you.

1002
02:26:52,600 --> 02:26:55,000
Threatening police inspector! Are you crazy?

1003
02:26:56,900 --> 02:26:59,800
It is not an inspector! It is fake!

1004
02:27:00,400 --> 02:27:02,900
Prevaplati He stabbed me and my brother.

1005
02:27:03,400 --> 02:27:06,400
He is a chatterbox! Close it!

1006
02:27:07,100 --> 02:27:09,400
Why do not you listen? He pretends.

1007
02:27:09,600 --> 02:27:13,000
It will kill my brother! Let me.

1008
02:27:43,700 --> 02:27:46,700
Atul wake up! He opened the eyes! Come, please.

1009
02:27:46,900 --> 02:27:49,100
This is great! Let's go.

1010
02:30:30,100 --> 02:30:32,600
Run Vivek! Get out of here.

1011
02:30:34,300 --> 02:30:36,200
Run Vivek ... run.

1012
02:30:36,500 --> 02:30:38,600
Run ... do it for me.

1013
02:30:38,700 --> 02:30:40,100
Run.

1014
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:42,700
For me.

1015
02:30:44,800 --> 02:30:46,800
Run.

1016
02:30:48,800 --> 02:30:50,000
Come on.

1017
02:34:12,700 --> 02:34:14,700
What happened to you?

1018
02:34:16,200 --> 02:34:24,200
I did my best fight to save Vivek.

1019
02:34:24,600 --> 02:34:29,000
I want to destroy them.

1020
02:34:29,300 --> 02:34:35,200
I'm not lost courage nor his momentum.

1021
02:34:38,500 --> 02:34:43,900
But what can I do? This massage me forward.

1022
02:34:47,200 --> 02:34:51,200
One last request, sir. Please save Vivek.

1023
02:34:58,900 --> 02:35:06,400
In the battle between good and evil deity can only triumph.

1024
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:24,500
My brother.

1025
02:38:17,900 --> 02:38:19,500
Leave him.

1026
02:38:20,400 --> 02:38:22,400
Drop it.

1027
02:40:03,200 --> 02:40:04,500
My brother.

1028
02:40:08,900 --> 02:40:11,900
Why did you kill my brother?

1029
02:40:12,800 --> 02:40:14,400
Drop it!

1030
02:40:19,800 --> 02:40:22,100
Let my brother!

1031
02:43:27,300 --> 02:43:29,000
Brother ...

1032
02:43:34,500 --> 02:43:36,400
My brother.
