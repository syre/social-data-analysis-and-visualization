1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,797
(rock music playing)

2
00:00:28,363 --> 00:00:30,524
# I fell off the wrong side #

3
00:00:30,565 --> 00:00:33,432
# Of my bed today #

4
00:00:33,468 --> 00:00:35,629
# I was distraught #

5
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:37,662
# Over welcoming
yet another day #

6
00:00:39,274 --> 00:00:41,765
# It seems like curtains to me #

7
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,404
# And everything
that I was meant to be #

8
00:00:45,447 --> 00:00:49,076
# And it seems I've got to realize #

9
00:00:53,288 --> 00:00:55,153
# I'll be the yellow light #

10
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,785
# To your gas pedal #

11
00:00:58,827 --> 00:01:00,556
# Baby, give me a minute #

12
00:01:00,595 --> 00:01:02,529
# My stomach's gotta settle #

13
00:01:04,633 --> 00:01:08,160
# I'm elusive in my own partaking #

14
00:01:10,706 --> 00:01:13,641
# Maybe I'd better realize #

15
00:01:17,846 --> 00:01:20,542
# Better realize #

16
00:01:21,616 --> 00:01:26,212
# That you can't make me #

17
00:01:28,156 --> 00:01:32,559
# I can only make
myself up to believe... #

18
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:45,673
Hey, my name's Duffy.

19
00:01:45,707 --> 00:01:47,197
I'm pretty famous
around here for being

20
00:01:47,242 --> 00:01:48,834
an all-around good guy,

21
00:01:48,877 --> 00:01:52,005
friendly, decent looking,
pretty smart.

22
00:01:52,047 --> 00:01:53,810
Kinda got it made.

23
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:55,339
Hey, Duffy.
How's it hanging?

24
00:01:55,384 --> 00:01:57,852
- Love you long time, Lexi.
- Looking hot, Duff.

25
00:01:57,886 --> 00:02:00,377
Hey, Andrea.
Graduation week...

26
00:02:00,422 --> 00:02:02,151
crazy.

27
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,158
That's what I want
to talk to you about.

28
00:02:04,192 --> 00:02:05,819
I have had a great
four years here at TULA.

29
00:02:05,861 --> 00:02:07,852
I'm getting a business degree

30
00:02:07,896 --> 00:02:10,456
and I belong to the best
fraternity on campus...

31
00:02:10,499 --> 00:02:12,126
Gamma House.

32
00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:14,761
See, I focus on one thing...

33
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:18,929
okay, let's make that two things...

34
00:02:18,974 --> 00:02:21,374
during my college career:
Getting laid

35
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,934
and getting an MRS degree.

36
00:02:22,978 --> 00:02:24,570
Okay, you... you may laugh,

37
00:02:24,613 --> 00:02:26,137
but you know,
the first three years

38
00:02:26,181 --> 00:02:29,048
we try to hook up with as many
people as we possibly can.

39
00:02:29,084 --> 00:02:31,575
And then the last year,
we try to find that perfect match.

40
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,781
And let me tell you something,
buddy boy.

41
00:02:33,822 --> 00:02:37,019
I found the perfect girl.

42
00:02:37,058 --> 00:02:38,582
Hey, Duff.

43
00:02:38,627 --> 00:02:41,425
- You may think that's her.
- Why don't you call me anymore?

44
00:02:41,463 --> 00:02:42,953
But that's my ex.

45
00:02:42,998 --> 00:02:44,693
You certainly know why, Kell.

46
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:47,031
I mean, no one loved you more.

47
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,502
That's true.

48
00:02:56,545 --> 00:02:58,206
No one's crazier in bed.

49
00:03:05,887 --> 00:03:07,718
That's definitely true.

50
00:03:07,756 --> 00:03:09,314
And no one's hotter.

51
00:03:19,134 --> 00:03:21,193
No one.

52
00:03:21,236 --> 00:03:23,204
So then why, Duffy?

53
00:03:23,238 --> 00:03:24,796
Oh yeah, let me guess.

54
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,501
Adriana?

55
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:29,032
Tell that stupid
rich bitch I said hi.

56
00:03:29,077 --> 00:03:31,409
That's not cool, Kell.
That's not cool at all.

57
00:03:31,446 --> 00:03:33,311
Bye-bye, Duffy.

58
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,175
See, that girl is amazing,

59
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:39,187
but she's not the one.

60
00:03:40,222 --> 00:03:42,247
Okay, so I burned some bridges
over the last three years

61
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,814
of messing around.

62
00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:46,350
You see, I screwed around...

63
00:03:46,394 --> 00:03:49,022
a lot...
a whole lot.

64
00:03:49,064 --> 00:03:51,624
Sandy Waves
looks like a mermaid.

65
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,600
She's beautiful in every way.

66
00:03:53,635 --> 00:03:55,364
It was like clockwork.

67
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:57,530
I'd go to the gym,
she'd get on top of me

68
00:03:57,572 --> 00:03:59,540
5:00 every day.

69
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:01,804
I think she's married
to a chemistry teacher now,

70
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:04,004
but she was really
good on the bench.

71
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,829
Ivana Humpalofsky... whoo.

72
00:04:21,863 --> 00:04:24,229
This girl was just

73
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:25,858
one of a kind.

74
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:27,664
- (rock music playing)
- Every time we'd have sex,

75
00:04:27,702 --> 00:04:29,863
my ears would ring
for three hours afterwards.

76
00:04:29,905 --> 00:04:32,135
The loudest orgasm
you would ever hear in your life.

77
00:04:32,173 --> 00:04:35,233
Yeah! Oh!
Bang bang bang!

78
00:04:35,277 --> 00:04:37,404
(moaning, screaming)

79
00:04:49,257 --> 00:04:51,589
Two naked twins are actually

80
00:04:51,626 --> 00:04:53,491
making out in my...
my bed right now.

81
00:04:53,528 --> 00:04:55,393
Chloe and Katie...

82
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,694
AKA every man's fantasy.

83
00:04:57,732 --> 00:04:59,962
- Oh!
- Duffy's voice: I would play video games

84
00:05:00,001 --> 00:05:01,628
and talk to my buddies online.

85
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:04,298
They would be there
just making out with each other.

86
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,104
Sometimes I'd watch.
Sometimes I'd join.

87
00:05:09,144 --> 00:05:11,908
- Sometimes I'd make videos.
- Hi.

88
00:05:11,947 --> 00:05:13,505
(women cooing)

89
00:05:24,826 --> 00:05:27,056
Professor Beaubier...
what a woman,

90
00:05:27,095 --> 00:05:28,824
what a great teacher.

91
00:05:28,863 --> 00:05:31,297
I mean, they say teachers don't
care about their students anymore.

92
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,823
That's a lie.

93
00:05:33,868 --> 00:05:36,632
You know, I really appreciate you
helping me, Miss "Boobier."

94
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:40,004
It's Beaubier, "Duffay."

95
00:05:41,176 --> 00:05:43,041
- It's actually Duffy.
- Mm.

96
00:05:43,078 --> 00:05:45,638
You know, this class
is just so hard.

97
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,138
Oh, really?
It's really hard?

98
00:05:49,184 --> 00:05:51,277
- It's really hard.
- Mm.

99
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:53,981
- It's getting harder.
- You need me to take some stress off

100
00:05:54,022 --> 00:05:56,252
from that... that hardness?

101
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:59,317
- Duffy: Yeah, I don't like hard things.
- No. Oh, no one does.

102
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:01,591
Holy God.

103
00:06:05,467 --> 00:06:06,957
Oh!

104
00:06:07,002 --> 00:06:09,334
Duffy's voice:
But that is all over now.

105
00:06:09,371 --> 00:06:11,464
No more one-night stands,
no more walk of shames,

106
00:06:11,506 --> 00:06:13,064
no more threesomes.

107
00:06:13,108 --> 00:06:15,633
You see, I am in love

108
00:06:15,677 --> 00:06:17,406
and I'm getting married.

109
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:19,572
Her name is Adriana.

110
00:06:19,614 --> 00:06:21,775
Adriana is, well...

111
00:06:40,268 --> 00:06:42,566
really really perfect.

112
00:06:42,604 --> 00:06:44,629
She is the most amazing girl
I have ever met in my life

113
00:06:44,673 --> 00:06:46,607
and I want to spend
the rest of my life with her.

114
00:06:48,476 --> 00:06:51,240
Okay, I admit it.
That sounds cornball...

115
00:06:52,414 --> 00:06:53,972
but I mean it.

116
00:06:54,015 --> 00:06:55,642
See, this is
the last week of college

117
00:06:55,684 --> 00:06:57,413
and after finals are over,

118
00:06:57,452 --> 00:06:59,147
I'm going to get married.

119
00:06:59,187 --> 00:07:01,451
I know it's a bit of a rush,
but here's the rub.

120
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:03,980
My fiancÃ©e is a debutante
and her family,

121
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:05,549
they are super-social,

122
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:08,084
super-rich Italians

123
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:09,619
from the old country...

124
00:07:09,664 --> 00:07:11,188
very old school.

125
00:07:11,232 --> 00:07:13,666
You see, her father runs
some global wine business.

126
00:07:13,702 --> 00:07:16,330
And he wants her to get married
at the right church

127
00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:19,033
with the right reception
at the right country club.

128
00:07:19,074 --> 00:07:23,272
The problem is the only time
her family says we can get married

129
00:07:23,311 --> 00:07:25,142
is the week of graduation.

130
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,738
I have no say.

131
00:07:32,954 --> 00:07:34,819
Babe, you know that Friday

132
00:07:34,856 --> 00:07:37,484
is the last party

133
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:41,017
of my Gamma career
and I can't miss it.

134
00:07:41,062 --> 00:07:43,997
Okay, it's just a stupid party.
Who cares?

135
00:07:44,032 --> 00:07:45,590
No no, it's... it's like

136
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:48,261
the most amazing party
in the history of mankind.

137
00:07:48,303 --> 00:07:51,295
Mm, the most amazing party.

138
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:53,307
Well, how can you go
to the most amazing party

139
00:07:53,341 --> 00:07:55,400
when you have
the most amazing woman

140
00:07:55,443 --> 00:07:57,809
to marry the next day?

141
00:07:57,846 --> 00:08:00,872
Well, just... just tell your Dad
we'll do it another time.

142
00:08:00,915 --> 00:08:04,078
- I mean, seriously.
- I can't do that, he'll fucking kill me.

143
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:05,677
- (gasps)
- (laughs)

144
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,915
Fine.

145
00:08:07,956 --> 00:08:10,720
- Wait...
- Duff, I know that look.

146
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:12,624
- What are you thinking?
- Okay,

147
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,356
the wedding
is Saturday night... Saturday.

148
00:08:15,396 --> 00:08:17,057
Yes.

149
00:08:17,098 --> 00:08:19,430
And the party is Friday.

150
00:08:19,467 --> 00:08:21,799
Genius, you're a genius.

151
00:08:23,071 --> 00:08:25,471
- Am I?
- What do you mean?

152
00:08:25,507 --> 00:08:27,634
I mean, am I?

153
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:30,075
Friday party,

154
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:32,579
Saturday wedding.

155
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:37,511
Wow. Okay. Just go.

156
00:08:37,552 --> 00:08:39,213
Just go to your stupid party.

157
00:08:39,254 --> 00:08:40,915
Really?

158
00:08:42,323 --> 00:08:44,086
You'd consider that?

159
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,752
Going... going to the party?

160
00:08:45,794 --> 00:08:47,284
Yeah.

161
00:08:47,328 --> 00:08:48,920
Babe, fuckin' yeah.

162
00:08:48,963 --> 00:08:50,487
- (laughs)
- Hell yeah.

163
00:08:50,532 --> 00:08:52,159
- Wow.
- It's my last Gamma party...

164
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,997
I picked a winner
this time, didn't I?

165
00:08:54,035 --> 00:08:56,469
- Hey, please.
- Papa's gonna be so proud.

166
00:08:56,504 --> 00:08:59,564
Papa... it's not...
it's not a rehearsal dinner,

167
00:08:59,607 --> 00:09:01,097
it's just a family dinner.

168
00:09:02,343 --> 00:09:04,470
- And I should party...
- Family, remember?

169
00:09:04,512 --> 00:09:06,002
- Yeah.
- We're gonna be a family.

170
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,537
- Can I please go?
- No.

171
00:09:07,582 --> 00:09:09,812
- I'll make the wedding. Please?
- No. No.

172
00:09:09,851 --> 00:09:11,614
Please?

173
00:09:13,822 --> 00:09:17,189
Isn't she so cute? I mean,
what girl does that for her man?

174
00:09:17,225 --> 00:09:20,251
- Man: What's up, bitch!
- Oh, here comes my fraternity brother

175
00:09:20,295 --> 00:09:21,819
- and best friend in the world. Mac!
- Yo!

176
00:09:21,863 --> 00:09:24,161
- Hey.
- Dude, last week of school, man,

177
00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:26,224
which means
the countdown to waiting

178
00:09:26,267 --> 00:09:28,861
for the biggest party
of all time is over!

179
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:31,531
(laughs)
And we don't get to go.

180
00:09:31,573 --> 00:09:33,473
Ah, it's... it's gonna be cool, Mac.

181
00:09:33,508 --> 00:09:35,203
I can't believe
you're so cool about it.

182
00:09:35,243 --> 00:09:37,507
- I'm completely cool.
- Yeah, but you're completely screwed.

183
00:09:37,545 --> 00:09:39,945
- How?
- Dude, you are getting married

184
00:09:39,981 --> 00:09:41,972
- on Saturday.
- So?

185
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:44,484
So, the biggest party
of all time is Friday

186
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,646
which means
we don't get to go.

187
00:09:46,688 --> 00:09:48,519
No way.

188
00:09:48,556 --> 00:09:50,615
- What do you mean "No way"?
- No way am I missing

189
00:09:50,658 --> 00:09:52,148
my last night of freedom

190
00:09:52,193 --> 00:09:53,717
on the finest campus

191
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:55,251
at the finest party

192
00:09:55,296 --> 00:09:57,389
with the finest friends
at my fraternity, dude...

193
00:09:57,432 --> 00:09:59,127
- Gamma.
- T-U-L-A!

194
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:00,794
- (both grunt)
- Yeah!

195
00:10:00,835 --> 00:10:02,496
No way I'm missing that.

196
00:10:02,537 --> 00:10:04,232
B... but... l... l...
what do you mean?

197
00:10:04,272 --> 00:10:06,069
You've got to be kidding me, right?

198
00:10:06,107 --> 00:10:07,665
- No, I mean...
- Dude, Adriana

199
00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:10,007
is going to hang you up
by your balls

200
00:10:10,044 --> 00:10:13,241
- Well, she's not going to be happy.
- Oh, no shit.

201
00:10:13,281 --> 00:10:15,647
But she's... she's cool with it.

202
00:10:15,683 --> 00:10:17,548
Dude...
(sniffs)

203
00:10:17,585 --> 00:10:18,887
Check this out.

204
00:10:18,887 --> 00:10:19,512
Check this out.

205
00:10:26,527 --> 00:10:28,757
(muttering)
It's weird, you know?

206
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:31,663
It's like school's over

207
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:33,826
and you hated going,
but now that it's done

208
00:10:33,868 --> 00:10:35,699
you wish you could
go back, you know?

209
00:10:35,737 --> 00:10:38,103
We had some good times though.

210
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,108
- I'm going to miss it.
- Me too, man.

211
00:10:41,142 --> 00:10:43,633
Oh, speak of the devil, bro.

212
00:10:43,678 --> 00:10:46,806
Here comes Adriana
and her fucking hot-ass friends.

213
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:53,946
Why are all her friends
so fucking hot?

214
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:57,723
What's up, baby girl?

215
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:59,556
Hey, Adriana.
Hey, Kristen. Hey, Cherie.

216
00:11:01,262 --> 00:11:04,197
Hey, baby.
Want to go take a walk with me?

217
00:11:04,232 --> 00:11:06,097
Sure enough.

218
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,330
- Take that.
- Okay. I'll see you guys later.

219
00:11:11,205 --> 00:11:14,936
Hey, I was just about to get down
on some video games.

220
00:11:20,515 --> 00:11:22,710
Fuck you, Duffy!

221
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,342
So, what are you gonna do?

222
00:11:25,954 --> 00:11:29,151
- About what?
- Don't be coy with me, Duffy.

223
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:32,421
Babe, come on.
This is the last party

224
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,587
of my college career.

225
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:37,860
It's going to be amazing. I'm going
to talk about it for like 30 years.

226
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:39,491
All my buddies
are going to be there.

227
00:11:39,534 --> 00:11:41,365
Yeah, it's all your nasty,

228
00:11:41,402 --> 00:11:44,963
porn-addicted, gross,
perverted buddies.

229
00:11:45,006 --> 00:11:47,440
Gamma House?
Really, babe.

230
00:11:47,475 --> 00:11:49,272
Come on. You could've
done so much better.

231
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,437
That place is disgusting.

232
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:53,413
I'm offended.
I'm a little bit offended.

233
00:11:53,448 --> 00:11:55,575
It's... it's actually
the best fraternity in history.

234
00:11:55,616 --> 00:11:57,208
- Mm. Mm-hmm.
- It was in a magazine.

235
00:11:57,251 --> 00:12:00,084
Oh, cool.
"Frat Boy Mag"?

236
00:12:00,121 --> 00:12:01,679
- Yeah, so?
- Awesome.

237
00:12:01,723 --> 00:12:04,419
(clears throat)

238
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:06,689
Come on, Duffy.

239
00:12:06,728 --> 00:12:08,525
Come home with me, all right?

240
00:12:08,563 --> 00:12:10,497
Our wedding is in two days.
Do you realize that?

241
00:12:10,531 --> 00:12:12,692
- Two days.
- Okay.

242
00:12:12,734 --> 00:12:14,998
I will see you
on Saturday morning.

243
00:12:15,036 --> 00:12:16,765
- (groans)
- I'm not supposed to see the bride

244
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:19,534
- before the wedding, anyways.
- I will take the red-eye.

245
00:12:19,574 --> 00:12:22,509
What? You're going to take
a red-eye to your own wedding?

246
00:12:22,543 --> 00:12:25,171
It's an easy flight. I'll be there
first thing in the morning.

247
00:12:25,213 --> 00:12:27,181
Yeah... hung-over.

248
00:12:27,215 --> 00:12:29,308
Is Kelly going?

249
00:12:36,824 --> 00:12:38,314
- What?
- Kelly.

250
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:40,020
Kelly, you know?
Kelly... Kelly Kelly...

251
00:12:40,061 --> 00:12:41,688
- whore Kelly... slut Kelly...
- Yeah, I know...

252
00:12:41,729 --> 00:12:43,458
- Remember? Kelly?
- Yeah.

253
00:12:43,498 --> 00:12:45,432
I don't know... I don't know
if she's going to be there.

254
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:47,331
- I don't know who's going to be there.
- God. Yeah.

255
00:12:47,368 --> 00:12:49,029
- It's a big party.
- Mm-hmm. Duffy,

256
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,470
if you so much as touch her arm,

257
00:12:51,506 --> 00:12:53,701
you're dead meat.

258
00:12:53,741 --> 00:12:55,538
You have nothing
to worry about.

259
00:12:55,576 --> 00:12:57,237
It's not you I'm worried about.

260
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:01,078
It's your friends
and all of your ex-girlfriends.

261
00:13:02,116 --> 00:13:05,051
Babe, it's just... your father
has a thousand divisions

262
00:13:05,086 --> 00:13:07,054
and they're all in these
little tiny countries.

263
00:13:07,088 --> 00:13:08,885
- (laughs)
- And so, this is the last time

264
00:13:08,923 --> 00:13:11,619
I'm going to be on American soil
for a long time.

265
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:13,991
Duffy, come on. You know
you need to learn the business.

266
00:13:14,028 --> 00:13:16,428
And Bulgaria?
Oh my God, how much fun.

267
00:13:16,464 --> 00:13:18,625
Whoa... Bulgaria?

268
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,759
- Yeah.
- You didn't tell me Bulgaria!

269
00:13:20,802 --> 00:13:23,498
Bulgaria... like prostitution's
the biggest way

270
00:13:23,538 --> 00:13:25,403
- to make money in Bulgaria.
- (laughs)

271
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,772
That place is scary, babe.
I need... okay.

272
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:30,039
That... that just proves my point.
I need to be here.

273
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:32,546
I need to party one last time
in the United States of America...

274
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,070
- Oh yes.
...because I'm a patriot.

275
00:13:34,115 --> 00:13:36,083
- (laughs)
- And I'm gonna marry you

276
00:13:36,117 --> 00:13:38,847
in this great country
on this soil

277
00:13:38,886 --> 00:13:40,820
because I pledge
my allegiance to you...

278
00:13:40,855 --> 00:13:42,516
- (laughs)
...because I love you.

279
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:46,316
You are fucking nuts.
Do you know that?

280
00:13:47,762 --> 00:13:50,629
And that might be
one of the reasons why I love you.

281
00:13:50,665 --> 00:13:52,633
Have I ever told you
I dreamt about you

282
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:56,000
- when I was like 10 years old?
- Mm. No.

283
00:13:56,037 --> 00:13:57,664
You were the same size,
the same age,

284
00:13:57,705 --> 00:14:00,265
- but I was 10 and I remember you.
- (laughs)

285
00:14:01,609 --> 00:14:03,338
- You're a dork.
- I know.

286
00:14:03,377 --> 00:14:05,174
I swear to God,
you call me.

287
00:14:05,213 --> 00:14:07,443
Do you understand?
You call me from the party,

288
00:14:07,482 --> 00:14:09,245
you call me when you get to LAX
and you call me

289
00:14:09,283 --> 00:14:11,774
when you land
in San Francisco, okay?

290
00:14:11,819 --> 00:14:14,379
Do not forget.
You call me, Duffy.

291
00:14:14,422 --> 00:14:17,016
- So, what... what am I doing again?
- Oh, you're calling me.

292
00:14:17,058 --> 00:14:18,548
Oh, call you.
Yeah, I'll call you.

293
00:14:18,593 --> 00:14:20,993
I'll call you
whenever I have service

294
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:23,826
and I will see you first thing
in the morning

295
00:14:23,865 --> 00:14:26,561
in Napa for our wedding.

296
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:30,068
Papa's gonna kill you.

297
00:14:30,104 --> 00:14:31,594
Mm.

298
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:33,197
Babe, we... we talked about it

299
00:14:33,241 --> 00:14:35,209
and he didn't even care.
He just... he was more concerned

300
00:14:35,243 --> 00:14:37,711
about his friends and the family,
everyone going to the wedding.

301
00:14:37,745 --> 00:14:40,578
And I promise you,
when I get to that reception,

302
00:14:40,615 --> 00:14:43,778
I will just lick his asshole clean...

303
00:14:43,818 --> 00:14:45,945
Eww. And you'd better, okay?

304
00:14:45,987 --> 00:14:47,477
You need to make him love you.

305
00:14:47,522 --> 00:14:49,422
I will.

306
00:14:50,525 --> 00:14:52,584
Well, I'll see you in Napa.

307
00:15:08,176 --> 00:15:08,309
(rock music playing)
# Last night I met this girl #

308
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:10,038
(rock music playing)
# Last night I met this girl #

309
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:12,011
# Her name was December #

310
00:15:12,046 --> 00:15:14,037
# She asked me if I would... #

311
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:16,879
So, what'd she say, bro?

312
00:15:16,918 --> 00:15:19,443
She's gonna let me do it!

313
00:15:19,487 --> 00:15:21,853
Oh my God!
Dude, you are the man!

314
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:23,618
- Of course.
- I can't believe she let you do it.

315
00:15:23,658 --> 00:15:25,285
Dude Mac, we talked
about this months ago.

316
00:15:25,326 --> 00:15:27,453
She's cool with it.

317
00:15:27,495 --> 00:15:29,019
What about the rehearsal dinner?

318
00:15:29,063 --> 00:15:32,692
Technically, it's a family dinner
the night before the wedding,

319
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:34,462
so it's not that big of a deal.

320
00:15:34,502 --> 00:15:36,402
Semantics, dude, semantics.

321
00:15:37,705 --> 00:15:39,297
Home sweet home.

322
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,638
# Baby, are you such a cutie? #

323
00:15:41,676 --> 00:15:43,541
# She asked me
"Is yours guaranteed?" #

324
00:15:43,578 --> 00:15:46,342
- # Now could you talk to me? #
- Hi, Duffy.

325
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,042
Duffy:
Hi... Olivia?

326
00:15:50,051 --> 00:15:52,246
- Close enough.
- # What do you mean? #

327
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:53,844
# Said now, baby #

328
00:15:53,888 --> 00:15:55,685
# Are you such a cutie? #

329
00:15:55,723 --> 00:15:57,520
# She asked me
"Is yours guaranteed?" #

330
00:15:57,558 --> 00:15:59,116
# Now could you talk to me? #

331
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,594
# I said I've fallen... #

332
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:03,494
Yeah, I'm gonna need
three iron maidens.

333
00:16:03,531 --> 00:16:06,932
I'm looking for handcuffs,
firecrackers,

334
00:16:06,968 --> 00:16:08,492
lube, olive juice...

335
00:16:08,536 --> 00:16:10,561
this might sound weird,
but how much are clowns?

336
00:16:10,605 --> 00:16:12,539
We need magic at this party.

337
00:16:12,573 --> 00:16:14,541
Um, let me know ASAP.

338
00:16:14,575 --> 00:16:16,202
Okay. TTYL.
(smooches)

339
00:16:16,244 --> 00:16:17,905
Chadster!

340
00:16:17,945 --> 00:16:19,936
- Chad: What is up?
- What the hell are you ordering, bro?

341
00:16:19,981 --> 00:16:21,744
- Supplies, my brother.
- What's up, buddy?

342
00:16:21,782 --> 00:16:23,909
- Duffy-Duff-Duff.
- Mac: Sounds nice.

343
00:16:23,951 --> 00:16:26,283
Guys, this party's gonna
be off the fucking chain.

344
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,515
Dude, sounds like it.
That's why we put your ass in charge.

345
00:16:28,556 --> 00:16:30,751
Yeah, of course.
I've been working since 6:00 A.M.,

346
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:33,658
- I don't stop.
- Gamma Spa open.

347
00:16:33,694 --> 00:16:35,389
- Oh, yes.
- Chad: No.

348
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:37,727
- Gamma Spa!
- Chad: Not me, not me.

349
00:16:37,765 --> 00:16:39,756
Guys, I no longer deal
with anything Asian.

350
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,734
Duffy: That is the most
racist thing I've ever heard.

351
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:43,634
I think she's Chinese anyway, bro.

352
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:46,265
Look, forget him.
Me and you, Duff.

353
00:16:46,307 --> 00:16:47,797
- She's got two hands.
- You see that?

354
00:16:47,842 --> 00:16:49,537
"No full service."

355
00:16:49,577 --> 00:16:51,169
Yeah, that's for people
who aren't Gamma.

356
00:16:51,212 --> 00:16:52,975
Come on.

357
00:16:53,014 --> 00:16:55,312
- Hey, sweetie.
- I didn't know we had a statue of you.

358
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:56,839
Mac:
Shut up. It's just me on a toilet.

359
00:16:57,852 --> 00:17:01,185
Hey! Let me see them cheeks!
(laughs)

360
00:17:01,222 --> 00:17:02,712
(Asian flute music playing)

361
00:17:02,757 --> 00:17:04,657
- Here, Macky.
- (Mac giggles)

362
00:17:06,027 --> 00:17:07,790
Hey, massage only, buddy.

363
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:10,695
Dude, come on.
Don't be such a puss.

364
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:12,961
Puss? Bro, l... I'm engaged.
I'm getting married.

365
00:17:14,001 --> 00:17:16,492
Yeah, you're getting married.
Key word..."getting."

366
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:18,198
Make this your last one.
It'll be cool.

367
00:17:18,239 --> 00:17:20,139
And no bachelor party shit.

368
00:17:20,174 --> 00:17:23,007
Are you fucking kidding me?
I'm your best man!

369
00:17:23,044 --> 00:17:25,205
It's my job to throw you
the sickest bachelor party.

370
00:17:25,246 --> 00:17:26,873
Dude-dude-dude...
bachelor party, frat party

371
00:17:26,914 --> 00:17:28,814
all combined into one.

372
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:30,817
Being here is my bachelor party.

373
00:17:30,851 --> 00:17:32,944
No. You being here
is a fucking happy ending.

374
00:17:32,987 --> 00:17:35,979
The bachelor party's after this.

375
00:17:36,023 --> 00:17:37,513
Duffy:
Oh, God.

376
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:39,185
Massage only.

377
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:40,716
Mac:
Yeah, for now.

378
00:17:40,761 --> 00:17:42,854
He might change his mind and get the...
(clicks teeth)

379
00:17:42,897 --> 00:17:44,387
With me.

380
00:17:50,971 --> 00:17:52,802
My God, Adriana.

381
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,467
What? What?

382
00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:57,204
I mean, come on now.
He should be going with you right now.

383
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:59,337
Would you stop it?
It's gonna be fine.

384
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,678
- No, he's a piece of shit.
- Oh my God.

385
00:18:01,716 --> 00:18:03,741
Oh my God. Okay?
You're my bridesmaid in my wedding.

386
00:18:03,784 --> 00:18:06,719
- You need to stop.
- And I don't think it's right...

387
00:18:06,754 --> 00:18:08,745
- Right?
- Yes, Duffy is a nice guy.

388
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:10,723
- Yeah.
- He's gonna be a good boy at the party.

389
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:12,248
- Yeah.
- Then why wouldn't he

390
00:18:12,293 --> 00:18:13,851
come with her today? I mean...

391
00:18:13,894 --> 00:18:15,725
It's his last night.
Would you stop?

392
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:17,321
- Okay.
- Exactly.

393
00:18:17,365 --> 00:18:19,390
- Oh, God.
- It's going to be so fun anyway.

394
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:21,901
- Yeah and our dresses...
- I know.

395
00:18:21,936 --> 00:18:23,733
- Our dresses are so pretty...
- Yeah, but he...

396
00:18:23,771 --> 00:18:26,865
The party is gonna rock
and he's gonna make up for it.

397
00:18:26,907 --> 00:18:28,932
He told me he was
gonna kiss my dad's ass.

398
00:18:28,976 --> 00:18:31,376
Oh, he's gonna
have to do that and kiss your ass.

399
00:18:32,413 --> 00:18:33,903
I'm fine. I told him he could go.

400
00:18:33,948 --> 00:18:36,280
- I trust him. I love him. Enough.
- Yeah.

401
00:18:36,317 --> 00:18:38,581
- (phone ringing)
- No.

402
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:40,644
It's my sister.

403
00:18:41,689 --> 00:18:43,281
- I'll see you guys later.
- Okay. Bye.

404
00:18:43,324 --> 00:18:45,121
- Bye.
- Let's go.

405
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:48,560
- Adriana: Hi.
- Is he coming to the family dinner Friday?

406
00:18:48,596 --> 00:18:51,861
- No.
- Adriana, Papa's gonna be angry.

407
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:53,764
(groans)
You know what? I don't have time for this.

408
00:18:53,801 --> 00:18:55,393
I'll see you later. Bye.

409
00:19:05,513 --> 00:19:09,347
(Mac sighs)
Dude, I'm so glad that you're going to be

410
00:19:09,383 --> 00:19:11,180
coming to our final frat party.

411
00:19:11,218 --> 00:19:12,742
It'd suck without you, bro.

412
00:19:13,788 --> 00:19:15,881
Oh yeah, it feels good.
It's probably the dumbest decision

413
00:19:15,923 --> 00:19:17,823
I've ever made,
but you know what?

414
00:19:17,858 --> 00:19:19,951
Adriana's Dad is pissing me off.

415
00:19:19,994 --> 00:19:21,586
I mean, this is like
my last day of freedom.

416
00:19:21,629 --> 00:19:23,722
Mac:
Right. And you're stepping up to him

417
00:19:23,764 --> 00:19:25,664
showing him that you
can be the man, you know?

418
00:19:25,699 --> 00:19:28,065
That's awesome.

419
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:44,982
It's kind of crazy, you know?
It's our last party of college.

420
00:19:46,187 --> 00:19:47,950
I'm going to miss you guys.

421
00:19:47,988 --> 00:19:50,650
Mac: I know, bro.
I'm going to miss you too.

422
00:19:57,498 --> 00:19:59,432
It is weird to think
that it's all over, man.

423
00:19:59,467 --> 00:20:02,027
Real life's gonna suck.

424
00:20:08,776 --> 00:20:11,040
(men sighing)

425
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,745
So...

426
00:20:14,782 --> 00:20:16,306
dude...

427
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:19,649
you gonna roll over and join me
in a farewell happy ending, huh?

428
00:20:19,687 --> 00:20:21,245
(laughs)

429
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:22,812
Yeah, dude,

430
00:20:22,857 --> 00:20:26,418
real men
don't do that together.

431
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,361
Oh, okay. All right,
why don't you just lie there

432
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:32,627
with your own insecurities
and try to keep it down.

433
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,657
'Cause I'm getting
a happy ending without ya.

434
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,502
Okay.

435
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:40,029
(grunts)

436
00:20:40,074 --> 00:20:42,872
Hey, baby. How about a happy ending
for your favorite customer?

437
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,639
You get no happy ending

438
00:20:44,678 --> 00:20:47,078
because what you did last time,
you bad boy...

439
00:20:47,114 --> 00:20:49,480
Come on, baby,
that was...

440
00:20:49,517 --> 00:20:52,509
look, I was... I was
pent up that last time.

441
00:20:52,553 --> 00:20:54,578
- No...
- No no no, listen listen.

442
00:20:54,622 --> 00:20:56,590
I'll wait, okay?

443
00:20:56,624 --> 00:20:59,752
- I'll wait this time, I promise.
- You never wait last time.

444
00:20:59,793 --> 00:21:01,727
But you be careful this time, okay?

445
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:03,229
I will, I promise.

446
00:21:03,264 --> 00:21:05,562
Okay.

447
00:21:07,301 --> 00:21:08,928
(Mac moaning)

448
00:21:08,969 --> 00:21:10,994
Mac:
Oh, God, that is nice.

449
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:12,733
You know, if you...
if you take your top off,

450
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:15,105
it would really help me
just concentrate more.

451
00:21:15,142 --> 00:21:16,871
Yeah, just...

452
00:21:16,911 --> 00:21:18,435
it's cool, right?

453
00:21:21,315 --> 00:21:23,249
(moans)
Yeah.

454
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:33,652
(grunts)
Oh ho-ho-ho-ho.

455
00:21:33,694 --> 00:21:35,924
Now, that is nice.

456
00:21:37,197 --> 00:21:39,392
(Mac moaning, laughing)

457
00:21:39,433 --> 00:21:41,162
Mac:
Your hands are cold.

458
00:21:45,773 --> 00:21:47,673
Oh, God, you look so fine.

459
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,505
Your body's so amazing.

460
00:21:49,543 --> 00:21:51,602
And this... this wrist thing
is just good.

461
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:54,375
Oh, man.
What kind of lotion is this?

462
00:21:54,415 --> 00:21:56,042
It's like self-warming.

463
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,914
Oh! Oh, God!

464
00:21:57,952 --> 00:21:59,852
Oh... oh, yeah!

465
00:21:59,887 --> 00:22:01,514
- Yes! Yes!
- No! No!

466
00:22:01,555 --> 00:22:03,386
- Yes!
- (shouting)

467
00:22:03,424 --> 00:22:05,119
(Mac moaning, yelling)

468
00:22:06,226 --> 00:22:07,750
Oh, I just went.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

469
00:22:07,795 --> 00:22:09,854
I'm sorry. My bad.

470
00:22:09,897 --> 00:22:11,728
It's no big, deal, right...
(screams)

471
00:22:11,765 --> 00:22:13,790
- Son of a bitch!
- Macky!

472
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:16,803
Oh shit, you fucking...
what is wrong with you?

473
00:22:16,837 --> 00:22:19,829
- (woman laughs)
- Oh my God.

474
00:22:19,873 --> 00:22:23,001
You just threw my shit back on me.
That's fucking disgusting.

475
00:22:23,043 --> 00:22:25,238
Masseuse:
Macky! No more Macky!

476
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:27,679
You promised
to wait for nappy-Macky!

477
00:22:27,715 --> 00:22:30,980
Where's my nappy now?
Where's my nappy?!

478
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:32,986
Okay! Okay, listen,
I'm gonna get ready to...

479
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,215
- Oh! Son of a bitch!
- Duffy: I'm out of here.

480
00:22:35,255 --> 00:22:37,052
You can dish it,

481
00:22:37,091 --> 00:22:39,286
- but you cannot take the Macky.
- Mac: Oh fuck!

482
00:22:39,326 --> 00:22:41,817
Yes! It's all over my fucking face!

483
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:45,263
Are you happy?
You get paid for this shit!

484
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:47,028
Duffy:
Thank you. Thank you.

485
00:22:47,067 --> 00:22:49,126
- You have great hands.
- Can I get a fucking nappy?

486
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:51,228
Please?

487
00:22:51,271 --> 00:22:53,603
- (water running)
- What an amazing massage.

488
00:22:53,641 --> 00:22:55,302
- I loved her hands.
- (gasping)

489
00:22:55,342 --> 00:22:58,004
Yeah? Fuck an amazing massage.

490
00:22:58,045 --> 00:23:00,570
My shit traumatized me.
I'm going to have nightmares about girls

491
00:23:00,614 --> 00:23:02,673
flinging come on me
the rest of my life!

492
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:04,411
It sucks!

493
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:06,146
I'm never going back to that place.

494
00:23:06,186 --> 00:23:07,915
Two-for-one coupon, my ass!

495
00:23:07,955 --> 00:23:09,923
You know that girl
was a tranny, right?

496
00:23:11,091 --> 00:23:13,127
(rock music playing)

497
00:23:26,106 --> 00:23:27,835
You know I hate you, right?

498
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:30,867
You know I love you, right?

499
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:33,072
Mm-hmm.

500
00:23:33,113 --> 00:23:34,808
Don't fuck this up, okay?

501
00:23:34,848 --> 00:23:36,748
- I won't.
- Mm.

502
00:23:41,622 --> 00:23:43,317
See you tomorrow.

503
00:23:43,357 --> 00:23:46,326
Yeah? You're a jerk.

504
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,884
And you'd better fucking call me.

505
00:23:49,296 --> 00:23:52,026
(Adriana giggles)

506
00:23:52,066 --> 00:23:53,624
You better drive safe

507
00:23:53,667 --> 00:23:55,635
- or I'll cut your head off.
- (car starts)

508
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:03,900
(rock music playing)

509
00:24:08,482 --> 00:24:10,245
(neighs)

510
00:24:16,924 --> 00:24:18,448
(sighs)

511
00:24:26,934 --> 00:24:29,300
Adriana! Adriana!

512
00:24:29,336 --> 00:24:31,896
This boy Duffy,
where is he?

513
00:24:31,939 --> 00:24:33,668
The wedding is tomorrow.

514
00:24:33,707 --> 00:24:36,437
Adriana! Adriana!

515
00:24:36,477 --> 00:24:39,469
Papa! I told you
he will be here late tonight. Enough.

516
00:24:39,513 --> 00:24:41,572
# I wanna take you with me... #

517
00:24:41,615 --> 00:24:43,446
(grunts)

518
00:24:46,854 --> 00:24:49,049
# Far away #

519
00:24:49,089 --> 00:24:52,320
# Makes me feel
like you are far away... #

520
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:53,951
Man:
Aww!

521
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:57,088
Time out. Come on,
you're throwing me off...

522
00:24:57,131 --> 00:24:58,894
- Shh! Shh shh! Shh...
- You don't have to do that...

523
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:00,559
- Shh.
- Come here. Hug it out.

524
00:25:00,601 --> 00:25:02,125
- It's okay.
- Jeez.

525
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:04,160
- We all can't... stop.
- I'm a girl. You don't have to...

526
00:25:04,204 --> 00:25:05,967
- Seriously. Shh.
- You don't have to do it.

527
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:08,099
- Just let...
- Hey. Go back to your side.

528
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:16,642
Hey hey, Adriana.

529
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:19,311
Hey, Stefano.
Didn't realize you'd be here.

530
00:25:19,353 --> 00:25:21,480
- You're looking good.
- Thanks.

531
00:25:21,522 --> 00:25:23,956
Adriana, I invited Stefano here
for your homecoming.

532
00:25:23,991 --> 00:25:25,515
He misses you.

533
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,824
I haven't dated Stefano
since boarding school

534
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:31,194
and last I checked,
he's dating Michela.

535
00:25:31,231 --> 00:25:33,563
Yeah, we're not dating anymore.

536
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,500
Yeah, l... I actually
put a bag over her head

537
00:25:35,536 --> 00:25:37,094
when we were in the bedroom.

538
00:25:37,137 --> 00:25:40,163
Um, it's kind of weird. She has some
bumps. I'm a little freaked out by 'em,

539
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:42,004
but it's okay.

540
00:25:50,684 --> 00:25:53,448
Please please,
have a toast with us.

541
00:25:53,487 --> 00:25:54,977
Come have some wine.

542
00:25:55,022 --> 00:25:57,650
Thanks, Papa.
And to my wedding too.

543
00:25:57,691 --> 00:26:00,524
Come come, sit sit, drink.

544
00:26:00,561 --> 00:26:03,724
This Duffy,
your no-good boyfriend,

545
00:26:03,764 --> 00:26:07,564
he's not making a family dinner
so he can go to a party.

546
00:26:07,601 --> 00:26:10,695
It's more than a party, okay?
We're gonna be overseas for years

547
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:12,637
and he just wants
to say goodbye to his friends.

548
00:26:12,673 --> 00:26:14,504
It's ridiculous.

549
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:16,975
- I think you should consider Stefano.
- (gasps)

550
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,671
I knew it.

551
00:26:18,712 --> 00:26:20,646
- Michela!
- It's decided.

552
00:26:21,715 --> 00:26:23,683
Adriana, baby,

553
00:26:23,717 --> 00:26:25,480
look, come here, come here.

554
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:27,009
- Look...
- Oh, God.

555
00:26:27,054 --> 00:26:29,386
It's always been you.

556
00:26:29,423 --> 00:26:32,358
You've got to be kidding me.
You dated my little sister.

557
00:26:32,392 --> 00:26:34,257
I know, but I've always loved you.

558
00:26:34,294 --> 00:26:36,558
That's disgusting, okay?

559
00:26:36,597 --> 00:26:38,155
Michela, say something!

560
00:26:38,198 --> 00:26:40,826
What do you want me to say?
He doesn't want to marry me.

561
00:26:40,868 --> 00:26:43,393
Okay, you know what?
This is insane.

562
00:26:43,437 --> 00:26:45,132
It's not the Old Country
anymore, Papa.

563
00:26:45,172 --> 00:26:48,198
Okay? I'm marrying Duffy.

564
00:26:48,242 --> 00:26:51,268
Adriana, wait up.

565
00:26:51,311 --> 00:26:53,279
Stefano, let her go.

566
00:27:03,557 --> 00:27:06,720
You better get
to the university right away.

567
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,694
- I won't let you down.
- You'd better not.

568
00:27:08,729 --> 00:27:11,163
Now, go say goodbye
to the girls.

569
00:27:11,198 --> 00:27:13,564
Come on. Go.

570
00:27:21,441 --> 00:27:23,671
(distant rock music playing)

571
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,450
Jesus, Stefano!
Get out!

572
00:27:35,489 --> 00:27:37,286
Adriana, I just want to tell you

573
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:39,417
- I've always loved you.
- Oh, God.

574
00:27:39,459 --> 00:27:43,156
- I've always loved you.
- Stefano, we're not dressed.

575
00:27:44,298 --> 00:27:45,890
Get out.

576
00:27:45,933 --> 00:27:48,299
I'm leaving. I'm leaving.

577
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:50,428
(giggles)

578
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,301
What do you see in him?

579
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:55,069
What? Marry him.

580
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:58,009
Fuck, Michela!
Shut up already.

581
00:27:59,212 --> 00:28:01,112
(groans)

582
00:28:02,316 --> 00:28:02,516
- (shouting, cheering)
- (rock music playing)

583

- (shouting, cheering)
- (rock music playing)

584
00:28:08,555 --> 00:28:10,250
Last party of the year, bro.

585
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:13,088
- Yeah, bro. I hope you get laid.
- Yeah, bro. I hope I get laid too.

586
00:28:15,128 --> 00:28:18,529
- Aw!
- (cheering)

587
00:28:18,565 --> 00:28:21,159
# Ooh ooh ooh #

588
00:28:23,937 --> 00:28:26,405

# I'm bleedin' out my eyes #

# They hit us with rocks,
we'll stand on a box #

595
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:43,982
# And show them
exactly what we found... #

596
00:28:44,024 --> 00:28:46,652
(vocalizing)

597
00:28:51,098 --> 00:28:53,191
You are getting
completely married tomorrow.

598
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:54,791
- Exactly.
- Thanks, brother.

599
00:28:54,835 --> 00:28:56,359
Hey... Mandy?

600
00:28:56,403 --> 00:28:57,995
- That's Megan.
- Whatever.

601
00:28:58,038 --> 00:28:59,801
# 'Cause when you're with me #

602
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,330
# I get this feeling inside #

Yeah!

624
00:29:58,265 --> 00:29:59,926
- Oh!
- Looks good, buddy.

625
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:02,560
Looks good, but you know what?
It is a little normal.

626
00:30:02,602 --> 00:30:04,467
- Yeah.
- Normal? What are you talking about?

627
00:30:04,504 --> 00:30:06,631
Dude dude...
where's the pop-a-top spotter?

628
00:30:06,673 --> 00:30:08,800
Chad:
Uh, right there.

629
00:30:08,842 --> 00:30:11,242
Hey, Vincent!
What's up, Vinny!

630
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:12,939
Where are the girls at?

631
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:14,810
(guys cheering)

632
00:30:14,848 --> 00:30:16,645
Good eyes, bro.
Good eyes.

633
00:30:16,683 --> 00:30:18,810
- That's what I'm talking about.
- But that's still normal.

634
00:30:18,852 --> 00:30:22,015
- It's normal.
- Normal? Dude, strip beer pong!

635
00:30:22,055 --> 00:30:24,455
(all cheering)

636
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:26,550
Whoo!

637
00:30:26,593 --> 00:30:28,254
All:
Oh!

638
00:30:31,998 --> 00:30:33,932
- Normal!
- Oh my God.

639
00:30:33,967 --> 00:30:36,367
You know what?
You guys... you guys are hard to impress,

640
00:30:36,403 --> 00:30:38,496
but follow me,
both of you...

641
00:30:38,538 --> 00:30:40,335
- Uh-huh?
...to the theme rooms.

642
00:30:40,373 --> 00:30:42,102
- Theme rooms!
- Oh my!

643
00:30:42,142 --> 00:30:44,076
Mac:
Theme rooms!

644
00:30:47,047 --> 00:30:49,106
(man vocalizing)

645
00:30:49,149 --> 00:30:52,516
(hip-hop music playing)

646
00:30:52,552 --> 00:30:56,181
Gentlemen, I simply call this room...

647
00:30:56,223 --> 00:30:57,747
"The Club."

648
00:30:57,791 --> 00:30:59,281
- Nice.
- Wow.

649
00:30:59,326 --> 00:31:01,487
Chad, it is looking

650
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:03,758
much much better.

651
00:31:03,797 --> 00:31:06,493
Please save your compliments

652
00:31:06,533 --> 00:31:09,161
until the end of the tour.

653
00:31:09,202 --> 00:31:11,898
- Move, come on.
- I'm going.

654
00:31:11,938 --> 00:31:13,496
# You know it's like fire #

655
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:16,566
# I ain't tired,
I feel wired #

656
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:18,134
# It's my desire... #

657
00:31:20,113 --> 00:31:22,240
Thanks.

658
00:31:22,282 --> 00:31:24,045
(sighs)

659
00:31:24,084 --> 00:31:26,109
- You worried?
- No.

660
00:31:26,153 --> 00:31:27,643
(sighs)

661
00:31:27,687 --> 00:31:29,245
(pop music playing)
# Change your pace... #

662
00:31:29,289 --> 00:31:31,484
Duffy:
Oh, that's good right there, yeah.

663
00:31:31,525 --> 00:31:33,925
Show me some more of that.

664
00:31:34,995 --> 00:31:38,226
Gentlemen, welcome
to my perverted palace

665
00:31:38,265 --> 00:31:39,994
of "pussay."

666
00:31:40,033 --> 00:31:42,729
# You stop for me,
can't hardly breathe... #

667
00:31:42,769 --> 00:31:45,602
Awesome.

668
00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:48,005
I'm speechless.

669
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:51,670
Yeah, sometimes
I even outdo myself.

670
00:31:54,114 --> 00:31:56,582
- Hey, Kell. You in line?
- Hey.

671
00:31:56,616 --> 00:31:58,243
Why not?

672
00:31:58,285 --> 00:32:00,185
To get photographed by Pablo?

673
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:03,018
Kelly:
No, I'm gonna get photographed

674
00:32:03,056 --> 00:32:04,648
by you, bachelor boy.

675
00:32:04,691 --> 00:32:06,852
- Surprise!
- You're a bachelor.

676
00:32:06,893 --> 00:32:09,555
It's your party.
Time to fuckin' party!

677
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:12,030
- Kelly: Whoo!
- Yeah! Come on, dude!

678
00:32:12,065 --> 00:32:14,090
- Yeah, it's my turn.
- Wait, I'm not done, I'm not done.

679
00:32:14,134 --> 00:32:16,329
- Oh, stop...
- Duffy, come on.

680
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:18,633
You're gonna shoot me.
Look. Look look look.

681
00:32:20,407 --> 00:32:23,137
You're not gonna touch,
you're just gonna shoot.

682
00:32:25,045 --> 00:32:26,637
- Chad: Oh my God. You've gotta...
- Shh!

683
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,545
No offense,
but l... I can't do that.

684
00:32:28,582 --> 00:32:30,106
# So beg me... #

685
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:33,483
Um, I'm... I'm a little insulted.

686
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,317
I said no offense,

687
00:32:35,355 --> 00:32:37,721
but if you're a little offended,
I'm sorry, Kell because...

688
00:32:37,757 --> 00:32:40,419
Are you fucking kidding me?

689
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,655
You know what?
Screw you. Pablo!

690
00:32:42,696 --> 00:32:44,527
That's your name, right?
You want to shoot me?

691
00:32:44,564 --> 00:32:46,896
- Pablo: Hell yeah.
- Kelly: All right, let's go.

692
00:32:46,933 --> 00:32:49,493
Bye! See you later!
Yeah, run along! Run along!

693
00:32:49,536 --> 00:32:51,060
- I'm sorry.
- Kelly: Yeah, whatever.

694
00:32:51,104 --> 00:32:52,628
- I love your tits.
- Kelly: Uh-huh.

695
00:32:52,672 --> 00:32:54,799
- (all chattering)
- Kelly: Yeah, it's cool. Whatever.

696
00:32:54,841 --> 00:32:56,809
- Give me the tiger... tiger.
- (hisses)

697
00:32:56,843 --> 00:32:59,073
That's... that's the shit
I'm talking about right there, dude.

698
00:32:59,112 --> 00:33:00,636
That's that shit.

699
00:33:02,616 --> 00:33:05,676
# I hope this will do for me... #

700
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,183
Duff.

701
00:33:09,222 --> 00:33:12,157
- Duff. Duffy.
- Chad.

702
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:14,217
- Duffy.
- Chad.

703
00:33:14,261 --> 00:33:15,819
- (laughs)
- Duffy!

704
00:33:15,862 --> 00:33:17,557
Chad, what the fuck?

705
00:33:17,597 --> 00:33:19,929
Well, uh, I'm sad.

706
00:33:19,966 --> 00:33:21,627
We're both sad.

707
00:33:21,668 --> 00:33:23,829
- Because?
- You're getting married.

708
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:26,395
- You're getting married, bro!
- Both: You're getting married!

709
00:33:26,439 --> 00:33:28,236
Married forever!
Forever married!

710
00:33:28,275 --> 00:33:30,106
I know, I'm getting married.
I'm sorry.

711
00:33:30,143 --> 00:33:33,271
Well, because we love you,

712
00:33:33,313 --> 00:33:35,338
- we got you a present.
- A big present.

713
00:33:35,382 --> 00:33:37,850
- Big present!
- I'm so jealous.

714
00:33:37,884 --> 00:33:40,045
- I'm so jealous!
- It's like the best present ever.

715
00:33:40,086 --> 00:33:41,781
Okay, what is it?

716
00:33:41,821 --> 00:33:43,550
- Porn star!
- Porn star, bro!

717
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:46,252
- Motherfuckin' porn star!
- Porn star!

718
00:33:46,293 --> 00:33:48,056
What the fuck
are you talking about?

719
00:33:48,094 --> 00:33:50,688
Right there behind this door

720
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:54,359
is a real live human
fucking porn star

721
00:33:54,401 --> 00:33:55,959
for you to fuck the shit out of!

722
00:33:56,002 --> 00:33:58,698
- Yeah, that's a good one.
- In your room, porn star, for you, Duff.

723
00:33:58,738 --> 00:34:01,366
Duffy, if there is not a porn star

724
00:34:01,408 --> 00:34:02,966
in that room
when you open the door,

725
00:34:03,009 --> 00:34:05,136
I will personally suck your dick.

726
00:34:05,178 --> 00:34:07,203
There is no fucking way
that there is a porn star

727
00:34:07,247 --> 00:34:08,805
in this Gamma House
in my room.

728
00:34:08,848 --> 00:34:10,247
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

729
00:34:10,283 --> 00:34:11,807
Okay, well, how about this? Bam!

730
00:34:14,154 --> 00:34:15,951
Duffy, right?

731
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:17,513
Duffy:
Hey. Yeah.

732
00:34:19,259 --> 00:34:21,090
Hello.

733
00:34:23,663 --> 00:34:25,961
Oh, God.
Mission accomplished.

734
00:34:25,999 --> 00:34:27,557
It's really on, dude.
He's not going to know.

735
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,033
(laughing)
I know.

736
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:30,559
I need Vicodin.

737
00:34:30,603 --> 00:34:32,935
You're... you're Jesse Jane.

738
00:34:32,972 --> 00:34:36,066
You have really
considerate friends, Duffy.

739
00:34:36,109 --> 00:34:37,736
Yeah.

740
00:34:37,777 --> 00:34:41,338
You know, I don't offer myself
to a lot of people.

741
00:34:41,381 --> 00:34:43,110
(pop music playing)

742
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:44,844
- You don't?
- Uh-uh.

743
00:34:44,884 --> 00:34:47,352
I'm doing this
as a favor for Chad.

744
00:34:50,056 --> 00:34:51,956
Yeah, I mean, porn's different,

745
00:34:51,991 --> 00:34:53,720
but on the other hand,

746
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,352
I'm a really nice girl.

747
00:34:55,395 --> 00:34:58,455
Yeah, you look like a nice girl.

748
00:34:58,498 --> 00:35:00,557
I'm from a really small town.

749
00:35:01,601 --> 00:35:03,535
- I'm from a small town.
- Where at?

750
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:05,367
Oklahoma.

751
00:35:05,405 --> 00:35:07,202
No way, I'm from Oklahoma.

752
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,867
We... we actually
went to the same high school.

753
00:35:08,908 --> 00:35:11,138
- We did?
- Yeah.

754
00:35:11,177 --> 00:35:13,543
- Have I met you?
- No, but we brushed arms one time

755
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,377
like walking by.

756
00:35:15,415 --> 00:35:17,815
Huh. Well,

757
00:35:17,851 --> 00:35:20,149
what's it gonna be,
bachelor boy?

758
00:35:20,186 --> 00:35:22,211
Um... um...

759
00:35:22,255 --> 00:35:23,882
what... what do you mean?

760
00:35:23,923 --> 00:35:26,983
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

761
00:35:27,026 --> 00:35:29,187
You're cute.

762
00:35:29,229 --> 00:35:30,924
I owe Chad a favor

763
00:35:30,964 --> 00:35:32,454
and you're getting married.

764
00:35:32,499 --> 00:35:35,161
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

765
00:35:35,201 --> 00:35:37,635
So do you want
to have sex with me?

766
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:40,468
Uh... s... yeah... sex with...

767
00:35:40,507 --> 00:35:42,236
with... with... with you?

768
00:35:42,275 --> 00:35:44,937
Sex with me.

769
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:48,709
Sex with... with you.

770
00:35:48,748 --> 00:35:51,046
Are you hard of fucking hearing?

771
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:54,917
- (moans)
- Oh, shit.

772
00:35:54,954 --> 00:35:57,252
I'm not... I'm actually
not hard of hearing.

773
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:59,019
- But you're hard.
- Yeah.

774
00:35:59,058 --> 00:36:02,050
Um, this is...
this is incredible,

775
00:36:02,095 --> 00:36:04,188
- I need to tell you.
- Mm, yeah.

776
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,790
- Oh my God.
- (moaning)

777
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:09,461
- Take you clothes off.
- My... my clothes too?

778
00:36:09,502 --> 00:36:11,163
- Yeah, I want your clothes off.
- Okay.

779
00:36:11,204 --> 00:36:13,672
- Come on.
- I've gotta get this button.

780
00:36:13,706 --> 00:36:15,867
Come on. Oh, come on,
take your clothes off!

781
00:36:15,909 --> 00:36:17,570
- Okay, yeah yeah...
- I'm horny.

782
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:20,078
Fuck me, Duffy!
Fuck me, Duffy!

783
00:36:20,113 --> 00:36:22,081
- (Duffy muttering)
- (Jesse moaning)

784
00:36:28,021 --> 00:36:30,285
- Jesse: Oh, God.
- Duffy: Oh, yeah.

785
00:36:31,524 --> 00:36:33,583
- Okay. That's nice.
- (moaning loudly)

786
00:36:34,828 --> 00:36:36,921
You know what?
You know what? L... l...

787
00:36:36,963 --> 00:36:40,057
l... I can't. I can't.

788
00:36:40,099 --> 00:36:41,896
I can't... I can't do this. I'm sorry.

789
00:36:41,935 --> 00:36:43,698
- What?!
- It's just that...

790
00:36:43,736 --> 00:36:46,136
I'm getting married tomorrow.

791
00:36:47,474 --> 00:36:49,032
- So...
- What the fuck!

792
00:36:49,075 --> 00:36:51,009
- It's just...
- (gasps)

793
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:53,808
I, um... you're really hot, but...

794
00:36:54,948 --> 00:36:56,848
Do you know how many guys
turn me down topless?

795
00:36:59,185 --> 00:37:02,086
- Three?
- None, you fuck!

796
00:37:02,121 --> 00:37:04,555
Jesse, listen, um...

797
00:37:04,591 --> 00:37:07,059
good Lord, you know?

798
00:37:07,093 --> 00:37:09,425
- (sighs)
- I'm attracted to you.

799
00:37:09,462 --> 00:37:11,794
It's... it's... I just...

800
00:37:11,831 --> 00:37:13,799
Jesse:
No shit?

801
00:37:15,101 --> 00:37:18,628
I really want to do you.
You know, I love my fiancÃ©e.

802
00:37:18,671 --> 00:37:20,400
Really? That's sweet.

803
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,568
But you're missing out
on a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

804
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:27,478
I wish that I was a dog and that I was
still a freshman or a sophomore

805
00:37:27,514 --> 00:37:29,277
or a junior

806
00:37:29,315 --> 00:37:30,873
or it was beginning of senior year

807
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:32,942
because I would
fuck the living shit out of you.

808
00:37:32,986 --> 00:37:35,682
But you know what?
L... I would never hurt my girlfriend.

809
00:37:35,722 --> 00:37:38,156
Are you sure there's
nothing you wouldn't do?

810
00:37:39,325 --> 00:37:41,122
Um... but...

811
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,152
Nothing at all you wouldn't wanna...

812
00:37:44,197 --> 00:37:46,859
try out?

813
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,130
Yeah yeah, okay.
Let's stop.

814
00:37:49,168 --> 00:37:51,796
Let's just stop
right here because...

815
00:37:52,839 --> 00:37:55,273
I really do love her
and as much as I love

816
00:37:55,308 --> 00:37:57,902
Jesse Jane,
I need to go and, uh...

817
00:37:58,978 --> 00:38:01,640
She's... she's a really lucky girl.

818
00:38:02,882 --> 00:38:05,112
- You think so?
- You turned me down,

819
00:38:05,151 --> 00:38:07,483
so yeah, I think so.

820
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:11,313
Thank you.

821
00:38:11,357 --> 00:38:12,949
I'm gonna, um...
I'm gonna go.

822
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:15,153
- Okay.
- Thanks for coming.

823
00:38:15,194 --> 00:38:18,095
- And, uh...
- Thanks for not coming.

824
00:38:18,131 --> 00:38:20,725
Would you sign
my fridge? Please?

825
00:38:20,767 --> 00:38:22,826
- Sure.
- There's a Sharpie in that mug over there.

826
00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:24,803
Okay. I will.
I'll sign you fridge.

827
00:38:24,837 --> 00:38:26,737
- Can I kiss that bunny?
- You wanna kiss my bunny?

828
00:38:26,773 --> 00:38:28,365
Yeah. There you go.

829
00:38:28,408 --> 00:38:31,241
- I always wanted to do that.
- (giggles)

830
00:38:31,277 --> 00:38:33,575
- I'm gonna get married!
- Whoo-hoo!

831
00:38:36,883 --> 00:38:40,717
# I can survive #

832
00:38:40,753 --> 00:38:42,721
- # Ooh #
- Hey, Duff.

833
00:38:42,755 --> 00:38:45,383
- Hey. Hey hey.
- Where's your girlfriend, big boy?

834
00:38:45,425 --> 00:38:48,121
- She's actually not here.
- Oh! Lucky for me then.

835
00:38:48,161 --> 00:38:50,061
Yeah, no no no.
Actually, I'm getting married.

836
00:38:50,096 --> 00:38:52,257
- I'm getting married tomorrow.
- Really?

837
00:38:52,298 --> 00:38:55,062
- Yeah.
- Shouldn't you be at the rehearsal...

838
00:38:55,101 --> 00:38:56,796
Yes! L... I should.
I should be there.

839
00:38:56,836 --> 00:38:58,463
So, l... I'm going right now.

840
00:38:58,504 --> 00:39:00,199
Yeah, I'll meet you upstairs.

841
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:02,434
Yeah? Upstairs.

842
00:39:02,475 --> 00:39:04,500
Holy God.

843
00:39:05,778 --> 00:39:07,939
(cheering, shouting)

844
00:39:15,355 --> 00:39:17,118
Mac!

845
00:39:19,726 --> 00:39:22,092
Mac!

846
00:39:22,128 --> 00:39:23,857
Come on, boy!
(smooches)

847
00:39:23,896 --> 00:39:25,488
Come on!
(whistles)

848
00:39:25,531 --> 00:39:27,590
Damn it!
Get over here!

849
00:39:31,137 --> 00:39:33,002
Did you see me sucking face
with that hot chick?

850
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:35,098
Shh! See that guy? Him.

851
00:39:35,141 --> 00:39:37,268
That dude right there
does not belong here.

852
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:38,800
Mac:
What... what?

853
00:39:38,845 --> 00:39:41,780
That's Adriana's ex-boyfriend.
It's her sister's...

854
00:39:41,814 --> 00:39:44,282
Duff, did you fuck her?

855
00:39:44,317 --> 00:39:45,807
- No.
- No?!

856
00:39:45,852 --> 00:39:47,342
- No!
- No?!

857
00:39:47,387 --> 00:39:49,082
- No, dickhead!
- Dude, I would've fucked her!

858
00:39:49,122 --> 00:39:50,987
- I know you would've...
- You didn't fuck Jesse Jane?

859
00:39:51,024 --> 00:39:52,855
- I spent all my money on that chick.
- Way to go, bro.

860
00:39:52,892 --> 00:39:55,793
By the way, Mac, the girl you're
making out with has herpes.

861
00:39:55,828 --> 00:39:58,126
Anyways, follow me

862
00:39:58,164 --> 00:39:59,995
(French accent)
To the sex dungeon.

863
00:40:00,033 --> 00:40:01,694
Yeah, like big-time herpes.
I got it from her.

864
00:40:01,734 --> 00:40:04,066
Can I go back up there with Jesse Jane
then? 'Cause it won't matter.

865
00:40:04,103 --> 00:40:06,367
Duffy:
Come on.

866
00:40:06,406 --> 00:40:06,472
- (industrial music playing)
- (Chad humming)

867
00:40:06,472 --> 00:40:08,303
- (industrial music playing)
- (Chad humming)

868
00:40:11,444 --> 00:40:13,708
Man:
Oh, wow.

869
00:40:13,746 --> 00:40:16,579
Duffy-Duff, meet Jennifer,

870
00:40:16,616 --> 00:40:18,914
your sex dungeon goddess.

871
00:40:20,353 --> 00:40:21,877
Jesus, Chad.

872
00:40:21,921 --> 00:40:24,253
L... you look so...
(grunting)

873
00:40:26,726 --> 00:40:29,058
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, man!

874
00:40:29,095 --> 00:40:30,585
- I can't watch.
- Damn it.

875
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:32,120
- Oh my God.
- Damn it!

876
00:40:32,165 --> 00:40:35,362
You literally just made him
ejaculate in his boxer shorts.

877
00:40:35,401 --> 00:40:37,426
- Mac: Oh, God!
- Clean him up.

878
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:39,165
I'm gonna do that.

879
00:40:40,273 --> 00:40:43,367
- (groans)
- Sorry, Mac's always had a thing for you.

880
00:40:43,409 --> 00:40:45,001
(chuckles)
Yeah.

881
00:40:45,044 --> 00:40:46,636
Both: L...

882
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:49,739
- I had no idea, Jenn.
- Yeah, well, I figured

883
00:40:49,782 --> 00:40:52,012
I'd never see
these guys again, so...

884
00:40:52,051 --> 00:40:53,882
I'm more surprised
to see you here.

885
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,185
I thought you were...
I thought you were getting married.

886
00:40:57,223 --> 00:40:59,555
I am, tomorrow.

887
00:40:59,592 --> 00:41:01,560
You know,

888
00:41:01,594 --> 00:41:04,290
you should've married me, Duff.
I mean... Kelly?

889
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:06,457
Lily? And Adriana?

890
00:41:06,499 --> 00:41:08,262
Are you serious?

891
00:41:08,301 --> 00:41:10,929
I am the one for you.

892
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:13,063
Um, that was like

893
00:41:13,106 --> 00:41:15,267
three and a half years ago.

894
00:41:15,308 --> 00:41:17,503
I know, but it's always
so good to see you.

895
00:41:17,543 --> 00:41:19,636
You just gotta let it go.

896
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:22,580
Okay, look, why don't we do

897
00:41:22,615 --> 00:41:24,810
a little goodbye present?

898
00:41:24,851 --> 00:41:28,252
Say, a little sadomasochistic
present from me to you?

899
00:41:29,322 --> 00:41:31,290
- Um...
- Come on, what do you say?

900
00:41:31,324 --> 00:41:33,121
That's really sweet.

901
00:41:34,193 --> 00:41:36,024
Could you do me a favor?

902
00:41:36,062 --> 00:41:38,257
(stammers)
Oh, yeah, you want sex, no whipping.

903
00:41:38,297 --> 00:41:39,787
(laughing)

904
00:41:39,832 --> 00:41:41,424
- No sex...
- What?

905
00:41:41,467 --> 00:41:43,731
...unfortunately.

906
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:47,103
Um, I need you to do me

907
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:49,665
a big favor.

908
00:41:49,709 --> 00:41:52,200
- Um, okay.
- Okay, there's this guy.

909
00:41:52,245 --> 00:41:54,406
- He's spying on me, all right?
- (laughs)

910
00:41:54,447 --> 00:41:56,142
- Seriously?
- Yeah, seriously.

911
00:41:56,182 --> 00:41:58,582
It's weird, I know,
but Adriana's family...

912
00:41:58,618 --> 00:42:00,347
probably her dad...
hired this guy Stefano

913
00:42:00,386 --> 00:42:02,286
to come and, you know,
spy on me.

914
00:42:02,321 --> 00:42:03,913
And why would
they be spying on you?

915
00:42:03,956 --> 00:42:06,151
I don't know, nervous
about the wedding I guess.

916
00:42:06,192 --> 00:42:07,716
(laughs)
No,

917
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,729
probably because you skipped out
on the rehearsal dinner.

918
00:42:10,763 --> 00:42:12,390
(laughs)
How did you know about...

919
00:42:12,431 --> 00:42:15,093
it's not... it's not a rehearsal dinner.
It's actually a family...

920
00:42:15,134 --> 00:42:17,159
That is what it's called, Duffy.
That is what happens

921
00:42:17,203 --> 00:42:19,763
the night before the wedding.
It's a rehearsal dinner.

922
00:42:19,806 --> 00:42:21,831
- I'm allowed to miss it.
- No, you're not.

923
00:42:21,874 --> 00:42:24,069
Would you help me out, please?

924
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:26,806
So, you want me to lure him in

925
00:42:26,846 --> 00:42:28,438
and tease him
and then tie him up

926
00:42:28,481 --> 00:42:30,949
so that he can't leave, right?

927
00:42:30,983 --> 00:42:33,178
That's exactly what I was gonna say.
That's so weird.

928
00:42:33,219 --> 00:42:34,709
- Oh!
- (whip cracks)

929
00:42:34,754 --> 00:42:37,279
- Ow!
- That's exactly why I'm the one for you.

930
00:42:37,323 --> 00:42:39,188
That's not the one at all.

931
00:42:39,225 --> 00:42:41,693
Duffy! What the fuck?

932
00:42:41,727 --> 00:42:44,093
I give you this
leather, hot piece of ass

933
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:47,691
and you talk?
Treat her like a piggy bank

934
00:42:47,733 --> 00:42:49,758
and put things inside her. Look!

935
00:42:49,802 --> 00:42:51,963
- Don't you see?
- There's this thing.

936
00:42:52,004 --> 00:42:53,869
- Chad Chad Chad. Okay, cool.
- What?

937
00:42:53,906 --> 00:42:55,430
I need you to do something for me.

938
00:42:55,474 --> 00:42:58,341
I am doing something for you.
Look at this hot piece of ass.

939
00:42:58,377 --> 00:43:00,607
- (giggles)
- Yeah, all right.

940
00:43:00,646 --> 00:43:02,136
You guys can hook up
whenever you want to,

941
00:43:02,181 --> 00:43:05,116
but for now, I need you to go
and find the Stefano guy,

942
00:43:05,151 --> 00:43:07,483
bring him here
and introduce him to Jennifer.

943
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,318
Oh, I hate that guy.
I saw him upstairs. He's an asshole.

944
00:43:10,356 --> 00:43:11,914
- Yeah.
- I was gonna say something mean,

945
00:43:11,958 --> 00:43:14,654
but I'm scared of people.

946
00:43:14,694 --> 00:43:16,252
Well, you know what?
Don't worry about it.

947
00:43:16,295 --> 00:43:17,956
- I'll change his tune.
- Okay.

948
00:43:17,997 --> 00:43:19,726
- Yeah.
- So, I'll go get him

949
00:43:19,765 --> 00:43:22,233
while you
kind of do things to her.

950
00:43:22,268 --> 00:43:23,963
- Give me a few minutes.
- All right.

951
00:43:24,003 --> 00:43:25,903
- We'll set it up.
- You know what I'm talking about?

952
00:43:25,938 --> 00:43:27,496
Hey, hide your panties.

953
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,440
- Still wet.
- Hi, Jenn.

954
00:43:29,475 --> 00:43:31,136
Uh-huh.

955
00:43:33,212 --> 00:43:35,373
So, when he comes up,
I want you to just like tie him up...

956
00:43:35,414 --> 00:43:37,177
- Yeah yeah yeah...
- Seduce him a little bit.

957
00:43:37,216 --> 00:43:39,446
This is gonna be my plan.
We're gonna undress you.

958
00:43:39,485 --> 00:43:41,043
Take it off, take it off.

959
00:43:41,087 --> 00:43:43,817
Okay. So we're going
to get you undressed.

960
00:43:43,856 --> 00:43:46,484
- Okay? Help me.
- Sorry. Sorry.

961
00:43:46,525 --> 00:43:48,186
- I'm still...
- Do it before he gets down here.

962
00:43:48,227 --> 00:43:50,024
- I want him to see you.
- That's a good idea.

963
00:43:50,062 --> 00:43:51,723
- Yeah, it's gonna be perfect.
- Okay.

964
00:43:51,764 --> 00:43:54,665
Because I want him to see exactly
what we're going to do to him.

965
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,668
- Okay.
- He has to believe it.

966
00:43:56,702 --> 00:43:58,192
- Okay, cool.
- Okay.

967
00:43:58,237 --> 00:43:59,727
- Are you ready?
- These come off too?

968
00:43:59,772 --> 00:44:01,899
Yeah, everything. Shoes.
Take 'em off.

969
00:44:01,941 --> 00:44:03,568
- Okay.
- Okay.

970
00:44:03,609 --> 00:44:05,736
- This sounds like it...
- No, I promise. I promise.

971
00:44:05,778 --> 00:44:07,370
Take your socks off,
it looks terrible.

972
00:44:08,948 --> 00:44:10,848
- Duffy: Um...
- Okay. Okay, now...

973
00:44:10,883 --> 00:44:12,680
this is the best part.

974
00:44:12,718 --> 00:44:15,278
So, I'm going to tie him like this.
I'm going to show you, okay?

975
00:44:15,321 --> 00:44:17,221
So, come stand right here. Okay?

976
00:44:17,256 --> 00:44:18,951
Now, I'm gonna
put your hands in here.

977
00:44:18,991 --> 00:44:20,583
- Okay.
- Like this and then we're gonna go...

978
00:44:20,626 --> 00:44:22,389
(chirps)
Tighten 'em.

979
00:44:22,428 --> 00:44:24,760
- Yeah.
- Go like this. Gonna pull 'em up.

980
00:44:24,797 --> 00:44:26,492
- (Jennifer chirps)
- Yeah.

981
00:44:26,532 --> 00:44:28,932
- This is gonna be awesome.
- 'Cause then he can't do anything.

982
00:44:28,968 --> 00:44:30,458
I know, it's perfect.

983
00:44:30,503 --> 00:44:32,767
And then, your other hand.

984
00:44:32,805 --> 00:44:34,329
- Oh, both hands.
- Oh, yeah.

985
00:44:34,373 --> 00:44:36,102
They can't be free.
Come on.

986
00:44:36,142 --> 00:44:38,406
- Duffy: I get it though.
- Right? No. We have to do it.

987
00:44:38,444 --> 00:44:40,912
- He has to see...
- Duffy: Be like practicing or something...

988
00:44:40,947 --> 00:44:42,505
That's right.

989
00:44:43,582 --> 00:44:45,277
- Back?
- Tighten that shit up.

990
00:44:45,318 --> 00:44:46,808
- Ready?
- Yeah, okay.

991
00:44:46,852 --> 00:44:48,479
Okay.

992
00:44:48,521 --> 00:44:50,887
We can pull out our toys

993
00:44:50,923 --> 00:44:52,891
and we can decide
everything we want to do to him

994
00:44:52,925 --> 00:44:54,449
when he comes down here, right?

995
00:44:54,493 --> 00:44:56,120
Well, l... I already know
what I want you to do...

996
00:44:56,162 --> 00:44:58,221
- Like what? You tell me.
- I want you to tie him up like this.

997
00:44:58,264 --> 00:44:59,993
- Uh-huh?
- And I want you to speed-bag his balls

998
00:45:00,032 --> 00:45:01,693
like you're a boxer,
just boom boom boom.

999
00:45:01,734 --> 00:45:03,463
- Ooh, I would love to.
- Okay.

1000
00:45:03,502 --> 00:45:05,993
And then maybe you can
pour some hot wax on them.

1001
00:45:06,038 --> 00:45:08,268
- Uh-huh.
- Maybe take that shovel off the wall

1002
00:45:08,307 --> 00:45:10,036
- and shove it up his anus.
- Okay.

1003
00:45:10,076 --> 00:45:13,375
- Not supposed to grab that.
- What, your package?

1004
00:45:13,412 --> 00:45:14,936
- Yeah.
- Aww.

1005
00:45:14,981 --> 00:45:17,745
Is Adriana gonna get so upset?
Aww, I'm so worried.

1006
00:45:17,783 --> 00:45:20,047
I mean...

1007
00:45:20,086 --> 00:45:21,883
- So, can l...
- Tell her I had it first.

1008
00:45:21,921 --> 00:45:23,889
Oh, I'm not gonna tell her that.

1009
00:45:24,924 --> 00:45:26,414
Can I get... can I get out now.

1010
00:45:26,459 --> 00:45:28,051
- Can you... can I get out of this though?
- No.

1011
00:45:28,094 --> 00:45:31,291
- I have to show him exactly...
- Oh, like... like I'm a part of it.

1012
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:35,027
Right, you're... you're the display
so he knows, right?

1013
00:45:35,067 --> 00:45:37,035
Do I have to really be
in my underwear for this?

1014
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:39,999
Oh, I could strip you down.

1015
00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:42,234
No, I don't want to be naked.
I thought maybe I'd wear jeans

1016
00:45:42,274 --> 00:45:44,174
- or something like that.
- No.

1017
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:46,906
- This is way more fun.
- Oh, fun.

1018
00:45:46,946 --> 00:45:49,312
So, what kind of games
are you playing?

1019
00:45:49,348 --> 00:45:51,839
(giggles)

1020
00:45:51,884 --> 00:45:53,374
Hey, thanks a lot.

1021
00:45:53,419 --> 00:45:55,250
Oh! What's going on?

1022
00:45:57,890 --> 00:45:59,687
Hey. Hey.

1023
00:45:59,725 --> 00:46:02,717
Uh, do we... um...
do I know you?

1024
00:46:02,762 --> 00:46:06,562
Um, nope. I'm actually, uh...
I'm actually a foreign exchange student.

1025
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:08,533
So, I don't think you know me.

1026
00:46:08,567 --> 00:46:10,558
- He's not from around here.
- Okay. Well, guess what?

1027
00:46:10,603 --> 00:46:12,298
You know what?
We throw big parties

1028
00:46:12,338 --> 00:46:15,068
especially for people who are,
you know, like you.

1029
00:46:15,107 --> 00:46:16,870
- Like this one.
- Yeah.

1030
00:46:16,909 --> 00:46:20,106
So, why don't you join us
in the sex dungeon?

1031
00:46:20,146 --> 00:46:22,114
Well, not us... not us.
We got girls.

1032
00:46:22,148 --> 00:46:24,343
Yeah yeah yeah,
not... not us... not us three...

1033
00:46:24,383 --> 00:46:26,010
- Not us in the sex dungeon.
- But a sex dungeon.

1034
00:46:26,052 --> 00:46:28,145
- It's like... it's like...
- We're going to take you it...

1035
00:46:28,187 --> 00:46:30,121
- take you to it.
- It's like the Renaissance Faire

1036
00:46:30,156 --> 00:46:32,283
- with chlamydia.
- Okay.

1037
00:46:32,324 --> 00:46:34,383
- But not all of 'em...
- Just, uh, give me one second, okay?

1038
00:46:34,427 --> 00:46:36,088
Okay.

1039
00:46:36,128 --> 00:46:38,255
L... I'll be right back.

1040
00:46:38,297 --> 00:46:40,162
You just wait
right here for me, okay?

1041
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:41,928
Just wait right here.

1042
00:46:42,968 --> 00:46:44,731
Hey, who's that guy?

1043
00:46:46,439 --> 00:46:48,168
(Jennifer moans)

1044
00:46:48,207 --> 00:46:50,198
So much fun,
as I promised.

1045
00:46:50,242 --> 00:46:52,210
- I can't wait.
- (laughs)

1046
00:46:52,244 --> 00:46:53,939
Me either.

1047
00:46:53,979 --> 00:46:55,708
(sighs)

1048
00:46:55,748 --> 00:46:57,306
- Oh!
- (laughs)

1049
00:46:57,349 --> 00:46:59,112
Hey, Jennifer,
we have a new player!

1050
00:46:59,151 --> 00:47:01,381
Ooh, bring him in.

1051
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:03,980
Ooh! Is this my next conquest?

1052
00:47:04,023 --> 00:47:05,888
(Stefano laughs)

1053
00:47:08,727 --> 00:47:10,592
Come over here.

1054
00:47:11,864 --> 00:47:14,924
You want to join in the fun?

1055
00:47:14,967 --> 00:47:16,491
Stefano!

1056
00:47:16,535 --> 00:47:18,264
What are you doing here, bro?

1057
00:47:18,304 --> 00:47:21,535
Duff, l... I thought
you were getting married.

1058
00:47:21,574 --> 00:47:24,441
Uh, tomorrow, buddy.
This is freedom.

1059
00:47:24,477 --> 00:47:28,140
You want to, uh,
let me tie you up?

1060
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:29,807
Oh, no, I'm... I'm good. Thanks.

1061
00:47:29,849 --> 00:47:31,476
Oh, okay.

1062
00:47:31,517 --> 00:47:33,178
Come on, bro.
Just let her tie you up, dude.

1063
00:47:33,219 --> 00:47:34,948
It's my last night of freedom.

1064
00:47:34,987 --> 00:47:36,716
I mean, you've been bad, right?

1065
00:47:36,755 --> 00:47:38,279
- Oh yeah, I mean...
- He's been real bad.

1066
00:47:38,324 --> 00:47:39,848
Oh-ho! Then it'll be fun.

1067
00:47:39,892 --> 00:47:42,156
- Let's tie you up.
- Well, I mean, I guess I could

1068
00:47:42,194 --> 00:47:43,718
get tied up a little bit.

1069
00:47:43,762 --> 00:47:45,252
Come here.
Give me that wrist.

1070
00:47:45,297 --> 00:47:48,266
I always... two is always
more fun than one.

1071
00:47:49,468 --> 00:47:51,197
Oh, like this?
This is how you get tied up?

1072
00:47:51,237 --> 00:47:52,932
- Yeah.
- You know, the funny thing

1073
00:47:52,972 --> 00:47:55,566
- about this knot is...
- Jennifer: Is what?

1074
00:47:56,609 --> 00:47:59,305
Oh, Duff. Oops.

1075
00:48:00,513 --> 00:48:03,107
- (Jennifer laughs)
- Oh. Tie him back up.

1076
00:48:05,851 --> 00:48:07,409
- Whoa! What?
- Looks like you have

1077
00:48:07,453 --> 00:48:09,182
a little problem here, Duffy.

1078
00:48:09,221 --> 00:48:11,018
What the... shit...

1079
00:48:11,056 --> 00:48:13,024
- Jennifer: Yeah.
- Whoa!

1080
00:48:13,058 --> 00:48:15,424
- Fuck you, Duffy.
- Fuck me?

1081
00:48:15,461 --> 00:48:17,156
- Yeah.
- You don't get it, do you?

1082
00:48:17,196 --> 00:48:18,857
You don't get it.
Your little rich bitch...

1083
00:48:18,898 --> 00:48:21,162
her daddy paid him
to set you up.

1084
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,966
Okay, this isn't funny
and you're supposed to tie his ass up.

1085
00:48:25,004 --> 00:48:26,767
Shh shh shh shh.

1086
00:48:26,805 --> 00:48:29,171
- Fuck you, Duffy.
- Whoa... fuck me?

1087
00:48:29,208 --> 00:48:32,075
- Yeah. Fuck you.
- W... why?

1088
00:48:32,111 --> 00:48:34,636
How does it make you feel?
Do you feel helpless right now?

1089
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:37,148
- I feel...
- You broke my heart, you fucker.

1090
00:48:37,183 --> 00:48:38,775
Oh, God. Ow!

1091
00:48:38,817 --> 00:48:40,512
- Payback's a bitch, Duffy.
- Obviously.

1092
00:48:40,553 --> 00:48:42,487
You like being helpless?
Watch this.

1093
00:48:42,521 --> 00:48:44,079
Oh... no.
(muttering)

1094
00:48:44,123 --> 00:48:45,852
- Put a ball in your mouth.
- Let me get on a plane.

1095
00:48:45,891 --> 00:48:47,381
Can I get on a plane, please?

1096
00:48:47,426 --> 00:48:49,758
If I miss the flight, dude,
it's... I'm not gonna get married.

1097
00:48:49,795 --> 00:48:52,263
- Jennifer: What... what? Oh, bummer.
- Dude, there's one flight out.

1098
00:48:52,298 --> 00:48:54,858
I get married tomorrow.
Just let me get on the friggin' plane.

1099
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:58,165
Oh, God...
(muttering)

1100
00:48:58,204 --> 00:49:00,195
- (Duffy groaning)
- Now, that's all better, isn't it?

1101
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:01,729
How's that taste?
Does it taste good?

1102
00:49:01,774 --> 00:49:03,605
- Mm-mm.
- No, it doesn't.

1103
00:49:03,642 --> 00:49:05,405
- How do you like being tortured? Huh?
- Mm-mm.

1104
00:49:05,444 --> 00:49:07,412
I can give you
a little bit more, Duffy.

1105
00:49:07,446 --> 00:49:09,175
- Mm-mm.
- You deserve it.

1106
00:49:09,215 --> 00:49:11,046
You're a complete prick.

1107
00:49:11,083 --> 00:49:13,017
Now, as much as I would enjoy

1108
00:49:13,052 --> 00:49:15,452
staying to play with you,
because I mean,

1109
00:49:15,487 --> 00:49:18,422
as we can see,
you've been trying to go to the gym,

1110
00:49:18,457 --> 00:49:20,015
but you missed a little spot...

1111
00:49:20,059 --> 00:49:22,857
so, I'm going to leave you here

1112
00:49:22,895 --> 00:49:25,193
all by yourself to think
about things, okay?

1113
00:49:25,231 --> 00:49:27,358
- (groaning, muttering)
- Bye, princess.

1114
00:49:29,201 --> 00:49:31,032
Good.

1115
00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:32,560
- Bye, Duff.
- (screams)

1116
00:49:32,605 --> 00:49:34,835
- Later, Duffy.
- (yelling)

1117
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:40,504
# Is what I said #

1118
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,075
# But there's
a place that... #

1119
00:49:44,116 --> 00:49:45,606
I almost forgot.

1120
00:49:45,651 --> 00:49:48,950
- (screams)
- That's gotta hurt.

1121
00:49:55,494 --> 00:49:57,826
(dialing)

1122
00:50:05,204 --> 00:50:07,434
(phone ringing)

1123
00:50:16,582 --> 00:50:19,710
(groans, sighs)

1124
00:50:26,892 --> 00:50:28,093
Man:
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1125
00:50:28,093 --> 00:50:29,617
Man:
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1126
00:50:29,662 --> 00:50:32,563
- Everybody out!
- (men shouting)

1127
00:50:32,598 --> 00:50:34,566
(folk music playing)

1128
00:50:38,337 --> 00:50:39,861
Whoa-ho!

1129
00:50:43,876 --> 00:50:45,400
(screaming)

1130
00:50:47,012 --> 00:50:49,173
(phone ringing)

1131
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:53,946
(snoring)

1132
00:50:56,588 --> 00:50:58,818
(sniffs)
Mom? Mom?

1133
00:50:59,858 --> 00:51:01,758
Mom?

1134
00:51:01,794 --> 00:51:04,695
# Baby, keep you by my side #

1135
00:51:06,198 --> 00:51:07,722
# No use in trying... #

1136
00:51:07,766 --> 00:51:10,428
What a great end
to a solid four years.

1137
00:51:11,704 --> 00:51:13,672
I'm gonna miss this place.

1138
00:51:13,706 --> 00:51:17,437
I'm gonna miss girls
like you... so much.

1139
00:51:17,476 --> 00:51:19,444
Mac:
Hell yeah, bro.

1140
00:51:19,478 --> 00:51:21,275
I met some really cool people,

1141
00:51:21,313 --> 00:51:23,679
but you and Duffy...

1142
00:51:25,851 --> 00:51:27,580
I love you guys.

1143
00:51:27,619 --> 00:51:29,553
Bro.

1144
00:51:32,024 --> 00:51:34,458
- Where is Duffy?
- (Mac laughs)

1145
00:51:34,493 --> 00:51:36,961
Fuck. I haven't seen him in like...

1146
00:51:38,597 --> 00:51:40,189
holy shit, what time is it?

1147
00:51:41,667 --> 00:51:44,227
- Holy shit.
- Chad: Oh no, dude.

1148
00:51:44,269 --> 00:51:46,965
He's fucking that bitch Jennifer

1149
00:51:47,005 --> 00:51:49,132
in the dungeon, right?

1150
00:51:49,174 --> 00:51:51,802
No, she left with that foreign guy

1151
00:51:51,844 --> 00:51:53,539
that blew me off last night.

1152
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:55,376
He was kind of cute.

1153
00:51:55,414 --> 00:51:56,904
You talk?

1154
00:51:56,949 --> 00:51:58,974
Shit! Shit!

1155
00:51:59,017 --> 00:52:00,644
Chad! He's gonna
miss his fucking flight!

1156
00:52:00,686 --> 00:52:03,211
We missed it! He's gonna miss
the whole fucking wedding, man!

1157
00:52:03,255 --> 00:52:05,120
We gotta get him!
Fucking shit!

1158
00:52:05,157 --> 00:52:07,955
- Come on, bro!
- I can't believe she talks!

1159
00:52:09,428 --> 00:52:10,918
(rattling)

1160
00:52:10,963 --> 00:52:13,864
Oh! Jeez, Duff!
What happened?

1161
00:52:13,899 --> 00:52:15,594
- (muttering)
- You don't know?

1162
00:52:15,634 --> 00:52:18,000
(grunting)
Oh!

1163
00:52:18,036 --> 00:52:20,470
- What happened, bro?
- (spits)

1164
00:52:20,506 --> 00:52:23,634
- You okay?
- Yeah, untie me! Jesus.

1165
00:52:24,676 --> 00:52:28,271
God. Jennifer and that
damn Stefano dude,

1166
00:52:28,313 --> 00:52:30,645
they were working together.
And then... and then Adriana's dad

1167
00:52:30,682 --> 00:52:32,775
paid him to come here
and get in my way...

1168
00:52:32,818 --> 00:52:34,945
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.
Dude, slow down, slow down, man.

1169
00:52:34,987 --> 00:52:37,615
- What's going on?
- What time is it?

1170
00:52:37,656 --> 00:52:40,648
It's 4:00 AM
Dude, we way missed our flights.

1171
00:52:40,692 --> 00:52:42,159
Hey hey hey, don't worry.

1172
00:52:42,194 --> 00:52:44,059
- Now you don't have to get married.
- No, fuck that.

1173
00:52:44,096 --> 00:52:45,620
I'm not missing
my fucking wedding, dude.

1174
00:52:45,664 --> 00:52:47,928
- We're driving it.
- Whoa! Whoa, dude.

1175
00:52:47,966 --> 00:52:49,934
The drive, that's like
six hours from now.

1176
00:52:49,968 --> 00:52:52,266
Well, there's no more flights out, man.
What are we gonna do?

1177
00:52:52,304 --> 00:52:54,329
I've been up all night,
it was a crazy party last night.

1178
00:52:54,373 --> 00:52:56,705
Can we just like chill out
and maybe reschedule?

1179
00:52:56,742 --> 00:52:58,232
- We could do it next weekend.
- No.

1180
00:52:58,277 --> 00:52:59,869
You drive, I'll sleep. Come on.

1181
00:53:01,046 --> 00:53:02,570
(Mac groans)

1182
00:53:04,716 --> 00:53:06,411
(dialing)

1183
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,585
(ringing)

1184
00:53:13,425 --> 00:53:15,484
Come on, motherfucker.

1185
00:53:15,527 --> 00:53:17,119
Answer the phone.

1186
00:53:19,298 --> 00:53:20,788
(ringing)

1187
00:53:20,833 --> 00:53:22,733
(rock music playing)

1188
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:27,129
(grunts)

1189
00:53:50,529 --> 00:53:52,360
Duffy:
All right, dude.

1190
00:53:52,397 --> 00:53:54,695
- I think I'm gonna take a nap.
- Oh.

1191
00:53:54,733 --> 00:53:56,860
That's cool, man.
That's why I'm driving, you know?

1192
00:53:56,902 --> 00:53:58,927
Gotta make sure you
look good for the bride.

1193
00:53:58,971 --> 00:54:00,996
I know, a little beauty sleep.

1194
00:54:02,074 --> 00:54:03,598
That's good, man.

1195
00:54:14,019 --> 00:54:15,816
(dialing)

1196
00:54:19,124 --> 00:54:20,785
(phone ringing)

1197
00:54:29,001 --> 00:54:30,969
Duffy's voice:
Hey, this is Duffy. Leave a message.

1198
00:54:32,404 --> 00:54:35,339
Hey, honey, it's me.
Just calling to see where you're at.

1199
00:54:35,374 --> 00:54:37,808
I wanted to let you know
the dinner went really well.

1200
00:54:37,843 --> 00:54:39,834
And I miss you and I love you.

1201
00:54:39,878 --> 00:54:41,937
I can't wait to see you. Bye, baby.

1202
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,538
(smooches)

1203
00:54:43,582 --> 00:54:45,140
Not answering?

1204
00:54:45,183 --> 00:54:46,775
He's probably still on the plane.

1205
00:54:46,818 --> 00:54:48,342
He should be her by now.

1206
00:54:48,387 --> 00:54:50,116
- (sighs)
- You worried?

1207
00:54:50,155 --> 00:54:52,214
- No.
- Really?

1208
00:54:52,257 --> 00:54:53,747
Michela, you bitch, shut up.

1209
00:54:53,792 --> 00:54:55,692
(chuckles)

1210
00:54:57,963 --> 00:55:00,454
- (hip-hop music playing)
- (people moaning)

1211
00:55:17,349 --> 00:55:19,408
(rock music playing)

1212
00:55:23,088 --> 00:55:25,886
I can't fly that slow!

1213
00:55:25,924 --> 00:55:29,257
# Come on, let go, so I have to show you
why I'm going, showing #

1214
00:55:29,294 --> 00:55:32,491
# Everybody's knowing
that it's so sad #

1215
00:55:32,531 --> 00:55:34,362
# It's so bad #

1216
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:37,562
# I used to be #

1217
00:55:37,603 --> 00:55:39,468
# The one who #

1218
00:55:39,504 --> 00:55:41,335
# Had to #

1219
00:55:41,373 --> 00:55:43,807
# Criticize me #

1220
00:55:43,842 --> 00:55:45,707
# And it holds you... #

1221
00:55:45,744 --> 00:55:48,042
- (hip-hop music playing)
- (both giggling)

1222
00:55:51,016 --> 00:55:52,950
- (moaning)
- Oh, God.

1223
00:55:52,985 --> 00:55:54,509
I'm bigger than a tree.

1224
00:55:54,553 --> 00:55:56,077
I'm bigger than Tommy Lee.

1225
00:55:56,121 --> 00:55:58,487
I'm hung like a motherfucking
baby donkey.

1226
00:55:58,523 --> 00:56:01,219
Shh. Jesse.

1227
00:56:01,259 --> 00:56:03,227
(laughs)

1228
00:56:04,596 --> 00:56:06,427
Jesse?

1229
00:56:07,866 --> 00:56:09,458
- Oh, shit!
- (moaning)

1230
00:56:09,501 --> 00:56:12,026
Shit! Oh, no! No!

1231
00:56:13,171 --> 00:56:15,503
No!
(grunts)

1232
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:17,735
(rock music playing)

1233
00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:23,673
Dude, where's...
where's my cell phone?

1234
00:56:23,715 --> 00:56:25,945
It's probably in the back, man.

1235
00:56:25,984 --> 00:56:28,885
Shit, dude.
Where's my cell phone?

1236
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,445
Dude, check in the back.

1237
00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:33,890
# I stared the Devil in the face
until I went blind... #

1238
00:56:35,227 --> 00:56:37,559
Bro, I didn't call Adriana!

1239
00:56:37,596 --> 00:56:39,086
- (huffs)
- I didn't call Adriana.

1240
00:56:39,131 --> 00:56:41,031
Hey, it's not a big deal.
You're going to go down there

1241
00:56:41,066 --> 00:56:43,261
and marry her. You have the rest
of your life to fight over it.

1242
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:47,668
Okay. I need your cell phone.

1243
00:56:47,706 --> 00:56:50,140
Dude, she can wait.
We're gonna be there in a couple hours.

1244
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:51,733
She probably
thinks I'm not coming.

1245
00:56:51,777 --> 00:56:53,540
Mac:
Of course, you're coming. It's ridiculous.

1246
00:56:53,578 --> 00:56:55,842
- Just give me your cell phone.
- I can't let you use my cell phone.

1247
00:56:55,881 --> 00:56:58,543
I'm over on weekend minutes. My mom's
gonna kill me if I use them up again.

1248
00:56:58,583 --> 00:57:00,448
Adriana's gonna kill me
and I'm gonna kill you.

1249
00:57:00,485 --> 00:57:03,352
- Just let me use your cell phone.
- Dang it, Duff.

1250
00:57:04,589 --> 00:57:07,023
Just try and make it quick.
No lovey-dovey smooshy crap.

1251
00:57:07,059 --> 00:57:09,254
Duffy:
Give me that phone, man.

1252
00:57:10,328 --> 00:57:12,922
# Here we go again... #

1253
00:57:17,202 --> 00:57:19,432
There's... there's no bars.

1254
00:57:20,739 --> 00:57:23,037
- There's no bars, dude!
- Shake it.

1255
00:57:23,075 --> 00:57:24,565
I'm not... shake... what?

1256
00:57:24,609 --> 00:57:26,406
Shake the phone,
sometimes the bars come in.

1257
00:57:26,445 --> 00:57:28,037
The antenna's a little weary.

1258
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,672
- (grunting)
- Now check.

1259
00:57:31,083 --> 00:57:33,916
No bars, dude.
Drive... drive this... here.

1260
00:57:33,952 --> 00:57:36,216
- Hold on.
- I'm just trying to...

1261
00:57:36,254 --> 00:57:38,051
just try to like...

1262
00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:39,921
- Drive!
- I'm driving!

1263
00:57:39,958 --> 00:57:42,256
Duffy:
Mac, your phone is dead.

1264
00:57:42,294 --> 00:57:42,427
(crickets chirping)

1265
00:57:42,427 --> 00:57:44,588
(crickets chirping)

1266
00:57:45,697 --> 00:57:47,494
(whirring)

1267
00:57:54,272 --> 00:57:56,365
(dialing)

1268
00:57:58,477 --> 00:58:00,570
(sighs)

1269
00:58:04,015 --> 00:58:06,916
Come on.
(sighs)

1270
00:58:09,087 --> 00:58:10,611
Michela:
No answer?

1271
00:58:10,655 --> 00:58:12,987
Shit, Micky.
What am I gonna do?

1272
00:58:13,024 --> 00:58:14,685
Sorry.

1273
00:58:14,726 --> 00:58:16,353
Maybe he's still on the plane.

1274
00:58:16,394 --> 00:58:17,884
(sighs)

1275
00:58:17,929 --> 00:58:21,330
He'll make it. His phone battery
probably just died.

1276
00:58:21,366 --> 00:58:23,163
Oh, God.
You don't understand, okay?

1277
00:58:23,201 --> 00:58:25,294
The phone is ringing,

1278
00:58:25,337 --> 00:58:26,827
he's just not answering.

1279
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:30,199
I'm sorry.
He'll make it.

1280
00:58:30,242 --> 00:58:32,335
Oh, shit, Micky.
What am I gonna do?

1281
00:58:32,377 --> 00:58:34,311
He'll make it.

1282
00:58:43,054 --> 00:58:45,420
(bells tolling)

1283
00:58:50,562 --> 00:58:52,189
Adriana:
Shit!

1284
00:58:53,665 --> 00:58:55,599
Shit.

1285
00:58:55,634 --> 00:58:57,192
(crying)
He's not answering.

1286
00:58:57,235 --> 00:58:58,964
I'm sorry.

1287
00:59:00,272 --> 00:59:01,899
What am I going to do?

1288
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:04,408
Marry Stefano.

1289
00:59:04,442 --> 00:59:06,410
- Are you kidding me?
- Just do it.

1290
00:59:06,444 --> 00:59:08,036
Papa wants you to.

1291
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:10,206
You love him.

1292
00:59:10,248 --> 00:59:12,876
Adriana, Stefano
will never marry me.

1293
00:59:14,519 --> 00:59:17,352
This is insane.

1294
00:59:17,389 --> 00:59:18,913
Do it! Everyone is coming.

1295
00:59:18,957 --> 00:59:20,549
Duffy... he didn't show up.

1296
00:59:20,592 --> 00:59:22,116
He blew you off.

1297
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:25,186
If you show up with Stefano,
people will embrace it.

1298
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:27,528
You know they will.
They want you to marry him.

1299
00:59:27,566 --> 00:59:30,865
What about his family
and friends coming to the wedding?

1300
00:59:30,902 --> 00:59:32,870
- His parents...
- How many of his friends are coming?

1301
00:59:32,904 --> 00:59:35,634
- How many?
- I don't know, like 10 maybe.

1302
00:59:35,674 --> 00:59:37,835
Oh, okay. And how many
are coming for you?

1303
00:59:38,877 --> 00:59:40,708
376.

1304
00:59:40,745 --> 00:59:43,270
- Do it.
- Oh, God.

1305
00:59:43,315 --> 00:59:45,044
Do it!

1306
00:59:47,018 --> 00:59:48,679
(screams)
No! You know what?

1307
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,745
- I'm just calling it off.
- Are you kidding?

1308
00:59:50,789 --> 00:59:52,552
- No.
- You can't call it off.

1309
00:59:52,591 --> 00:59:54,616
You cannot call it off.
Papa will kill you.

1310
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:57,890
(rock music playing)
# Something in your eyes #

1311
00:59:57,929 --> 00:59:59,829
# Tonight #

1312
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:04,530
# Something that says #

1313
01:00:04,569 --> 01:00:06,537
# You'll give it away #

1314
01:00:09,374 --> 01:00:12,343
# You don't need any reasons... #

1315
01:00:20,352 --> 01:00:21,979
Dude, it was right there, man.

1316
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:23,954
(laughing)
We did it.

1317
01:00:23,989 --> 01:00:25,547
- (laughs)
- We made it, bro.

1318
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:27,490
So stoked.

1319
01:00:27,525 --> 01:00:30,085
Dude, that beast is nice.

1320
01:00:30,128 --> 01:00:31,652
Duffy:
Who needs a red-eye flight?

1321
01:00:33,064 --> 01:00:34,827
Hey, do you have any mouthwash?

1322
01:00:34,866 --> 01:00:36,993
Uh, no. Why?
You're good, right?

1323
01:00:37,035 --> 01:00:39,196
My mouth tastes like
a used sporting goods store.

1324
01:00:39,237 --> 01:00:41,865
It's probably 'cause you had that Chinese
ball-gag in your mouth all night.

1325
01:00:41,907 --> 01:00:44,467
- That's a good point.
- You always were a slow dresser, man.

1326
01:00:44,509 --> 01:00:46,136
Don't hold us up.
This is your wedding.

1327
01:00:46,177 --> 01:00:49,772
You were always
a fast undresser, buddy.

1328
01:00:49,814 --> 01:00:52,078
Dude, you been working out?
Those pecs are looking really ripe.

1329
01:00:52,117 --> 01:00:54,244
Thanks, bro.

1330
01:00:54,286 --> 01:00:55,947
- (buckle jangling)
- Was I snoring?

1331
01:00:55,987 --> 01:00:57,511
I don't know.
I was asleep too.

1332
01:00:57,555 --> 01:01:00,115
- What?!
- I mean, uh, yeah. You were really loud.

1333
01:01:00,158 --> 01:01:03,559
- I turned the radio up.
- You didn't wear your contacts today?

1334
01:01:03,595 --> 01:01:05,893
I mean, I'm driving.
Why would I wear contacts?

1335
01:01:05,931 --> 01:01:07,558
- Exactly.
- Then I've gotta see better.

1336
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:09,760
Dude, those bridesmaids
better be gorgeous.

1337
01:01:09,801 --> 01:01:11,894
I heard Italian chicks
suck good dick.

1338
01:01:11,937 --> 01:01:13,666
Well, they're all rich.

1339
01:01:15,106 --> 01:01:17,006
They're good cooks

1340
01:01:17,042 --> 01:01:18,669
and they have fat asses.

1341
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:20,678
I should be the one getting
married anyway. Look at me.

1342
01:01:20,712 --> 01:01:22,509
I look better than you in that.
Come here.

1343
01:01:22,547 --> 01:01:25,072
Do ya? Yeah, straighten
that up a little bit.

1344
01:01:25,116 --> 01:01:27,209
- Okay.
- Eyebrows?

1345
01:01:27,252 --> 01:01:28,879
- Fix my eyebrows up.
- Yeah.

1346
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:31,582
Yeah. Yeah, that looks good.
Don't you think?

1347
01:01:31,623 --> 01:01:33,181
(choir vocalizing)

1348
01:01:33,224 --> 01:01:34,782
(Adriana sniffling)

1349
01:01:39,431 --> 01:01:41,262
(grunts)

1350
01:01:44,369 --> 01:01:46,394
(crying)

1351
01:01:48,974 --> 01:01:51,568
(rock music playing)
# I've been coming #

1352
01:01:51,609 --> 01:01:54,601
# I've been coming after you #

1353
01:01:56,648 --> 01:01:58,548
# You got me coming out #

1354
01:01:58,583 --> 01:02:01,313
# You got me coming
right after you #

1355
01:02:01,353 --> 01:02:03,685
# Uh-oh, uh-oh... #

1356
01:02:09,361 --> 01:02:11,226
Shit. Come on.

1357
01:02:12,897 --> 01:02:14,922
Adriana!

1358
01:02:18,403 --> 01:02:20,633
- God damn it.
- Father: Adriana!

1359
01:02:22,574 --> 01:02:24,098
- Adriana.
- Stop calling him.

1360
01:02:24,142 --> 01:02:26,667
I don't understand it.
It just keeps ringing.

1361
01:02:26,711 --> 01:02:28,201
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know.

1362
01:02:28,246 --> 01:02:30,680
- Tell him. Tell him.
- No! No!

1363
01:02:30,715 --> 01:02:33,582
Papa, everything's going to be okay.
Duffy's on his way.

1364
01:02:33,618 --> 01:02:36,212
There's just something
wrong with his phone.

1365
01:02:36,254 --> 01:02:39,849
- He dumped you.
- No, Michela. Okay?

1366
01:02:39,891 --> 01:02:43,452
No, Papa. He's on his way, okay?
He'll be here.

1367
01:02:43,495 --> 01:02:45,258
Marry Stefano, my love.

1368
01:02:45,296 --> 01:02:47,389
- Adriana: No, Papa!
- Just do it, Adriana.

1369
01:02:47,432 --> 01:02:48,956
You know you like him.

1370
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,730
- Go ahead and marry him.
- Adriana, listen to your sister.

1371
01:02:53,171 --> 01:02:54,695
He's here.
He wants to speak to you.

1372
01:02:54,739 --> 01:02:56,434
Papa, Jesus.

1373
01:02:56,474 --> 01:02:58,567
- Adriana.
- Hello, Stefano.

1374
01:02:58,610 --> 01:03:00,942
Look, I'm here for you.

1375
01:03:00,979 --> 01:03:03,504
Mm, thank you,
but I don't need you.

1376
01:03:03,548 --> 01:03:05,106
Duffy's coming, okay?

1377
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:07,345
Well, I'll wait until
the very last minute.

1378
01:03:07,385 --> 01:03:09,250
I'm dressed and ready
to be your husband,

1379
01:03:09,287 --> 01:03:11,448
so if you decide
you want to marry me today,

1380
01:03:11,489 --> 01:03:14,083
I'd be honored to do so.

1381
01:03:14,125 --> 01:03:16,252
(gasps)

1382
01:03:16,294 --> 01:03:18,194
Thanks, um,

1383
01:03:18,229 --> 01:03:21,323
I really appreciate it,
but that's just not necessary

1384
01:03:21,366 --> 01:03:22,890
because Duffy's on his way.

1385
01:03:23,935 --> 01:03:25,562
- Well, I'm here for you.
- Mm.

1386
01:03:27,906 --> 01:03:30,739
Adriana, you should
consider Stefano's offer.

1387
01:03:30,775 --> 01:03:33,107
He's a good man.
He'll be a good husband.

1388
01:03:33,144 --> 01:03:35,442
Duffy, he doesn't show up
at the wedding.

1389
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:37,175
He's not here
and we're ready, so...

1390
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:39,012
No, Papa.

1391
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:40,677
He's coming.

1392
01:03:40,718 --> 01:03:42,413
- I hope so.
- Yeah.

1393
01:03:42,454 --> 01:03:44,718
I hope so,
but Stefano is here

1394
01:03:44,756 --> 01:03:47,122
and we're ready.
It's time. It's time.

1395
01:03:47,158 --> 01:03:49,092
L... I think he'll be good
for the family,

1396
01:03:49,127 --> 01:03:51,425
good for the company,
he'll be a good husband for you

1397
01:03:51,463 --> 01:03:53,294
and I approve of him.

1398
01:03:54,365 --> 01:03:56,390
- I approve of him.
- Yeah.

1399
01:03:56,434 --> 01:03:57,992
I know.

1400
01:03:58,036 --> 01:03:59,901
I know, Papa.

1401
01:03:59,938 --> 01:04:01,667
(sighs)

1402
01:04:22,127 --> 01:04:23,822
(grunting)

1403
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:28,191
- I hate you, Duffy!
- (laughing)

1404
01:04:29,234 --> 01:04:31,600
- (chattering)
- Shut up!

1405
01:04:36,541 --> 01:04:38,907
I can't believe it.
I'm so nervous. I'm not nervous.

1406
01:04:38,943 --> 01:04:42,344
Shh. You look great, man.
Dude, you are getting married.

1407
01:04:43,381 --> 01:04:46,111
I'm so proud of you, man.
I know I gave you a hard time for this,

1408
01:04:46,151 --> 01:04:48,085
but you're doing
the right thing, man.

1409
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:50,451
- Think she'll forgive me?
- Does she love you?

1410
01:04:50,488 --> 01:04:52,115
- She loves me.
- Than she'll forgive you.

1411
01:04:52,157 --> 01:04:53,681
Go make a wife out of her, man.

1412
01:04:53,725 --> 01:04:55,625
(laughs)

1413
01:05:23,454 --> 01:05:24,978
(silent)

1414
01:07:09,193 --> 01:07:11,218
(murmuring)

1415
01:07:12,697 --> 01:07:14,562
Great job there, son.
We want to thank you

1416
01:07:14,599 --> 01:07:16,260
for inviting us to your wedding.

1417
01:07:16,301 --> 01:07:18,098
You are welcome.
How was it?

1418
01:07:18,136 --> 01:07:20,661
Duffy, you really screwed
the pooch on this one, honey.

1419
01:07:21,739 --> 01:07:23,229
Okay, Mom, it was not my fault.

1420
01:07:23,274 --> 01:07:25,970
- Well...
- Son... son, listen.

1421
01:07:26,010 --> 01:07:27,875
We're gonna go
down to the city

1422
01:07:27,912 --> 01:07:30,107
and we're gonna find ourselves
a nice show to go to

1423
01:07:30,148 --> 01:07:31,775
and then we're going
to find a nice little bar

1424
01:07:31,816 --> 01:07:33,681
- where we can get stinking drunk.
- That's for sure.

1425
01:07:33,718 --> 01:07:36,846
And then we're going to go back
to our nice little hotel room and pass out.

1426
01:07:36,888 --> 01:07:38,617
Tomorrow morning,
we may be a little hung-over,

1427
01:07:38,656 --> 01:07:40,180
but we're going to go
to a nice breakfast

1428
01:07:40,224 --> 01:07:41,919
and then we're going
to maybe go shopping.

1429
01:07:41,959 --> 01:07:44,860
- Maybe.
- And then we are going to leave.

1430
01:07:44,896 --> 01:07:46,693
So, if you'd like to come
out to the house some time

1431
01:07:46,731 --> 01:07:48,596
and tell us what this was all about,

1432
01:07:48,633 --> 01:07:50,464
that'd be great
because right now,

1433
01:07:50,501 --> 01:07:52,492
we are just flat batshit confused.

1434
01:07:52,537 --> 01:07:54,664
Oh, you just really
screwed things up here, honey.

1435
01:07:54,706 --> 01:07:57,766
You really screwed the pooch
and I am really pissed at you.

1436
01:07:57,809 --> 01:08:00,369
- I am really pissed at you, Duffy...
- He knows, honey.

1437
01:08:00,411 --> 01:08:02,106
(mother stammering)

1438
01:08:02,146 --> 01:08:04,046
I'll... I'll email you.

1439
01:08:06,884 --> 01:08:08,613
Michela, what happened?

1440
01:08:08,653 --> 01:08:10,678
Duffy, you screwed up my life.

1441
01:08:12,123 --> 01:08:13,920
Hi, Duffy.

1442
01:08:13,958 --> 01:08:15,789
Hi, Beverly.

1443
01:08:21,199 --> 01:08:21,299
(rock music playing)

1444
01:08:21,299 --> 01:08:23,426
(rock music playing)

1445
01:08:30,341 --> 01:08:32,241
Kelly:
I love you so much, Duffy.

1446
01:08:32,276 --> 01:08:34,301
Thanks so much for this vacation.

1447
01:08:34,345 --> 01:08:36,006
It's amazing.

1448
01:08:36,047 --> 01:08:38,948
You are so welcome.
Thanks for coming.

1449
01:08:40,418 --> 01:08:42,249
Hey, um...

1450
01:08:43,421 --> 01:08:45,321
I'm sorry about your wedding.

1451
01:08:46,991 --> 01:08:49,357
But it all turned out
for the best, right?

1452
01:08:49,394 --> 01:08:51,021
(sighs)

1453
01:08:51,062 --> 01:08:52,586
Definitely did.

1454
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:56,259
Let's just, uh...
let's relax, okay?

1455
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:58,029
I mean...

1456
01:08:59,103 --> 01:09:01,401
I'm better than that stupid
foreign rich bitch, anyway.

1457
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:04,705
So much better.

1458
01:09:09,881 --> 01:09:11,815
We've always had fun,
haven't we, Duffy?

1459
01:09:11,849 --> 01:09:14,340
More fun than I can handle.

1460
01:09:15,486 --> 01:09:17,078
And our sex is amazing.

1461
01:09:17,121 --> 01:09:18,884
Actually, yeah, it's...

1462
01:09:18,923 --> 01:09:21,050
it's the best I've ever had.

1463
01:09:21,092 --> 01:09:23,458
- (laughs)
- You like that? It's so...

1464
01:09:24,529 --> 01:09:26,326
Are you hungry?

1465
01:09:26,364 --> 01:09:28,855
Um... yeah.

1466
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:30,390
- Okay.
- Let's go eat.

1467
01:09:30,435 --> 01:09:32,027
Good.

1468
01:09:32,069 --> 01:09:33,900
(rock music playing)

1469
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:45,274
# I've got a Cisco feeling #

1470
01:09:45,316 --> 01:09:48,046
# I've got a summer feeling... #

1471
01:09:48,085 --> 01:09:50,679
Hey Duffy, didn't you say you used
to come here with Adriana all the time?

1472
01:09:51,722 --> 01:09:53,212
Yeah, it was our favorite place.

1473
01:09:53,257 --> 01:09:54,849
- How was that?
- Man: It was good, it was good.

1474
01:09:54,892 --> 01:09:56,382
- You want some?
- Mm-mm.

1475
01:09:56,427 --> 01:09:58,395
- No? Baby.
- Adriana: Mm-mm.

1476
01:09:58,429 --> 01:10:00,158
Hey.

1477
01:10:01,432 --> 01:10:03,093
(gasps)
Duff.

1478
01:10:05,369 --> 01:10:08,861
- What happened?
- Hey, it's Princess Charming.

1479
01:10:10,007 --> 01:10:12,237
Duffy, come on, let's go.
Let's not make a scene, okay?

1480
01:10:12,276 --> 01:10:14,073
Hey, princess,

1481
01:10:14,111 --> 01:10:16,204
can you go tickle your toes
down to the beach?

1482
01:10:16,247 --> 01:10:18,715
Shut your face, Stefano.

1483
01:10:18,749 --> 01:10:20,740
No one... no one wants you here
in the first place, okay?

1484
01:10:20,785 --> 01:10:22,548
- Adriana: Okay...
- No, listen. This guy,

1485
01:10:22,587 --> 01:10:24,680
he locked me up in the frat house.
I couldn't make the plane

1486
01:10:24,722 --> 01:10:26,917
- to get to the wedding.
- You know what? I don't want to hear it.

1487
01:10:26,958 --> 01:10:29,051
Okay? It's too late.

1488
01:10:29,093 --> 01:10:31,960
- He locked me up.
- Oh, yeah?

1489
01:10:31,996 --> 01:10:34,362
He locked you up?
You know what? He told me everything.

1490
01:10:34,398 --> 01:10:37,390
Okay? He locked you
in a sex dungeon...

1491
01:10:38,436 --> 01:10:41,064
the sex dungeon
that you were already in.

1492
01:10:41,105 --> 01:10:43,505
No, it wasn't...
it wasn't a sex dungeon.

1493
01:10:43,541 --> 01:10:46,442
- Okay, explain. Do. Please.
- It was a frat house...

1494
01:10:47,512 --> 01:10:51,573
- sex dungeon, but it...
- And who was there, hmm?

1495
01:10:51,616 --> 01:10:54,847
A lot of people like this guy.

1496
01:10:54,886 --> 01:10:57,548
And who else, hmm?
Who else was there, huh?

1497
01:10:57,588 --> 01:10:59,522
Like maybe who
you're with right now?

1498
01:11:00,892 --> 01:11:04,123
Huh? You're so predictable, Duffy.

1499
01:11:04,161 --> 01:11:06,129
Give me a break.

1500
01:11:06,163 --> 01:11:08,893
Oh, excuse me for a second.
Hey, Kell. What's up?

1501
01:11:08,933 --> 01:11:11,060
Hey, Adriana.
Always a pleasure.

1502
01:11:11,102 --> 01:11:12,729
- Yeah.
- Yeah, princess, I think it's time

1503
01:11:12,770 --> 01:11:14,260
for you two to go home.

1504
01:11:14,305 --> 01:11:15,795
Why do you keep
calling me "princess"?

1505
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:18,240
Stefano: Why? 'Cause you came out
of the womb as a woman, that's why.

1506
01:11:18,276 --> 01:11:20,676
- That's 'cause you have a crush on me.
- Stefano: Why don't you guys

1507
01:11:20,711 --> 01:11:23,373
- go to the beach and braid your hair?
- Why don't you go wax your chest again?

1508
01:11:23,414 --> 01:11:25,382
You're lucky I'm...
you're a short little tiny man.

1509
01:11:25,416 --> 01:11:28,180
'Cause if you weren't, I would come over
there and punch you in your nipple.

1510
01:11:28,219 --> 01:11:29,880
- Father: Boys! Boys!
- (all chattering)

1511
01:11:29,921 --> 01:11:32,389
Adriana:
Just stop it now. Enough.

1512
01:11:32,423 --> 01:11:34,482
This guy?

1513
01:11:34,525 --> 01:11:36,220
Adriana, I love you.

1514
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:39,525
Duff, come on. Stop.
It's too late. All right?

1515
01:11:41,899 --> 01:11:43,833
Duffy, you're an asshole.

1516
01:11:43,868 --> 01:11:46,200
(chuckling)

1517
01:11:46,237 --> 01:11:48,137
It's always been you, Adriana.

1518
01:11:48,172 --> 01:11:49,867
I love you.

1519
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:58,908
- I love you.
- You know what, Duffy?

1520
01:11:58,950 --> 01:12:02,078
Screw you.

1521
01:12:02,119 --> 01:12:04,383
You're a dick.

1522
01:12:04,422 --> 01:12:06,322
What are you looking at?

1523
01:12:08,793 --> 01:12:12,251
Just go run after Kelly, okay?

1524
01:12:13,364 --> 01:12:16,162
Just go, all right?
You know what?

1525
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:18,464
I'm... not in love
with you anymore.

1526
01:12:20,371 --> 01:12:22,202
Wow.

1527
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:24,207
(soft rock music playing)

1528
01:12:27,979 --> 01:12:29,708
Fuck!

1529
01:12:32,016 --> 01:12:33,506
Hey.

1530
01:12:45,229 --> 01:12:48,323
# As the moments passed us by #

1531
01:12:49,333 --> 01:12:52,734
# Somewhere along the way #

1532
01:12:52,770 --> 01:12:54,328
# We lost sight #

1533
01:12:54,372 --> 01:12:57,603
# Of the important things in life #

1534
01:12:59,076 --> 01:13:01,704
# Like time #

1535
01:13:01,746 --> 01:13:05,182
# And "I love yous" #

1536
01:13:05,216 --> 01:13:06,911
# Seem to settle #

1537
01:13:06,951 --> 01:13:09,852
# Around goodbyes #

1538
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:12,583
# So what were you
supposed to be #

1539
01:13:14,291 --> 01:13:16,623
# When you grew up? #

1540
01:13:16,661 --> 01:13:19,755
# As your life in scenes,
it flashes #

1541
01:13:19,797 --> 01:13:22,698
# Right before your eyes #

1542
01:13:22,733 --> 01:13:27,067
# 'Cause there are #

1543
01:13:27,104 --> 01:13:30,596
# No heroes #

1544
01:13:32,410 --> 01:13:35,607
# And this is your life #

1545
01:13:35,646 --> 01:13:37,671
# This is what's wrong #

1546
01:13:38,716 --> 01:13:41,810
# You're the big fish #

1547
01:13:41,852 --> 01:13:44,685
# In the small pond #

1548
01:13:44,722 --> 01:13:47,885
# And this is your world #

1549
01:13:47,925 --> 01:13:51,190
# It's where you belong #

1550
01:13:51,228 --> 01:13:54,026
# Inside, you are hollow #

1551
01:13:54,065 --> 01:13:57,228
# The damage is done #

1552
01:13:57,268 --> 01:14:01,204
# And this is your world #

1553
01:14:05,109 --> 01:14:08,601
# Before we fade away #

1554
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:13,016
# Before we fade away... #

1555
01:14:16,854 --> 01:14:19,186
- (chatting)
- Father: That's a good thing.

1556
01:14:19,223 --> 01:14:21,020
- Stefano: It is.
- Stefano?

1557
01:14:21,058 --> 01:14:23,026
- Yeah?
- Let me go talk to Duffy.

1558
01:14:25,296 --> 01:14:26,991
What?

1559
01:14:27,031 --> 01:14:28,521
I'll be fine, okay?

1560
01:14:28,566 --> 01:14:30,898
I just want to,
I don't know, talk to him

1561
01:14:30,935 --> 01:14:32,926
and help him get
back together with Kelly

1562
01:14:32,970 --> 01:14:34,562
and just tell him
it's over for good.

1563
01:14:34,605 --> 01:14:36,095
- I mean, look at him.
- Okay.

1564
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:39,268
He's just sitting there all by himself.
I feel so bad, you know?

1565
01:14:41,645 --> 01:14:44,580
Why don't you go over there and tell
that little princess that it's over, okay?

1566
01:14:44,615 --> 01:14:46,105
- Okay.
- Okay.

1567
01:14:46,150 --> 01:14:47,913
Hey, Adriana,

1568
01:14:47,952 --> 01:14:51,217
do you know how long
it's gonna be?

1569
01:14:51,255 --> 01:14:54,418
I'm just gonna go talk to him
and get him back with Kell,

1570
01:14:54,458 --> 01:14:56,551
so give me
a couple hours at least.

1571
01:14:56,594 --> 01:14:58,425
Father:
Adriana, you make him understand

1572
01:14:58,462 --> 01:15:00,657
it's over for good.
You set him straight.

1573
01:15:00,698 --> 01:15:02,757
- Okay.
- Father: Okay. Ciao.

1574
01:15:03,801 --> 01:15:06,133
(soft rock music playing)

1575
01:15:06,170 --> 01:15:08,570
# The damage is done #

1576
01:15:08,606 --> 01:15:12,770
# And this is your world #

1577
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:20,576
# Before we fade away... #

1578
01:15:20,618 --> 01:15:23,086
- Hey.
- # Before we fade away... #

1579
01:15:24,955 --> 01:15:26,980
Would you please
just tell me what happened?

1580
01:15:28,692 --> 01:15:30,853
You screwed me over real bad,
that's what happened.

1581
01:15:30,895 --> 01:15:32,419
I didn't want to.

1582
01:15:32,463 --> 01:15:35,955
- (gasps)
- Okay? I wanted... I want to marry you.

1583
01:15:37,001 --> 01:15:38,798
But there were all these
problems at the party.

1584
01:15:38,836 --> 01:15:41,600
There was like rooms
and handcuffs and...

1585
01:15:41,639 --> 01:15:43,231
and there was the plane
and the car...

1586
01:15:43,274 --> 01:15:44,764
- Jesse Jane...
- What?!

1587
01:15:44,809 --> 01:15:46,674
I don't want to hear
about this, okay?

1588
01:15:46,710 --> 01:15:48,302
No. It doesn't matter anymore.

1589
01:15:48,345 --> 01:15:50,472
It's over.

1590
01:15:50,514 --> 01:15:53,244
Over?

1591
01:15:53,284 --> 01:15:55,309
But I love you.
Does that not mean anything to you?

1592
01:15:55,352 --> 01:15:58,844
(groans)
You need to go find Kelly.

1593
01:15:59,890 --> 01:16:01,858
Where did she go, anyway?

1594
01:16:01,892 --> 01:16:03,985
I don't care, all right?

1595
01:16:06,163 --> 01:16:08,529
Don't you think it's fate
that we're both here

1596
01:16:08,566 --> 01:16:10,056
at the same time?

1597
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:13,501
Come on! I'm here
because my family comes here.

1598
01:16:13,537 --> 01:16:16,370
Remember? That's why
we used to come here... my family.

1599
01:16:16,407 --> 01:16:18,534
Remember? You were
going to be a part of my family?

1600
01:16:18,576 --> 01:16:20,100
Are you kidding me?

1601
01:16:20,144 --> 01:16:22,510
- (gasps)
- Okay, what are we gonna do?

1602
01:16:24,615 --> 01:16:26,549
Go our separate ways.

1603
01:16:26,584 --> 01:16:28,518
That's retarded.

1604
01:16:29,753 --> 01:16:31,778
Come on, seriously?

1605
01:16:33,557 --> 01:16:35,047
- Fine.
- (folk music playing)

1606
01:16:35,092 --> 01:16:36,582
- What?
- Fine. Fine.

1607
01:16:36,627 --> 01:16:38,561
You know what?
Just go back with your...

1608
01:16:38,596 --> 01:16:42,464
- your... your stupid husband.
- Duffy, wait, okay?

1609
01:16:42,499 --> 01:16:44,990
No, I'm not waiting anymore.

1610
01:16:45,035 --> 01:16:48,300
You go back to your family
and your... your life...

1611
01:16:49,406 --> 01:16:51,431
- your... your family.
- No no no.

1612
01:16:51,475 --> 01:16:53,943
Duffy, wait!

1613
01:16:56,213 --> 01:16:58,579
Damn it, Duffy!

1614
01:16:58,616 --> 01:17:02,177
# I know I've been
missing you #

1615
01:17:05,256 --> 01:17:08,623
# But I know
I will see you through #

1616
01:17:12,329 --> 01:17:16,459
# And all these things
that I can't say #

1617
01:17:19,303 --> 01:17:22,670
# I know they'll be
brought up one day #

1618
01:17:26,744 --> 01:17:30,441
# And now the pavement's
cold and wet #

1619
01:17:32,383 --> 01:17:33,907
# And I #

1620
01:17:33,951 --> 01:17:35,680
# I see these changes #

1621
01:17:35,719 --> 01:17:39,621
# But then I soon forget #

1622
01:17:39,657 --> 01:17:41,488
# Boy #

1623
01:17:41,525 --> 01:17:44,153
# I'm missing you. #

1624
01:17:45,195 --> 01:17:46,787
Stefano:
I like when you ride that wild wave.

1625
01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:48,457
- Michela: Yeah!
- Stefano: Who's the thunder

1626
01:17:48,499 --> 01:17:49,989
from down under?
Who is it? That's me.

1627
01:17:50,034 --> 01:17:52,002
- Michela: Take it! Take it!
- Stefano: Yeah! Yeah! Yes!

1628
01:17:52,036 --> 01:17:53,970
- Sweat on me!
- Take it!

1629
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:04,773
- Stefano: I'm taking it.
- Yeah, you like that?

1630
01:18:04,815 --> 01:18:06,510
- Who's the dirty sister, huh?
- You like that?

1631
01:18:06,550 --> 01:18:08,484
- Who's that dirty sister?
- Take it!

1632
01:18:08,519 --> 01:18:11,886
(Stefano and Michela yelling)

1633
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,653
- Take it! Take that.
- You dirty sister!

1634
01:18:18,696 --> 01:18:20,220
- Who's the dirty sister?
- I'm the dirty...

1635
01:18:20,264 --> 01:18:22,425
- Oh my fucking God!
- Oh my God.

1636
01:18:22,466 --> 01:18:24,934
- Adriana, you said two hours!
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

1637
01:18:24,969 --> 01:18:27,767
- It's been 10 fucking minutes.
- Oh my fucking...

1638
01:18:27,805 --> 01:18:29,500
- No no no no no...
- Are you fucking kidding me?!

1639
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:31,474
- Dirty fucking whore!
- Chill chill chill chill!

1640
01:18:31,508 --> 01:18:33,567
- Are you fucking kidding me?!
- Chill. Chill, it's okay!

1641
01:18:33,610 --> 01:18:36,408
Stefano! What the fuck
is wrong with you?!

1642
01:18:36,447 --> 01:18:38,711
- What... oh, my God...
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa!

1643
01:18:38,749 --> 01:18:40,774
- Whoa. Chill. Chill. Chill...
- Are you kidding me?!

1644
01:18:40,818 --> 01:18:43,651
Don't you fucking touch me!
Are you kidding me?

1645
01:18:43,687 --> 01:18:46,212
You stupid... are you
fucking kidding me, Michela?

1646
01:18:46,256 --> 01:18:48,019
- Really? Really?
- Adriana, I'm sorry.

1647
01:18:48,058 --> 01:18:50,151
How could you do this to me?!
(shrieks)

1648
01:18:51,862 --> 01:18:53,454
Do it!
(screams)

1649
01:18:53,497 --> 01:18:55,590
- Stefano: Whoa whoa whoa whoa!
- What am I gonna do now?

1650
01:18:55,632 --> 01:18:57,463
Oh my God!
What am I gonna do?

1651
01:18:57,501 --> 01:19:00,732
Oh, God. What am I gonna do now?

1652
01:19:00,771 --> 01:19:02,568
Michela:
Adriana.

1653
01:19:02,606 --> 01:19:04,301
- What the fuck?
- Hey.

1654
01:19:04,341 --> 01:19:05,831
What the... don't you
fucking talk to me!

1655
01:19:05,876 --> 01:19:08,470
Get the fuck away from me,
you fucking asshole!

1656
01:19:08,512 --> 01:19:10,673
Okay.

1657
01:19:10,714 --> 01:19:13,547
You fucking fucking bitch.

1658
01:19:13,584 --> 01:19:15,142
- I'm sorry?
- Adriana...

1659
01:19:15,185 --> 01:19:17,050
Don't! I don't want
to hear another word.

1660
01:19:17,087 --> 01:19:20,420
- I didn't... l... I love you!

# All those precious years #

1664

# I lacked the courage #

1665
01:19:53,023 --> 01:19:56,186

I know.

No shit.

- Of course I do.
- Yeah?
