1
00:00:35,951 --> 00:00:39,053
<i>When I was a child in India,</i>

2
00:00:39,121 --> 00:00:42,957
<i>growing up in the tiny village
of Harenmahkeester,</i>

3
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,194
<i>I found a voice-over machine,</i>

4
00:00:48,664 --> 00:00:51,365
<i>which I still use
to this day.</i>

5
00:00:51,433 --> 00:00:52,634
Oh, hi.

6
00:00:54,403 --> 00:00:57,455
I decided to use
the Morgan Freeman setting.

7
00:00:57,522 --> 00:01:00,474
I am His Holiness
the Guru Pitka.

8
00:01:00,542 --> 00:01:04,479
<i>In my book, If You're Happy
and You Know it, Think Again,</i>

9
00:01:04,547 --> 00:01:08,733
I speak of intimacy,
or "into-me-I-see."

10
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:13,104
Intimacy is like putting your wiener
on the table and having someone say,

11
00:01:13,171 --> 00:01:15,707
"That looks like a penis,
only smaller."

12
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:19,443
Only smaller.

13
00:01:22,648 --> 00:01:26,550
Though I was raised here in India,
I was born in America,

14
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:28,653
which is where
our journey begins.

15
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:33,257
It's the story of a hockey
player named Darren Roanoke,

16
00:01:33,325 --> 00:01:35,827
my most resistant student,

17
00:01:35,894 --> 00:01:38,329
who became
my greatest teacher.

18
00:01:39,564 --> 00:01:42,834
Or some such bullshit.
I don't know. Gotta go!

19
00:01:49,525 --> 00:01:50,891
Hi, I'm
Trent Lueders!

20
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,093
And I'm Jay Kell.

21
00:01:52,161 --> 00:01:54,495
Tonight is all
about champions.

22
00:01:54,563 --> 00:01:58,799
But before we get going, I'd like to start
by thanking my own personal champions.

23
00:01:58,867 --> 00:02:01,119
The fans who supported me
with their cards and letters

24
00:02:01,186 --> 00:02:05,689
during my recent addiction to
peyote buttons and Frangelico.

25
00:02:05,757 --> 00:02:10,361
I've already apologized to my
friends, my family, and my god.

26
00:02:10,428 --> 00:02:13,380
And now, I'd like to apologize
to Dame Judi Dench

27
00:02:13,448 --> 00:02:15,883
for my vicious
and brutal attack.

28
00:02:15,951 --> 00:02:17,885
I'm sorry, Judi,
you did not deserve that,

29
00:02:17,953 --> 00:02:20,554
and I hope the staples
come out soon.

30
00:02:20,623 --> 00:02:22,272
Over to you, Trent.

31
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,675
Thanks, Jay!

32
00:02:24,743 --> 00:02:27,879
Tonight, the Toronto Maple
Leafs' Darren Roanoke

33
00:02:27,946 --> 00:02:30,664
<i>is the subject of
our player profile.</i>

34
00:02:30,732 --> 00:02:32,816
Hockey has its legends.

35
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:35,936
Now, the new one,
Darren Roanoke.

36
00:02:38,757 --> 00:02:40,541
Known as the
Tiger Woods of hockey,

37
00:02:40,609 --> 00:02:43,110
Roanoke brought the sport
to a whole new audience.

38
00:02:43,178 --> 00:02:45,346
- Hey, yo, check this, son!
- Check this!

39
00:02:47,515 --> 00:02:50,634
<i>A role model
turned bad boy.</i>

40
00:02:50,702 --> 00:02:52,604
<i>He was in a perfect marriage.</i>

41
00:02:52,671 --> 00:02:54,471
<i>But before the playoffs,</i>

42
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:58,008
<i>he stunned the world by separating
from his wife, Prudence.</i>

43
00:02:58,076 --> 00:03:01,145
From role model
to dating models.

44
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:05,450
Roanoke found out
his wife, Prudence,

45
00:03:05,517 --> 00:03:07,385
<i>was dating the
L.A. Kings' legendary</i>

46
00:03:07,452 --> 00:03:10,788
<i>French-Canadian goalie,
Jacques "Le Coq" Grande.</i>

47
00:03:13,025 --> 00:03:14,659
He earned his
nickname, "Le Coq,"

48
00:03:14,726 --> 00:03:18,162
for reasons that cannot
be stated on this program.

49
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,631
This interview is over.

50
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:25,436
Holy...

51
00:03:26,604 --> 00:03:28,906
<i>That's when
Roanoke fell apart.</i>

52
00:03:28,974 --> 00:03:33,111
<i>Roanoke is hit hard.
Open net! He misses!</i>

53
00:03:33,178 --> 00:03:34,878
Damn, damn, damn!

54
00:03:36,048 --> 00:03:38,115
But the question
on everyone's mind is,

55
00:03:38,183 --> 00:03:40,934
can the Leafs win
without Roanoke?

56
00:03:42,187 --> 00:03:44,488
Well, can we win the Cup
without Roanoke?

57
00:03:44,556 --> 00:03:46,123
Not a chance, boss.

58
00:03:46,191 --> 00:03:49,610
As long as Jacques "Le Coq"
Grande is banging Darren's wife,

59
00:03:49,678 --> 00:03:51,195
Darren's toast.

60
00:03:51,262 --> 00:03:55,532
My father once told me the Yankees hired
a guru to turn their team around.

61
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:56,733
I have our guru.

62
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:59,721
If he can fix Darren,
we win the Cup.

63
00:03:59,788 --> 00:04:02,590
They call him
the Love Guru.

00:10:44,108 --> 00:10:45,676
Speak of your parents.

158
00:10:45,761 --> 00:10:49,113
They are both dead.
They were missionaries.

159
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,631
And what did they
do before then?

160
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:54,001
They were dog stylists.

161
00:10:54,068 --> 00:10:56,420
So, let me get
this straight.

162
00:10:56,487 --> 00:11:00,641
They were into doggy style
before the missionary position?

163
00:11:04,512 --> 00:11:07,498
That's hilarious. My parents are dead.
Thanks.

164
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:09,800
Deepak,

165
00:11:09,868 --> 00:11:13,637
why do you want to join
the Tugginmypudha Ashram?

166
00:11:13,705 --> 00:11:15,522
To seek my true self.

167
00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:17,590
All right, kiss ass.

168
00:11:18,777 --> 00:11:22,128
Maurice, why do you
want to join?

169
00:11:22,196 --> 00:11:25,315
I want to become a guru
so girls will like me.

170
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:27,385
Then I will like myself.

171
00:11:28,736 --> 00:11:32,556
Deepak, you will enjoy
love in all forms.

172
00:11:32,624 --> 00:11:35,642
Maurice, you must wear
this chastity belt.

173
00:11:39,013 --> 00:11:41,782
Chastity belt?
That sucks!

174
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,317
Once you have learned

175
00:11:43,384 --> 00:11:47,654
that self-love is more important
than being loved by others,

176
00:11:47,722 --> 00:11:49,239
you may remove the belt.

177
00:11:49,307 --> 00:11:52,643
Master, if I am not allowed
to be with a woman,

178
00:11:53,211 --> 00:11:54,512
may I still...

179
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:58,749
You will go cross-eyed!

180
00:12:00,552 --> 00:12:01,935
Guaranteed.

181
00:12:14,565 --> 00:12:16,483
Mariska Hargitay. Yeah.

182
00:12:16,551 --> 00:12:18,769
Mariska Hargitay.

183
00:12:18,837 --> 00:12:21,605
I am His Holiness,
the Guru Pitka.

184
00:12:21,673 --> 00:12:23,340
Welcome to my ashram,

185
00:12:23,407 --> 00:12:26,443
the Ecumenical Intuitive Enlightenment
Initiative Organization,

186
00:12:26,511 --> 00:12:29,847
or EIEIO.

187
00:12:29,914 --> 00:12:31,348
Guru Pitka had a farm.

188
00:12:31,415 --> 00:12:32,950
EIEIO.

189
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:35,185
And on that farm,
he did no harm.

190
00:12:35,253 --> 00:12:36,953
EIEIO.

191
00:12:38,907 --> 00:12:40,240
Okay.

192
00:12:40,308 --> 00:12:43,294
If I sit like this any longer,
I'm gonna pop my dink bag.

193
00:12:43,361 --> 00:12:44,511
Shh.

194
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:47,381
Listen up.
I am a guru.

195
00:12:47,448 --> 00:12:49,717
Let's look at the word "guru,"
okay?

196
00:12:49,784 --> 00:12:54,538
My goal is to get you to say,
"Gee, you are you."

197
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,508
TM.

198
00:12:57,576 --> 00:13:01,846
And the you of "guru"
is intimacy.

199
00:13:01,913 --> 00:13:04,181
Or "into-me-I-see."

200
00:13:04,248 --> 00:13:05,499
I see.

201
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:08,052
Without intimacy,
you feel nowhere.

202
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,589
Tonight I want you
to go from nowhere

203
00:13:12,657 --> 00:13:14,925
to "now here."

204
00:13:16,594 --> 00:13:18,345
Yeah.

205
00:13:18,413 --> 00:13:20,297
<i>It's like in The Electric
Company, you know?</i>

206
00:13:20,364 --> 00:13:21,699
Now...

207
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,567
Here.

208
00:13:24,302 --> 00:13:26,703
Nowhere.

209
00:13:26,738 --> 00:13:30,374
My laws of intimacy are
kind of like my Bible.

210
00:13:30,441 --> 00:13:33,377
And let's look at the word
"Bible," shall we?

211
00:13:33,444 --> 00:13:37,481
The Bible is "basic instructions
before leaving earth."

212
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:38,815
TM.

213
00:13:40,368 --> 00:13:42,802
Put that shit on a T-shirt.

214
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,488
Show the T-shirt.

215
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:52,145
Now, I myself have a guru,
Guru Tugginmypudha.

216
00:13:52,213 --> 00:13:57,334
And my guru, Guru Tugginmypudha
had a guru, Guru Cheddafrumunda.

217
00:13:57,402 --> 00:14:02,622
And Guru Cheddafrumunda had
a guru, Guru Hathasmalvena.

218
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:06,526
Guru Hathasmalvena had
two main periods of his Gita,

219
00:14:06,594 --> 00:14:08,061
or words of wisdom.

220
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:11,731
The first period came
before he got syphilis.

221
00:14:13,835 --> 00:14:17,270
Some pre-syphilitic
words of wisdom include,

222
00:14:17,338 --> 00:14:19,673
"To know something is good.

223
00:14:21,075 --> 00:14:25,028
"To do something is God."

224
00:14:28,032 --> 00:14:31,802
Then, after he got syphilis,
he would say things like,

225
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,354
"Eatin' ain't cheatin'."

226
00:14:34,422 --> 00:14:36,656
"Did it smell that bad
when you ate it?"

227
00:14:37,909 --> 00:14:41,444
"Liquor up front,
poker in back."

228
00:14:41,512 --> 00:14:46,182
But his point was this, "If you can't
love yourself, you can't love another."

229
00:14:47,351 --> 00:14:50,453
And that's the end
of that one. Yeah.

230
00:14:50,939 --> 00:14:52,639
Mariska Hargitay.

231
00:14:53,374 --> 00:14:55,292
Some announcements.

232
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,474
On Friday,

233
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,955
please join us for our first annual
Gamblers Anonymous Monte Carlo Night.

234
00:15:00,998 --> 00:15:03,400
Yeah. Just for funzies,
you know.

235
00:15:03,468 --> 00:15:05,602
Bring your singles.
Yeah.

236
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:08,138
All right, good night,
everyone! Yeah!

237
00:15:08,205 --> 00:15:10,006
Thank you so much!

238
00:15:22,103 --> 00:15:24,087
Great show, Guru Pitka.

239
00:15:24,155 --> 00:15:26,990
Hey, any bears
in the cave?

240
00:15:27,057 --> 00:15:28,425
Any bears?
Oh, yeah.

241
00:15:28,493 --> 00:15:30,827
Bear cub. Left cave.

242
00:15:30,895 --> 00:15:32,095
Right here?
There. Right there.

243
00:15:32,163 --> 00:15:33,764
Yeah. Right.

244
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:37,233
That little booger gave me a
nose-whistle during the whole show.

245
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:45,426
Now, I'm ready to receive.

246
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:50,180
Mariska Hargitay,
Your Holiness.

247
00:15:50,248 --> 00:15:52,766
Mariska Hargitay,
Jessica Simpson.

248
00:16:02,443 --> 00:16:05,078
Did you get into
the VIP room okay?

249
00:16:07,098 --> 00:16:08,698
I love you.

250
00:16:10,084 --> 00:16:12,252
Mariska Hargitay,
Your Holiness.

251
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,621
Mariska Hargitay,
Val Kilmer.

252
00:16:23,648 --> 00:16:25,381
Why do you hurt me?

253
00:16:27,051 --> 00:16:29,068
I know why.
I know why.

254
00:16:29,937 --> 00:16:31,638
Mariska Hargitay,
Guru Pitka.

255
00:16:31,705 --> 00:16:33,240
Mariska Hargitay...

256
00:16:37,094 --> 00:16:39,295
Mariska Hargitay.

257
00:16:39,363 --> 00:16:43,650
I so enjoyed your sutra, especially
the part about not being a victim.

258
00:16:43,652 --> 00:16:44,534
Well, thank you.

259
00:16:44,602 --> 00:16:46,837
Because you are such
a generous benefactor,

260
00:16:46,904 --> 00:16:51,592
we are establishing the "Mariska
Hargitay Special Victims Unit."

261
00:16:56,447 --> 00:16:57,831
The whole nine yards.

262
00:16:57,899 --> 00:16:59,766
Thank you, Your Holiness.

263
00:16:59,834 --> 00:17:04,004
You have gone
from nowhere to now here.

264
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,974
I'm beautiful
and I have a secret.

265
00:17:08,909 --> 00:17:10,076
Bang.

266
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:15,431
Yes.

267
00:17:15,499 --> 00:17:20,187
Guru Pitka, this is Jane Bullard,
owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs.

268
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:50,951
<i>Guru Pitka?</i>

269
00:17:51,018 --> 00:17:52,970
Hold on one second.

270
00:17:53,037 --> 00:17:54,921
<i>Guru Pitka?</i>

271
00:17:54,989 --> 00:17:56,622
No!

272
00:17:59,043 --> 00:18:03,546
So, you are the owner of the ice
hockey team, the Toronto Maple Leaves?

273
00:18:03,614 --> 00:18:05,482
Actually,
it's Leafs.

274
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,583
Who said that?

275
00:18:07,768 --> 00:18:09,052
How did you get there?

276
00:18:10,488 --> 00:18:12,389
This little guy scared
the crap out of me.

277
00:18:12,457 --> 00:18:13,857
I think I'm gonna have
to do a panty check.

278
00:18:13,924 --> 00:18:16,793
I might have some
monkey-mustard back there.

279
00:18:16,861 --> 00:18:18,495
No, I am good.

280
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:19,696
Who is this prick?

281
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:20,563
Shh.

282
00:18:20,631 --> 00:18:23,417
Well, how do you do?
Shrimp?

283
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:26,135
What'd you call me, Jagamo?

284
00:18:26,203 --> 00:18:29,006
I'm sorry, I didn't catch
your gnome... Name!

285
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:32,509
You are a midget.

286
00:18:32,577 --> 00:18:34,745
I find that term
condescending!

287
00:18:34,812 --> 00:18:38,398
Condescending.
That's a big word for you.

288
00:18:39,717 --> 00:18:41,151
The man's an ass!

289
00:18:41,219 --> 00:18:44,504
Your Holiness,
you're an expert on love.

290
00:18:44,572 --> 00:18:45,755
Yes, I am.

291
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:48,474
Why do you think Darren Roanoke
threw away his marriage?

292
00:18:48,542 --> 00:18:52,178
<i>Well, in my book, I Know You Are,
But What Am I?</i>

293
00:18:52,246 --> 00:18:54,314
I explain that when
love goes wrong...

294
00:18:54,382 --> 00:18:56,116
Nothing goes right.
...nothing goes right.

295
00:18:56,183 --> 00:18:57,450
Yes!

296
00:18:57,518 --> 00:18:58,752
I've read it.
It's impressive.

297
00:18:58,819 --> 00:19:01,254
Yeah, it's nothing short
of a masterpiece.

298
00:19:01,322 --> 00:19:04,458
So, do you think you can come back
with us to Toronto in the team jet?

299
00:19:04,525 --> 00:19:06,075
It's a date.

300
00:19:06,143 --> 00:19:07,077
Is it, now?

301
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:10,948
Well, this kitten's
got a whip. Meow!

302
00:19:14,385 --> 00:19:16,536
This is great,
Your Holiness!

303
00:19:16,604 --> 00:19:21,007
I can see you now, spreading
your message of self-love

304
00:19:21,075 --> 00:19:23,060
<i>on Oprah.
Oprah!</i>

305
00:19:23,127 --> 00:19:25,512
<i>He's finally here for the
first time on the Oprah show.</i>

306
00:19:25,579 --> 00:19:28,080
Welcome Guru Pitka.

307
00:19:31,719 --> 00:19:35,672
Oprah! Come on, Oprah.

308
00:19:41,529 --> 00:19:43,129
Hello.

309
00:19:43,164 --> 00:19:45,598
Thank you very much.

310
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:49,569
Mariska Hargitay.
Thank you for the gift of water.

311
00:19:49,637 --> 00:19:52,089
All right, I'm just gonna
come out and say it.

312
00:19:52,156 --> 00:19:54,857
I find your work
really inspiring.

313
00:19:54,925 --> 00:19:58,945
I actually went to one of your
sutras after my father passed away.

314
00:19:59,013 --> 00:20:01,631
I'm sorry to hear
about your father.

315
00:20:01,699 --> 00:20:04,051
Have you read my book
on the grieving process?

316
00:20:04,118 --> 00:20:07,453
<i>It's called, What's This?
A Dead One of These.</i>

317
00:20:08,956 --> 00:20:10,957
Yes.
Oh, you have?

318
00:20:11,225 --> 00:20:15,578
I especially like the chapter,
"It Might Just Be Sleeping."

319
00:20:15,697 --> 00:20:17,430
My favorite.

320
00:20:17,498 --> 00:20:19,065
I've read all your books.

321
00:20:19,133 --> 00:20:20,417
Oh. Well.

322
00:20:20,484 --> 00:20:23,920
To tell you the truth, I kind
of have a schoolgirl crush.

323
00:20:24,972 --> 00:20:27,340
Oh, really?

324
00:20:27,408 --> 00:20:30,276
What does your husband
think about this crush?

325
00:20:30,344 --> 00:20:31,895
I'm not married.

326
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:33,964
Boyfriend?

327
00:20:34,031 --> 00:20:35,298
Nope.

328
00:20:36,617 --> 00:20:37,935
Girlfriend?

329
00:20:39,487 --> 00:20:41,605
Well, I mean, there was
one time in college.

330
00:20:41,672 --> 00:20:42,539
Really?

331
00:20:42,606 --> 00:20:44,691
What was that?

332
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:46,276
I didn't hear anything.

333
00:20:49,813 --> 00:20:52,815
Well, it's hard to believe a
girl like you can't find a man.

334
00:20:52,883 --> 00:20:54,400
What does that mean,
"a girl like me"?

335
00:20:54,468 --> 00:20:56,419
Well, come on,
I don't have words for it.

336
00:20:56,487 --> 00:21:00,657
You know, nice girl,
intelligent,

337
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:04,361
bedroom eyes,
pouty lips,

338
00:21:04,428 --> 00:21:07,364
great rack,
tight bell-shaped ass,

339
00:21:07,431 --> 00:21:08,898
thicker than a Snicker...

340
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:12,518
Say.

341
00:21:12,586 --> 00:21:15,688
My problem with men
is the Bullard Curse.

342
00:21:15,756 --> 00:21:17,524
What's a Bullard Curse?

343
00:21:17,592 --> 00:21:23,180
My father, Hank Bullard,
bought the Leafs in 1967.

344
00:21:23,247 --> 00:21:25,866
And we haven't won
a Stanley Cup since.

345
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:29,052
So, all the men in the city
blame me and my family.

346
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:32,522
<i>Well, as I write in my book
Stop Hitting Yourself.</i>

347
00:21:32,589 --> 00:21:34,524
<i>Stop Hitting Yourself.</i>

348
00:21:34,591 --> 00:21:37,410
<i>Why Are You Still
Hitting Yourself?</i>

349
00:21:37,478 --> 00:21:42,515
I explain that, people may
say bad things about you,

350
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:45,819
but you must never say bad
things about yourself.

351
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:50,740
I see someone who's
ready for change.

352
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:53,676
It would just be
easier to change,

353
00:21:53,744 --> 00:21:56,513
if I didn't have to deal
with the city that hates me.

354
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,249
Jane, the City of Toronto
doesn't hate you.

355
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:01,468
Oh, yeah, they do.
Oh, no, they don't.

356
00:22:01,535 --> 00:22:02,985
Oh, yeah, they do.
Oh, no, they don't.

357
00:22:03,054 --> 00:22:04,337
Trust me.

358
00:22:04,404 --> 00:22:06,138
At the arena, I had
Maintenance paint lines

359
00:22:06,206 --> 00:22:07,874
to show me where
the crowd can't see me.

360
00:22:12,596 --> 00:22:15,448
<i>You know,
so they don't boo me</i>

361
00:22:15,516 --> 00:22:18,702
<i>and throw stuff at my head.</i>

362
00:22:21,689 --> 00:22:24,074
I mean, I didn't even
ask for this job!

363
00:22:24,141 --> 00:22:25,374
I guess it's just my fate!

364
00:22:25,442 --> 00:22:27,077
Fate is a joke.

365
00:22:27,144 --> 00:22:31,681
And as I once read on a wall, in a
truck stop bathroom in Barstow,

366
00:22:31,749 --> 00:22:35,184
"The joke is
in your hands."

367
00:22:37,971 --> 00:22:40,106
Oh, my God,
I just got that!

368
00:22:41,609 --> 00:22:45,344
Well, to be more accurate, the
joke was in Rajneesh's hands.

369
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:49,516
What?

370
00:23:02,946 --> 00:23:04,397
Nice shooting!

371
00:23:06,233 --> 00:23:09,035
I am His Holiness,
the Guru Pitka.

372
00:23:09,103 --> 00:23:10,754
Look, man, just get back
on your pillow, all right?

373
00:23:10,821 --> 00:23:13,290
There ain't no connection between
my love life and my hockey.

374
00:23:13,357 --> 00:23:15,041
I'm not here
to work with you.

375
00:23:15,109 --> 00:23:17,994
I just came by to say
hello and goodbye.

376
00:23:18,061 --> 00:23:19,596
Goodbye?
Yeah.

377
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:21,498
I spoke with your wife,
Prudence.

378
00:23:21,565 --> 00:23:23,333
She broke it off
with Grande,

379
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:25,602
and now she wants you back!

380
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:26,836
Seriously?

381
00:23:26,904 --> 00:23:28,738
Sure. You don't need me.

382
00:23:28,806 --> 00:23:31,074
Go back to what
you were doing.

383
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:41,151
Yes!

384
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:43,569
There is one other thing.

385
00:23:43,637 --> 00:23:45,005
I lied.

386
00:23:45,072 --> 00:23:46,539
Prudence is still
with Jacques Grande,

387
00:23:46,607 --> 00:23:49,058
and he still has the
biggest wiener in hockey.

388
00:23:51,295 --> 00:23:52,545
Ooh. Ow.

389
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,831
Is it true?

390
00:23:54,898 --> 00:23:57,100
Yes, he has
a ginormous hog.

391
00:23:57,168 --> 00:24:00,086
Do you still think
there is no connection

392
00:24:00,154 --> 00:24:03,639
between Prudence and how
crappy you are playing?

393
00:24:03,641 --> 00:24:04,924
Tell me this.

394
00:24:04,992 --> 00:24:06,960
Do you want Prudence back?
Of course I do.

395
00:24:07,027 --> 00:24:09,962
Then I need you to write
Prudence an apology letter,

396
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:12,498
and I will go
deliver it to her.

397
00:24:12,566 --> 00:24:14,801
All bids for connection count.

398
00:24:16,653 --> 00:24:17,787
What if it doesn't work?

399
00:24:17,855 --> 00:24:20,056
I can always
refund your misery.

400
00:24:23,127 --> 00:24:24,827
I was ominous just then.

401
00:24:43,681 --> 00:24:46,432
Grande's not going to like
you talking to Prudence.

402
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,719
I know, but I must deliver
this apology letter to her.

403
00:24:49,787 --> 00:24:51,921
Do you think
Grande saw us?

404
00:24:51,989 --> 00:24:53,489
Of course not, Rajneesh.

405
00:24:53,557 --> 00:24:55,825
We are completely
hidden by this bush.

406
00:24:59,463 --> 00:25:02,566
This may go badly.

407
00:25:03,967 --> 00:25:05,935
Keep the elephant running.

408
00:25:10,073 --> 00:25:11,507
Prudence?

409
00:25:13,594 --> 00:25:15,528
My little cabbage?

410
00:25:24,588 --> 00:25:26,522
While I do your calves,
I'd like to sing a song

411
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:29,175
by the greatest singer
ever from Quebec,

412
00:25:29,177 --> 00:25:32,161
Miss Celine Dion.

413
00:25:33,297 --> 00:25:37,133
♪ You were my strength

And now, I'd like to show my love
by making for you a Quebec pizza.

427
00:26:27,367 --> 00:26:28,484
What's that?

428
00:26:28,552 --> 00:26:30,420
Pop-Tart with the ketchup.

429
00:26:30,487 --> 00:26:32,055
She's good.

430
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:39,095
Guru Pitka?
What happened to you?

431
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,501
Nothing. Why do you ask?

432
00:26:47,387 --> 00:26:51,407
We've not much time.
I have an apology letter from Darren.

433
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:57,730
Well, you know, I got attacked
by a rooster. So, you know.

434
00:26:57,798 --> 00:26:59,599
Yeah.

435
00:26:59,666 --> 00:27:02,402
So he writes one stupid note and
you expect me to take him back?

436
00:27:02,469 --> 00:27:03,836
Perhaps I can change him.

437
00:27:03,904 --> 00:27:05,004
Ding-dong.

438
00:27:05,071 --> 00:27:08,908
Did someone order the
special Quebec pizza, eh?

439
00:27:08,975 --> 00:27:11,076
You know,
like in the porno.

440
00:27:12,446 --> 00:27:14,546
Who is this
in my house?

441
00:27:14,614 --> 00:27:16,066
Whoa!

442
00:27:18,302 --> 00:27:21,487
Looks like he's
smuggling a schnauzer.

443
00:27:21,555 --> 00:27:22,922
Yeah.

444
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,824
Let me show you out.

445
00:27:24,892 --> 00:27:26,142
Down, boy.

446
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:28,761
Read the letter.

447
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,783
Nice place, eh?
Yeah.

448
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:35,652
And I got her cheap.

449
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:39,088
So, it's an honor to have
you here in my house, Guru Pitka.

450
00:27:39,156 --> 00:27:41,340
I think you are an
amazing guru, and...

451
00:27:41,408 --> 00:27:43,609
Hey! Mister!

452
00:27:43,677 --> 00:27:46,712
What did you do
to my rooster?

453
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,948
I don't know what
you're talking about.

454
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:53,335
Stay away from
my girlfriend!

455
00:27:58,209 --> 00:27:59,725
The Wolverine.

456
00:28:12,907 --> 00:28:14,457
Don't look at me with
that tone of voice,

457
00:28:14,524 --> 00:28:16,693
or I punch you
in the shirt!

458
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,494
Okay, gotta go.

459
00:28:20,113 --> 00:28:21,747
Beat it.
I gotta take a dump.

460
00:28:21,815 --> 00:28:23,766
Bodhisattva!

461
00:28:28,388 --> 00:28:30,439
Hello, superstar.

462
00:28:30,507 --> 00:28:33,659
Welcome to my new
Toronto ashram.

463
00:28:33,727 --> 00:28:36,746
Uncle Jack. Can I get a hand
getting off this elephant?

464
00:28:36,814 --> 00:28:40,633
Darren, if your Uncle Jack
helped you off an elephant,

465
00:28:40,701 --> 00:28:43,769
would you help your Uncle
Jack off an elephant?

466
00:28:46,924 --> 00:28:48,391
That's funny to you?

467
00:28:49,727 --> 00:28:52,027
I don't know
where I get it.

468
00:28:52,095 --> 00:28:54,163
So did you give Prudence
my apology letter or what?

469
00:28:54,231 --> 00:28:55,998
Yes, of course!

470
00:28:56,066 --> 00:28:57,099
Did it work?

471
00:28:57,167 --> 00:28:59,252
Let me answer it this way.

472
00:29:03,239 --> 00:29:04,674
You're an idiot.

473
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:05,858
Yes, I am!

474
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:15,418
Now, your entourage
must stay behind.

475
00:29:15,486 --> 00:29:17,370
No, no, no, no, no.
They protect me.

476
00:29:17,438 --> 00:29:20,289
Well, they didn't protect you
from that outfit, now, did they?

477
00:29:21,008 --> 00:29:22,574
What?

478
00:29:22,642 --> 00:29:24,227
What's wrong
with shark skin?

479
00:29:24,294 --> 00:29:27,263
More like gay-skin,
how about. What? Yeah.

480
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:30,799
Snaps.

481
00:29:32,086 --> 00:29:34,153
Right, let's talk about
Jacques Grande!

482
00:29:34,221 --> 00:29:36,322
No! Leave that
man out of this.

483
00:29:36,389 --> 00:29:37,907
You feel inadequate,

484
00:29:37,975 --> 00:29:43,045
because he has plenty of clarity,
organization, charm, and knowledge.

485
00:29:43,113 --> 00:29:44,213
TM.

486
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,917
Yeah, he's got a lot
of that, all right.

487
00:29:48,985 --> 00:29:51,804
Therefore, he's able
to say to Prudence,

488
00:29:51,872 --> 00:29:55,641
"Be loving and open-hearted
with my emotions."

489
00:29:56,777 --> 00:29:57,977
TM.

490
00:29:59,329 --> 00:30:01,030
You better stop right there.

491
00:30:01,165 --> 00:30:05,000
Blowme is a good way to remember that.
Blowme, yeah.

492
00:30:05,068 --> 00:30:08,504
Blowme, yeah. Blowme.

493
00:30:08,572 --> 00:30:09,772
Blowme.

494
00:30:10,307 --> 00:30:11,590
You should stop.

495
00:30:11,658 --> 00:30:13,893
Well, I'm sure
you're sick of this.

496
00:30:13,961 --> 00:30:16,963
I know Prudence has had it
up to here with Grande.

497
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,347
All right,
you know what?

498
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,304
I can't move my body!

499
00:30:25,371 --> 00:30:28,892
It is an Indian martial art
known as "how to hurt a guy."

500
00:30:28,959 --> 00:30:30,894
I am poking
your third eye.

501
00:30:30,961 --> 00:30:34,213
And if I twist my thumb,
I can make you crap yourself!

502
00:30:34,281 --> 00:30:36,699
So, what do you
want me to do?

503
00:30:36,767 --> 00:30:40,135
What I need is to get you
to follow my method, Drama.

504
00:30:40,203 --> 00:30:42,271
We must distract you
from your emotional pain,

505
00:30:42,338 --> 00:30:44,106
regress you back
to your childhood.

506
00:30:44,174 --> 00:30:46,842
We must adjust your
negativity, mature you,

507
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,544
and put it all into action.

508
00:30:48,612 --> 00:30:52,615
If you follow my method,
not only will you win Stanley's Cup,

509
00:30:52,683 --> 00:30:54,917
but you'll also
get Prudence back.

510
00:30:54,984 --> 00:30:56,202
You think this'll work?

511
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,854
Depends.
Depends on what?

512
00:30:57,921 --> 00:31:00,039
No, you might want to
pick up some Depends.

513
00:31:00,106 --> 00:31:02,742
I may have twisted
my thumb. Yeah.

514
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:04,327
Check for coins.

515
00:31:04,394 --> 00:31:05,762
Think fast.

516
00:31:05,829 --> 00:31:07,129
Drama!

517
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:09,899
Drama.

518
00:31:11,868 --> 00:31:16,739
Students, now I am going
to teach you the "D" of drama.

519
00:31:16,807 --> 00:31:18,074
Distraction.

520
00:31:21,945 --> 00:31:25,164
Maurice, if Plato,
Shakespeare and Einstein

521
00:31:25,232 --> 00:31:27,533
were talking about
the meaning of life,

522
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,736
and two elephants
started humping outside,

523
00:31:30,804 --> 00:31:32,855
even they would
rush to the window.

524
00:31:32,923 --> 00:31:35,007
It is the ultimate
distraction.

525
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:40,496
We shall now compete
in a game of tag.

526
00:31:40,563 --> 00:31:42,515
It is called Stink Mop.

527
00:31:43,267 --> 00:31:45,401
Enter, Sanjay!

528
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,808
Enter, Maurice.

529
00:31:59,933 --> 00:32:02,619
Commence Stink Mop.

530
00:32:04,404 --> 00:32:06,155
Stink Mop! Stink Mop!

531
00:32:06,189 --> 00:32:08,057
Stink Mop.
Go.

532
00:32:10,844 --> 00:32:12,094
Stink Mop.

533
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,195
Stink Mop!

534
00:32:13,664 --> 00:32:15,297
Maurice.

535
00:32:15,365 --> 00:32:17,967
What are you not
thinking about?

536
00:32:18,035 --> 00:32:20,770
I am not thinking
about my chastity belt.

537
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:22,354
That is distraction.

538
00:32:22,422 --> 00:32:23,689
Yes!

539
00:32:23,757 --> 00:32:26,442
I get it!
I am distracted!

540
00:32:31,381 --> 00:32:34,483
Good distraction frees us
from emotional pain.

541
00:32:34,551 --> 00:32:37,086
Bad distraction gives you
a mouth full of whizz.

542
00:32:44,978 --> 00:32:47,529
Once again,
I'm Trent Lueders.

543
00:32:47,597 --> 00:32:49,165
And I'm Jay Kell.

544
00:32:49,232 --> 00:32:50,516
Go, Leafs, go!
Go, Leafs, go!

545
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:52,518
<i>Tonight, game one
of the Stanley Cup Finals.</i>

546
00:32:52,586 --> 00:32:56,672
<i>L.A. Kings, Toronto Maple Leafs.
It's gonna get ugly.</i>

547
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,291
Ugly. You want
to hear ugly?

548
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:02,395
At Promises, I shivved a guy
with a sharpened toothbrush

549
00:33:02,463 --> 00:33:04,964
because he bogarted
the rehab toilet hooch

550
00:33:05,031 --> 00:33:07,866
that I'd made from
apples and pantyhose.

551
00:33:07,934 --> 00:33:10,236
That was ugly.

552
00:33:10,304 --> 00:33:11,570
Over to you, Trent.

553
00:33:12,188 --> 00:33:14,340
Thanks, Jay.

554
00:33:14,407 --> 00:33:16,075
All right, guys.
Bring it in.

555
00:33:16,142 --> 00:33:19,412
Let's rip off their heads
and shit down their necks!

556
00:33:19,479 --> 00:33:20,796
Yeah!

557
00:33:20,864 --> 00:33:22,932
- Go! Go!
- Here we go!

558
00:33:23,033 --> 00:33:26,051
Now, the first lesson
is distraction.

559
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:27,787
In order to
learn distraction,

560
00:33:27,854 --> 00:33:30,656
you're not allowed to fight
anyone in today's hockey match.

561
00:33:30,723 --> 00:33:33,091
I'm a hockey player! That's what
hockey players do. We fight!

562
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:34,477
It's a problem.

563
00:33:34,544 --> 00:33:36,729
Even Jay-Z had 99 of them,

564
00:33:36,796 --> 00:33:39,732
and the bitch was
not one of them.

565
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:42,635
Now, do you want
to win Stanley's Cup?

566
00:33:42,702 --> 00:33:45,021
Yes, I wanna win
the Stanley Cup!

567
00:33:45,055 --> 00:33:48,474
Then you are not allowed to
fight anyone for any reason!

568
00:33:51,728 --> 00:33:53,562
Don't fight!

569
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,581
Now, get out there,
and don't kill them.

570
00:33:59,068 --> 00:34:00,836
What is that?
Corn dog.

571
00:34:01,838 --> 00:34:03,005
What is it?

572
00:34:03,072 --> 00:34:05,458
Is it made from dog?

573
00:34:05,526 --> 00:34:07,426
What a freaking idiot.

574
00:34:08,862 --> 00:34:12,748
Is this a dog's thingy?
Am I being punk'd?

575
00:34:12,816 --> 00:34:16,385
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the Leafs take the ice.</i>

576
00:34:27,347 --> 00:34:28,915
Hello, Los Angeles Kings.

577
00:34:29,082 --> 00:34:31,166
I am His Holiness,
the Guru Pitka.

578
00:34:31,234 --> 00:34:34,019
And I have a message
from Darren Roanoke.

579
00:34:34,087 --> 00:34:39,558
He told me to tell you
that you're all his bitches,

580
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:42,127
and that you can
suck his big greasy...

581
00:34:44,848 --> 00:34:46,765
Mariska Hargitay.

582
00:34:51,688 --> 00:34:53,305
I'm gonna kill you,
Roanoke!

583
00:34:53,373 --> 00:34:54,890
You're dead,
Roanoke!

584
00:34:54,958 --> 00:34:56,625
Damn, Roanoke!

585
00:34:56,693 --> 00:35:00,178
<i>And we're getting ready to drop
the puck for game one of the Finals.</i>

586
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,731
I know I'm excited, Jay.
How are you?

587
00:35:02,799 --> 00:35:04,467
I am rigid.

588
00:35:15,896 --> 00:35:17,780
<i>It's a yard sale!</i>

589
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,133
What?

590
00:35:21,135 --> 00:35:22,334
Not to fight.

591
00:35:22,402 --> 00:35:24,770
You are not to fight anyone.

592
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,400
Oh!

593
00:35:38,468 --> 00:35:41,904
I would not wanna
be his nutsack.

594
00:35:41,972 --> 00:35:44,606
<i>They're coming
after Roanoke!</i>

595
00:35:50,046 --> 00:35:51,297
Get up!

596
00:35:55,135 --> 00:35:56,368
What the hell
are you doing?

597
00:35:56,436 --> 00:35:59,554
Superstar,
look at your hands.

598
00:36:00,573 --> 00:36:02,040
They're not shaking!

599
00:36:02,108 --> 00:36:03,225
Yes.

600
00:36:05,612 --> 00:36:09,164
<i>Roanoke with the puck.
What a pass!</i>

601
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:12,885
Goal! Roanoke may be
fighting for his life,

602
00:36:12,952 --> 00:36:14,687
but he's playing great!

603
00:36:21,361 --> 00:36:25,765
<i>Rob Blake is lucky
the refs didn't see that.</i>

604
00:36:25,832 --> 00:36:28,851
But the refs will see that on
our post-game highlight reel.

605
00:36:28,919 --> 00:36:33,789
That is the Altoids "Curiously Strong
Elbow to the Face" of the game.

606
00:36:33,857 --> 00:36:36,742
Oh, God.
Am I still dreaming?

607
00:36:37,878 --> 00:36:40,146
No. Why do you ask?

608
00:36:42,081 --> 00:36:43,582
Why'd you tell me
not to fight?

609
00:36:43,633 --> 00:36:47,002
Because you are now distracted,
therefore playing better.

610
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,537
It's the only way.

611
00:36:48,605 --> 00:36:50,355
Yeah, well, I can't keep
getting my ass kicked!

612
00:36:50,357 --> 00:36:53,609
Fine! Fight anyone
for any reason.

613
00:36:53,677 --> 00:36:56,629
You just said don't fight...
What, it's just arbitrary with you?

614
00:36:56,696 --> 00:36:58,630
Of course not!

615
00:36:58,698 --> 00:37:00,499
But we will let
the dice decide.

616
00:37:03,036 --> 00:37:06,622
Yes, it is arbitrary!
Fight anyone for any reason!

617
00:37:12,162 --> 00:37:13,629
Fight anyone.

618
00:37:21,722 --> 00:37:25,373
It's a bench-clearing
brawl!

619
00:37:25,441 --> 00:37:27,905
Remember, kids, this is
not how you play hockey.

620
00:37:27,931 --> 00:37:28,885
It's just ugly.

621
00:37:28,928 --> 00:37:30,079
I like it.

622
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,487
That was a good one.

623
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,092
One game suspension,
Roanoke!

624
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,611
Way to go, Roanoke!
You jag-off!

625
00:37:47,213 --> 00:37:48,280
Him, too?

626
00:37:48,348 --> 00:37:51,417
Anyone for any reason.

627
00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:00,142
I love my job!

628
00:38:01,861 --> 00:38:03,095
Two games!

629
00:38:03,162 --> 00:38:04,697
Now, it's a two-game
suspension.

630
00:38:04,764 --> 00:38:08,467
That would mean Roanoke would
be out for game two and three!

631
00:38:08,535 --> 00:38:09,969
He could play in game four.

632
00:38:10,303 --> 00:38:12,387
Of course, we don't know
if we're going to game five!

633
00:38:12,455 --> 00:38:15,057
Two and three, out,
can't play in the game.

634
00:38:15,124 --> 00:38:17,559
He could watch the game
at home, but he can't play!

635
00:38:17,627 --> 00:38:19,979
He can pretend to play
while he's at home,

636
00:38:20,046 --> 00:38:25,084
but he cannot play on the ice in
the game that we're watching,

637
00:38:25,152 --> 00:38:28,553
which is after this game,
'cause we're in game one.

638
00:38:28,621 --> 00:38:31,523
You have a firm
grasp of the obvious.

639
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:35,877
How could he do that?

640
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:40,765
Are you all right?

641
00:38:42,819 --> 00:38:44,587
I'd like to thank
the Academy.

642
00:38:44,654 --> 00:38:47,389
Wow, these things
are heavy. Yeah.

643
00:38:47,457 --> 00:38:49,225
Put me down, A-hole!
Okay.

644
00:38:51,644 --> 00:38:55,514
<i>And the Kings take the first
game of the Stanley Cup Finals.</i>

645
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:58,000
Damn it!

646
00:38:58,735 --> 00:39:00,769
Cherkov, relax!

647
00:39:00,837 --> 00:39:02,637
Now, everyone,
let's just take a seat.

648
00:39:02,706 --> 00:39:03,872
Okay.

649
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:15,400
First of all, let's agree next time
we decide to have a group meeting,

650
00:39:15,468 --> 00:39:17,503
we take it in my office.

651
00:39:19,105 --> 00:39:22,324
Now, Guru Pitka here
obviously has a plan.

652
00:39:22,392 --> 00:39:26,278
So, Guru, enlighten us.
What is your plan?

653
00:39:26,346 --> 00:39:29,982
Frankly, this is completely
unexpected, and I'm scared shitless.

654
00:39:29,984 --> 00:39:31,700
- No, no!
- Let me at him!

655
00:39:31,768 --> 00:39:32,968
Take it easy, Frodo.

656
00:39:33,036 --> 00:39:34,836
No! Get back! No!

657
00:39:35,355 --> 00:39:36,671
No! No!

658
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,007
Hippie queer!

659
00:39:39,075 --> 00:39:40,275
Throw a hex on you.

660
00:39:40,343 --> 00:39:41,694
Okay, okay.

661
00:39:41,761 --> 00:39:45,330
Isn't there any way that you
could skip a step or two?

662
00:39:45,398 --> 00:39:48,099
No way! With Drama,
there is no shortcuts.

663
00:39:48,167 --> 00:39:50,903
We must now take him
back to his childhood.

664
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:53,289
His childhood?
Yes.

665
00:39:53,356 --> 00:39:55,440
His mother only
lives an hour away,

666
00:39:55,508 --> 00:39:57,576
but he won't allow her
to go to the games.

667
00:39:57,644 --> 00:39:59,545
Interesting.

668
00:39:59,612 --> 00:40:02,614
He won't allow his mother
to come to any of his games!

669
00:40:02,682 --> 00:40:04,433
Come, Rajneesh,
a breakthrough!

670
00:40:05,619 --> 00:40:07,402
Little help, please!

671
00:40:10,707 --> 00:40:12,575
Okay. All right.

672
00:40:12,642 --> 00:40:14,743
You're leaving?
Yes.

673
00:40:14,811 --> 00:40:16,479
Where are you going?

674
00:40:16,546 --> 00:40:17,980
To see Darren.

675
00:40:18,047 --> 00:40:20,749
Jane, I promise you,
everything will be fine.

676
00:40:20,817 --> 00:40:23,185
Come by my ashram,
then I will explain.

677
00:40:23,269 --> 00:40:24,954
Coach Cherkov,
I would invite you,

678
00:40:25,021 --> 00:40:27,907
but I know you have your meeting
with the Lollipop Guild.

679
00:40:35,514 --> 00:40:37,916
Why won't you let your mother
come to any of your hockey games?

680
00:40:37,984 --> 00:40:39,910
'Cause, man, I don't play
well around her, man.

681
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,777
She freaks me out.

682
00:40:40,819 --> 00:40:43,321
Then tomorrow
we will go to her!

683
00:40:43,389 --> 00:40:45,624
Oh, hell no!
Oh, hell no!

684
00:40:45,691 --> 00:40:47,008
Oh, hells yes!

685
00:41:00,522 --> 00:41:02,124
<i>Yeah.
This ain't Driving Miss Daisy, man.</i>

686
00:41:02,192 --> 00:41:04,259
I'll break your fingers.

687
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,343
Okay. Yo, this
my street right here.

688
00:41:16,369 --> 00:41:17,155
Tonawanda Street.

689
00:41:17,157 --> 00:41:18,990
Tonawanda Street?
I know this street.

690
00:41:19,058 --> 00:41:20,792
You do?
Yes.

691
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,744
At what number
did you live?

692
00:41:22,812 --> 00:41:24,195
Fifty-three.

693
00:41:24,263 --> 00:41:26,948
Do you know a
Dickie Withers at 85?

694
00:41:27,016 --> 00:41:29,284
No.
Well, it does.

695
00:41:29,352 --> 00:41:32,937
A dickie does wither at 85.
I own you! Yeah!

696
00:41:32,939 --> 00:41:34,710
Yeah!
You are laughing!

697
00:41:34,736 --> 00:41:38,201
You see,
you're filled with joy of a child!

698
00:41:38,244 --> 00:41:40,912
You are now ready
to meet your ma.

699
00:41:45,118 --> 00:41:47,435
I'm warning you, GP,
my mom's tough.

700
00:41:47,503 --> 00:41:50,305
Oh, please.
How bad can she be?

701
00:41:50,373 --> 00:41:53,258
♪ Raise it up
and make a joyful noise

702
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,877
♪ Oh, I shall not be moved

703
00:41:55,945 --> 00:41:57,779
♪ No, no, no, no

704
00:41:57,847 --> 00:41:59,581
♪ No, I shall not be moved

705
00:41:59,649 --> 00:42:00,882
♪ No, no

706
00:42:00,884 --> 00:42:04,486
♪ Lead me to your rock

707
00:42:04,554 --> 00:42:07,055
♪ Where I shall not be

708
00:42:07,122 --> 00:42:13,078
♪ I shall not be moved

709
00:42:13,146 --> 00:42:15,897
Remember, Darren,
you must stand up to her.

710
00:42:15,965 --> 00:42:17,032
Got it.

711
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:18,466
Baby boy.

712
00:42:18,534 --> 00:42:20,819
Oh, Mom.

713
00:42:20,887 --> 00:42:23,388
Now, why won't you let
your ma come see you play?

714
00:42:23,439 --> 00:42:26,275
It's just that you're not
always the most supportive, Ma.

715
00:42:26,342 --> 00:42:27,809
Supportive?

716
00:42:30,263 --> 00:42:32,113
Pressure makes diamonds.

717
00:42:32,181 --> 00:42:34,382
Pressure also
makes rubble.

718
00:42:36,352 --> 00:42:40,188
And after a good whipping,
cream rises to the top.

719
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:41,773
So does scum!

720
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:45,644
You're the Guru Pitka.

721
00:42:45,711 --> 00:42:47,178
Yes, I am.

722
00:42:47,246 --> 00:42:49,681
You're like the poor
man's Deepak Chopra.

723
00:42:49,799 --> 00:42:51,232
Game over.

724
00:42:51,234 --> 00:42:52,750
Oh, Mom, don't, don't.

725
00:42:52,818 --> 00:42:55,487
Do you have something
to say to me?

726
00:42:55,555 --> 00:42:58,106
Yes, you do.
Yes, go ahead.

727
00:43:02,044 --> 00:43:03,227
Yes.

728
00:43:05,014 --> 00:43:07,482
You change your hair color?
'Cause it looks nice.

729
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,335
We'll talk in the car.

730
00:43:11,704 --> 00:43:13,771
Well, this was fun.

731
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:17,275
And by fun, of course
I mean emotionally scarring.

732
00:43:17,343 --> 00:43:21,396
I know you are not trying to
tell me how to raise my child.

733
00:43:21,464 --> 00:43:22,713
Gotta go.

734
00:43:23,949 --> 00:43:26,834
Superstar! Superstar, wait!
Whoa!

735
00:43:26,836 --> 00:43:29,370
Look at you.
You're jumpy.

736
00:43:29,438 --> 00:43:31,706
You're like prison
bitch jumpy.

737
00:43:31,774 --> 00:43:33,591
I told you that we
shouldn't have come here.

738
00:43:33,659 --> 00:43:34,318
No, no, no, no, no.

739
00:43:34,344 --> 00:43:36,320
We have to go back in there
and confront your mother.

740
00:43:36,362 --> 00:43:38,447
There has to be
another way.

741
00:43:38,514 --> 00:43:41,049
Well, I hear you rappin',
Sister McCrappin'.

742
00:43:41,116 --> 00:43:43,951
Okay, there are two
ways to regress you.

743
00:43:44,019 --> 00:43:45,837
One involves your mother,
your shame core,

744
00:43:45,905 --> 00:43:48,607
and a grueling process
of intense self-examination.

745
00:43:48,674 --> 00:43:50,242
What's the other way?
Well...

746
00:43:50,909 --> 00:43:52,710
What does this
sound like?

747
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:14,332
I am making diarrhea
sounds with my cup.

748
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,967
I'm regressing you.

749
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:21,072
Someone's in here.
Someone's in here!

750
00:44:24,977 --> 00:44:26,778
Yes. You are laughing!

751
00:44:26,813 --> 00:44:29,314
Why am I laughing, man?

752
00:44:29,382 --> 00:44:31,649
Look what you did
to my jacket.

753
00:44:32,585 --> 00:44:33,735
Ball-gazer!

754
00:44:34,353 --> 00:44:36,387
Go ahead!

755
00:44:36,455 --> 00:44:39,507
You bastard. You totally
caught me in a ball-gaze.

756
00:44:39,575 --> 00:44:42,644
Congratulations,
you have been regressed.

757
00:44:42,712 --> 00:44:44,095
I own you!

758
00:44:44,163 --> 00:44:45,530
Yes, you own me.

759
00:44:45,598 --> 00:44:46,814
That was easy.

760
00:44:46,882 --> 00:44:49,117
But with ownership
comes responsibility.

761
00:44:49,285 --> 00:44:50,918
<i>It was at this
point that I realized</i>

762
00:44:50,986 --> 00:44:54,389
<i>that my student was finally
shedding his defenses.</i>

763
00:44:54,457 --> 00:44:55,723
What are you doing?

764
00:44:55,791 --> 00:44:57,843
<i>He said while eating
a chicken wing.</i>

765
00:44:57,910 --> 00:45:00,745
I am talking into my
voice-over machine.

766
00:45:00,813 --> 00:45:05,016
<i>So, the Leafs lose game two
by a whopping six-to-one score.</i>

767
00:45:05,018 --> 00:45:07,918
<i>The Leafs look rattled
without Roanoke.</i>

768
00:45:09,505 --> 00:45:11,422
It's Darren Roanoke.

769
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:13,241
You mean
Roan-choke more like.

770
00:45:15,911 --> 00:45:17,695
That's great.
Nice hat.

771
00:45:17,763 --> 00:45:19,597
I had a hat like that once.
Yeah?

772
00:45:19,665 --> 00:45:21,966
Then my mom got a job.

773
00:45:25,003 --> 00:45:27,888
Looks like I'm gonna have to shove
these love beads someplace special.

774
00:45:27,956 --> 00:45:29,408
You got a problem?

775
00:45:29,475 --> 00:45:31,976
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Let me handle this.

776
00:45:32,044 --> 00:45:36,698
There are two things about violence
they teach you when becoming a guru.

777
00:45:36,765 --> 00:45:42,186
The first thing is, an eye for
an eye leaves everyone blind.

778
00:45:42,305 --> 00:45:44,038
The second thing is,

779
00:45:44,106 --> 00:45:47,558
never ever watch
the bottle.

780
00:46:03,109 --> 00:46:05,026
You son of a bitch!

781
00:46:05,778 --> 00:46:07,929
It's a bar fight!

782
00:46:33,873 --> 00:46:35,323
Down, down!

783
00:46:36,091 --> 00:46:37,892
Watch out!

784
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,444
Well done!
Nice job!

785
00:46:58,013 --> 00:47:00,014
Hold on, hold on.

786
00:47:06,172 --> 00:47:07,172
Oh!

787
00:47:09,942 --> 00:47:11,943
Niagara Falls
is amazing.

788
00:47:12,811 --> 00:47:14,279
Darren.

789
00:47:14,346 --> 00:47:18,082
Just because your mother only
loved you when you achieved

790
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:21,386
doesn't mean that Prudence will
only love you when you achieve.

791
00:47:21,453 --> 00:47:25,906
I was afraid that Prudence would leave
me if I didn't win the Stanley Cup,

792
00:47:25,974 --> 00:47:27,242
so I left Prudence first.

793
00:47:27,309 --> 00:47:28,809
That's it!

794
00:47:28,877 --> 00:47:32,397
However, we must
confront your mother.

795
00:47:32,399 --> 00:47:34,533
Prudence always wanted me
to stand up to my ma.

796
00:47:34,634 --> 00:47:35,767
I know.

797
00:47:35,835 --> 00:47:37,485
I miss Prudence.

798
00:47:37,553 --> 00:47:38,953
I miss the connection.

799
00:47:40,189 --> 00:47:42,624
Connection.
Yeah.

800
00:47:42,692 --> 00:47:46,394
<i>Making love.
Falling asleep in each other's arms.</i>

801
00:47:46,462 --> 00:47:48,597
<i>Sometimes we would wake up
a couple hours later,</i>

802
00:47:48,664 --> 00:47:51,099
<i>and it'd be like we were the
only two people in the world.</i>

803
00:47:51,166 --> 00:47:54,402
<i>Prudence would stare into
my eyes, and she'd say...</i>

804
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:57,138
<i>- Damn.
- Damn.</i>

805
00:47:57,206 --> 00:47:59,941
<i>It sort of became our song.</i>

806
00:48:00,008 --> 00:48:03,445
You are a very lucky man.

807
00:48:03,512 --> 00:48:06,481
I would like to have a "damn"
moment like that someday.

808
00:48:06,782 --> 00:48:08,700
How can you be
the Love Guru

809
00:48:08,767 --> 00:48:11,285
if you've never been
in a relationship?

810
00:48:11,353 --> 00:48:13,721
Well, there is
someone I like.

811
00:48:13,789 --> 00:48:15,490
But until I learn
to love myself,

812
00:48:15,558 --> 00:48:17,875
I can only go out
with three girls named Ann.

813
00:48:17,943 --> 00:48:20,344
Three girls named Ann?
Yeah.

814
00:48:20,412 --> 00:48:23,147
Ann Visible, Ann
Flatable, and Ann Job.

815
00:48:24,216 --> 00:48:25,583
Ann Job!

816
00:48:27,219 --> 00:48:30,221
Well, you know, I deflect
because of the pain.

817
00:48:31,557 --> 00:48:33,924
I gotta get
my girl back, GP.

818
00:48:33,992 --> 00:48:36,260
Otherwise, what am
I gonna do with this?

819
00:48:36,262 --> 00:48:38,463
I have two tattoos.

820
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:40,365
One tattoo is
the Drama tattoo,

821
00:48:40,433 --> 00:48:42,434
which signifies the
self-determinist philosophy

822
00:48:42,501 --> 00:48:44,702
of the Tugginmypudha Ashram.

823
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:45,870
And what's
the other tattoo?

824
00:48:45,937 --> 00:48:48,656
Daffy Duck pushing a lawn
mower through my pubes.

825
00:48:50,158 --> 00:48:53,694
Look, he's dancing.
Yeah. Right.

826
00:48:53,762 --> 00:48:56,381
Ball-gazer! Oh, my God!
There you go!

827
00:48:56,448 --> 00:48:59,567
The ball-gazing student has
become the ball-gazing master.

Thank you, Speedy.
That's great.

843
00:50:36,248 --> 00:50:38,399
Mariska Hargitay.
That's great.

844
00:50:41,403 --> 00:50:43,805
That was lovely.
But we need to talk about Darren.

845
00:50:43,872 --> 00:50:45,306
This is a disaster.
He's my only...

846
00:50:45,474 --> 00:50:47,809
Jane! Do you trust me?

847
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,428
I do trust you.

848
00:50:51,763 --> 00:50:53,031
I'm not really sure why.

849
00:50:53,098 --> 00:50:56,784
It's the beard.
It makes me look like Santa.

850
00:50:56,919 --> 00:51:00,538
And by the way,
you look breathtaking.

851
00:51:01,272 --> 00:51:02,607
Thank you.

852
00:51:02,675 --> 00:51:04,976
As do I.

853
00:51:05,043 --> 00:51:08,079
Come. My staff has
prepared a lovely meal.

854
00:51:11,033 --> 00:51:12,850
Wow.
Right?

855
00:51:12,918 --> 00:51:15,937
I am so hungry I could
eat a skunk's bottom.

856
00:51:16,805 --> 00:51:18,756
Which is a lot
like calamari.

857
00:51:18,824 --> 00:51:20,992
But that's not what
we're having tonight.

858
00:51:21,059 --> 00:51:23,094
Rajneesh will now
prepare a dish

859
00:51:23,162 --> 00:51:26,097
made of two lychees
wrapped in a doughy pouch.

860
00:51:26,165 --> 00:51:28,699
It's called
Kartapal Birigalapatt.

861
00:51:28,767 --> 00:51:30,468
What's that mean?

862
00:51:30,536 --> 00:51:33,171
Nuts in a sling.

863
00:51:33,239 --> 00:51:35,172
Oh, thanks,
but I'll pass.

864
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,942
Very well, I'll have
your nuts in a sling.

865
00:51:39,595 --> 00:51:40,712
Cough.

866
00:51:42,114 --> 00:51:45,917
Reject this man.
Not fit for military service.

867
00:51:45,984 --> 00:51:48,736
Would you like your
nuts to be crushed?

868
00:51:48,803 --> 00:51:51,822
Doesn't everyone?
Who is this guy?

869
00:52:01,183 --> 00:52:03,051
Geronimo!

870
00:52:03,118 --> 00:52:05,086
That is our safe word.

871
00:52:07,539 --> 00:52:12,026
Now, we get the nuts nice and hot,
so they tighten up and get firm.

872
00:52:14,913 --> 00:52:16,130
Oh.

873
00:52:18,717 --> 00:52:20,718
That's good.

874
00:52:20,786 --> 00:52:23,855
Feels good. I mean, tastes good.
I mean, what?

875
00:52:25,991 --> 00:52:28,325
You want curlies
on your nuts?

876
00:52:28,393 --> 00:52:31,763
Do I look like a child? Of course
I want curlies on my nuts.

877
00:52:31,831 --> 00:52:33,931
Don't forget your pickle.

878
00:52:35,134 --> 00:52:37,352
Would you like
some soup instead?

879
00:52:37,419 --> 00:52:38,870
Yes.

880
00:52:38,938 --> 00:52:41,940
Rajneesh, I'd like an alligator
soup, and make it snappy.

881
00:52:44,143 --> 00:52:45,993
Because alligators
are snappy,

882
00:52:46,061 --> 00:52:48,295
and at the same time,
I want it prompt.

883
00:52:51,216 --> 00:52:54,235
Here it is. There's your soup.
Watch out! It's dangerous!

884
00:52:57,156 --> 00:52:59,741
You're as cute as pie.

885
00:52:59,808 --> 00:53:02,710
I haven't laughed like this
in such a long time.

886
00:53:02,778 --> 00:53:04,261
Why not?

887
00:53:04,329 --> 00:53:08,216
It's hard to laugh when men
only see you as some curse.

888
00:53:08,284 --> 00:53:11,285
Jane, there is no curse.

889
00:53:11,353 --> 00:53:15,123
You're just afraid of
intimacy, or into-me-I-see.

890
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:19,427
Remember, being vulnerable
is being woundable.

891
00:53:19,494 --> 00:53:21,829
I say take the risk.

892
00:53:21,897 --> 00:53:25,099
Well, that's easy to say
and hard to do.

893
00:53:25,167 --> 00:53:26,451
Is it?

894
00:53:26,485 --> 00:53:27,718
Uh-huh.

895
00:53:27,786 --> 00:53:31,372
What's the downside of
throwing away your fear?

896
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,525
The only way out is in.

897
00:53:38,296 --> 00:53:41,699
I think I'm about
to risk something.

898
00:53:46,538 --> 00:53:48,305
What's wrong?
We can't do this.

899
00:53:48,373 --> 00:53:50,975
What? You tell me to be vulnerable, and
then you turn around and wound me?

900
00:53:51,043 --> 00:53:53,044
I can explain.
Okay, go ahead.

901
00:53:53,512 --> 00:53:54,928
I can't explain.

902
00:53:54,996 --> 00:53:57,632
I should go.
No, Jane, wait! I...

903
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:01,468
Jane! Jane!

904
00:54:01,536 --> 00:54:06,007
<i>Game three here in Los Angeles.
The L.A. Kings have beaten the Leafs.</i>

905
00:54:06,075 --> 00:54:10,211
They are one game away
from a Stanley Cup victory.

906
00:54:10,278 --> 00:54:13,598
They can't be happy in the
Leafs' locker room right now.

907
00:54:13,666 --> 00:54:16,917
I'm sorry, I blacked out for a second.
Have they dropped the puck?

908
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:20,438
Damn it!
We're down three games

909
00:54:20,505 --> 00:54:23,808
because you decided you
couldn't win without Roanoke.

910
00:54:23,810 --> 00:54:26,560
And you! You're just
a stupid rich girl!

911
00:54:26,628 --> 00:54:29,613
You were born on third,
and you think you hit a triple!

912
00:54:29,681 --> 00:54:30,865
You don't know hockey!

913
00:54:30,933 --> 00:54:32,817
Are you finished?
No!

914
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:38,189
Now I'm finished!
And, Pitka!

915
00:54:38,256 --> 00:54:39,323
Yes?

916
00:54:39,391 --> 00:54:40,924
What's the capital
of Thailand?

917
00:54:40,992 --> 00:54:42,126
Bangkok.

918
00:54:42,194 --> 00:54:43,544
Exactly.

919
00:54:44,379 --> 00:54:47,548
Omar Sharif, my balls!

920
00:54:49,935 --> 00:54:52,103
My balls, you prick!

921
00:54:55,373 --> 00:54:57,108
Stay down, bitch!

922
00:54:57,242 --> 00:54:58,442
Okay.

923
00:55:00,062 --> 00:55:01,695
Jane! Jane, wait!

924
00:55:01,763 --> 00:55:06,234
He's right! I'm just a stupid rich
girl about to be a huge failure.

925
00:55:06,301 --> 00:55:09,353
Failure?
There's no such thing as failure.

926
00:55:09,421 --> 00:55:11,655
Only early attempts
at success.

927
00:55:11,723 --> 00:55:15,243
You know what? I hired you
to fix Darren Roanoke.

928
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:16,310
Do your job!

929

<i>Your Holiness, I spoke

930
00:55:22,885 --> 00:55:26,487

Prudence together by the next game,

931
00:55:26,554 --> 00:55:28,605
your spot will
go to Deepak.

932
00:55:28,724 --> 00:55:32,359
But Darren is not ready!
He must truly deal with his mother.

933
00:55:32,427 --> 00:55:34,495
And I will not
take a shortcut.

934
00:55:34,562 --> 00:55:36,714
Take a shortcut!

935
00:55:36,782 --> 00:55:39,867
Do you want to be the next
Deepak Chopra or not?

936
00:55:55,884 --> 00:55:58,586
<i>Babu, you cannot
take a shortcut.</i>

937
00:55:58,653 --> 00:56:01,138
But I need to become
the next Deepak Chopra!

938
00:56:01,206 --> 00:56:04,174
But how will you get Grande
away from Prudence?

939
00:56:04,426 --> 00:56:10,681
I have one idea that
just might work. Yeah.

00:57:14,129 --> 00:57:15,946
"love without knowledge."

954
00:57:16,014 --> 00:57:19,850
But what you had with Darren
is love with knowledge.

955
00:57:19,918 --> 00:57:22,236
A real connection.

956
00:57:22,304 --> 00:57:24,604
Come by my ashram
tomorrow at noon.

957
00:57:24,672 --> 00:57:27,825
I will show you a Darren
who is completely changed.

958
00:57:27,892 --> 00:57:29,960
Do you think
he's really changed?

959
00:57:30,028 --> 00:57:32,129
I mean, he can't even play
in front of his own mother.

960
00:57:32,297 --> 00:57:34,148
She's like
kryptonite to him.

961
00:57:34,216 --> 00:57:37,484
Can't play in front
of his mother?

962
00:57:37,552 --> 00:57:41,022
Hey! I said stay
away from the girl!

963
00:57:41,089 --> 00:57:44,475
Rajneesh, let's make like
a baby and head out.

964
00:57:50,448 --> 00:57:52,450
So you went to see your mother?

965
00:57:52,476 --> 00:57:52,975
Yes.

966
00:57:53,017 --> 00:57:55,619
But did you
stand up to her?

967
00:57:57,539 --> 00:57:59,440
He doesn't have to stand
up to his mother.

968
00:57:59,508 --> 00:58:00,891
Yes, he does!

969
00:58:00,959 --> 00:58:02,693
Not now, Kato.

970
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:06,464
Now, aren't there a few more
steps in your Drama plan?

971
00:58:06,531 --> 00:58:09,216
Yes. Maturity and Action.

972
00:58:09,283 --> 00:58:11,552
Beat it, Rajneesh.

973
00:58:11,619 --> 00:58:14,055
Yes. We did Maturity
and Action.

974
00:58:14,122 --> 00:58:17,875
"M" and "A" spells "ma," and we
went to Buffalo and we saw his ma.

975
00:58:17,942 --> 00:58:19,677
Right. See?

976
00:58:19,745 --> 00:58:22,312
You see, I left 'cause I was scared
that if I didn't win the Stanley Cup,

977
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:23,713
you would leave me.

978
00:58:23,781 --> 00:58:26,500
But I don't care
if you win the Stanley Cup.

979
00:58:28,337 --> 00:58:30,187
Can you forgive me?

980
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:40,698
Of course
I can forgive you.

981
00:58:43,652 --> 00:58:46,337
Stick a fork in them,
they're done.

982
00:58:46,404 --> 00:58:48,255
Champers wishes!

983
00:58:49,624 --> 00:58:52,509
It would be great if you could
stick around for a while.

984
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:56,580
You know, just to make
sure Darren's okay.

985
00:58:56,648 --> 00:58:58,015
Yes, of course. Yeah, business.
Yes, of course.

986
00:58:58,082 --> 00:59:00,451
Would His Holiness staying
on qualify as an extension?

987
00:59:00,519 --> 00:59:03,103
<i>Pants! Sheket Bevakasha!</i>

988
00:59:03,171 --> 00:59:06,707
Because if that were the case,
we would refuse payment.

989
00:59:06,775 --> 00:59:08,041
Of course,
I'll stay, Jane.

990
00:59:08,109 --> 00:59:09,326
<i>Until we get the
call from Oprah.</i>

991
00:59:09,394 --> 00:59:11,879

992

994

Your Holiness? Mark my words,
this shortcut will haunt you.

995

<i>Roanoke is
freaking out...</i>

1111
01:06:00,638 --> 01:06:02,656
What do I do? What do I do?
What do I do?

1112
01:06:02,723 --> 01:06:04,474
No, no! Nothing to see here.

1113
01:06:04,526 --> 01:06:06,226
<i>Our plane is about
to leave for Oprah,</i>

1114
01:06:06,294 --> 01:06:09,463

every dream we've ever had.

1115
01:06:10,548 --> 01:06:13,199
I am not going

Oh, no! No!

1117
01:06:15,737 --> 01:06:20,708
If you don't get on that plane,
I will take 60% of the ashram!

1118

Fine. I don't need

I was put on this earth to spread

Give me that ticket!
Give me it!

No! Please, no!

Baby, are you all right?

1130
01:07:05,171 --> 01:07:08,105
I can't play in
front of you, Ma!

1131
01:07:08,173 --> 01:07:11,641
It's all my fault for not putting
more pressure on you to succeed.

1132
01:07:16,998 --> 01:07:17,931
Yes.
Hello?

1133
01:07:17,998 --> 01:07:19,666
Jane, I'm on my way.

1134
01:07:19,734 --> 01:07:20,851
I thought you said
he was cured!

1135
01:07:20,919 --> 01:07:22,553
I was wrong.

1136
01:07:22,654 --> 01:07:25,238
Tell Coach Cherkov
to buy some time!

1137
01:07:25,306 --> 01:07:27,491
Okay.

1138
01:07:27,558 --> 01:07:30,544
Sir, please, please make sure
it's locked, sir. Please, over there.

Dell Computers,
this is Chip.

1141
01:07:38,236 --> 01:07:42,322
Rajneesh, I...
Wait a second, who is Chip?

1142
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:43,406
I took another job.

1143
01:07:43,474 --> 01:07:45,909
Rajneesh, you have
to come meet me!

1144
01:07:45,977 --> 01:07:48,061
<i>I must finish
my job with Darren.</i>

1145
01:07:48,129 --> 01:07:49,696
<i>You're back, Babu!</i>

1146
01:07:49,764 --> 01:07:50,630
Yes!

01:07:52,716 --> 01:07:54,817

1148
01:08:00,308 --> 01:08:02,225
Boo! You suck, Bullard!

1149
01:08:02,293 --> 01:08:03,727
No, you suck!

1150
01:08:03,812 --> 01:08:05,395
You can say
bad things about me,

1151
01:08:05,463 --> 01:08:07,998
but I won't say
bad things about myself!

1152
01:08:08,066 --> 01:08:12,235
So, guess what?
You can all just kiss my Canadian ass!

1153
01:08:20,578 --> 01:08:22,279
Cherkov, Pitka's coming.
You...

1154
01:08:22,347 --> 01:08:25,749
Are you as turned on
as I am right now?

1155
01:08:25,816 --> 01:08:28,485
You're a bad, bad person.

1156
01:08:28,553 --> 01:08:31,154
I'll take that as a yes.

1157
01:08:31,222 --> 01:08:33,523
Pitka's coming.
Just stall.

1158
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:37,710
Hey, ref! Time-out!

1159
01:08:37,778 --> 01:08:40,030
<i>Leafs call
their last time-out.</i>

1160
01:08:40,032 --> 01:08:42,566
- Darren?
- Come on, baby.

1161
01:08:42,767 --> 01:08:44,067
Jane!

1162
01:08:44,135 --> 01:08:45,368
You lied to me!

1163
01:08:45,603 --> 01:08:48,972
Yes. I only pulled away
from you because of this.

1164
01:08:51,859 --> 01:08:54,861
My name is
the Guru Pitka,

1165
01:08:54,929 --> 01:08:57,096
and I wear
a chastity belt.

1166
01:08:58,483 --> 01:09:01,384
So, you didn't reject me.

1167
01:09:01,453 --> 01:09:03,687
You're just devoted
to a higher purpose.

1168
01:09:03,755 --> 01:09:05,288
Yes, Jane.

1169
01:09:08,009 --> 01:09:10,426
Superstar, it's me,
Guru Pitka!

1170
01:09:10,494 --> 01:09:12,862
Good luck.
He won't even let me in.

1171
01:09:15,633 --> 01:09:17,968
Mmm-hmm.

1172
01:09:22,907 --> 01:09:27,560
Darren, I took a shortcut
with you, and I'm sorry.

1173
01:09:27,628 --> 01:09:30,130
Now, what is it
you can't face?

1174
01:09:31,065 --> 01:09:32,298
What did you say to me?

1175
01:09:32,366 --> 01:09:35,101
What is it you can't face?

1176
01:09:35,169 --> 01:09:37,136
I can't face my ma.

1177
01:09:37,204 --> 01:09:39,439
Then that's what
you have to face.

1178
01:09:39,506 --> 01:09:41,558
Will you help me?
I can't.

1179
01:09:41,626 --> 01:09:44,727
You're on your own
when it comes to your mother.

1180
01:09:44,795 --> 01:09:48,599
Darren, the only
way out is in.

1181
01:09:51,318 --> 01:09:52,786
Yes, yes, yes, it's good.

1182
01:09:52,854 --> 01:09:56,423
It's good, it's good, it's good,
it's good, it's good.

1183
01:09:56,490 --> 01:09:58,107
What the hell
happened to you?

1184
01:09:58,109 --> 01:10:02,478
Ma! I'm a grown man,
and I can take it from here.

1185
01:10:04,665 --> 01:10:06,083
I love you.

1186
01:10:06,951 --> 01:10:08,885
I love you,
baby boy.

1187
01:10:14,008 --> 01:10:17,343
Now, how long will it take you to get
dressed and get down to the ice?

1188
01:10:17,412 --> 01:10:18,979
Five minutes.
Well, you better hurry up,

1189
01:10:19,046 --> 01:10:21,097
'cause there's only six
minutes left in the game!

1190
01:10:21,165 --> 01:10:24,951
Go, baby boy!
Go, go, go, go, go!

1191
01:10:25,019 --> 01:10:28,371
I think I made a happy
wee-wee. Yeah.

1192
01:10:31,242 --> 01:10:35,912
Come on. Let's go quickly!
Come on. Come, come. Hello?

1193
01:10:35,980 --> 01:10:43,253
Action picks up here in game seven
with only 31 seconds left to go.

1194
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:45,188
Coach, I'm ready.

1195
01:10:45,256 --> 01:10:47,290
Get in there!

1196
01:10:47,358 --> 01:10:49,525
Darren Roanoke
is in the game!

1197
01:10:57,234 --> 01:11:00,953
Hey, Rob Blake. The first thing
they teach you about hockey

1198
01:11:01,021 --> 01:11:03,472
is never ever
watch the puck.

1199
01:11:18,972 --> 01:11:21,391
<i>Roanoke's going
for the Ice Slam!</i>

1200
01:11:22,727 --> 01:11:24,094
Yeah!
Yeah!

1201
01:11:24,161 --> 01:11:28,682
We're all tied up, folks,
with only eight seconds left!

1202
01:11:28,749 --> 01:11:33,753
Seven, six, five, four...
Seven, six, five, four...

1203
01:11:33,821 --> 01:11:35,272
<i>This is it, folks.</i>

1204
01:11:35,298 --> 01:11:38,199
<i>Roanoke on the breakaway,
just him and Grande!</i>

1205
01:11:40,994 --> 01:11:45,098
<i>With one second left!
It's a penalty shot.</i>

1206
01:11:45,165 --> 01:11:47,901
<i>Roanoke could win
the Stanley Cup here.</i>

1207
01:11:48,302 --> 01:11:50,069
Hey!

1208
01:11:50,137 --> 01:11:53,156
Listen, Darren,
I know we are rivals,

1209
01:11:53,224 --> 01:11:57,410
but fate chose
these sides, not us.

1210
01:11:57,478 --> 01:12:01,581
So, before you take this shot,
I just need to say

1211
01:12:04,519 --> 01:12:06,119
damn!

1212
01:12:08,205 --> 01:12:09,806
Show it to me.

1213
01:12:20,801 --> 01:12:23,336
Damn!

1214
01:12:23,404 --> 01:12:30,526
I don't know what Grande just said to
Roanoke, but he is now out to lunch.

1215
01:12:30,594 --> 01:12:33,229
Superstar! What did
he say to you?

1216
01:12:33,297 --> 01:12:35,015
He said, "Damn!"

1217
01:12:35,082 --> 01:12:38,418
"Damn!" Quaking pudding.
That's not good.

1218
01:12:38,485 --> 01:12:39,703
Cherkov, call a time-out.

1219
01:12:39,771 --> 01:12:40,920
We're out of time-outs.

1220
01:12:40,988 --> 01:12:42,122
Just buy us some time.

1221
01:12:42,190 --> 01:12:44,474
He needs a distraction.
Jane, follow me!

1222
01:12:44,542 --> 01:12:46,309
He's gotta take
the shot, now!

1223
01:12:46,377 --> 01:12:49,112
I promised myself
I'd never do this.

1224
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:51,881
Hey, ref! I'm having
a heart attack.

1225
01:12:54,251 --> 01:12:57,237
Out of the way!
Coach! Coach!

1226
01:12:57,638 --> 01:12:59,556
Get the crash kit!

1227
01:12:59,624 --> 01:13:01,992
Sir, may I borrow
your elephant, Lucy?

1228
01:13:02,059 --> 01:13:03,159
Sure.

Come on, Bodhi! Let's go quickly!
Come on, Bodhi!

Uh-oh.

Yes!

1236
01:14:08,142 --> 01:14:09,675

What do you make of this?

1246

I think they're
doing it, Trent.

I think they're
doing it hard.

Bing-bam-boom, you got a baby pachyderm.
Back to you, Trent.

1253

Now, what happens if you
don't score this goal?

1254
