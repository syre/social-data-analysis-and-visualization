1
00:01:51,042 --> 00:01:52,001
Gentlemen...

2
00:01:54,242 --> 00:01:58,163
On behalf of the business community
in Kiangsu and Anhui

3
00:01:58,323 --> 00:02:01,441
and the 9th Nanyang Revolutionary Army,

4
00:02:01,602 --> 00:02:04,725
I nominate Ch'en Ch'i-mei as Military Governor

5
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:06,480
in charge of the Shanghai garrison.

6
00:02:17,922 --> 00:02:21,878
I'm honoured by my comrades' nomination...

7
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,838
Objection!

8
00:02:27,398 --> 00:02:28,202
I object!

9
00:02:29,281 --> 00:02:31,398
From Hsu Hsi-lin to Ch'iu Chin,

10
00:02:31,998 --> 00:02:34,118
members of the Restoration Society

11
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,079
have sacrificed for the cause.

12
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,438
You're not qualified for the position!

13
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:40,999
Mr. T'ao,

14
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:45,159
to draw a line with Chinese United League

15
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,276
is inappropriate.

16
00:02:46,477 --> 00:02:49,597
This is segregation!

17
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:52,515
You're not up for the task!

18
00:02:58,999 --> 00:02:59,916
T'ao Ch'eng-Chang,

19
00:03:01,276 --> 00:03:04,156
this is counter-revolutionary!

20
00:03:11,637 --> 00:03:13,674
You have no right to label me!

21
00:03:14,036 --> 00:03:14,799
I'm telling you,

22
00:03:14,957 --> 00:03:17,716
even if Sun Yet-sen were here today

23
00:03:17,877 --> 00:03:18,873
it's still unacceptable.

24
00:03:25,974 --> 00:03:31,874
<i>timing resync by:</i>
<b>HAEL</b></i>

25
00:05:55,463 --> 00:05:58,102
Under Emperor Shun-chih,

26
00:05:58,302 --> 00:06:00,542
you needed a pigtail to keep your head.

27
00:06:00,704 --> 00:06:04,223
Business was great back then.

28
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,900
Now, it's the exact opposite,

29
00:06:07,062 --> 00:06:09,584
you'll lose your head if you wear a pigtail.

30
00:06:14,101 --> 00:06:15,623
Recruiting for the New Army!

31
00:06:16,785 --> 00:06:19,701
Join the New Revolutionary Army!

32
00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:21,220
Hurry up and enrol!

33
00:06:21,739 --> 00:06:22,942
Hurry up and enrol!

34
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,662
I repeat,

35
00:06:25,981 --> 00:06:27,500
Join the New Army!

36
00:06:27,661 --> 00:06:28,459
Join the revolution!

37
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:29,662
I'll sign up!

38
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,980
Dr. Sun's position is clear.

39
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:42,497
The Emperor's abdication is a prerequisite.

40
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:45,258
Peiyang Clique's bottom line is equally simple.

41
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:47,259
Yuan Shih-k'ai must become President

42
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:50,778
to counter the Ch'ing court
and force the Emperor to abdicate.

43
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:52,141
Dr. Sun made it clear,

44
00:06:52,938 --> 00:06:55,817
end monarchy, stop the war

45
00:06:55,978 --> 00:06:59,538
set up a republic, anything else is negotiable.

46
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:06,897
I ascended the throne at a young age,

47
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:12,379
during a time of great upheavals,

48
00:07:13,298 --> 00:07:16,736
I understand the will of the people,

49
00:07:17,018 --> 00:07:20,937
that honour and glory of one family

50
00:07:21,217 --> 00:07:23,215
should not come before it.

51
00:07:23,455 --> 00:07:27,493
I wish that people can live on in peace

52
00:07:27,855 --> 00:07:32,336
- among all ethnic groups. - Your Majesty,

53
00:07:32,496 --> 00:07:34,536
- Bringing everyone under one roof
- don't play with that in court.

54
00:07:34,776 --> 00:07:37,134
- To form the Republic of China. - Why not?

55
00:07:38,095 --> 00:07:41,494
The Emperor will step down

56
00:07:41,892 --> 00:07:46,174
and continue to enjoy a monarch's privileges

57
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,254
Don't cry,

58
00:07:47,532 --> 00:07:50,011
and personally experience this new era

59
00:07:50,172 --> 00:07:51,493
because you're the Emperor.

60
00:07:51,653 --> 00:07:53,292
Which can only be great.

61
00:07:53,609 --> 00:07:55,535
So decreed.

62
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:09,771
Thank you, Your Majesty.

63
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:33,007
Though I'm unfit to become President,

64
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:36,168
upon President Sun's recommendation,

65
00:08:36,569 --> 00:08:38,329
and the support of all ethnic groups,

66
00:08:38,928 --> 00:08:41,569
I shall do my best

67
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:45,168
to make the Republic of China strong.

68
00:08:51,171 --> 00:08:52,849
We now live in a republic, no more "long live"...

69
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:55,449
"Joint Harmony" dates back to Chou Dynasty.

70
00:08:55,606 --> 00:08:57,811
According to "Records of the Grand Historian"

71
00:08:57,968 --> 00:09:00,608
during the regency under Dukes Shao and Chou

72
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:07,247
state affairs were discussed
until consensus was reached.

73
00:09:07,726 --> 00:09:08,408
I see.

74
00:09:08,569 --> 00:09:10,487
The Emperor is gone, now we can all have a say.

75
00:09:11,527 --> 00:09:12,608
Forget it!

76
00:09:16,609 --> 00:09:17,445
Tse-tung,

77
00:09:17,967 --> 00:09:20,490
who do you think should be President?

78
00:09:21,007 --> 00:09:22,005
Dr. Sun.

79
00:09:22,727 --> 00:09:24,568
Then why did Yuan get the job?

80
00:09:26,647 --> 00:09:27,765
Because he has guns.

81
00:09:35,766 --> 00:09:37,727
Before Dr. Sun stepped down,

82
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:41,326
he pushed through the Provisional Constitution

83
00:09:42,286 --> 00:09:44,365
which will become the foundation.

84
00:09:45,121 --> 00:09:47,885
A new President won't change the Republic's fate.

85
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:50,965
Party politics is our platform.

86
00:09:51,804 --> 00:09:54,203
We may have conceded a title,

87
00:09:54,525 --> 00:09:57,284
but as long as we win the election,

88
00:09:57,803 --> 00:09:59,123
we can appoint our own cabinet members.

89
00:09:59,123 --> 00:10:01,922
I'm afraid he is too aggressive.

90
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,640
Gentlemen, the Presidency is symbolic,

91
00:10:04,761 --> 00:10:07,764
he can be anybody, or nobody.

92
00:10:09,601 --> 00:10:12,802
We must dismantle one party to build another.

93
00:10:13,283 --> 00:10:15,001
Let's turn the faltering Chinese United League,

94
00:10:15,001 --> 00:10:17,682
whose aim was to overthrow Ch'ing Dynasty,

95
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,523
into Kuomintang, a true nationalist party,

96
00:10:19,523 --> 00:10:22,201
the foremost political party for the Republic.

97
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,317
Sir!

98
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,201
Party politics determines
the polity of the Republic,

99
00:10:41,437 --> 00:10:42,957
you must take it seriously.

100
00:11:22,476 --> 00:11:23,556
Here we are!

101
00:11:31,277 --> 00:11:33,437
Conduct a democratic, non-violent election,

102
00:11:34,237 --> 00:11:35,995
insist on fair competition,

103
00:11:36,314 --> 00:11:38,354
unite the Party!

104
00:11:38,917 --> 00:11:41,196
This is important, remember it well.

105
00:11:41,716 --> 00:11:42,515
I Will.

106
00:11:42,675 --> 00:11:43,432
Thank you.

107
00:11:43,715 --> 00:11:44,914
I won't forget!

108
00:11:48,633 --> 00:11:49,755
- Take care! - Take care!

109
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:52,276
- Take care! - Goodbye!

110
00:11:59,795 --> 00:12:00,755
Chiao-jen!

111
00:12:01,872 --> 00:12:05,193
I fear his thinking is too aggressive...

112
00:12:10,514 --> 00:12:13,231
Chiao-jen!

113
00:12:26,632 --> 00:12:28,352
Chiao-jen!

114
00:12:32,432 --> 00:12:34,071
My mother...

115
00:12:35,913 --> 00:12:39,352
lives on humble means.

116
00:12:42,748 --> 00:12:44,630
- Chiao-jen! - When I die...

117
00:12:46,309 --> 00:12:47,789
I count on you...

118
00:12:50,909 --> 00:12:52,630
to look after her.

119
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:55,911
Chiao-jen!

120
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:04,227
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

121
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,827
Hang in there!

122
00:13:07,986 --> 00:13:09,308
Hang in there, Chiao-jen!

123
00:13:10,147 --> 00:13:12,309
- Hang in there. - Chiao-jen!

124
00:13:12,987 --> 00:13:13,986
Chiao-jen!

125
00:13:16,628 --> 00:13:17,708
Chiao-jen!

126
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:08,182
At dawn on the day of the Sacrificial Rites,

127
00:14:08,424 --> 00:14:12,223
the President changes with officials in attendance

128
00:14:12,383 --> 00:14:16,223
then lights the ceremonial pyre,
offers jade and satin,

129
00:14:16,382 --> 00:14:19,782
offers roast meat, reads first prayer...

130
00:14:20,343 --> 00:14:24,823
Shih-ch'ang, the entire country seems to have

131
00:14:24,982 --> 00:14:26,099
different opinions on the polity.

132
00:14:26,983 --> 00:14:28,819
It's either the Japanese absolute monarchy,

133
00:14:28,982 --> 00:14:30,464
the French parliamentary system,

134
00:14:30,622 --> 00:14:33,181
or the American presidential system.

135
00:14:33,503 --> 00:14:34,745
Which is more suitable for us?

136
00:14:35,462 --> 00:14:37,778
Japanese monarchy is outdated

137
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,619
for a republic like ours.

138
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,743
That's the crux of the problem,

139
00:14:44,344 --> 00:14:47,860
if we keep changing our minds,

140
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:49,900
we'll be neither here nor there.

141
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:51,342
What are you suggesting?

142
00:14:52,619 --> 00:14:55,980
Follow Japan, adopt constitutional monarchy.

143
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,382
Had we persisted initially with that,

144
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,859
China would have been one of the Powers

145
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:05,301
and won't have to be bullied by foreign aggressors.

146
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,136
What about you, Yuan-hung?

147
00:15:09,296 --> 00:15:12,898
Your wish is my command, Your Excellency.

148
00:15:15,938 --> 00:15:19,416
Enough of rhetoric, this is now a Republic.

149
00:15:23,136 --> 00:15:24,057
General Ts'ai!

150
00:15:29,415 --> 00:15:30,176
Ts'ai O!

151
00:15:33,575 --> 00:15:34,497
What are you doing?

152
00:15:35,812 --> 00:15:37,174
Sir, I...

153
00:15:42,896 --> 00:15:44,855
You like that?

154
00:15:45,534 --> 00:15:47,495
I'll send you some later.

155
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:49,937
Thank you.

156
00:15:54,693 --> 00:15:56,935
What comes after the first prayer?

157
00:15:57,975 --> 00:15:59,495
Second and third prayer,

158
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:01,773
then the burning of the sacrificial offerings,

159
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:07,335
and everybody will bow in four directions.

160
00:17:13,489 --> 00:17:16,208
Firstly, allow Japan to inherit

161
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,247
all German interests in Shantung

162
00:17:19,527 --> 00:17:22,807
and agree not to cede or lease Shantung to others.

163
00:17:25,488 --> 00:17:27,888
Secondly, Japanese subjects are permitted

164
00:17:28,045 --> 00:17:32,004
into Southern Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia

165
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:35,125
to engage in commercial,
industrial and mining activities.

166
00:17:36,087 --> 00:17:39,609
The leases on Port Arthur and Dalny,

167
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:42,446
and management of the Antung-Mukden Railway

168
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:45,485
shall be extended by 99 years.

169
00:17:49,008 --> 00:17:50,488
That's daylight robbery!

170
00:17:51,126 --> 00:17:53,964
Prime Minister Okuma must be out of his mind!

171
00:17:54,765 --> 00:17:56,965
Is your Prime Minister out of his mind?

172
00:18:01,725 --> 00:18:03,206
This document...

173
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:05,844
how can you explain to the Western Powers?

174
00:18:16,003 --> 00:18:17,242
This is confidential.

175
00:18:22,485 --> 00:18:25,120
Both parties have a duty to keep it as such.

176
00:18:26,243 --> 00:18:27,239
Sir,

177
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,600
whoever leaks the contents,

178
00:18:31,882 --> 00:18:34,520
regardless of his esteemed position,

179
00:18:35,004 --> 00:18:37,763
will be sanctioned by Japan.

180
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:39,321
Spare me this bullshit!

181
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:44,482
Even Ito Hirobumi dared not threaten me
when he was alive.

182
00:18:45,522 --> 00:18:47,161
Who do you think you are?

183
00:18:50,037 --> 00:18:51,680
Your Excellency,

184
00:18:57,122 --> 00:19:01,521
neither the late Ito-san

185
00:19:02,077 --> 00:19:06,400
nor the Western Powers can save your skin.

186
00:19:06,921 --> 00:19:09,717
Only we can do that.

187
00:19:11,879 --> 00:19:14,880
Don't you want to be Emperor of China?

188
00:19:25,439 --> 00:19:26,796
Have you heard?

189
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,798
Yuan Shih-k'ai accepted Japan's 21 Articles.

190
00:19:28,957 --> 00:19:29,637
He's a traitor!

191
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:32,197
We're organising a protest, hurry...

192
00:19:34,116 --> 00:19:36,477
Let's go, Tse-tung!

193
00:19:39,674 --> 00:19:41,197
The strength of the Western Powers

194
00:19:41,716 --> 00:19:43,677
lies in their ability to tolerate opposition.

195
00:19:44,957 --> 00:19:47,356
In Chu Chih-hsin's

196
00:19:47,518 --> 00:19:49,715
"An Introduction of German Social Revolutionaries"

197
00:19:50,278 --> 00:19:52,115
he mentioned two western philosophers,

198
00:19:52,597 --> 00:19:55,274
by the name of Marx and Engels.

199
00:19:55,436 --> 00:19:56,155
Tu-hsiu!

200
00:19:56,876 --> 00:19:57,793
Excuse me!

201
00:19:59,874 --> 00:20:00,635
What is it?

202
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:01,916
Look!

203
00:20:10,753 --> 00:20:14,835
What Yuan did was treacherous!

204
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:21,394
It's time we go home.

205
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:30,671
I heard you wish to restore monarchy.

206
00:20:32,111 --> 00:20:33,513
Is that true?

207
00:20:35,553 --> 00:20:41,072
Kuo-Chang, you're one of us, I'll level with you.

208
00:20:42,268 --> 00:20:46,511
All founding emperors in history were under 50,

209
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:53,470
I'm almost 60, too old to have this ambition.

210
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:55,791
That's good!

211
00:20:56,432 --> 00:21:00,032
Whoever wants to be Emperor,

212
00:21:00,991 --> 00:21:03,871
will suffer the wrath of the nation.

213
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:13,868
Sir, I must hurry back to Nanking, goodbye!

214
00:21:19,308 --> 00:21:21,869
Having set the polity, with Heaven's mandate

215
00:21:22,188 --> 00:21:25,147
and the will of the people ascends to the throne

216
00:21:25,508 --> 00:21:27,950
and rules.

217
00:21:28,547 --> 00:21:33,271
By virtue of an unanimous vote,
the Representative Assembly of the Republic

218
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:36,385
is in favour of the President

219
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:38,428
in becoming the Emperor of China.

220
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,586
Long live the Emperor!

221
00:21:40,946 --> 00:21:43,708
Long live His Majesty!

222
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:51,224
I'm overwhelmed by your support.

223
00:21:56,265 --> 00:21:58,660
I hear you insist on taking cold baths,

224
00:21:59,183 --> 00:22:01,744
and advocate saving the country with able bodies.

225
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:02,864
I used to.

226
00:22:03,184 --> 00:22:04,064
Not now?

227
00:22:04,785 --> 00:22:06,467
I'm a bit lost.

228
00:22:08,742 --> 00:22:11,223
With a weak country and inept Peiyang government,

229
00:22:11,704 --> 00:22:13,343
able bodies are useless.

230
00:22:13,784 --> 00:22:15,585
Guns and cannons against bows and arrows,

231
00:22:15,902 --> 00:22:17,823
the outcome is obvious.

232
00:22:18,824 --> 00:22:20,262
Look what happened in Shantung.

233
00:22:21,502 --> 00:22:23,105
You have the answer?

234
00:22:23,463 --> 00:22:24,905
Not yet, sir.

235
00:22:25,623 --> 00:22:29,301
Talk is cheap,

236
00:22:29,983 --> 00:22:32,344
finding the way out

237
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:34,861
may take a lifetime,

238
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:37,542
even generations.

239
00:22:37,942 --> 00:22:38,743
Dad!

240
00:22:42,582 --> 00:22:44,022
This is my daughter K'ai-hui,

241
00:22:46,422 --> 00:22:47,620
this is Mao Tse-tung.

242
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:55,821
You're so tall.

243
00:22:56,221 --> 00:22:57,141
I'll go out and play.

244
00:22:58,781 --> 00:23:02,097
The question I ask of you is

245
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,939
what do you really want?

246
00:23:38,377 --> 00:23:40,896
Say goodbye to Feng-hsien!

247
00:23:54,137 --> 00:23:55,857
I wish I could bring you along.

248
00:23:56,497 --> 00:23:57,894
Why don't you?

249
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:10,535
You pretended to support Yuan Shih-k'ai

250
00:24:10,692 --> 00:24:12,374
so he'll let you go to Japan for treatment.

251
00:24:14,694 --> 00:24:18,055
You don't want to arouse suspicion by taking me.

252
00:24:20,895 --> 00:24:24,814
I only want to know, is a Courtesan

253
00:24:24,974 --> 00:24:26,773
really that important?

254
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:38,692
Everyone knows

255
00:24:41,092 --> 00:24:44,451
I'll forsake my country for my beloved.

256
00:24:51,612 --> 00:24:53,333
Without me, who'll take care of you?

257
00:24:56,209 --> 00:24:59,730
Promise me you'll come back alive.

258
00:25:01,891 --> 00:25:03,089
Unfortunately,

259
00:25:04,531 --> 00:25:06,408
I've pledged this body and soul

260
00:25:09,568 --> 00:25:12,770
to my country, not you.

261
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:35,687
Listen, you belong to 400 million Chinese

262
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:38,006
as well as to me, Hsiao Feng-hsien.

263
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,206
I know.

264
00:26:22,684 --> 00:26:25,764
I appeal to all of you

265
00:26:26,242 --> 00:26:29,484
to answer to a call of duty.

266
00:26:30,204 --> 00:26:33,643
Should Yuan refuse to come to his senses,

267
00:26:34,243 --> 00:26:37,686
he will be punished by an army of justice.

268
00:26:38,005 --> 00:26:39,766
An army of justice?

269
00:26:40,484 --> 00:26:41,524
Well said!

270
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,481
But where's your army?

271
00:26:47,282 --> 00:26:49,681
General Ts'ai is here, sir!

272
00:26:52,762 --> 00:26:53,800
Here comes my army!

273
00:26:57,401 --> 00:26:58,839
You look so frail!

274
00:26:59,081 --> 00:27:00,680
- Dr. Sun, I... - Take your time...

275
00:27:01,561 --> 00:27:03,563
Have a seat!

276
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:12,398
Reviving the monarchy is a regression.

277
00:27:12,959 --> 00:27:16,561
It's fatal to China. We must launch an expedition.

278
00:27:45,518 --> 00:27:46,398
Commander-in-chief,

279
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,598
Captain Chu Te of the 6th detachment is here.

280
00:27:50,075 --> 00:27:50,716
Go ahead.

281
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:52,595
Enemy troops defending Mienhuapo

282
00:27:52,757 --> 00:27:56,278
are led by Wu of Peiyang's 6th Brigade.

283
00:27:56,438 --> 00:27:58,679
Take the advance guard off duty,

284
00:27:58,836 --> 00:27:59,837
let them rest.

285
00:27:59,997 --> 00:28:01,995
We'll attack tomorrow at dawn.

286
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:05,277
We must capture Mienhuapo within a day.

287
00:28:05,437 --> 00:28:06,155
Yes, sir!

288
00:28:06,596 --> 00:28:09,917
Bring up all our heavy artillery.

289
00:28:12,634 --> 00:28:15,275
Who the hell is their commander?

290
00:28:16,915 --> 00:28:18,035
Wu P'ei-fu!

291
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,592
Son of a bitch!

292
00:28:57,233 --> 00:28:58,273
What's going on here?

293
00:28:59,232 --> 00:29:03,432
Feng Kuo-Chang and the generals just declared

294
00:29:04,152 --> 00:29:05,511
their opposition to the new polity.

295
00:29:07,353 --> 00:29:10,788
And the Military Governor Lu Jung-t'ing

296
00:29:11,272 --> 00:29:12,710
has declared Kuanghsi independent.

297
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,992
The country is in uproar!

298
00:29:19,432 --> 00:29:22,910
Perhaps we should postpone the accession rites.

299
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,871
It's mere formality.

300
00:29:32,469 --> 00:29:36,148
It now depends on Chen Huan and Ts'ao K'un,

301
00:29:36,391 --> 00:29:40,029
if they can defeat Ts'ai O in Szechuan,

302
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:44,309
we might still have a chance.

303
00:33:57,329 --> 00:34:00,971
Ts'ai is hounding me to my grave...

304
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:06,087
I'd high hopes for you, but you let me down.

305
00:36:07,277 --> 00:36:11,676
Mr. Fan Ching-Sheng, the Minister of Education

306
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,237
will now confer the letters of appointment.

307
00:36:22,877 --> 00:36:25,675
On behalf of the Ministry of Education

308
00:36:25,915 --> 00:36:30,114
and the National Peking University Council,

309
00:36:32,316 --> 00:36:36,757
I appoint Ch'en Tu-hsiu
as Dean of the School of Letters,

310
00:36:41,795 --> 00:36:46,036
Chu Hsi-chu as lecturer in Literature,

311
00:36:48,558 --> 00:36:52,596
Li Ta-Chao as Head Librarian,

312
00:36:55,156 --> 00:36:59,152
and Ku Hung-ming as English Professor.

313
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:08,474
Isn't he the renowned academic?

314
00:37:11,073 --> 00:37:12,352
Why does he dress like that?

315
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:32,868
What's so funny?

316
00:37:36,868 --> 00:37:38,868
I wear my pigtail at the back of my head,

317
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:42,590
those who laugh at me wear it in their hearts.

318
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:50,471
Mine is visible,

319
00:37:50,831 --> 00:37:55,708
yours is not.

320
00:37:58,629 --> 00:38:01,748
Feel free to enjoy it.

321
00:38:46,666 --> 00:38:49,062
How dare you! This is the Senate,

322
00:38:49,224 --> 00:38:51,782
the sacred ground of the Republic.

323
00:38:53,745 --> 00:38:54,903
What sacred ground?

324
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:57,386
Just a bunch of pathetic scholars

325
00:38:57,624 --> 00:38:59,946
who are doomed to fail.

326
00:39:00,103 --> 00:39:02,182
What do you mean, General?

327
00:39:02,344 --> 00:39:04,942
I'm Peiyang's Joint Chief Military Governor,

328
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,183
Chang Hsum is my name.

329
00:39:07,581 --> 00:39:11,543
I'm here to settle the dispute with the Senate,

330
00:39:14,541 --> 00:39:16,344
Understand? I hereby proclaim

331
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,622
effective immediately

332
00:39:18,863 --> 00:39:23,341
this dump is closed, the party is over.

333
00:39:24,422 --> 00:39:25,664
Understand?

334
00:39:25,862 --> 00:39:27,700
The Senate is the Republic's legislative body,

335
00:39:27,902 --> 00:39:29,461
you have no right to close it down.

336
00:39:32,301 --> 00:39:33,380
Listen...

337
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:34,659
I'm not only shutting down

338
00:39:34,822 --> 00:39:37,501
this cackling dump of a Senate,

339
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:41,019
I'm also closing down

340
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,540
your bloody Republic.

341
00:39:47,939 --> 00:39:51,699
Long live Your Majesty!

342
00:39:53,301 --> 00:39:54,620
You may rise.

343
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:56,778
Thank you, Your Majesty.

344
00:39:57,537 --> 00:39:58,620
Your Majesty!

345
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,141
Your Majesty!

346
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:18,935
I'm late, Your Majesty!

347
00:40:21,056 --> 00:40:23,217
You may look up when you speak.

348
00:40:25,576 --> 00:40:29,576
Without Your Majesty, the country is at a loss.

349
00:40:29,977 --> 00:40:31,936
268 years of the glorious Ch'ing Dynasty

350
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:35,738
must not be ended by that Sun Yat-sen.

351
00:40:38,217 --> 00:40:42,695
They bullied you because you're a child.

352
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:49,336
They took advantage of your age.

353
00:40:58,216 --> 00:41:01,494
Alright... I appoint you as my Cabinet Minister

354
00:41:02,053 --> 00:41:04,374
Viceroy of Zhili, Minister of Peiyang,

355
00:41:04,576 --> 00:41:05,856
with the title of First Lord.

356
00:41:07,292 --> 00:41:13,452
Thank you, Your Majesty.

357
00:41:14,892 --> 00:41:18,091
You may run three laps around the Palace.

358
00:41:22,373 --> 00:41:23,972
His Majesty allows you to also fly a kite.

359
00:41:34,733 --> 00:41:35,730
It's flying!

360
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:37,209
Flying...

361
00:41:38,091 --> 00:41:39,092
Your Majesty,

362
00:41:39,809 --> 00:41:40,927
Look!

363
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:47,648
It's airborne!

364
00:42:02,533 --> 00:42:07,248
Don't be scared. This is outrageous!

365
00:42:07,407 --> 00:42:09,967
We still have a proclamation to make...

366
00:42:11,008 --> 00:42:13,329
Don't force him to be Emperor,

367
00:42:15,371 --> 00:42:17,765
we only want to be safe.

368
00:42:18,688 --> 00:42:19,767
Traitor!

369
00:42:20,407 --> 00:42:21,969
I, Tuan Ch'i-jui, Premier of the Republic of China

370
00:42:22,129 --> 00:42:25,487
and Commander-in-Chief of the expedition force,

371
00:42:25,884 --> 00:42:27,928
hereby condemn Chang Hsun and his clique

372
00:42:28,088 --> 00:42:30,767
for forcibly dissolving the Senate,
holding the President hostage

373
00:42:30,767 --> 00:42:34,087
and restoring monarchy.
Such action is contemptible

374
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:36,687
and against the will of the people and Heaven.

375
00:42:37,446 --> 00:42:38,566
I, Tuan Ch'i-jui,

376
00:42:38,765 --> 00:42:41,287
resuming as Premier on President Li's instruction

377
00:42:41,966 --> 00:42:46,087
will lead a punitive expedition
to crush the traitors.

378
00:42:46,525 --> 00:42:48,324
July 2, this 6th year of the Republic.

379
00:42:50,447 --> 00:42:53,085
It's time for us students to take action.

380
00:42:53,242 --> 00:42:54,884
Go to Peking and rally against the restoration.

381
00:42:55,044 --> 00:42:56,122
I don't understand.

382
00:42:56,523 --> 00:42:57,647
About what?

383
00:42:58,285 --> 00:43:00,843
By conceding the presidency to Yuan

384
00:43:01,005 --> 00:43:02,164
the Senate has made a fatal error.

385
00:43:02,281 --> 00:43:03,242
The problem with China

386
00:43:03,404 --> 00:43:05,479
is not just about choosing the wrong President!

387
00:43:06,243 --> 00:43:07,722
Isn't that a reason?

388
00:43:08,364 --> 00:43:11,405
If all fault lies with the head of state,

389
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:13,562
then the problems we had before

390
00:43:13,766 --> 00:43:15,598
were Yuan Shih-k'ai's fault.

391
00:43:15,762 --> 00:43:18,243
But what about the restoration fiasco?

392
00:43:18,403 --> 00:43:20,044
Who should we blame?

393
00:43:26,161 --> 00:43:27,284
What are you getting at?

394
00:43:27,723 --> 00:43:28,840
Today's China

395
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:33,644
cannot be changed by having a
different Emperor or President.

396
00:43:35,842 --> 00:43:38,440
An utmost humiliation!

397
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,520
The Chinese race has been shamed!

398
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:51,918
Republic is a must and demanded by the people.

399
00:43:53,398 --> 00:43:57,722
Yet in a mere six years,

400
00:43:58,195 --> 00:44:00,079
we already have two emperors.

401
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:05,358
Remember, China is a republic,

402
00:44:06,197 --> 00:44:07,917
to have an emperor in a republic

403
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:11,317
is so utterly ironic.

404
00:44:11,637 --> 00:44:15,639
Bravo!

405
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,595
The Republic champions freedom,
equality and philanthropy.

406
00:44:21,279 --> 00:44:22,879
Yet, since the founding of the Republic,

407
00:44:23,036 --> 00:44:25,596
equality has been ignored, freedom trampled on,

408
00:44:25,756 --> 00:44:27,999
philanthropy does not exist.

409
00:44:28,156 --> 00:44:30,996
Lives were lost and blood was shed

410
00:44:31,156 --> 00:44:33,998
in exchange for a republic in name only.

411
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,515
That is intolerable!

412
00:44:36,836 --> 00:44:39,717
Is this the Republic

413
00:44:39,879 --> 00:44:41,954
people have sacrificed for?

414
00:44:42,357 --> 00:44:46,036
It is unacceptable legally and to the Assembly,

415
00:44:46,197 --> 00:44:48,595
and to the 400 million Chinese subjects.

416
00:44:56,475 --> 00:44:59,675
Down with Chang Hsun!

417
00:44:59,837 --> 00:45:02,874
Down with P'u-yi!

418
00:45:03,036 --> 00:45:06,234
Down with Chang Hsun!

419
00:45:06,395 --> 00:45:09,313
Down with P'u-yi!

420
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:13,116
Down with Chang Hsun! Down with P'u-yi!

421
00:45:15,191 --> 00:45:19,716
Despite the 1911 Revolution
and the rallying cry for the Republic,

422
00:45:20,995 --> 00:45:26,591
people still worship Confucius

423
00:45:26,753 --> 00:45:28,953
without learning the essence of democratic freedom.

424
00:45:30,672 --> 00:45:33,634
Looking back over history for the past decades,

425
00:45:34,592 --> 00:45:37,431
each time there's a failed republican movement,

426
00:45:37,631 --> 00:45:39,832
monarchism will make another comeback.

427
00:45:40,272 --> 00:45:43,432
Just like Yuan and Chang's attempts to restore.

428
00:45:44,951 --> 00:45:47,587
Fellow students!

429
00:45:48,031 --> 00:45:53,431
Feudalism and the republic are incompatible.

430
00:45:54,032 --> 00:45:56,748
To keep one, the other must be destroyed.

431
00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:01,470
In order for this country to be strong,

432
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:04,388
we must first remove this ancient burden

433
00:46:04,667 --> 00:46:08,550
from the hearts of the people.

434
00:46:42,708 --> 00:46:46,349
You're shamelessly boastful, Mr. Ch'en.

435
00:46:47,144 --> 00:46:51,022
You praise New Culture and bury the old

436
00:46:51,867 --> 00:46:57,823
and blame all our troubles on Confucianism.

437
00:46:57,986 --> 00:47:02,383
What did Confucius do 2,000 years ago

438
00:47:02,627 --> 00:47:04,583
that is damaging today?

439
00:47:05,344 --> 00:47:07,742
Mr. Ku, as an erudite scholar,

440
00:47:07,904 --> 00:47:11,143
can't you see what Confucius advocated then

441
00:47:11,303 --> 00:47:12,506
is not applicable to us today?

442
00:47:12,904 --> 00:47:15,144
What Confucius taught us

443
00:47:15,302 --> 00:47:17,861
is like arithmetics.

444
00:47:18,146 --> 00:47:21,703
2,000 years ago, 3 x 3 = 9. It still is today.

445
00:47:21,865 --> 00:47:23,505
It will never be 8.

446
00:47:23,743 --> 00:47:26,381
Blaming your miscalculations

447
00:47:26,621 --> 00:47:30,982
on the person who invented arithmetics is absurd.

448
00:47:31,183 --> 00:47:35,626
If you call that New Culture, it's bullshit.

449
00:47:37,581 --> 00:47:40,463
Clearly a talent despite his quibbling!

450
00:47:43,739 --> 00:47:46,618
Culture needs reforms

451
00:47:47,021 --> 00:47:48,742
to keep up with time.

452
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:52,701
Some say classical Chinese is refined

453
00:47:53,099 --> 00:47:56,858
while vernacular Chinese is vulgar.

454
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:00,981
But imperial examination system was harmful.

455
00:48:01,339 --> 00:48:03,657
Even the best written eight-legged essays

456
00:48:03,979 --> 00:48:07,462
were detached from society and impractical.

457
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:11,457
They're useless except in examinations.

458
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,418
Our country needs talents,

459
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:17,938
pragmatism will make us strong.

460
00:48:18,096 --> 00:48:20,461
I represent the Women's College of Education,

461
00:48:20,658 --> 00:48:23,218
I think classical Chinese is more concise.

462
00:48:23,375 --> 00:48:24,339
That's a fact!

463
00:48:24,856 --> 00:48:26,177
Please cite an example.

464
00:48:27,817 --> 00:48:30,659
Take the phrase "unable to do it"

465
00:48:30,816 --> 00:48:33,778
Isn't it more concise in classical Chinese?

466
00:48:34,617 --> 00:48:37,538
That's four words.

467
00:48:37,857 --> 00:48:40,936
You use only three in vernacular Chinese.

468
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:42,175
Such as?

469
00:48:42,737 --> 00:48:44,057
"Can't be done!"

470
00:48:44,975 --> 00:48:47,258
Bravo!

471
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:56,414
Before the 1911 Revolution,
we modelled after Japan.

472
00:48:57,015 --> 00:48:58,932
But it doesn't appear to be working.

473
00:48:59,095 --> 00:49:01,694
Japan's Meiji Restoration was inspired by the West.

474
00:49:02,417 --> 00:49:05,095
Why don't we learn from the teacher
but choose to follow the student?

475
00:49:05,374 --> 00:49:07,975
It's not about Japanese or Americans.

476
00:49:08,134 --> 00:49:10,535
It's a matter of new versus old culture.

477
00:49:10,775 --> 00:49:12,371
To strengthen the country and enlighten its people,

478
00:49:12,534 --> 00:49:15,173
we must abolish the old and popularize the new.

479
00:49:15,574 --> 00:49:19,092
That's how our nation can be re-born.

480
00:49:19,254 --> 00:49:20,534
Who should we learn from?

481
00:49:21,014 --> 00:49:22,810
Whether it's the U.S., France

482
00:49:22,973 --> 00:49:24,896
Japan, or even Russia.

483
00:49:25,054 --> 00:49:27,413
- Learn from whoever can help China.
- Russia?

484
00:49:27,571 --> 00:49:30,532
That's absurd!

485
00:49:30,692 --> 00:49:32,932
The governance of any country in the world

486
00:49:33,254 --> 00:49:36,773
is a way of thinking that stems
from its own culture.

487
00:49:37,052 --> 00:49:38,052
Look at the world,

488
00:49:38,493 --> 00:49:41,129
taking a macro view of the future of humanity,

489
00:49:41,292 --> 00:49:42,452
is not absurd at all.

490
00:49:44,572 --> 00:49:47,972
There's a man in Russia called Lenin,

491
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:51,766
who succeeded with the Bolshevik revolution.

492
00:49:52,529 --> 00:49:53,890
The ideology he introduced

493
00:49:54,051 --> 00:49:56,170
is Marxism from Germany.

494
00:49:56,691 --> 00:49:58,089
What is Bolshevik?

495
00:49:58,652 --> 00:50:01,091
Bolshevik means majority.

496
00:50:01,691 --> 00:50:05,809
What is majority? Peasants and workers.

497
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:09,410
The many millions of oppressed labourers.

498
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:11,970
The success of Russia

499
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:14,131
is a victory for Bolshevism,

500
00:50:14,289 --> 00:50:17,089
common people and the proletariat,

501
00:50:17,249 --> 00:50:19,646
for the first time ever in the history of mankind,

502
00:50:20,049 --> 00:50:22,247
and also the greatest.

503
00:50:22,368 --> 00:50:23,690
Bravo!

504
00:50:26,889 --> 00:50:27,647
Bravo!

505
00:51:01,126 --> 00:51:03,688
Peiyang is up for grabs after Yuan's death.

506
00:51:03,967 --> 00:51:05,725
Tuan Ch'i-jui used Chang Hsun
to get rid of Li Yuan-hung,

507
00:51:05,882 --> 00:51:06,886
then he took out Chang Hsun.

508
00:51:07,041 --> 00:51:08,886
Now he's using Wu P'ei-fu against Dr. Sun.

509
00:51:09,046 --> 00:51:10,286
There's no end to this war.

510
00:51:10,565 --> 00:51:12,965
If this continues, Hu'nan will be in ruins.

511
00:51:13,206 --> 00:51:15,563
What about the Constitutional Protection Movement?

512
00:51:15,725 --> 00:51:17,005
To succeed, Dr. Sun must launch
a northern expedition,

513
00:51:17,165 --> 00:51:19,044
and Hu'nan will bear the brunt.

514
00:51:19,363 --> 00:51:21,243
KMT should be stronger than the Peiyang Clique.

515
00:51:21,487 --> 00:51:22,404
By some distance.

516
00:51:22,567 --> 00:51:24,165
But in-fighting among various factions

517
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,364
makes KMT vulnerable.

518
00:51:26,605 --> 00:51:27,962
What's your view?

519
00:51:28,122 --> 00:51:30,602
Declare Hu'nan autonomous.

520
00:51:37,244 --> 00:51:38,124
Sir...

521
00:51:41,323 --> 00:51:42,164
Sir...

522
00:51:44,361 --> 00:51:47,401
He's in a bad mood, I'm so sorry.

523
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,683
First the south, then the north.

524
00:51:50,279 --> 00:51:53,840
Now it's north against south! There's no end to it!

525
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:57,043
There's no end to this revolution

526
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:01,999
You-jen, what are we missing?

527
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:03,838
Madam, same as before,

528
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,281
no money, no guns, no troops.

529
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:11,837
Fellow students,

530
00:52:11,999 --> 00:52:14,598
I believe France is the hub
of European civilisation,

531
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,358
the standard-bearer of modern revolution,
and a model for global revolution.

532
00:52:17,519 --> 00:52:18,397
Then let's go to France.

533
00:52:18,557 --> 00:52:19,398
But...

534
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,961
to go abroad

535
00:52:22,282 --> 00:52:24,560
we need money.

536
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:26,159
We'll raise it.

537
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:28,559
Let's split up,

538
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:30,635
Peking, Shanghai and Canton.

539
00:52:30,997 --> 00:52:32,876
Tse-tung, where do you want to go?

540
00:52:33,277 --> 00:52:34,158
Peking.

541
00:52:34,879 --> 00:52:35,797
Peking?

542
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:42,116
I can visit Mr. Yang at Peking University.

543
00:53:19,715 --> 00:53:22,237
Which faculty are you from?

544
00:53:23,876 --> 00:53:25,635
My name is Mao Tse-tung, sir, graduate of

545
00:53:25,793 --> 00:53:27,273
First Provincial Normal School of Hu'nan.

546
00:53:27,433 --> 00:53:29,075
I'm visiting, came across your class,

547
00:53:29,235 --> 00:53:30,477
and took the liberty of sitting in.

548
00:53:31,352 --> 00:53:34,274
Mr. Mao, not that I won't let you,

549
00:53:34,432 --> 00:53:36,352
but Peking University has its rules.

550
00:53:36,471 --> 00:53:38,472
I'm a great admirer of yours,

551
00:53:38,634 --> 00:53:40,390
I only wish to sit in for one session.

552
00:53:40,552 --> 00:53:41,953
I'll leave quietly afterwards.

553
00:53:45,276 --> 00:53:45,992
Take a seat.

554
00:53:47,592 --> 00:53:48,390
Thank you.

555
00:53:49,633 --> 00:53:51,351
The university is not a sanctuary,

556
00:53:52,671 --> 00:53:54,553
anyone not properly dressed won't be admitted.

557
00:53:54,713 --> 00:53:56,310
That's the rule here!

558
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:58,032
In any case,

559
00:53:58,434 --> 00:53:59,632
because of Hu Shih's huge reputation

560
00:53:59,792 --> 00:54:01,629
I don't want to miss his lecture.

561
00:54:07,472 --> 00:54:10,395
What brings you to Peking?

562
00:54:11,033 --> 00:54:12,632
To raise money for my alumni to go to France.

563
00:54:15,268 --> 00:54:16,187
Ta-Chao.

564
00:54:16,911 --> 00:54:18,430
This student of mine...

565
00:54:18,628 --> 00:54:19,869
what should we do with him?

566
00:54:20,511 --> 00:54:21,310
You're...

567
00:54:23,788 --> 00:54:25,868
Mr. Li Ta-Chao?

568
00:54:27,829 --> 00:54:29,468
I need an assistant.

569
00:54:30,148 --> 00:54:31,669
Are you willing to work hard?

570
00:54:31,826 --> 00:54:32,829
Absolutely!

571
00:54:32,991 --> 00:54:34,989
I'll do anything anytime.

572
00:54:35,268 --> 00:54:36,348
8 silver dollars a month.

573
00:54:36,508 --> 00:54:37,428
That's plenty.

574
00:54:37,789 --> 00:54:39,387
More than I make as a soldier.

575
00:54:39,547 --> 00:54:40,589
You're a soldier?

576
00:54:42,109 --> 00:54:43,227
Yes, but never went to war.

577
00:55:03,386 --> 00:55:06,465
Close the door, thank you.

578
00:55:18,025 --> 00:55:18,945
You are...

579
00:55:19,146 --> 00:55:20,546
It's me!

580
00:55:26,585 --> 00:55:27,424
K'ai-hui!

581
00:55:46,983 --> 00:55:50,421
Today, we leave for the Paris Peace Conference.

582
00:55:50,582 --> 00:55:53,904
For the first time in 100 years,

583
00:55:54,062 --> 00:55:57,064
China shows up on international stage as a victor.

584
00:55:57,262 --> 00:56:00,584
We won't let our nation down!

585
00:56:00,741 --> 00:56:03,061
Let's brace ourselves

586
00:56:03,421 --> 00:56:05,779
and demand for the return of Shantung.

587
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:08,021
Unite...

588
00:56:08,181 --> 00:56:11,100
and China shall prevail!

589
00:56:11,261 --> 00:56:14,019
Justice shall prevail!

590
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:16,779
Look! Behind us

591
00:56:16,939 --> 00:56:18,380
are 400 million Chinese.

592
00:56:21,261 --> 00:56:22,860
But a weak nation lacks diplomatic clout.

593
00:56:23,822 --> 00:56:27,258
We shall join you in Paris later.

594
00:56:28,781 --> 00:56:30,700
My words carry little weight,

595
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:33,380
but I'll do my best for the Republic.

596
00:56:33,942 --> 00:56:36,940
Unite...

597
00:56:37,097 --> 00:56:39,739
Justice shall prevail!

598
00:56:41,335 --> 00:56:43,698
Sir, I once thought

599
00:56:43,818 --> 00:56:46,579
our nation can be saved by strong mind and body,

600
00:56:46,698 --> 00:56:48,897
or even by Kropotkin's anarchism.

601
00:56:49,377 --> 00:56:51,974
But these solutions now seem superficial.

602
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,656
I read your review on Marxism

603
00:56:54,857 --> 00:56:57,417
I think that is the truth.

604
00:56:57,777 --> 00:57:00,899
My article is a mere glimpse of Marxism.

605
00:57:01,097 --> 00:57:03,216
It's a fraction of what it is about.

606
00:57:03,575 --> 00:57:05,617
You should study "The Communist Manifesto"

607
00:57:05,815 --> 00:57:08,578
and its theory of a proletariat revolution.

608
00:57:09,576 --> 00:57:12,096
That's the truth.

609
00:57:15,054 --> 00:57:16,338
"The Communist Manifesto"

610
00:57:19,534 --> 00:57:22,133
I forgot today is New Year's eve.

611
00:57:22,295 --> 00:57:24,094
Stay for dinner.

612
00:57:25,013 --> 00:57:25,776
Sir!

613
00:57:26,737 --> 00:57:27,735
I still have work to do.

614
00:57:54,292 --> 00:57:55,531
It's dad's prescribed hours!

615
00:57:55,692 --> 00:57:56,852
We can now eat New Year dinner.

616
00:57:57,011 --> 00:57:57,810
Great!

617
00:58:02,289 --> 00:58:04,329
Wipe your hands!

618
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:10,289
Victory of the common people?

619
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:13,648
Didn't Uncle Li write this?

620
00:58:13,892 --> 00:58:17,569
Yes, it's about the Russian revolution.

621
00:58:17,889 --> 00:58:20,409
How is it different?

622
00:58:21,413 --> 00:58:23,973
Most revolutions are led by the elite.

623
00:58:24,369 --> 00:58:26,009
But in Mr. Li's thesis,

624
00:58:26,168 --> 00:58:28,851
Russian revolution is a victory
of the common people.

625
00:58:29,407 --> 00:58:30,570
Common people?

626
00:58:30,768 --> 00:58:32,089
Let's have a drink.

627
00:58:32,850 --> 00:58:34,172
I don't drink.

628
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:36,410
Just one, for the New Year.

629
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:39,731
Alright.

630
00:58:55,167 --> 00:58:56,609
Let's go watch the fireworks.

631
00:58:58,251 --> 00:58:59,730
Hurry up!

632
00:59:00,767 --> 00:59:01,647
Coming...

633
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:57,644
Shantung is the cradle of Chinese civilisation,

634
00:59:57,804 --> 00:59:59,840
great thinkers like Confucius and Mencius

635
01:00:00,004 --> 01:00:01,921
were born in Shantung.

636
01:00:02,081 --> 01:00:03,682
China cannot lose Shantung,

637
01:00:04,286 --> 01:00:09,403
like the West can't be without Jerusalem.

638
01:00:10,884 --> 01:00:15,120
Concerning the problem of Shantung,

639
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:25,401
the governments have already
signed a treaty of 21 Articles.

640
01:00:25,561 --> 01:00:32,440
So it is not necessary to discuss
it in this conference.

641
01:00:32,599 --> 01:00:34,880
At the Paris Peace Conference,

642
01:00:35,078 --> 01:00:36,841
Japan proposed that German concessions in Shantung

643
01:00:36,999 --> 01:00:38,439
should be transferred to them permanently.

644
01:00:39,557 --> 01:00:40,396
As expected.

645
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:41,319
Hu Shih and I

646
01:00:41,476 --> 01:00:43,158
intend to write to President Wilson,

647
01:00:43,318 --> 01:00:44,640
and force him to mediate.

648
01:00:45,437 --> 01:00:47,958
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

649
01:00:50,077 --> 01:00:52,837
That's Yang's student, Mao Tse-tung.

650
01:00:53,597 --> 01:00:55,036
Tse-tung, please come down.

651
01:00:56,075 --> 01:00:58,118
Japan's ambition in China

652
01:00:58,398 --> 01:01:00,756
is clearly a threat to American interests.

653
01:01:00,918 --> 01:01:02,637
Wilson must do something.

654
01:01:02,919 --> 01:01:03,760
Mr. Ch'en,

655
01:01:04,599 --> 01:01:06,038
if Japan refuses to withdraw its troops,

656
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:07,597
will the U.S. send its fleet

657
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,918
to Kiautschou Bay for us?

658
01:01:10,077 --> 01:01:11,359
So Wilson's Fourteen-Points

659
01:01:11,515 --> 01:01:12,396
is bullshit?

660
01:01:12,556 --> 01:01:15,638
He's right. Between Japan and China,

661
01:01:15,795 --> 01:01:17,957
the Powers can only choose to support one.

662
01:01:18,116 --> 01:01:21,038
They have never backed us in the past.

663
01:01:21,394 --> 01:01:22,793
They supported Japan

664
01:01:22,993 --> 01:01:25,153
because they wanted her to contain Russia.

665
01:01:25,316 --> 01:01:27,993
They need to contain Russia now more than ever,

666
01:01:28,395 --> 01:01:29,314
don't they?

667
01:01:35,114 --> 01:01:36,515
Thank you, comrades!

668
01:01:46,151 --> 01:01:46,953
Sending you to Peking

669
01:01:47,115 --> 01:01:49,073
is to raise money,

670
01:01:49,554 --> 01:01:52,952
but you spent your time reading in the library.

671
01:01:53,875 --> 01:01:55,995
He's a genuine bookworm.

672
01:01:57,393 --> 01:01:59,552
We can't go to France without money.

673
01:01:59,715 --> 01:02:01,955
Going back to Hu'nan empty handed

674
01:02:02,112 --> 01:02:03,351
is so humiliating.

675
01:02:10,153 --> 01:02:11,349
A cashier's cheque

676
01:02:13,431 --> 01:02:14,472
for 20,000 silver dollars!

677
01:02:14,751 --> 01:02:15,631
Where did you get this?

678
01:02:16,433 --> 01:02:18,711
Chang Shih-Chao raised it at Mr. Yang's request.

679
01:02:20,473 --> 01:02:21,433
Mao Tse-tung...

680
01:02:21,590 --> 01:02:22,751
You left me speechless!

681
01:02:22,914 --> 01:02:24,271
Do I have to pay it back?

682
01:02:24,869 --> 01:02:25,671
Of course!

683
01:02:26,992 --> 01:02:27,990
I'm going back to Hu'nan tonight

684
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:29,433
to make plans for France.

685
01:02:29,911 --> 01:02:33,273
I need to stay on for a while.

686
01:02:36,231 --> 01:02:37,313
You're not going?

687
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:43,429
Are you courting each other?

688
01:02:44,429 --> 01:02:45,947
I have to go now!

689
01:02:48,308 --> 01:02:49,429
Money!

690
01:02:53,587 --> 01:02:54,787
Do you have to go?

691
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:56,548
I made a promise.

692
01:02:59,389 --> 01:03:00,790
Will you come back?

693
01:03:03,469 --> 01:03:07,266
Of course, the reason why I'm going

694
01:03:08,627 --> 01:03:10,309
is to bring back more advanced learnings.

695
01:03:12,226 --> 01:03:16,268
Mr. Yang is here,

696
01:03:17,466 --> 01:03:18,746
Mr. Li, too,

697
01:03:20,227 --> 01:03:21,225
and...

698
01:03:28,386 --> 01:03:29,545
you.

699
01:03:36,385 --> 01:03:40,302
Before I leave, I want to visit my parents.

700
01:03:41,983 --> 01:03:44,863
If you don't come back,

701
01:03:45,182 --> 01:03:47,022
I'll look for you in France.

702
01:04:24,781 --> 01:04:25,902
Bad news from Paris!

703
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:29,581
We just got word,

704
01:04:29,781 --> 01:04:31,940
the person who signed the loan agreement

705
01:04:32,101 --> 01:04:33,300
with Japan last September

706
01:04:33,459 --> 01:04:35,219
was Chang Tsung-hsiang, our envoy to Japan.

707
01:04:35,501 --> 01:04:36,618
Chang Tsung-hsiang!

708
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:37,939
Traitor!

709
01:04:39,141 --> 01:04:42,021
Something tumultuous is about to happen.

710
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:43,460
Because of the Peace Conference?

711
01:04:43,621 --> 01:04:44,540
Yes!

712
01:04:46,579 --> 01:04:49,220
If we succeed, the nation will rejoice.

713
01:04:49,581 --> 01:04:50,659
If we fail...

714
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:53,099
Nationalism suppressed for centuries

715
01:04:53,256 --> 01:04:54,859
will erupt like a volcano.

716
01:04:56,138 --> 01:04:57,257
What should we do?

717
01:04:58,259 --> 01:05:00,139
Just go with the flow.

718
01:05:03,897 --> 01:05:05,776
We'll turn this world upside down.

719
01:05:09,018 --> 01:05:12,576
Extra! Diplomatic failure in Paris!

720
01:05:12,738 --> 01:05:16,375
Extra! Paris peace talk collapses...

721
01:05:16,894 --> 01:05:17,696
Today,

722
01:05:17,899 --> 01:05:20,695
Japan's conspiracy to take over Shantung

723
01:05:20,858 --> 01:05:22,059
is about to succeed

724
01:05:22,698 --> 01:05:24,576
due to our diplomatic failure.

725
01:05:25,855 --> 01:05:27,858
If Shantung were taken by Japan,

726
01:05:28,216 --> 01:05:30,857
our territorial integrity will be compromised,

727
01:05:32,013 --> 01:05:35,136
and the nation will perish.

728
01:05:37,058 --> 01:05:40,056
What should we do now?

729
01:05:40,697 --> 01:05:43,893
Stage protests at foreign legation.

730
01:05:44,213 --> 01:05:45,415
Calm down!

731
01:05:45,774 --> 01:05:48,135
Don't lose sight of our objective!

732
01:05:48,293 --> 01:05:49,772
We just want to be patriotic.

733
01:05:50,094 --> 01:05:52,172
We're doing this to pressure
the Peiyang government.

734
01:05:52,332 --> 01:05:53,732
Reclaim our sovereignty in Shandong.

735
01:05:55,256 --> 01:05:58,375
All along,

736
01:05:58,533 --> 01:06:01,050
we deluded ourselves into thinking

737
01:06:01,772 --> 01:06:04,414
when the war is over

738
01:06:04,614 --> 01:06:07,093
the Western Powers will help us.

739
01:06:08,014 --> 01:06:08,969
Now we know

740
01:06:09,851 --> 01:06:11,213
we have been betrayed

741
01:06:11,373 --> 01:06:13,652
by the rhetoric of politicians at Versailles,

742
01:06:14,174 --> 01:06:15,054
by the Western Powers

743
01:06:15,211 --> 01:06:18,133
who are too busy carving up Europe to care.

744
01:06:19,333 --> 01:06:20,573
And our government

745
01:06:20,969 --> 01:06:24,333
had wanted to sign this humiliating treaty.

746
01:06:26,012 --> 01:06:31,530
A historic moment is upon us.

747
01:06:44,372 --> 01:06:47,051
Fellow students, take to the streets!

748
01:06:53,129 --> 01:06:56,691
Return Tsingtao!

749
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:59,847
Defend our sovereignty!

750
01:07:00,008 --> 01:07:01,966
Return Tsingtao!

751
01:07:02,128 --> 01:07:03,329
Defend our sovereignty!

752
01:07:03,489 --> 01:07:05,924
Return Tsingtao!

753
01:07:06,124 --> 01:07:08,528
This is Wilson's so-called truth and justice!

754
01:07:08,685 --> 01:07:11,809
The Western Powers betrayed us in Paris.

755
01:07:12,207 --> 01:07:13,568
They betrayed China!

756
01:07:13,726 --> 01:07:15,526
Betrayed 400 million Chinese!

757
01:07:15,686 --> 01:07:17,408
Betrayed truth and justice!

758
01:07:18,165 --> 01:07:20,008
Something so painfully obvious

759
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:22,406
but overlooked by the Peiyang government!

760
01:07:23,128 --> 01:07:24,806
This Peiyang government

761
01:07:25,048 --> 01:07:27,366
that can tolerate such humiliation

762
01:07:27,927 --> 01:07:30,008
is not fit to govern us!

763
01:07:30,287 --> 01:07:32,524
They are Western Powers' accomplices,

764
01:07:32,806 --> 01:07:34,446
running dogs of the Japanese pirates!

765
01:07:34,607 --> 01:07:38,486
In time of crisis, stand up and be counted!

766
01:07:39,206 --> 01:07:42,245
Today, we want an eye for an eye,

767
01:07:42,925 --> 01:07:45,885
a tooth for a tooth!

768
01:07:46,368 --> 01:07:49,605
President Wilson is a scoundrel!

769
01:07:49,966 --> 01:07:51,403
He deceived us!

770
01:07:52,563 --> 01:07:54,004
He insulted us!

771
01:07:54,764 --> 01:07:56,524
He toyed with us!

772
01:07:58,002 --> 01:07:59,483
What should we do now?

773
01:07:59,923 --> 01:08:00,766
Fellow countrymen,

774
01:08:01,167 --> 01:08:04,561
Today, we shall petition President Hsu

775
01:08:05,084 --> 01:08:07,325
and also the Premier.

776
01:08:07,766 --> 01:08:10,603
We want people to know about the Paris conspiracy.

777
01:08:10,802 --> 01:08:13,242
We want them to know our demands.

778
01:08:13,483 --> 01:08:14,480
Whoever it is

779
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:17,401
who tries to wipe us out

780
01:08:17,723 --> 01:08:20,359
will face a bloody battle!

781
01:08:20,643 --> 01:08:21,800
Pay with blood!

782
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:24,320
Fight to the end!

783
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:26,204
Return Tsingtao!

784
01:08:26,362 --> 01:08:27,600
Today's rally

785
01:08:27,762 --> 01:08:31,441
is a harbinger of China's bright future.

786
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:35,361
So, this very moment, this very day...

787
01:08:35,521 --> 01:08:39,283
I'm proud and honoured to be a part of

788
01:08:39,443 --> 01:08:42,960
this unprecedented revolution.

789
01:08:43,518 --> 01:08:46,238
Return our sovereignty!

790
01:08:46,401 --> 01:08:53,320
Punish the traitors!

791
01:09:05,518 --> 01:09:06,477
Students have taken to the streets,

792
01:09:06,599 --> 01:09:07,878
they're heading for the Legation Quarter.

793
01:09:09,358 --> 01:09:11,236
Ignorant, naive and stupid!

794
01:09:11,718 --> 01:09:13,518
Send police to stop them!

795
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:14,558
Yes, sir!

796
01:09:14,717 --> 01:09:17,155
Fight to the end!

797
01:09:17,315 --> 01:09:19,438
Patriotism is not a crime!

798
01:09:19,598 --> 01:09:21,836
Fight to the end!

799
01:09:21,995 --> 01:09:24,079
Patriotism is not a crime!

800
01:09:24,237 --> 01:09:26,475
Fight to the end!

801
01:09:26,917 --> 01:09:27,916
Fellow students!

802
01:09:28,278 --> 01:09:31,718
T'an Ssu-t'ung said
"successful reforms come with bloodshed",

803
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:35,840
So let bloodshed and sacrifice begin with us!

804
01:09:35,997 --> 01:09:41,796
Charge!

805
01:09:44,475 --> 01:09:51,598
Come out!

806
01:09:54,913 --> 01:09:55,837
Young lady!

807
01:09:56,235 --> 01:09:58,154
Take your grievances to the prosecutors!

808
01:09:58,752 --> 01:10:00,634
You've come to the wrong place!

809
01:10:01,753 --> 01:10:06,113
My grievances are beyond the prosecutors!

810
01:10:06,596 --> 01:10:07,755
What do you mean?

811
01:10:10,074 --> 01:10:14,353
I'm pleading for 400 million Chinese.

812
01:10:14,513 --> 01:10:21,114
Come out!

813
01:10:21,271 --> 01:10:22,672
Return Tsingtao!

814
01:10:22,831 --> 01:10:25,390
Hand over the traitors!

815
01:10:25,552 --> 01:10:27,950
Return Tsingtao!

816
01:10:28,151 --> 01:10:30,673
Hand over the traitors!

817
01:10:30,831 --> 01:10:32,350
Return Tsingtao!

818
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:35,432
Hand over the traitors!

819
01:10:36,027 --> 01:10:37,831
Charge!

820
01:10:38,033 --> 01:10:40,752
Charge!

821
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:49,550
Go inside and grab the traitors!

822
01:10:49,711 --> 01:10:52,152
Open up...

823
01:10:52,312 --> 01:10:54,468
Open the door!

824
01:11:18,068 --> 01:11:19,668
We were under siege in Japan,

825
01:11:20,108 --> 01:11:22,227
it's happening here as well!

826
01:11:24,107 --> 01:11:26,628
Don't cry!

827
01:11:27,028 --> 01:11:29,424
Look, Ping-hsiang!

828
01:11:30,064 --> 01:11:32,307
Don't worry, I'm here.

829
01:11:34,788 --> 01:11:35,667
3 Bamboos!

830
01:11:48,663 --> 01:11:50,186
K'uang Hu-Sheng, bravo!

831
01:11:50,785 --> 01:11:57,107
Jump!

832
01:11:57,265 --> 01:11:58,226
Jump inside!

833
01:12:06,385 --> 01:12:07,381
Soldiers!

834
01:12:09,224 --> 01:12:10,467
Teng Chung-hsia, Fang Ho!

835
01:12:12,026 --> 01:12:13,425
Go, Fang Ho!

836
01:12:14,424 --> 01:12:16,064
1...2...3...

837
01:12:17,224 --> 01:12:20,582
1...2...3...

838
01:12:22,422 --> 01:12:25,944
Quiet...

839
01:12:26,103 --> 01:12:28,620
You should be fighting Japanese in Shantung

840
01:12:28,783 --> 01:12:31,901
instead of guarding a traitor's house.

841
01:12:33,462 --> 01:12:35,781
Comrades! Brothers...

842
01:12:36,219 --> 01:12:37,219
We're one family!

843
01:12:37,983 --> 01:12:39,900
I believe we're one family,

844
01:12:40,622 --> 01:12:43,741
Those you're holding off

845
01:12:44,062 --> 01:12:46,660
are your brothers and sisters.

846
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:49,822
Each and every one a patriotic student.

847
01:12:49,982 --> 01:12:52,903
Move aside, let us through!

848
01:12:53,061 --> 01:12:56,583
Protect our territory!

849
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:59,260
Protect our sovereignty!

850
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:01,261
Brothers!

851
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:04,343
Everyone of you is patriotic

852
01:13:04,581 --> 01:13:05,217
Am I right?

853
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:06,181
Yes!

854
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:08,936
Are you Chinese?

855
01:13:09,098 --> 01:13:09,861
Yes!

856
01:13:10,061 --> 01:13:11,777
Then let us through!

857
01:13:11,937 --> 01:13:14,496
Charge!

858
01:13:15,939 --> 01:13:16,739
Students!

859
01:13:16,899 --> 01:13:17,739
Tell me where he is!

860
01:13:17,898 --> 01:13:20,219
Hand over the traitor!

861
01:13:20,378 --> 01:13:22,337
Search the house! Step aside...

862
01:13:22,497 --> 01:13:25,135
Students...

863
01:13:25,658 --> 01:13:27,418
Listen, harbouring traitors

864
01:13:27,576 --> 01:13:29,380
makes you also a traitor of China.

865
01:13:30,338 --> 01:13:31,137
He's here!

866
01:13:33,537 --> 01:13:34,377
Students!

867
01:13:35,977 --> 01:13:37,176
I have nothing to do with it!

868
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:38,257
Where is Chang Tsung-hsiang?

869
01:13:38,418 --> 01:13:39,257
I don't know!

870
01:13:39,414 --> 01:13:40,218
Take him away!

871
01:13:43,776 --> 01:13:44,534
Listen...

872
01:13:44,697 --> 01:13:46,536
This is the desk on which the treaty was signed!

873
01:13:46,817 --> 01:13:54,974
Burn it...

874
01:13:55,132 --> 01:13:56,299
The police are here!

875
01:14:11,534 --> 01:14:13,012
Are you Ts'ao Ju-lin?

876
01:14:13,174 --> 01:14:14,413
No, I am not...

877
01:14:14,572 --> 01:14:15,975
- No? Then who are you? - I'm really nobody,

878
01:14:16,133 --> 01:14:18,292
just a visiting guest.

879
01:14:21,135 --> 01:14:22,653
Where did they go?

880
01:14:22,815 --> 01:14:23,453
They left.

881
01:14:23,611 --> 01:14:25,811
How could you! That's Chang Tsung-hsiang!

882
01:14:25,971 --> 01:14:26,734
After him...

883
01:14:59,331 --> 01:15:00,249
Let me go!

884
01:15:04,089 --> 01:15:06,292
Let me go!

885
01:15:06,971 --> 01:15:08,131
Let me go!

886
01:15:38,326 --> 01:15:40,447
Consider China's 2,000-year-old history,

887
01:15:40,846 --> 01:15:42,127
have you ever heard of

888
01:15:42,486 --> 01:15:44,767
students involved in arson and killing?

889
01:15:45,127 --> 01:15:47,246
They have no choice but to revolt.

890
01:15:48,164 --> 01:15:49,087
Today...

891
01:15:49,327 --> 01:15:52,927
President Hsu has arrested innocent students.

892
01:15:53,085 --> 01:15:56,326
He did it to please our enemies.

893
01:15:56,766 --> 01:15:58,606
As a staff member of the school,

894
01:15:58,606 --> 01:16:00,724
I declare the school will go on strike

895
01:16:00,724 --> 01:16:03,402
until the students are released.

896
01:16:03,562 --> 01:16:06,363
Long live students...

897
01:16:06,482 --> 01:16:09,648
Long live revolution...

898
01:16:30,683 --> 01:16:31,642
What is it?

899
01:16:33,601 --> 01:16:36,241
You wrote "The Spirit of the Chinese People"

900
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,043
and I admired you for it.

901
01:16:40,042 --> 01:16:41,041
Speaking of principles,

902
01:16:41,041 --> 01:16:43,842
you should know our differences with foreigners.

903
01:16:45,282 --> 01:16:46,321
But today,

904
01:16:46,721 --> 01:16:48,439
you wrote in a Japanese-owned newspaper

905
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:51,642
denouncing the students as barbaric mobsters!

906
01:16:53,082 --> 01:16:55,040
What has happened to your principles?

907
01:16:57,439 --> 01:16:59,040
You're siding with the enemy.

908
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:22,318
Students, workers and merchants are all on strike.

909
01:17:22,636 --> 01:17:26,476
Overnight, the whole country is in uproar.

910
01:17:28,037 --> 01:17:30,437
Even soldiers are siding with the students.

911
01:17:30,596 --> 01:17:33,758
This is a crucial moment, no compromise!

912
01:17:33,918 --> 01:17:37,157
We mustn't go against the tide.

913
01:18:33,793 --> 01:18:35,713
Tu-hsiu, what is it?

914
01:18:37,274 --> 01:18:38,591
Have we won already?

915
01:18:39,152 --> 01:18:40,793
Is this time for celebration?

916
01:18:41,593 --> 01:18:42,632
Ridiculous!

917
01:19:15,549 --> 01:19:16,549
Mr. Hu,

918
01:19:17,153 --> 01:19:20,948
are you denouncing Ch'en Tu-hsiu and Li Ta-Chao?

919
01:19:26,031 --> 01:19:27,389
Why not?

920
01:19:28,188 --> 01:19:29,549
You must have a sound argument.

921
01:19:30,188 --> 01:19:34,111
Marx's doctrine is just a theory.

922
01:19:34,583 --> 01:19:35,787
But such a theory

923
01:19:35,867 --> 01:19:38,908
though proven successful in Russia

924
01:19:39,149 --> 01:19:42,228
does not mean it's applicable in China.

925
01:19:43,267 --> 01:19:45,908
We must not act like a parrot

926
01:19:46,068 --> 01:19:48,587
and lose ourselves by following others.

927
01:19:48,747 --> 01:19:50,268
To sit back and talk about theories

928
01:19:50,946 --> 01:19:53,027
without solving the actual problems

929
01:19:54,145 --> 01:19:55,787
is no different from Confucianism.

930
01:19:55,944 --> 01:19:58,745
If this is what New Culture is about,

931
01:19:59,106 --> 01:20:00,627
then it's meaningless.

932
01:20:01,266 --> 01:20:04,865
For Ch'en and Li to model on Russia,

933
01:20:05,507 --> 01:20:09,264
it's not going to solve our problems.

934
01:20:10,066 --> 01:20:11,066
You're wrong, sir.

935
01:20:11,385 --> 01:20:13,584
Confucianism is a feudal code,

936
01:20:13,864 --> 01:20:15,664
Whereas Marx's doctrine is scientific.

937
01:20:15,825 --> 01:20:17,464
You can't compare the two.

938
01:20:37,503 --> 01:20:38,823
Esteemed delegates,

939
01:20:40,024 --> 01:20:45,262
what right do you have to give Shantung to Japan?

940
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:47,301
I am furious.

941
01:20:48,183 --> 01:20:55,742
Chinese people will never forget this painful day.

942
01:21:03,301 --> 01:21:04,781
You wouldn't dare to kill Ch'en Tu-hsiu!

943
01:21:05,341 --> 01:21:07,660
If he dies, there'll be hundreds more like him.

944
01:21:07,903 --> 01:21:10,620
Tell Hsu not to make himself a public enemy.

945
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:12,779
If he still wants to continue as President,

946
01:21:12,942 --> 01:21:14,261
he must release Ch'en Tu-hsiu at once.

947
01:21:37,618 --> 01:21:40,298
You have suffered, Tu-hsiu.

948
01:21:47,216 --> 01:21:50,655
Ch'en Tu-hsiu takes on the burden alone,

949
01:21:51,381 --> 01:21:53,134
and sets an example for us all.

950
01:21:54,695 --> 01:21:58,338
Peking University is proud of him.

951
01:22:00,697 --> 01:22:02,694
Bravo, Mr. Ch'en!

952
01:22:24,335 --> 01:22:25,576
So sorry...

953
01:22:25,735 --> 01:22:27,531
- Over here! - What took you so long?

954
01:22:27,693 --> 01:22:28,974
We got lost!

955
01:22:30,692 --> 01:22:32,014
- Hello! - We'll do the introductions later,

956
01:22:32,174 --> 01:22:33,014
let's get on board.

957
01:22:33,172 --> 01:22:34,330
Come on...

958
01:22:34,775 --> 01:22:35,373
Let's go!

959
01:22:35,652 --> 01:22:36,612
Wait...

960
01:22:38,252 --> 01:22:39,094
I'm thinking...

961
01:22:39,490 --> 01:22:41,292
transplanting the experience of
a foreign revolution

962
01:22:41,891 --> 01:22:43,013
does it really work?

963
01:22:43,211 --> 01:22:44,093
Changed your mind again?

964
01:22:44,253 --> 01:22:46,372
China has much more complex issues,

965
01:22:47,054 --> 01:22:48,294
I'd better stay.

966
01:22:49,332 --> 01:22:51,250
Good luck all... Till we meet again.

967
01:22:57,531 --> 01:22:58,534
Give me some money!

968
01:23:07,690 --> 01:23:08,573
Who is he?

969
01:23:11,133 --> 01:23:12,293
Mao Tse-tung from Hu'nan.

970
01:23:13,292 --> 01:23:14,489
What a shame he's not going!

971
01:23:24,289 --> 01:23:27,049
Why did the Governor shut down the
"Shian Kian Review"?

972
01:23:27,653 --> 01:23:29,049
Because we told the truth.

973
01:23:29,928 --> 01:23:33,092
He's afraid the truth will come out

974
01:23:33,769 --> 01:23:36,008
about Chang Ching-yao being Hu'nan's public enemy.

975
01:23:36,647 --> 01:23:40,088
Workers, peasants and merchants have all suffered.

976
01:23:40,445 --> 01:23:43,369
Fellow workers, Hu'nan will not tolerate Chang!

977
01:23:43,607 --> 01:23:46,288
Hu'nan is finished with him around.

978
01:23:47,408 --> 01:23:50,247
We're only poor workers

979
01:23:50,409 --> 01:23:51,888
we have no say.

980
01:23:52,409 --> 01:23:53,689
How do you write the word "work"?

981
01:23:54,490 --> 01:23:56,288
A vertical stroke between 2 lines.

982
01:23:56,968 --> 01:24:00,287
Yes, heaven above your head
with your feet on the ground.

983
01:24:01,088 --> 01:24:02,646
The words "work" and "man" together

984
01:24:03,047 --> 01:24:04,847
make the word "heaven",

985
01:24:05,405 --> 01:24:07,886
It means the world under heaven.

986
01:24:08,526 --> 01:24:11,645
Workers and peasants will rule the world.

987
01:24:12,245 --> 01:24:15,165
Sounds too good to be true.

988
01:24:16,728 --> 01:24:18,004
This is not my idea,

989
01:24:18,525 --> 01:24:20,325
it belongs to a foreigner called Marx.

990
01:24:20,847 --> 01:24:22,324
This foreigner advocated

991
01:24:22,684 --> 01:24:26,126
equality of all men.

992
01:24:26,762 --> 01:24:28,126
Adopting this theory,

993
01:24:28,245 --> 01:24:31,446
the Russian workers now rule their own country.

994
01:24:31,843 --> 01:24:36,999
Fellow workers, the revolution Marx spoke
of will be universal.

995
01:24:37,405 --> 01:24:41,641
Chinese workers should follow suit.

996
01:24:42,161 --> 01:24:46,281
Overthrow this corrupt and evil government

997
01:24:46,602 --> 01:24:50,403
that bullied and oppressed us.

998
01:24:50,641 --> 01:24:55,400
Yes...

999
01:25:03,161 --> 01:25:05,562
Tse-tung, your telegram.

1000
01:25:13,519 --> 01:25:15,001
Tse-tung...

1001
01:25:19,559 --> 01:25:21,520
the doctor said dad had a stroke,

1002
01:25:21,956 --> 01:25:24,682
he can't talk, he can't hear.

1003
01:25:30,158 --> 01:25:34,879
His health has deteriorated so much in a year...

1004
01:25:36,238 --> 01:25:40,239
Before taken ill,
dad hadn't stopped speaking of you.

1005
01:25:45,478 --> 01:25:46,558
Remember...

1006
01:25:47,597 --> 01:25:49,081
the summer of 1915

1007
01:25:49,317 --> 01:25:51,038
you asked me a question?

1008
01:25:51,839 --> 01:25:52,960
All these years,

1009
01:25:54,079 --> 01:25:56,797
I've been thinking hard.

1010
01:25:58,476 --> 01:25:59,957
I'm close to having an answer.

1011
01:26:03,678 --> 01:26:04,958
But...

1012
01:26:13,275 --> 01:26:14,077
Sir...

1013
01:26:14,237 --> 01:26:15,117
Dad...

1014
01:26:37,793 --> 01:26:39,114
As my wife,

1015
01:26:40,354 --> 01:26:41,593
life will be tough.

1016
01:26:46,115 --> 01:26:47,152
If you're with me,

1017
01:26:48,394 --> 01:26:50,351
you won't enjoy a stable life,

1018
01:26:51,512 --> 01:26:55,273
no bridal gowns, sedan chair or banquet.

1019
01:27:01,994 --> 01:27:03,911
Not even a witness or marriage license.

1020
01:27:24,911 --> 01:27:26,388
I'm willing.

1021
01:27:35,072 --> 01:27:38,347
The Governor wishes to meet your representatives.

1022
01:27:38,550 --> 01:27:39,626
Follow me!

1023
01:27:51,507 --> 01:27:52,029
Let them go!

1024
01:27:52,189 --> 01:27:54,227
You have no right to arrest us!

1025
01:27:54,389 --> 01:27:55,946
What are you doing? Let go!

1026
01:27:56,265 --> 01:27:57,105
What do you want?

1027
01:27:57,269 --> 01:28:00,947
Let go of me!

1028
01:28:05,546 --> 01:28:07,667
Let us out!

1029
01:28:16,305 --> 01:28:17,544
In this world,

1030
01:28:18,028 --> 01:28:19,905
who are the noblest people?

1031
01:28:21,147 --> 01:28:22,345
My answer to that...

1032
01:28:24,547 --> 01:28:26,265
is the working class.

1033
01:28:28,386 --> 01:28:32,464
Food, clothes, and even houses that we live in

1034
01:28:32,625 --> 01:28:35,506
are all created by workers.

1035
01:28:36,145 --> 01:28:37,866
We slave for a living,

1036
01:28:38,345 --> 01:28:41,426
but we're not well fed, clothed or sheltered.

1037
01:28:41,945 --> 01:28:43,265
Is that fair?

1038
01:28:43,425 --> 01:28:44,467
No!

1039
01:28:44,665 --> 01:28:46,905
Of course not!

1040
01:28:47,503 --> 01:28:50,065
That's why we must unite

1041
01:28:50,263 --> 01:28:51,463
and go on strike.

1042
01:28:52,183 --> 01:28:54,025
Confront these bourgeois factory owners

1043
01:28:54,267 --> 01:28:55,625
and show them our strength.

1044
01:28:55,782 --> 01:28:57,665
Reclaim what is rightfully ours.

1045
01:28:59,181 --> 01:29:00,262
Fellow workers,

1046
01:29:00,981 --> 01:29:03,982
in the future

1047
01:29:04,221 --> 01:29:06,420
workers will rule the world.

1048
01:29:07,422 --> 01:29:14,541
Long live workers!

1049
01:29:14,741 --> 01:29:19,141
Release the students!

1050
01:29:19,621 --> 01:29:22,221
Sir, these students haven't eaten in 3 days.

1051
01:29:22,782 --> 01:29:23,781
Who's not eating?

1052
01:29:24,782 --> 01:29:25,901
Let him starve to death!

1053
01:29:26,421 --> 01:29:28,461
He has no one but himself to blame.

1054
01:29:44,658 --> 01:29:46,176
Who wrote this?

1055
01:29:47,581 --> 01:29:48,739
I did.

1056
01:29:51,378 --> 01:29:52,738
These are our latest demands.

1057
01:29:56,259 --> 01:29:59,455
The hunger strike continues until they are met.

1058
01:30:04,857 --> 01:30:07,497
We want books and newspapers.

1059
01:30:07,819 --> 01:30:09,177
- Go ahead. - Yes!

1060
01:30:10,497 --> 01:30:11,614
We want New Year dinner.

1061
01:30:11,776 --> 01:30:16,137
I'll treat all 26 of you to dinner!

1062
01:30:16,698 --> 01:30:17,817
We'll even eat outside.

1063
01:30:17,977 --> 01:30:19,578
The Awakening Society needs a place to study.

1064
01:30:20,577 --> 01:30:21,574
Certainly.

1065
01:30:23,376 --> 01:30:24,373
What's your name?

1066
01:30:27,457 --> 01:30:28,417
Chou En-lai.

1067
01:30:38,457 --> 01:30:39,576
Why did you change your mind?

1068
01:30:39,977 --> 01:30:41,494
Didn't we agree to go on hunger strike?

1069
01:30:41,655 --> 01:30:44,854
Change of tactics.
Let's prepare for a long struggle!

1070
01:30:45,256 --> 01:30:46,173
Let's eat.

1071
01:31:22,212 --> 01:31:23,214
Goodbye!

1072
01:31:24,814 --> 01:31:25,531
Mr. Ch'en!

1073
01:31:28,772 --> 01:31:31,169
"Cops are after you, follow the student, Li Ta-Chao"

1074
01:31:31,567 --> 01:31:32,571
Follow me!

1075
01:31:40,251 --> 01:31:42,690
If you leave Peking while on bail

1076
01:31:43,253 --> 01:31:45,008
and get arrested again,

1077
01:31:45,171 --> 01:31:46,133
it'll be difficult to get out.

1078
01:31:46,290 --> 01:31:47,729
I'll go back to Shanghai.

1079
01:31:52,130 --> 01:31:53,966
Scholars-in-arms are hopeless.

1080
01:31:55,447 --> 01:31:56,690
Don't say that!

1081
01:31:57,926 --> 01:32:00,532
Your arrest has shaken the nation.

1082
01:32:00,809 --> 01:32:02,849
That's as big an honour as you can get!

1083
01:32:07,246 --> 01:32:08,808
What are you studying these days?

1084
01:32:10,608 --> 01:32:11,687
The Russian Revolution.

1085
01:32:17,287 --> 01:32:19,044
Hu Shih was right about you!

1086
01:32:20,009 --> 01:32:23,246
The Russian Revolution is all you care about.

1087
01:32:24,245 --> 01:32:28,405
It's the last resort when all else have failed.

1088
01:32:30,608 --> 01:32:31,523
Now tell me,

1089
01:32:33,486 --> 01:32:36,085
why model after Russia?

1090
01:32:36,365 --> 01:32:38,846
The reason why the Russians succeeded

1091
01:32:39,287 --> 01:32:41,289
was because the Bolsheviks

1092
01:32:41,446 --> 01:32:44,365
united the workers and peasants,

1093
01:32:44,524 --> 01:32:46,683
the broadest social classes.

1094
01:32:47,887 --> 01:32:50,922
To unite the nation, you must first

1095
01:32:51,605 --> 01:32:53,164
unite peasants and workers.

1096
01:32:53,564 --> 01:32:54,647
To unite them,

1097
01:32:55,442 --> 01:32:58,042
China must first have its own Bolshevik.

1098
01:33:00,281 --> 01:33:02,523
Tu-hsiu, when you get to Shanghai,

1099
01:33:02,683 --> 01:33:04,162
that's exactly what you've to do.

1100
01:33:04,403 --> 01:33:07,564
We'll split up, you take the north, I go south,

1101
01:33:07,724 --> 01:33:09,322
form our own political party at once.

1102
01:33:18,363 --> 01:33:19,283
Easy...

1103
01:33:21,082 --> 01:33:22,084
When I get to Shanghai,

1104
01:33:22,284 --> 01:33:24,238
I'll send you your favourite candy.

1105
01:33:24,558 --> 01:33:25,882
You must keep your word!

1106
01:33:29,677 --> 01:33:30,478
Take care!

1107
01:33:31,443 --> 01:33:32,401
Take care!

1108
01:34:10,677 --> 01:34:12,317
We should help China

1109
01:34:12,479 --> 01:34:15,199
build her own Bolshevik Party.

1110
01:34:15,356 --> 01:34:18,640
The committee nominates Maring to assist.

1111
01:34:19,357 --> 01:34:21,916
Excellent, go right away!

1112
01:34:23,638 --> 01:34:25,117
Bravo!

1113
01:34:31,918 --> 01:34:33,314
What does the Shanghai dispatch say?

1114
01:34:35,236 --> 01:34:37,277
Each region should send two delegates
to the congress,

1115
01:34:37,438 --> 01:34:39,155
and the Caucuses in Japan and Europe

1116
01:34:39,314 --> 01:34:40,635
will each send one delegate.

1117
01:34:40,635 --> 01:34:41,756
Peking, Shanghai, Canton,

1118
01:34:41,954 --> 01:34:44,035
Ch'ang-she, Wuhan and Tsinan
will all be represented.

1119
01:34:44,354 --> 01:34:46,393
You and Ch'en Kung-po will represent Canton.

1120
01:34:47,354 --> 01:34:50,236
You two will represent Peking.

1121
01:34:51,035 --> 01:34:51,796
Remember,

1122
01:34:51,956 --> 01:34:54,195
you're there as my personal representative.

1123
01:34:54,553 --> 01:34:55,477
Aren't you attending?

1124
01:34:56,074 --> 01:34:58,116
The Comintern is attaching great importance to it.

1125
01:34:58,393 --> 01:35:00,995
If neither you nor Mr. Ch'en attend,

1126
01:35:01,153 --> 01:35:02,594
what's the point of having the congress?

1127
01:35:04,196 --> 01:35:05,832
Apologise to Comrade Maring for me.

1128
01:35:07,793 --> 01:35:11,236
Students are borrowing more books
for summer vacation.

1129
01:35:11,676 --> 01:35:12,993
I can't leave as Head Librarian.

1130
01:35:13,353 --> 01:35:16,032
I disagree with the Comintern on many issues,

1131
01:35:16,551 --> 01:35:18,714
if we argue during the congress

1132
01:35:19,033 --> 01:35:20,634
there will be no way back.

1133
01:35:20,793 --> 01:35:21,351
I see.

1134
01:35:21,513 --> 01:35:22,391
Remember,

1135
01:35:23,394 --> 01:35:26,434
Ch'en Tu-hsiu and I must act in unanimity.

1136
01:35:26,709 --> 01:35:27,553
I understand.

1137
01:35:44,388 --> 01:35:46,627
This should be enough for a month,

1138
01:35:48,470 --> 01:35:51,028
when you get to Shanghai, spend when you have to.

1139
01:35:53,988 --> 01:35:55,430
Dad left this,

1140
01:35:57,992 --> 01:35:59,073
you have it.

1141
01:36:01,549 --> 01:36:02,589
No, you keep it.

1142
01:36:03,786 --> 01:36:06,309
Don't be late for the congress.

1143
01:36:07,747 --> 01:36:08,631
No!

1144
01:36:09,188 --> 01:36:12,629
Just take it.

1145
01:36:31,144 --> 01:36:32,148
I'm leaving,

1146
01:36:35,385 --> 01:36:36,827
take good care of yourself.

1147
01:37:06,146 --> 01:37:07,785
Let me introduce myself,

1148
01:37:08,223 --> 01:37:09,743
Chang Kuo-t'ao from Peking.

1149
01:37:10,824 --> 01:37:12,625
Liu Jen-ching, also from Peking.

1150
01:37:12,783 --> 01:37:15,144
I'm Li Han-Chun from Shanghai.

1151
01:37:15,626 --> 01:37:16,945
Li Ta from Shanghai.

1152
01:37:17,104 --> 01:37:18,860
Teng En-ming from Tsinan.

1153
01:37:19,341 --> 01:37:20,981
Wang Chin-mei from Tsinan.

1154
01:37:21,621 --> 01:37:22,863
Tung Pi-Wu from Wuhan.

1155
01:37:23,545 --> 01:37:24,941
Ch'en Tan-ch'iu from Wuhan.

1156
01:37:25,742 --> 01:37:27,422
Chou Fo-hai from Japan.

1157
01:37:28,782 --> 01:37:32,024
Pao Hui-Seng, representing Ch'en Tu-hsiu.
Nice to meet you.

1158
01:37:32,141 --> 01:37:34,063
Ho Shu-heng from Chang-sha.

1159
01:37:34,462 --> 01:37:37,462
- This comrade from Chang-sha is...
- Tse-tung,

1160
01:37:38,342 --> 01:37:39,060
it's been a while.

1161
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:40,300
Indeed, Kuo-t'ao.

1162
01:37:41,620 --> 01:37:43,061
My apologies, gentlemen...

1163
01:37:43,223 --> 01:37:44,981
Sorry for being late.

1164
01:37:45,580 --> 01:37:47,460
Hello, everyone.

1165
01:37:48,178 --> 01:37:50,381
I'm Ch'en Kung-po from Canton.

1166
01:37:50,739 --> 01:37:53,698
Who's the lovely lady?

1167
01:37:53,898 --> 01:37:54,456
My wife.

1168
01:37:54,618 --> 01:37:56,379
Greetings, I'm Li Li-Chuang.

1169
01:37:56,541 --> 01:37:58,738
But we can't accommodate a couple...

1170
01:37:58,942 --> 01:37:59,342
I'm sorry...

1171
01:37:59,502 --> 01:38:01,458
We've a room at Tatung Hotel across the street.

1172
01:38:01,618 --> 01:38:02,739
Bringing your spouse to the congress?

1173
01:38:04,098 --> 01:38:04,978
Everyone...

1174
01:38:05,138 --> 01:38:06,737
This is my wife, Wang Hui-w...

1175
01:38:07,339 --> 01:38:09,138
I'm working the reception.

1176
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:10,738
Look for me if you need anything.

1177
01:38:11,541 --> 01:38:14,137
We've all had long trips, get some rest.

1178
01:38:14,419 --> 01:38:15,735
Meet at my brother's place tomorrow.

1179
01:38:15,897 --> 01:38:18,377
106 rue Wantz.

1180
01:38:19,338 --> 01:38:20,259
I'm most honoured

1181
01:38:20,457 --> 01:38:23,019
to represent Ch'en Tu-hsiu and Li Ta-Chao

1182
01:38:23,178 --> 01:38:25,856
to chair the First National Congress.

1183
01:38:26,019 --> 01:38:26,935
Let me introduce to you

1184
01:38:27,816 --> 01:38:28,736
Comrade Maring,

1185
01:38:28,856 --> 01:38:31,217
an observer from Comintern.

1186
01:38:31,656 --> 01:38:33,496
Mao Tse-tung will be our secretary.

1187
01:38:35,855 --> 01:38:38,616
The first item on the agenda

1188
01:38:39,018 --> 01:38:40,135
is to decide on the name of the party.

1189
01:38:40,696 --> 01:38:44,655
Our view regarding the name of the party
is clear-cut.

1190
01:38:45,174 --> 01:38:47,255
From the "The Communist Manifesto",

1191
01:38:47,415 --> 01:38:49,097
we adopt the word "Communist"

1192
01:38:49,457 --> 01:38:51,494
and call it the Chinese Communist Party.

1193
01:38:52,055 --> 01:38:55,253
In his letter to Tse-tung,
Ts'ai Ho-san is also in favour.

1194
01:39:01,174 --> 01:39:05,094
Maring wants to know Li Ta-chao's view.

1195
01:39:10,854 --> 01:39:12,412
Mr. Li's preference is

1196
01:39:13,333 --> 01:39:14,292
Chinese Communist Party.

1197
01:39:14,292 --> 01:39:15,133
I agree.

1198
01:39:15,453 --> 01:39:16,652
Agreed.

1199
01:39:18,333 --> 01:39:22,893
Agreed.

1200
01:39:24,732 --> 01:39:25,774
Unanimously passed.

1201
01:39:42,452 --> 01:39:43,133
Rickshaw-man,

1202
01:39:44,170 --> 01:39:46,011
Tung Fang Hotel on Nanking Road.

1203
01:39:46,172 --> 01:39:48,290
Let's go to Palace Hotel instead.

1204
01:39:48,490 --> 01:39:50,212
We're switching hotels?

1205
01:39:50,372 --> 01:39:51,530
We're being followed.

1206
01:39:51,932 --> 01:39:53,449
Be careful, don't look around.

1207
01:39:53,892 --> 01:39:55,010
Palace Hotel.

1208
01:39:55,291 --> 01:39:56,091
Got it!

1209
01:40:18,806 --> 01:40:21,130
Is there another exit?

1210
01:40:21,328 --> 01:40:24,090
There's a back entrance for the staff.

1211
01:40:24,288 --> 01:40:26,209
Wait for us there in five minutes.

1212
01:40:26,367 --> 01:40:27,368
Sure!

1213
01:40:33,166 --> 01:40:38,127
Why are we being followed everywhere?

1214
01:40:38,287 --> 01:40:39,250
I'm sorry, sir.

1215
01:40:39,686 --> 01:40:41,248
The first floor is full,

1216
01:40:41,527 --> 01:40:42,604
is the second floor alright?

1217
01:40:43,843 --> 01:40:44,769
Alright!

1218
01:40:58,443 --> 01:40:59,244
Jump!

1219
01:41:13,645 --> 01:41:15,842
Stupid idiots...

1220
01:41:20,682 --> 01:41:21,441
Go look for them!

1221
01:41:21,603 --> 01:41:23,842
Find them in three days or else!

1222
01:41:24,002 --> 01:41:27,003
Sir, my brother is with the Green Gang

1223
01:41:27,322 --> 01:41:29,923
finding someone in Shanghai is a piece of cake.

1224
01:41:33,481 --> 01:41:36,442
The Peking caucus has 13 members,

1225
01:41:36,644 --> 01:41:39,481
including Li Ta-Chao, Chang Kuo-t'ao,

1226
01:41:39,682 --> 01:41:41,481
Lo Zhang-lung, Liu Jen-ch'ing,

1227
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:44,239
Ch'en Te-jung, Teng Chung-hsia,

1228
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:48,239
Kao Chun-yu, Miu Po-ying, Ho Meng-hsiung,

1229
01:41:48,398 --> 01:41:50,959
Chu Wu-shan, Fan Hung-chieh, Wu Ju-ming.

1230
01:41:52,081 --> 01:41:53,522
Heads up, everyone!

1231
01:41:55,359 --> 01:41:56,439
is hereby pronounced
for delegates to comment and discuss.

1232
01:41:56,600 --> 01:41:59,640
is hereby pronounced
for delegates to comment and discuss.

1233
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:03,158
Proletariat must join force
with the revolutionary army

1234
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:05,518
and overthrow the bourgeois regime;

1235
01:42:05,757 --> 01:42:07,439
they must help the working class

1236
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:10,160
until the class system is abolished,

1237
01:42:10,318 --> 01:42:12,277
and until the class struggle has ended.

1238
01:42:12,477 --> 01:42:15,800
Meaning, when class system is finally abolished,

1239
01:42:15,958 --> 01:42:17,637
a proletariat dictatorship will be established.

1240
01:42:18,238 --> 01:42:19,682
Liaise with the Comintern,

1241
01:42:19,916 --> 01:42:21,478
and adopt the Soviet model.

1242
01:42:21,636 --> 01:42:24,358
Unite workers, peasants and soldiers

1243
01:42:24,519 --> 01:42:27,957
and adopt social revolution as our goal.

1244
01:42:28,398 --> 01:42:30,399
Those who accept the Party's platform and policies,

1245
01:42:30,556 --> 01:42:32,317
and willing to be loyal members,

1246
01:42:32,478 --> 01:42:34,001
upon the introduction of a Party member,

1247
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:36,120
regardless of gender and nationality

1248
01:42:36,279 --> 01:42:37,837
can be admitted as Party members

1249
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:39,436
and become our comrades.

1250
01:42:39,834 --> 01:42:41,476
But...

1251
01:42:42,157 --> 01:42:43,838
before their initiation into the Party,

1252
01:42:43,997 --> 01:42:45,558
they must sever all ties

1253
01:42:45,716 --> 01:42:47,398
with other parties and organisations

1254
01:42:47,556 --> 01:42:48,877
whose platforms are contradictory to ours.

1255
01:42:49,236 --> 01:42:50,675
Tomorrow is the last day of the congress,

1256
01:42:50,835 --> 01:42:52,116
the main agenda

1257
01:42:52,274 --> 01:42:54,914
is to adopt the platform
and election of the Central Committee.

1258
01:42:55,076 --> 01:42:56,795
Comrades Maring and Nikolsky

1259
01:42:56,955 --> 01:42:58,673
will attend tomorrow's closing session.

1260
01:43:05,634 --> 01:43:06,476
Rickshaw!

1261
01:43:50,792 --> 01:43:54,391
Sorry, we had to make a detour.

1262
01:43:55,072 --> 01:43:55,870
Is everyone here?

1263
01:43:56,509 --> 01:43:58,310
Chou Fo-hai is in the toilet,

1264
01:43:58,471 --> 01:43:59,270
he'll be right back.

1265
01:43:59,672 --> 01:44:00,547
It's that Chou again!

1266
01:44:01,191 --> 01:44:01,947
Let's not wait.

1267
01:44:03,269 --> 01:44:04,549
The draft platform we tabled yesterday,

1268
01:44:04,991 --> 01:44:07,070
can continue to be discussed now.

1269
01:44:07,632 --> 01:44:08,348
I have a comment.

1270
01:44:09,029 --> 01:44:10,829
Regarding nationality...

1271
01:44:22,550 --> 01:44:23,266
Can I help you?

1272
01:44:23,907 --> 01:44:24,668
Looking for someone?

1273
01:44:25,029 --> 01:44:25,709
What do you want?

1274
01:44:27,986 --> 01:44:28,750
Who are you looking for?

1275
01:44:28,909 --> 01:44:30,229
Chairman Wang of the Social League.

1276
01:44:30,827 --> 01:44:32,185
There's no Social League

1277
01:44:32,347 --> 01:44:33,230
or Chairman Wang.

1278
01:44:39,266 --> 01:44:40,426
I'm sorry...

1279
01:44:50,466 --> 01:44:52,466
Maring calls for an immediate recess.

1280
01:44:54,025 --> 01:44:55,306
I agree with Comrade Maring.

1281
01:44:55,587 --> 01:44:56,585
Let's adjourne.

1282
01:45:12,305 --> 01:45:14,504
This is my home. What are you doing here?

1283
01:45:18,181 --> 01:45:20,545
Why do you organise meeting in your house?

1284
01:45:20,941 --> 01:45:24,705
What meeting? I was entertaining guests.

1285
01:45:24,863 --> 01:45:28,066
That two are from which country?

1286
01:45:28,224 --> 01:45:29,182
Which two?

1287
01:45:29,461 --> 01:45:31,063
The two foreigners.

1288
01:45:31,225 --> 01:45:33,225
They're Dutch.

1289
01:45:38,222 --> 01:45:40,182
Pack up and be ready to move out!

1290
01:45:50,702 --> 01:45:51,463
Sir.

1291
01:45:55,262 --> 01:45:56,740
What do you do for a living?

1292
01:45:57,821 --> 01:45:58,701
Professor.

1293
01:46:00,181 --> 01:46:01,063
Him?

1294
01:46:01,738 --> 01:46:02,741
My colleague.

1295
01:46:03,621 --> 01:46:07,819
Today I can close your house and catch your people.

1296
01:46:08,222 --> 01:46:11,581
Because you are teaching in university,
I'll let you free.

1297
01:46:12,739 --> 01:46:15,460
If not, you will burn yourself.

1298
01:46:16,419 --> 01:46:17,500
I won't.

1299
01:46:31,137 --> 01:46:31,897
How is it?

1300
01:46:33,020 --> 01:46:33,978
It's fine.

1301
01:46:34,259 --> 01:46:35,697
Comrade Maring said we must leave Shanghai.

1302
01:46:36,056 --> 01:46:37,339
I suggest we go to Chiahsing

1303
01:46:37,497 --> 01:46:39,699
rent a boat for the meeting.

1304
01:46:39,857 --> 01:46:41,456
Is Maring coming?

1305
01:46:41,616 --> 01:46:42,654
He's too obvious a target,

1306
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:44,456
for our safety, he's not going.

1307
01:46:44,617 --> 01:46:45,377
Alright!

1308
01:46:45,856 --> 01:46:46,455
What time do we leave?

1309
01:46:46,576 --> 01:46:48,496
There's a train tomorrow at 10:00am.

1310
01:46:49,335 --> 01:46:51,096
Does Ch'en Kung-po know?

1311
01:46:51,254 --> 01:46:52,375
I'll go get him tomorrow morning.

1312
01:46:57,215 --> 01:47:01,097
Are you under surveillance?

1313
01:47:01,296 --> 01:47:03,094
Probably not, it was an accident.

1314
01:47:03,535 --> 01:47:04,536
Let's go home.

1315
01:47:05,293 --> 01:47:06,339
The meeting is not yet over.

1316
01:47:07,617 --> 01:47:10,735
To form a national party with just 50 people,

1317
01:47:10,897 --> 01:47:12,174
this has to be a joke!

1318
01:48:16,293 --> 01:48:17,251
A gun!

1319
01:48:26,930 --> 01:48:27,569
Don't stare!

1320
01:49:47,241 --> 01:49:48,564
Homicide at Tatung Hotel!

1321
01:49:49,162 --> 01:49:50,083
Tatung Hotel?

1322
01:49:52,282 --> 01:49:53,599
That's where Ch'en Kung-po stays!

1323
01:49:58,360 --> 01:50:00,681
Kung-po left for Kwangtung already.

1324
01:50:00,838 --> 01:50:02,280
Yesterday two people died at their hotel.

1325
01:50:02,482 --> 01:50:04,362
His wife was petrified. So they left.

1326
01:50:05,162 --> 01:50:06,560
It was a lovers' suicide pact!

1327
01:50:07,961 --> 01:50:08,960
Cowards!

1328
01:50:10,638 --> 01:50:11,439
Let's go.

1329
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:35,960
Comrades, we have reached the critical hours.

1330
01:50:36,199 --> 01:50:37,520
The last item on the agenda,

1331
01:50:37,959 --> 01:50:39,438
is to elect the Party Central Committee.

1332
01:50:39,958 --> 01:50:41,039
Under democratic principles,

1333
01:50:41,320 --> 01:50:42,397
we shall vote for

1334
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:44,879
members of the Central Committee.

1335
01:50:54,196 --> 01:50:55,557
We should have 13 delegates,

1336
01:50:55,718 --> 01:50:56,957
but only 12 are in attendance.

1337
01:50:58,038 --> 01:50:58,838
After the vote,

1338
01:50:59,074 --> 01:51:02,760
Ch'en Tu-hsiu, Chang Kuo-t'ao and Li Ta

1339
01:51:02,914 --> 01:51:04,675
are elected Central Committee members,

1340
01:51:04,957 --> 01:51:07,678
Ch'en Tu-hsiu is named General Secretary.

1341
01:51:08,114 --> 01:51:09,076
Meeting is concluded.

1342
01:51:10,035 --> 01:51:10,755
Comrades,

1343
01:51:11,155 --> 01:51:13,432
I'd like to recite from "The Communist Manifesto"

1344
01:51:13,673 --> 01:51:15,314
to illustrate my thrill and excitement.

1345
01:51:17,874 --> 01:51:20,916
The Communists disdain to conceal

1346
01:51:21,078 --> 01:51:23,438
their aims and views.

1347
01:51:23,955 --> 01:51:25,195
They openly declare

1348
01:51:25,555 --> 01:51:27,995
that their ends can be attained

1349
01:51:28,154 --> 01:51:30,314
only by the forcible overthrow

1350
01:51:30,474 --> 01:51:30,915
of all existing social conditions.

1351
01:51:31,075 --> 01:51:32,435
Let the ruling classes tremble

1352
01:51:32,595 --> 01:51:34,634
at a communist revolution.

1353
01:51:35,157 --> 01:51:38,316
The proletarians have nothing to lose
but their chains.

1354
01:51:38,753 --> 01:51:41,313
They have a world to win.

1355
01:51:41,595 --> 01:51:44,111
Proletarians of all countries, unite.

1356
01:51:44,753 --> 01:51:47,435
Proletarians of all countries, unite.

1357
01:51:47,595 --> 01:51:50,236
Proletarians of all countries, unite...

1358
01:51:50,593 --> 01:51:53,434
Proletarians of all countries...

1359
01:51:53,632 --> 01:51:54,633
...unite
