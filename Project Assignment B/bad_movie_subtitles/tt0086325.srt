Once upon a time, there was a

long ago in our very own galaxy..

00:00:58,728 --> 00:01:01,101
Bandit, me and Fred've got a question.

7
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:02,563
BANDIT: What do you and Fred want?

8
00:01:02,647 --> 00:01:04,754
- How come we doing this?
- Why not?

9
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:07,697
- They said it couldn't be done.
- That's the reason.

10
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:09,673
That's good with Fred. We're clear.

11
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,352
Ten-four.

12
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,036
I'm Big Enos Burdette.

[Fast-paced country instrumental music

17
00:01:36,298 --> 00:01:38,588
What we're dealing with here...

18
00:01:38,674 --> 00:01:43,271
is a complete lack of respect for the law.

19

[Fast-paced country instrumental music

22
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:37,294
JUNIOR: Daddy?
BUFORD: Shut up, Junior. I'm thinking.

23
00:02:37,331 --> 00:02:40,620
- What are you thinking about?
- Retiring.

You can all sit down now.

28
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:23,916
I want to thank you
nice ladies and gentlemen...

29
00:03:24,084 --> 00:03:26,623
and my fellow officers...

30
00:03:26,712 --> 00:03:30,661
for coming here this evening
to celebrate the retirement...

31
00:03:30,757 --> 00:03:35,450
of an old friend, Sheriff Buford T. Justice.

32
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:38,921
I think I can truthfully say...

33
00:03:39,013 --> 00:03:41,765
that tonight I feel as if I...

34
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:44,967
were emerging victoriously...

35
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:48,391
from a 35-year war.

36
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:52,270
A war to uphold law and order.

37
00:03:52,307 --> 00:03:54,070
LITTLE ENOS: Daddy, I'm bored.

38
00:03:54,107 --> 00:03:57,079
I'm bored hearing about your boredom.

39
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:00,150
That's why I went to all this trouble.
Now we're going to have fun!

40
00:04:00,186 --> 00:04:03,166
As much fun as putting Ex-Lax
in the Dallas water supply?

41
00:04:03,203 --> 00:04:05,745
Yeah, and then cornering the market
on toilet paper.

42
00:04:05,782 --> 00:04:07,318
More fun than that.

43
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:11,836
And what fond memories
were brought back...

44
00:04:12,621 --> 00:04:16,867
when I saw those 211s, the 502s...

45
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:20,866
and the DWls and the APBs...

46
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:27,007
but most of all, those hot pursuits.

47
00:04:27,044 --> 00:04:30,076
You're going to pee in your pants
watching that county mountie...

48
00:04:30,113 --> 00:04:31,667
hump across six states.

49
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:34,153
I don't think the Sheriff will
buy your plan, frankly.

50
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,959
Trust me, son. If there's one thing
that egomaniac can't refuse...

51
00:04:38,995 --> 00:04:41,147
it's a public challenge.

52
00:04:41,183 --> 00:04:45,775
BUFORD:... that I have marched through
a wave of crime and criminals...

53
00:04:45,812 --> 00:04:49,137
like crap through a moose.

[Snoring]

55
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:56,949
In the '60s, I chased those pimply-faced,
long-haired hippies.

56
00:04:56,985 --> 00:04:58,514
And I caught them.

57
00:04:58,551 --> 00:05:01,242
BUFORD: Then in the '70s, I chased-
BIG ENOS: The Bandit!

58
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:03,994
What about The Bandit?

59
00:05:04,409 --> 00:05:07,577
Yeah, Daddy? What about The Bandit?

60
00:05:07,614 --> 00:05:09,915
Sit down, you tick turd!

61
00:05:12,415 --> 00:05:17,545
I chased that boy for over 3,000 miles.

62
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:19,874
Through 20 states.

63
00:05:19,962 --> 00:05:23,461
- But you didn't catch him.
- So I didn't catch him.

64
00:05:23,549 --> 00:05:27,171
What the hell difference does it make?
But I'll bet-

65
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:29,292
- Okay.
- Okay, what?

66
00:05:29,385 --> 00:05:32,173
- Okay, let's bet.
- What are you talking about?

67
00:05:32,305 --> 00:05:36,550
What we're talking about
is a simple contest, a little race.

68
00:05:36,641 --> 00:05:38,680
And if you win, Sheriff...

69
00:05:38,767 --> 00:05:44,760
we Enoses are going to pony up $250,000.

70
00:05:44,814 --> 00:05:49,107
If you lose, you fork over
that silly symbol...

71
00:05:49,192 --> 00:05:53,216
you've been shoving in people's faces
all these years.

72
00:05:53,362 --> 00:05:55,837
Your badge.

73
00:05:56,781 --> 00:06:02,785
This badge means more to me
than anything else in the world.

74
00:06:02,822 --> 00:06:06,072
And I'd like nothing more
than anything else in the world...

75
00:06:06,109 --> 00:06:07,744
to run you into the ground.

76
00:06:07,831 --> 00:06:10,984
You and that
excuse for a son,

77
00:06:10,985 --> 00:06:14,298
who looks just like
a flea's pecker.

78
00:06:15,712 --> 00:06:19,181
However, I'm going to retire.

79
00:06:19,217 --> 00:06:23,226
I'm going down to Florida
and sit in the sun with my son.

80
00:06:23,263 --> 00:06:27,251
Remember, we're talking about
an awful lot of money here.

81
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:30,741
So if you change your mind,
you know where to reach us.

82
00:06:30,777 --> 00:06:33,640
Thanks, but no thanks.

83
00:06:33,725 --> 00:06:37,590
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
at this very moment...

84
00:06:37,626 --> 00:06:43,407
I proclaim myself retired.

Now you've up and left us

Where are you, Justice
when we need you the most

93
00:07:21,302 --> 00:07:25,064
Some say you're a lunatic
Some say you're a buffoon

Some say you're a fooI
with a gun

95
00:07:28,953 --> 00:07:32,890
Though you stuck to him like glue

96
00:07:32,926 --> 00:07:37,490
Now who'd have thought you'd walk away
before the job was done

Where are you, Justice
when we need you the most

100

You're a hero to your ego
a legend in your own mind

101
00:08:02,847 --> 00:08:06,145
To serve and protect
has been your word

102
00:08:06,335 --> 00:08:10,331
But can you stand to sit it out
when pride is on the line

103
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:14,647
And "What about The Bandit?"
was the last thing that you heard

Where are you, Justice
when we need you the most

108
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:35,473
Just like some old gray race horse,
you've been put to graze

They say you're over the hill now
and you've seen your better days

110

Like that old race horse,
you still hear that bell

111

If a hot chase was heaven
Now the good life is hell

112
00:09:03,732 --> 00:09:07,710
Well, you took on all those outlaws
and the weirdoes with the hair

113
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:11,183
You stood for law and order all the way

Now, you're standing on your records
But does anybody care

115

You're still known as the boob

Daddy, they're taking our picture.

Well, welcome, Sheriff.

What the hell's going on?

134
00:10:39,281 --> 00:10:43,580
These are a few of Daddy's closest friends.
Just came to see you off.

135
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:47,366
Let's cut the crap and get down
to the nitty-gritty.

136
00:10:47,403 --> 00:10:49,642
Well, you're a sporting man, Sheriff.

137
00:10:49,678 --> 00:10:51,992
We're going to bet you $250,000...

138
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:53,909
against your tin star...

139

that you can't drive from here in Miami...

to the Enos Ranch
just outside of Austin, Texas...

by 5:30 tomorrow afternoon.

142

That's only 1,400 miles. What's the catch?

all over the South.

A little respect, Sheriff. That's our logo.

Daddy, what's a logo?

152

Something like a flounder.

That's in the great tradition
of American advertising.

And you got to carry it. Otherwise, no bet.

I get it.

to prison where I'd lose all my friends...

and everything. I mean...

1081
01:19:18,692 --> 01:19:21,915
you could give me a five-second head start
and chase after me-

Oh, no, I'm sorry. I'm a law-and-order man.

I got you and I'm gonna keep you.

Yeah, you're right.
I was silly to even think that.

BANDIT: You're too tough for that.
BUFORD: That's right.

JUNIOR: [Voiceover] Now that you've...

1087
01:19:35,722 --> 01:19:39,277
finally caught The Bandit,
you can really retire.

1088
01:19:39,313 --> 01:19:43,661
We can go back to sunny Florida
and you can collect your seashells...

1089
01:19:43,795 --> 01:19:45,502
and you can play shuffleboard.

1090
01:19:45,588 --> 01:19:50,144
And we can even go back
and see that big funny whale jump again.

1091
01:19:50,181 --> 01:19:55,537
But most and best of all, Daddy,
I'll take you fishing with me.

are you doing?

1096
01:20:15,797 --> 01:20:19,961
I was trying to stop
The Bandit from getting away, Daddy.

1097
01:20:20,905 --> 01:20:25,024
I said it before, and I'll say it again:

1098
01:20:25,074 --> 01:20:29,768
There is no way that you
could come from my loins.

1099
01:20:29,911 --> 01:20:34,989

I'm putting a big lump on your mama's head.

I gotta hand it to you. You did it.

- I did it, didn't I?
- You did it!

1103
01:20:47,090 --> 01:20:50,049
I did it! Don't know what
I did, but I did it.
