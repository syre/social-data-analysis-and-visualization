1
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:16,899
<i>Sometimes I wonder...</i>

2
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,808
<i>how I got to be the way I am.</i>

3
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:27,150
<i>Most fathers have big dreams
for their little girls.</i>

4
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:33,984
<i>For me, it was to become a concert pianist.</i>

5
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:42,232
<i>But life never turns out the way we expect.</i>

6
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,831
<i>And when we moved to hong Kong...</i>

7
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,839
<i>everything changed.</i>

8
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:17,795
<i>My father was an important businessman.</i>

9
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:20,464
<i>I never Knew exactly
what he did for a living...</i>

10
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,700
<i>but we always moved around a lot.</i>

11
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,505
<i>For me, home was always where my family was.</i>

12
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,580
Ah.

13
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,647
Hi.

14
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,058
Huh?

15
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:24,068
Ho! Okay.

16
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,017
<i>As the years went by...</i>

17
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:45,579
<i>a new love brought me closer to my father...</i>

18
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:48,957
<i>the art of Wushu.</i>

19
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:57,531
<i>he was very proud.</i>

20
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:11,183
<i>Growing up was like a dream.</i>

21
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,778
<i>But nothing lasts forever.</i>

22
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:23,889
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

23
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:57,986
<i>Balrog.!</i>

24
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,372
<i>- papa.! papa.!
- Chun-Li.!</i>

25
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,951
- Where you going?
- Get off me!

26
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,919
- Let her go.
- Let me go!

27
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:33,257
I love what you've done to your new place.

28
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:36,624
<i>Next time you move, tell me...
I'll bring you a housewarming gift.</i>

29
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,890
Papa!

30
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:43,435
- Let me go!
- Well, well, Balrog. It seems we have a wild one here.

31
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:45,299
Let her go, Bison.

32
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:56,846
Shh. It's okay, my sweet.

33
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:00,612
A gentleman would never harm a schoolgirl.

34
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:04,919
Go.

35
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,459
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

36
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,300
Night-night.

37
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:19,098
<i>Balrog.</i>

38
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:29,009
Chun-Li!

39
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:32,278
<i>No.!</i>

40
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,615
hey! You leave her alone!

41
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:41,286
Get in there!

42
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,980
Thank you very much.

43
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:50,316
Now I remember why no one wanted to play
with you at Juilliard.

44
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,654
- Aren't you so sweet.
- I'm serious.

45
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,092
You always get the flowers.

46
00:09:57,196 --> 00:10:00,097
So how's your mom? Did she come?

47
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:03,600
<i>- No. She's not doing very well.
- Oh.</i>

48
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,762
I'm so sorry.

49
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,375
Oh! I almost forgot.

50
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:13,001
- This came for you.
- Who's it from?

51
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:16,138
I don't know. An admirer maybe?

52
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,793
I wonder what it says.

53
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:31,795
Wow!

54
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:34,661
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah, it is.

55
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:45,299
<i>So, after the concert,
I finally gave him my phone number.</i>

56
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:47,470
I don't know if he'll call but...

57
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,879
- You sure you don't want a ride?
- I'm okay. I like taking the subway.

58
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,575
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Okay. Okay.

59
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,585
- Bye.
- Bye.

60
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,996
<i>The crime rate continues to rise...</i>

61
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,998
<i>in several slum districts
throughout Southeast Asia.</i>

62
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,092
<i>No single group has been identified
for this new wave of violence.</i>

63
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,103
<i>Authorities instead suggest an overlap...</i>

64
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,469
Chun-Li?

65
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,716
Why did you take off your concert dress?

66
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:02,253
I couldn't wear it all the way home.

67
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:04,914
<i>I wanted to see you in it.</i>

68
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:07,288
And I'll bet you took the subway again, huh?

69
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,260
<i>It's dangerous out there, sweetie.</i>

70
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:12,728
Mama...

71
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,732
we can't just change our lives...

72
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:17,394
every time the news tells us so.

73
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:20,472
<i>Just like your father.</i>

74
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:24,339
Always standing up when standing's not easy.

75
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:43,956
<i>Gentlemen, thank you for coming.</i>

76
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:47,794
<i>As the distinguished leaders
of the Shadaloo Investment Corporation...</i>

77
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,800
You're all very important men.

78
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:52,029
And I don't mean to waste your time.

79
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,834
So, a toast.

80
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:59,138
Over the years our networks
have been very useful for each other.

81
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:02,078
We've all been well compensated for it.

82
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:07,278
Unfortunately for you,
that compensation is about to come to an end.

83
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:11,345
<i>I'm taking over Shadaloo
and moving my interests...</i>

84
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,357
into Bangkok.

85
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:17,190
Now, I understand that many of these
territories overlap with neighborhoods...

86
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,890
that, at this moment,
You consider to be your own.

87
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,797
This is no longer true.

88
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:26,565
The sooner you accept this,
the better it'll be.

89
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:37,343
<i>Show your loyalty to me right now...</i>

90
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:40,282
and we'll have no problems.

91
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,354
Slainte.

92
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:58,025
Gentlemen, thank you for your time.

93
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:11,710
- Nobody talks to me like that.
- Who the hell does he think he is?

94
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:13,717
That pig.

95
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,962
Mmm. Mmm-mm.

96
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:43,313
This just came in.

97
00:15:28,724 --> 00:15:30,954
Gangland homicide?

98
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,266
<i>I love this job.</i>

99
00:15:43,972 --> 00:15:45,439
You're the Interpol man?

100
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,941
Yeah. Call me Nash.

101
00:15:48,043 --> 00:15:50,102
Maya Sunee, Bangkok G.H.

102
00:15:50,212 --> 00:15:52,305
New Year's come early?

103
00:15:52,414 --> 00:15:55,645
We got a tip at 6:00 this morning.
Someone wanted us to know this was here.

104
00:15:55,751 --> 00:15:57,651
heads of every crime family.

105
00:15:57,753 --> 00:16:00,187
<i>Signed, sealed and delivered.</i>

106
00:16:00,289 --> 00:16:02,223
<i>Yeah, Last Supper.</i>

107
00:16:02,324 --> 00:16:05,316
And he serves 'em their own heads.

108
00:16:05,427 --> 00:16:08,419
"He"?

109
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:11,363
Tell me something I don't know, Nash.

110
00:16:12,468 --> 00:16:15,232
You just inherited a big problem.

111
00:16:20,392 --> 00:16:22,360
Good morning.

112
00:16:24,863 --> 00:16:26,763
Or is it evening?

113
00:16:27,933 --> 00:16:29,958
She had a piano concert.

114
00:16:30,068 --> 00:16:32,628
From what I've heard,
she was quite well received.

115
00:16:35,974 --> 00:16:38,499
You know, I'm surprised you chose
the landscape setting.

116
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:42,569
<i>I'd have thought of you
as being much more of a big city man.</i>

117
00:16:44,549 --> 00:16:47,245
A prison is a prison, Bison.

118
00:16:47,352 --> 00:16:50,412
No matter what's outside.

119
00:16:50,522 --> 00:16:53,082
Show a prisoner the world, and all he sees...

120
00:16:53,191 --> 00:16:55,716
are the bars on the window.

121
00:16:55,827 --> 00:16:59,126
You needn't be so cynical.

122
00:17:01,032 --> 00:17:03,660
<i>Ahhh. home, sweet home.</i>

123
00:17:03,768 --> 00:17:07,363
- Gorgeous, isn't it?
- So how'd your meeting go?

124
00:17:07,472 --> 00:17:10,100
Very well. Thank you for asking.

125
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:14,736
I'm officially the only surviving
partner of Shadaloo.

126
00:17:18,183 --> 00:17:20,674
Now we move on to
the Bangkok board of directors.

127
00:17:20,785 --> 00:17:23,253
I'll need their contacts for that.

128
00:17:25,323 --> 00:17:28,952
Killing them isn't gonna
get you anywhere, Bison.

129
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,392
I'm not interested in the board.

130
00:17:33,064 --> 00:17:35,294
I'm interested in their families.

131
00:17:46,044 --> 00:17:48,308
Damn you!

132
00:17:48,413 --> 00:17:53,350
Get him more pictures of the girl,
something more upbeat this time.

133
00:17:53,451 --> 00:17:57,751
It's amazing what a man will do
just to see his daughter.

134
00:17:57,856 --> 00:18:00,256
There's one thing I learned in the slums...

135
00:18:00,358 --> 00:18:04,158
When people are hungry,
there's nothing they won't do.

136
00:18:14,806 --> 00:18:16,933
Everyone has a price.

137
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:25,075
<i>With my mother gone,
the path in front of me was empty.</i>

138
00:19:26,711 --> 00:19:30,272
<i>I couldn't help feeling
like I was being led somewhere new.</i>

139
00:19:33,618 --> 00:19:36,883
<i>Was this mysterious scroll a message?</i>

140
00:19:36,988 --> 00:19:39,218
<i>Who was it from?</i>

141
00:19:39,324 --> 00:19:41,224
<i>I had to find out.</i>

142
00:21:55,593 --> 00:21:57,652
Crashing our party?

143
00:21:57,762 --> 00:22:00,253
Get used to it.
We're your new roommates.

144
00:22:00,365 --> 00:22:02,265
<i>Who says we need any?</i>

145
00:22:02,367 --> 00:22:04,426
<i>I've spent the last three years of my life...</i>

146
00:22:04,536 --> 00:22:07,266
chasin' around an organization
called Shadaloo.

147
00:22:07,372 --> 00:22:12,503
- Shadaloo's a myth.
- I wouldn't be in this ashtray if it was.

148
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:15,135
Those bodies piled up in the harbor...

149
00:22:15,246 --> 00:22:17,612
they were the heads of the ruling
crime families of Bangkok, correct?

150
00:22:17,715 --> 00:22:19,239
<i>- Yes.
- Uh-huh. Right?</i>

151
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:22,751
And now they're all dead except for one.

152
00:22:24,556 --> 00:22:27,753
his name's Bison...

153
00:22:27,859 --> 00:22:32,228
and I've tracked him through 11 major cities
on four continents and never come close.

154
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,230
Not once.

155
00:22:34,332 --> 00:22:37,165
This guy walks through the raindrops.

156
00:22:37,268 --> 00:22:42,228
And anybody that's against him
is either dead or on their way.

157
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,535
Now he's the last man standing.

158
00:22:49,714 --> 00:22:52,547
So, where do we start?

159
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:55,915
You don't want a ticket
to this dance, Detective.

160
00:22:57,655 --> 00:23:00,249
You've never even seen me dance.

161
00:23:06,464 --> 00:23:08,864
<i>To find Gen...</i>

162
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:13,131
<i>I was told I had to leave behind
the life I Knew...</i>

163
00:23:13,238 --> 00:23:15,138
<i>even my home...</i>

164
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,368
<i>and all the memories that were so dear to me.</i>

165
00:24:17,335 --> 00:24:19,326
<i>As it was written in the scroll...</i>

166
00:24:19,437 --> 00:24:23,373
<i>I had to forget everything I used to be.</i>

167
00:24:23,474 --> 00:24:27,308
<i>I had to lose myself
to the pulse of the streets.</i>

168
00:24:28,513 --> 00:24:32,677
<i>I had to become one
with the people of Bangkok.</i>

169
00:25:23,101 --> 00:25:25,729
<i>This was all so new to me.</i>

170
00:25:26,904 --> 00:25:30,203
<i>Life was hard on these streets.</i>

171
00:25:30,308 --> 00:25:32,640
<i>Every night was a struggle.</i>

172
00:25:34,412 --> 00:25:37,006
<i>Every meal was a gift.</i>

173
00:25:53,931 --> 00:25:57,526
<i>Day after day, I searched for Gen.</i>

174
00:26:00,438 --> 00:26:05,341
<i>As time went by,
I was getting further and further away...</i>

175
00:26:05,443 --> 00:26:07,570
<i>from all that I ever was.</i>

176
00:26:09,781 --> 00:26:11,874
<i>I felt lost...</i>

177
00:26:11,983 --> 00:26:14,611
<i>chasing a ghost I might never find.</i>

178
00:26:30,701 --> 00:26:33,033
<i>But what I found...</i>

179
00:26:33,137 --> 00:26:35,697
<i>I wasn't prepared for.</i>

180
00:26:35,807 --> 00:26:37,775
<i>Everywhere I looKed...</i>

181
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:40,901
<i>there was crime without punishment.</i>

182
00:26:42,313 --> 00:26:44,213
<i>I wanted to do something.</i>

183
00:26:46,017 --> 00:26:47,609
<i>Anything.</i>

184
00:26:47,718 --> 00:26:50,846
<i>I just didn't Know where to begin.</i>

185
00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:07,396
<i>Who could protect these people?</i>

186
00:27:08,706 --> 00:27:10,867
<i>Who was oppressing them?</i>

187
00:27:23,955 --> 00:27:26,287
Fantastic, isn't it?

188
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:29,826
All these waterfront slums
will soon belong to Shadaloo.

189
00:27:29,927 --> 00:27:33,863
Location, location, location.

190
00:27:33,965 --> 00:27:36,832
This came in from Murmansk.
I think you're gonna like it.

191
00:27:38,769 --> 00:27:40,669
<i>It's the White Rose.</i>

192
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,238
how long has it been? Fifteen years?

193
00:27:46,878 --> 00:27:48,903
Seventeen years...

194
00:27:49,013 --> 00:27:51,948
four months and six days.

195
00:27:54,285 --> 00:27:58,654
Bring the package to Bangkok... safely.

196
00:27:58,756 --> 00:28:00,951
There is no room for error.

197
00:28:01,058 --> 00:28:03,492
I got some bad news too.

198
00:28:03,594 --> 00:28:06,324
The schoolgirl's gone.

199
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:10,696
<i>We think she's in Bangkok.
But don't worry. We'll find her.</i>

200
00:28:45,036 --> 00:28:47,004
Hey!

201
00:29:03,754 --> 00:29:05,915
Hey!

202
00:29:06,023 --> 00:29:09,083
Leave him alone.

203
00:29:10,194 --> 00:29:12,856
It's none of your business, baby.

204
00:30:51,762 --> 00:30:55,323
Where you go, trouble follows.

205
00:30:59,904 --> 00:31:04,364
My name is Gen. Don't worry, Chun-Li.

206
00:31:04,475 --> 00:31:08,377
- How do you know who I am?
- We've been watching you for some time.

207
00:31:08,479 --> 00:31:11,073
I know who took your father.

208
00:31:11,182 --> 00:31:14,447
He's alive? Where is he?

209
00:31:14,552 --> 00:31:17,043
<i>- I'll tell you when you're ready.
- Ready for what?</i>

210
00:31:17,154 --> 00:31:19,452
<i>Ready to put away your anger.</i>

211
00:31:19,557 --> 00:31:23,118
<i>You are the only one who can bring
your father back, and I can help you do it.</i>

212
00:31:23,227 --> 00:31:26,025
But you have to do it my way.

213
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:28,121
Just tell me where he is.

214
00:31:28,232 --> 00:31:30,860
You don't know what you're up against.

215
00:31:30,968 --> 00:31:32,868
Let me show you.

216
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:42,443
<i>These are the slums.</i>

217
00:31:42,546 --> 00:31:44,480
<i>The people are suffering.</i>

218
00:31:44,582 --> 00:31:47,983
<i>The streets are being taken over
by a criminal organization...</i>

219
00:31:48,085 --> 00:31:49,985
called Shadaloo.

220
00:31:50,087 --> 00:31:52,419
I used to be a part of 'em.

221
00:31:52,523 --> 00:31:56,721
When you fight on the side of monsters,
eventually you become one yourself.

222
00:31:56,827 --> 00:32:00,319
That's why I changed, saw the better way.

223
00:32:01,365 --> 00:32:02,832
The Order of the Web.

224
00:32:06,203 --> 00:32:08,603
I created the Order to fight injustice...

225
00:32:08,706 --> 00:32:11,197
<i>to protect the people
who can't fight for themselves.</i>

226
00:32:11,308 --> 00:32:15,267
- What does this have to do with my father?
- Everything.

227
00:32:15,379 --> 00:32:17,870
Your father was a very
well-connected businessman.

228
00:32:17,982 --> 00:32:21,349
his relationships could open any doors
in any country anywhere.

229
00:32:21,452 --> 00:32:23,943
Many people wanted those connections.

230
00:32:24,054 --> 00:32:27,751
People like Bison, the leader of Shadaloo.

231
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,053
My father would never help someone like that.

232
00:32:32,163 --> 00:32:35,132
No? Not even for the safety
of his only daughter?

233
00:32:37,234 --> 00:32:40,692
- What do you want from me?
- I'm giving you a chance to join us...

234
00:32:40,805 --> 00:32:43,968
to become part of the Web, to fight
for something far greater than yourself.

235
00:32:44,074 --> 00:32:47,043
I already know how to fight.

236
00:33:01,358 --> 00:33:02,950
Impress me.

237
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,600
Anger isn't gonna guide you.

238
00:33:11,702 --> 00:33:13,397
Trust me. I know.

239
00:33:24,949 --> 00:33:27,417
- Why are you mad right now?
- Because you're hurting me.

240
00:33:31,355 --> 00:33:34,381
No. You're hurting yourself.

241
00:33:43,901 --> 00:33:45,596
You fight with passion...

242
00:33:46,704 --> 00:33:49,366
but your anger distorts your judgment.

243
00:33:52,309 --> 00:33:54,334
Bison will see right through you.

244
00:34:30,514 --> 00:34:32,744
<i>Believe in your true self.</i>

245
00:34:33,851 --> 00:34:36,217
Look for an innocence beyond the anger.

246
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:44,527
You still got a long way to go.

247
00:34:48,565 --> 00:34:51,966
<i>Bison, the same man who took my father...</i>

248
00:34:52,069 --> 00:34:54,037
<i>was here in Bangkok.</i>

249
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:57,573
<i>I'd never been so close...</i>

250
00:34:57,675 --> 00:35:00,473
<i>and so far away.</i>

251
00:35:00,577 --> 00:35:03,705
<i>I had to research his organization.</i>

252
00:35:03,814 --> 00:35:07,272
<i>I had to find out about Shadaloo.</i>

253
00:35:34,278 --> 00:35:37,247
<i>I must congratulate you all, gentlemen.</i>

254
00:35:37,348 --> 00:35:40,909
You've shown remarkably sound judgment.

255
00:35:41,018 --> 00:35:44,249
Not many municipal governments
would take such a bold stand...

256
00:35:44,355 --> 00:35:48,348
against the criminal elements
of their own population.

257
00:35:48,459 --> 00:35:51,792
People will point to you
long after your time has passed.

258
00:35:53,163 --> 00:35:56,655
<i>And here's the best part...
your debts are now clean.</i>

259
00:36:00,771 --> 00:36:03,137
<i>What about our families?</i>

260
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,401
Your children have been returned.

261
00:36:07,878 --> 00:36:11,837
Mr. Bison thanks you
for your continuing support.

262
00:36:31,468 --> 00:36:34,460
The papers are signed.
The slums are in your hands.

263
00:36:34,571 --> 00:36:38,769
Good girl, Cantana.
I'll handle the Secretary of Commerce.

264
00:36:38,876 --> 00:36:42,437
Looks like somebody's about to own
the Ministry of Commerce.

265
00:36:42,546 --> 00:36:45,276
<i>Nash, I have a source at the port authority.</i>

266
00:36:45,382 --> 00:36:49,648
he said the state just sold the majority share
of the slums to Esperanto Security Company.

267
00:36:49,753 --> 00:36:52,017
<i>Everything from the harbor to the markets.</i>

268
00:36:53,724 --> 00:36:55,658
Of course. It's a front for Shadaloo.

269
00:36:55,759 --> 00:36:59,286
<i>Bison's bringing crime into the neighborhoods
to drive the land value down.</i>

270
00:36:59,396 --> 00:37:02,593
And then he's buying it back up wholesale.

271
00:37:02,699 --> 00:37:06,135
- We gotta move on then.
- Okay, we're on it. Come with me.

272
00:38:07,664 --> 00:38:09,791
Isn't this your old neighborhood?

273
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,095
Old and new.

274
00:38:12,202 --> 00:38:14,727
Home, sweet home.

275
00:38:14,838 --> 00:38:17,238
I'm such a sentimental guy
that I invested in this shit hole.

276
00:38:17,341 --> 00:38:19,901
Though I have to admit,
I got a very nice deal on it.

277
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:21,978
It doesn't look like a nice deal for them.

278
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,070
<i>And I think they want it back.</i>

279
00:38:24,181 --> 00:38:26,081
Too late for that.

280
00:38:26,183 --> 00:38:28,276
Bulldozers come in tomorrow.
And soon after...

281
00:38:28,385 --> 00:38:32,253
beautiful homes for those who can afford it.

282
00:38:32,356 --> 00:38:34,256
I'm making Bangkok a better place.

283
00:38:34,358 --> 00:38:37,885
- They should build me a temple for that.
- Mmm.

284
00:38:50,174 --> 00:38:53,405
<i>Life's about choices, Balrog.</i>

285
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:56,570
<i>I was about his age when I made mine.</i>

286
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,944
<i>And I've never looked back.</i>

287
00:39:07,991 --> 00:39:10,892
<i>Hey, Maya?
I love stakeouts as much as the next guy...</i>

288
00:39:10,994 --> 00:39:12,894
<i>but what the hell are we doing here?</i>

289
00:39:12,996 --> 00:39:14,896
<i>Well, our source says Bison's guy...</i>

290
00:39:14,998 --> 00:39:17,125
<i>should be leaving
for the meet any second now.</i>

291
00:39:20,137 --> 00:39:22,298
Are you sure we're in the right place?

292
00:39:22,406 --> 00:39:25,307
No, I just like the view.

293
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:29,201
Wait. There he is.

294
00:39:30,314 --> 00:39:32,942
Come here.

295
00:40:05,882 --> 00:40:08,180
- That had to be done.
- Yeah, it had to.

296
00:40:10,487 --> 00:40:13,650
<i>There goes the Benz.</i>

297
00:40:13,757 --> 00:40:16,089
<i>Just make sure you don't lose him, Romeo.</i>

298
00:40:16,193 --> 00:40:18,093
Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.

299
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:25,596
Why are we meeting here? We handed over
the slums. What more do you want?

300
00:40:25,702 --> 00:40:28,671
There's a package coming in
on a ship from Murmansk.

301
00:40:28,772 --> 00:40:31,969
We need safe passage and no damn customs.

302
00:40:32,075 --> 00:40:34,339
You're the commerce secretary.

303
00:40:34,444 --> 00:40:37,311
So make it happen.

304
00:40:37,414 --> 00:40:40,406
- I need details.
- It's on the shipping manifest.

305
00:40:40,517 --> 00:40:43,543
<i>The package is called the White Rose.</i>

306
00:40:51,828 --> 00:40:55,093
Only in the dark do all colors become one.

307
00:40:55,198 --> 00:40:58,258
You can't just cope with the darkness...

308
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:01,860
You have to embrace what is without fear.

309
00:41:02,906 --> 00:41:05,534
You have to feel without your senses.

310
00:41:05,642 --> 00:41:08,577
Harness the energy around you.

311
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,141
Well done. Let's eat.

312
00:42:15,879 --> 00:42:19,406
<i>Yo, Maya. You almost done in there?</i>

313
00:42:20,951 --> 00:42:23,977
<i>Hey, it's not my fault you got here early.</i>

314
00:42:27,624 --> 00:42:30,092
So we're going clubbing tonight.

315
00:42:30,193 --> 00:42:33,185
Bison's attache loves
hittin' the nightlife...

316
00:42:33,296 --> 00:42:35,787
and I want to see what she's up to.

317
00:42:35,899 --> 00:42:38,424
Always work with you.

318
00:42:38,535 --> 00:42:42,699
You know, Nash,
if what you say about Bison is true...

319
00:42:42,806 --> 00:42:46,401
waiting and watching his bitch
is not gonna be the way we bring him down.

320
00:42:48,145 --> 00:42:50,045
We should be more aggressive.

321
00:42:50,147 --> 00:42:53,082
Looks like you got that down.

322
00:42:55,185 --> 00:42:58,245
Well, unlike you, I don't lose my man.

323
00:42:58,355 --> 00:43:02,348
And besides,
there's nothing I won't try once.

324
00:43:18,809 --> 00:43:21,175
Do you have any cash? I'm thirsty.

325
00:43:21,278 --> 00:43:24,736
- Are you serious?
- I don't have any money.

326
00:43:26,183 --> 00:43:28,777
You should try hocking those gold handcuffs.

327
00:44:01,585 --> 00:44:04,110
To the boys who have got my back.

328
00:44:04,221 --> 00:44:07,213
Tonight, I've got my own. Enjoy.

329
00:46:51,988 --> 00:46:54,582
Thought I might ask you a few questions.

330
00:47:27,724 --> 00:47:29,749
<i>Tell me about the White Rose.</i>

331
00:47:29,859 --> 00:47:32,692
You must be Daddy's little girl.

332
00:47:35,832 --> 00:47:37,732
Out of order, ladies.

333
00:47:43,473 --> 00:47:45,839
- Cantana.
- I know who your boss is.

334
00:47:51,748 --> 00:47:53,648
- Tell me.
- It's a shipment.

335
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:55,911
Arrives at the end of the month...
the last Friday.

336
00:47:56,019 --> 00:47:59,216
<i>- Where?
- Central Shipyard, Berth 21.</i>

337
00:48:01,891 --> 00:48:05,622
<i>I want you to send Bison a message.</i>

338
00:48:05,729 --> 00:48:09,165
Tell him the schoolgirl's grown up.

339
00:48:09,265 --> 00:48:11,290
<i>This is it.</i>

340
00:48:14,104 --> 00:48:16,732
Nash... Nash, something's going down.

341
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:39,189
<i>hey.!</i>

342
00:49:07,023 --> 00:49:09,457
<i>Interpol.! Freeze.! Stay down.</i>

343
00:49:35,385 --> 00:49:40,152
Are you gonna tell me, or should I guess?

344
00:49:40,256 --> 00:49:42,224
Go ahead and guess.

345
00:50:16,539 --> 00:50:19,064
That is one tough cookie.

346
00:50:19,175 --> 00:50:21,735
She most certainly was.

347
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:26,274
But she'd said enough.

348
00:50:26,382 --> 00:50:28,441
The damage was done.

349
00:50:28,551 --> 00:50:30,519
You think we gotta change the plans?

350
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:36,780
Unfortunately, we do.
Get the insurance policy.

351
00:50:36,892 --> 00:50:38,860
Call Vega.

352
00:50:47,303 --> 00:50:49,294
You broke my heart.

353
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:10,554
<i>- I don't know. Maybe she's an angry stripper.
- Yeah.</i>

354
00:51:10,659 --> 00:51:14,720
An irate pole dancer
not happy with her tips...

355
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:16,730
sets off Armageddon.

356
00:51:16,832 --> 00:51:21,792
<i>- Keep spitballing that, Maya. I love where your head's at.
- All right, Nash.</i>

357
00:51:21,904 --> 00:51:23,804
What do you think it is?

358
00:51:23,906 --> 00:51:28,673
This girl just wiped the floor with some
of the most dangerous players in Bangkok...

359
00:51:28,777 --> 00:51:31,905
and then bails out like
she's got a plane to catch.

360
00:51:32,014 --> 00:51:35,575
She's making a statement.
Now, come on, fellas. Who is this girl?

361
00:51:35,684 --> 00:51:39,711
Does she have priors?
A paper trail? How about a name?

362
00:51:39,822 --> 00:51:42,791
We checked the archives.
Nash, she's off the radar.

363
00:51:44,026 --> 00:51:46,995
We can look at
the closed-circuit security feed.

364
00:51:47,096 --> 00:51:49,530
The front door has a good shot.

365
00:51:59,174 --> 00:52:01,438
hey, thanks.

366
00:52:15,391 --> 00:52:17,359
Mmm-mm.

367
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:24,258
how's aggressive workin' for ya?

368
00:52:24,366 --> 00:52:26,732
Shut up.

369
00:52:26,835 --> 00:52:30,202
<i>- No one's talking.
- No, they won't.</i>

370
00:52:30,306 --> 00:52:32,797
They're protecting her.

371
00:52:34,376 --> 00:52:36,708
You're right.

372
00:52:49,224 --> 00:52:52,751
- Home-cooked.
- Tell me about Bison.

373
00:52:57,032 --> 00:53:00,490
We grew up together.
Like me, he was a criminal...

374
00:53:00,602 --> 00:53:02,661
with no future.

375
00:53:02,771 --> 00:53:04,671
His parents were Irish missionaries...

376
00:53:04,773 --> 00:53:06,832
who died in Thailand when he was very young.

377
00:53:09,678 --> 00:53:12,511
<i>Soon, the boy became very ill.</i>

378
00:53:12,614 --> 00:53:17,051
<i>Where he was, no one cared about the sick.</i>

379
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:20,417
<i>So they left him... to die.</i>

380
00:53:22,191 --> 00:53:24,751
<i>But the child survived.</i>

381
00:53:27,363 --> 00:53:29,490
<i>With each passing year...</i>

382
00:53:29,598 --> 00:53:31,896
<i>he became more and more feared...</i>

383
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,696
<i>and a well-known thief on the streets.</i>

384
00:53:36,605 --> 00:53:39,597
<i>he took what he wanted when he wanted it.</i>

385
00:53:39,708 --> 00:53:43,769
<i>But even that wasn't enough.</i>

386
00:53:43,879 --> 00:53:45,676
<i>He yearned for more.</i>

387
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:54,415
<i>So he went to the dark caves
in the Phang Nga Bay...</i>

388
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:57,253
<i>and brought his new wife.</i>

389
00:54:04,166 --> 00:54:06,225
<i>From ancient tales...</i>

390
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:09,065
<i>he'd heard about the dark forces...</i>

391
00:54:09,171 --> 00:54:11,162
<i>that could free a man from his conscience.</i>

392
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:42,498
<i>he had to transfer
the goodness ofhis soul...</i>

393
00:54:42,604 --> 00:54:45,334
<i>into his unborn daughter.</i>

394
00:55:20,909 --> 00:55:23,810
<i>The transformation was complete.</i>

395
00:55:25,547 --> 00:55:29,039
<i>he had finally rid himself of his conscience.</i>

396
00:55:35,591 --> 00:55:37,582
Now he's home again...

397
00:55:37,693 --> 00:55:40,821
Bangkok, where it all started.

398
00:55:40,929 --> 00:55:44,262
He's making moves on a bigger scale
than I've ever seen before.

399
00:55:44,366 --> 00:55:47,529
Sounds like the perfect time
to take him down and bring my father back.

400
00:55:48,837 --> 00:55:51,965
How's your wrist?

401
00:55:52,074 --> 00:55:54,304
- It's better.
- Good.

402
00:55:54,409 --> 00:55:56,707
You're doing well.

403
00:55:58,914 --> 00:56:01,041
Chun-Li.

404
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:03,083
I've got an important task for you.

405
00:56:03,185 --> 00:56:05,983
Maybe the hardest thing
I'll ever ask you to do.

406
00:56:06,088 --> 00:56:07,988
I want you to go buy groceries for breakfast.

407
00:56:08,090 --> 00:56:12,049
Pawning off all the hard work?

408
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,253
That's the privilege of a teacher.

409
00:56:27,109 --> 00:56:29,509
<i>Get the R.P.G.</i>

410
00:56:59,156 --> 00:57:00,350
Fire the missile!

411
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:06,825
Give me that! I'll do it myself.

412
00:57:16,507 --> 00:57:19,408
Say good night, baby.

413
00:57:26,117 --> 00:57:28,608
Let's go.

414
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:15,189
<i>I called you because
you do my best dirty worK.</i>

415
00:58:15,299 --> 00:58:19,065
Something very important
to me is about to arrive in Bangkok.

416
00:58:20,571 --> 00:58:23,199
And I don't want anything to
interfere with it.

417
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:27,477
There is a schoolgirl
that needs taking care of.

418
00:58:27,578 --> 00:58:30,342
<i>What kind of schoolgirl are we talking about?</i>

419
00:58:30,448 --> 00:58:33,542
She is a problem child.

420
00:58:39,657 --> 00:58:41,750
Well, well, well.

421
00:58:41,859 --> 00:58:44,726
She'll never be a problem again.

422
00:58:59,043 --> 00:59:01,307
<i>You've got ghosts. Let's see 'em.</i>

423
00:59:07,718 --> 00:59:09,845
Chun-Li.

424
01:00:23,894 --> 01:00:25,828
huh?

425
01:01:05,236 --> 01:01:08,467
No wonder you wear a mask.

426
01:01:08,572 --> 01:01:11,268
I'd hide that face too.

427
01:01:17,147 --> 01:01:19,581
You bitch!

428
01:01:19,683 --> 01:01:21,651
I'll cut you open!

429
01:01:23,587 --> 01:01:26,385
You think this is over?

430
01:01:26,490 --> 01:01:28,424
No. I'm just getting started.

431
01:01:49,246 --> 01:01:51,646
This is a restricted area.

432
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:55,116
I thought you might make an exception.

433
01:01:59,290 --> 01:02:01,690
I have a question for you.

434
01:02:01,792 --> 01:02:05,660
A shipment was scheduled
to arrive at Berth 21 in two days.

435
01:02:06,897 --> 01:02:10,526
Listen, lady,
I think it's time for you to go.

436
01:02:14,738 --> 01:02:17,673
<i>They call it Bai Mei... the White Rose.</i>

437
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:19,470
What time does it arrive?

438
01:02:19,577 --> 01:02:22,307
Midnight.

439
01:02:22,413 --> 01:02:24,847
You should learn some manners.

440
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:27,247
Never put your hands on a lady.

441
01:02:39,063 --> 01:02:42,123
Forget to pay the rent? Where is everybody?

442
01:02:42,232 --> 01:02:45,292
Orders from up high. We're off the case.

443
01:02:45,402 --> 01:02:47,302
What orders?

444
01:02:47,404 --> 01:02:49,702
Orders, Nash.

445
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:51,741
You were right.

446
01:02:51,842 --> 01:02:53,742
Shadaloo is very well connected.

447
01:02:55,679 --> 01:02:58,910
- We're out.
- Hey, wait a minute. Maya.

448
01:02:59,016 --> 01:03:01,177
That's it?

449
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:05,313
I'm sorry, Charlie.

450
01:04:22,866 --> 01:04:27,667
You're not a schoolgirl anymore.

451
01:04:30,574 --> 01:04:32,542
Bring her in.

452
01:04:42,119 --> 01:04:44,087
<i>Oh.</i>

453
01:04:49,126 --> 01:04:52,323
So this is the girl that roughed up Vega?

454
01:04:53,530 --> 01:04:56,021
<i>I like her already.</i>

455
01:05:00,370 --> 01:05:02,270
Huang!

456
01:05:05,509 --> 01:05:07,477
Let me go!

457
01:05:13,283 --> 01:05:15,649
<i>Papa.</i>

458
01:05:15,753 --> 01:05:18,881
<i>You two take some time and catch up.</i>

459
01:05:24,995 --> 01:05:26,826
Chun-Li.

460
01:05:29,433 --> 01:05:31,401
Why?

461
01:05:33,337 --> 01:05:35,362
Papa, I had to.

462
01:05:36,507 --> 01:05:39,704
You know I tried so hard for so many years...

463
01:05:41,478 --> 01:05:43,844
just to keep you safe...

464
01:05:45,182 --> 01:05:46,740
to protect you...

465
01:05:46,850 --> 01:05:48,750
to make sure you had the good life.

466
01:05:48,852 --> 01:05:51,377
I would rather have you.

467
01:05:53,290 --> 01:05:57,886
Getting in Bison's way, it's a losing battle.

468
01:05:57,995 --> 01:06:00,589
Why are you doing this to yourself?

469
01:06:00,697 --> 01:06:03,165
Sometimes, you have to stand up...

470
01:06:03,267 --> 01:06:05,235
when standing isn't easy.

471
01:06:05,335 --> 01:06:09,169
- You taught me that.
- I love you so much.

472
01:06:09,273 --> 01:06:12,333
I love you.

473
01:06:19,983 --> 01:06:24,215
I love family reunions.

474
01:06:24,321 --> 01:06:26,346
Don't touch her.

475
01:06:27,758 --> 01:06:30,784
If you touch her again,
You get nothing more from me.

476
01:06:30,894 --> 01:06:34,625
- Do you understand?
- Oh, I understand.

477
01:06:34,731 --> 01:06:38,292
You see,
Your father has been the milk of my business.

478
01:06:42,139 --> 01:06:44,039
But even milk...

479
01:06:44,141 --> 01:06:46,200
has an expiration date.

480
01:06:47,978 --> 01:06:50,446
- No. No, don't.
- I'm a man of my word.

481
01:06:50,547 --> 01:06:53,948
- No, please! - I promised him
he'd have a chance to say good-bye.

482
01:06:54,051 --> 01:06:57,714
<i>No! No! No, please, stop!</i>

483
01:06:57,821 --> 01:07:00,221
No!

484
01:07:07,197 --> 01:07:12,100
You... will not stop me.

485
01:07:19,776 --> 01:07:22,540
<i>Take the body away.</i>

486
01:07:22,646 --> 01:07:24,614
Balrog.

487
01:07:33,790 --> 01:07:37,624
Is there anything you wanna say before
we get this over with?

488
01:07:41,531 --> 01:07:43,499
<i>All right.</i>

489
01:07:44,534 --> 01:07:46,365
And make it quick.

490
01:07:55,312 --> 01:07:58,213
Should we kill you
before or after we cut you?

491
01:07:58,315 --> 01:08:00,112
I wouldn't do either.

492
01:08:00,217 --> 01:08:02,447
- You're not in a place to negotiate.
- Not yet.

493
01:08:54,805 --> 01:08:57,171
Swing around the block.

494
01:10:01,371 --> 01:10:04,306
Ow!

495
01:10:04,408 --> 01:10:07,309
<i>Somebody got a problem?</i>

496
01:10:11,415 --> 01:10:14,111
Come on! Come on! Let's go!

497
01:10:51,221 --> 01:10:53,655
You're alive.

498
01:10:53,757 --> 01:10:55,725
Come on.

499
01:11:15,479 --> 01:11:17,640
<i>Gen.</i>

500
01:11:26,022 --> 01:11:28,650
Where you go...

501
01:11:28,758 --> 01:11:31,158
trouble certainly does follow.

502
01:11:32,496 --> 01:11:34,487
Let me see this.

503
01:11:41,538 --> 01:11:43,768
Hmm. Let's fix it.

504
01:11:43,874 --> 01:11:46,069
Come.

505
01:12:42,032 --> 01:12:45,024
Pretty soon,
You're not gonna need me anymore.

506
01:12:46,403 --> 01:12:49,566
<i>Now, let's find the White Rose.</i>

507
01:12:56,246 --> 01:12:58,771
How's your arm doing?

508
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:04,062
I'm sorry. They made me do it.

509
01:13:04,169 --> 01:13:07,070
Do you remember my question,
or do I have to ask you again?

510
01:13:08,674 --> 01:13:11,802
Tomorrow night, a ship from Murmansk...

511
01:13:11,910 --> 01:13:13,901
will arrive in the front berth.

512
01:13:14,012 --> 01:13:16,071
You wouldn't set me up twice now, would you?

513
01:13:16,181 --> 01:13:18,911
Please. Look.

514
01:13:19,017 --> 01:13:21,008
It's right here. See?

515
01:13:23,588 --> 01:13:25,488
Thank you.

516
01:13:53,085 --> 01:13:56,851
<i>Sorry for interrupting.</i>

517
01:13:56,955 --> 01:13:58,980
<i>No problem.</i>

518
01:13:59,091 --> 01:14:01,685
Hi.

519
01:14:01,793 --> 01:14:04,728
What can I do for ya?

520
01:14:04,830 --> 01:14:07,799
Bison's shipment arrives
at Central harbor tomorrow night.

521
01:14:07,899 --> 01:14:10,026
And?

522
01:14:10,135 --> 01:14:12,103
I'm gonna need backup.

523
01:14:16,575 --> 01:14:19,601
<i>Unit three's holding. Got it.</i>

524
01:14:20,979 --> 01:14:23,470
<i>Check the ammo.</i>

525
01:14:23,582 --> 01:14:25,482
Good. We're good to go.

526
01:14:25,584 --> 01:14:28,519
<i>All right, Bison, where the hell are you?</i>

527
01:14:31,823 --> 01:14:34,986
- We've got guests, fellas.
- We're set.

528
01:14:58,817 --> 01:15:01,411
I thought you were out.

529
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:03,420
We all grew up in this neighborhood.

530
01:15:03,522 --> 01:15:06,184
Don't wanna see it disappear.

531
01:15:15,734 --> 01:15:18,703
<i>Looks like they're expecting us.</i>

532
01:15:31,983 --> 01:15:33,883
We are not alone.

533
01:15:33,985 --> 01:15:36,920
It makes no difference. We're ready.

534
01:15:43,495 --> 01:15:47,261
Bomb! Everybody out! Go! Go!

535
01:15:47,365 --> 01:15:49,993
Go! Go! Go!

536
01:16:31,877 --> 01:16:33,936
Nash!

537
01:16:39,217 --> 01:16:41,708
- Stay low!
- Come on! Come on!

538
01:16:42,787 --> 01:16:44,880
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

539
01:17:29,301 --> 01:17:30,131
Are you okay?

540
01:17:33,104 --> 01:17:35,129
Okay. Just stay here.

541
01:17:56,795 --> 01:18:01,289
You know,
You're a lot slower than you used to be.

542
01:18:18,083 --> 01:18:20,711
And you're just as ugly as I remember!

543
01:18:20,819 --> 01:18:23,151
<i>Where's the White Rose?</i>

544
01:18:51,583 --> 01:18:53,949
<i>You don't even know what the White Rose is!</i>

545
01:18:54,052 --> 01:18:56,850
By the time you fools figure it out,
she'll be long gone.

546
01:18:56,955 --> 01:18:59,253
"She"?

547
01:19:14,706 --> 01:19:18,198
You two stay with her! You, come with me!

548
01:19:36,227 --> 01:19:38,889
<i>That's Bison.</i>

549
01:19:38,997 --> 01:19:41,397
Give me a fix on the helicopter
leaving my location.

550
01:19:41,499 --> 01:19:44,297
Nash, out.

551
01:20:05,023 --> 01:20:06,991
<i>Gen.!</i>

552
01:20:08,093 --> 01:20:11,529
<i>The White Rose...
not a weapon. A girl.</i>

553
01:20:11,629 --> 01:20:15,065
A girl? I just saw her.

554
01:20:15,166 --> 01:20:17,600
Bison's daughter was
the conduit for his soul.

555
01:20:19,537 --> 01:20:22,836
<i>- He rid himself of his goodness
by passing it into her.</i>

556
01:20:22,941 --> 01:20:25,842
<i>And she is his only weakness.</i>

557
01:20:25,944 --> 01:20:28,572
That's why he's been
looking for her all this time.

558
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:31,274
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's go.

559
01:20:31,382 --> 01:20:33,543
And I'm gonna need support when we get there!

560
01:20:33,651 --> 01:20:36,552
Don't keep me waiting! Nash, out!

561
01:20:37,622 --> 01:20:40,056
We got him on radar! We gotta move now!

562
01:20:40,158 --> 01:20:42,388
- Bison's got a girl with him.
- What girl?

563
01:20:42,494 --> 01:20:44,928
<i>- His daughter. Her name's Rose.
- Let's get her.</i>

564
01:20:45,029 --> 01:20:47,156
Okay.

565
01:20:47,265 --> 01:20:49,290
Move!

566
01:21:24,202 --> 01:21:26,261
Ah.

567
01:21:43,822 --> 01:21:46,347
Still no word from Balrog.

568
01:22:02,807 --> 01:22:04,900
If anything happens to her...

569
01:22:05,009 --> 01:22:07,239
I'll kill you first.

570
01:22:27,565 --> 01:22:29,726
Where's the girl?

571
01:23:54,033 --> 01:23:56,058
<i>Hello, old friend.</i>

572
01:24:01,608 --> 01:24:03,735
You should never have left the team.

573
01:24:03,843 --> 01:24:05,970
We wouldn't be standing here like this.

574
01:24:06,079 --> 01:24:09,571
But, of course,
only one of us is standing.

575
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:15,818
Nice try.

576
01:24:25,265 --> 01:24:27,233
<i>Seven-six-seven-five.</i>

577
01:24:39,312 --> 01:24:41,177
<i>You must be Rose.</i>

578
01:25:04,037 --> 01:25:06,301
<i>Hello, old friend.</i>

579
01:25:15,181 --> 01:25:17,149
<i>Where is she?</i>

580
01:25:27,861 --> 01:25:30,728
It's time we said good-bye,
old friend.

581
01:27:35,989 --> 01:27:39,049
Fathers always have a soft spot
for their daughters.

582
01:27:39,158 --> 01:27:42,457
That's how I brought yours down.

583
01:27:42,562 --> 01:27:46,259
<i>You didn't think this was
going to end well, now, did you?</i>

584
01:27:55,041 --> 01:27:57,305
<i>Chun-Li.!</i>

585
01:27:57,410 --> 01:27:59,310
You know what you need to do.

586
01:28:56,518 --> 01:28:59,612
Fathers always have a weakness
for their daughters.

587
01:29:03,525 --> 01:29:05,550
Chun-Li.

588
01:29:09,998 --> 01:29:11,898
Nice work.

589
01:29:16,705 --> 01:29:19,003
Hey, you'd better get out of here.

590
01:29:20,209 --> 01:29:22,143
Chopper's on the other side of the island.

591
01:29:22,244 --> 01:29:24,974
I never saw you.

592
01:29:27,716 --> 01:29:30,207
See to it she gets a real life.

593
01:29:35,224 --> 01:29:37,351
You too, huh?

594
01:29:40,863 --> 01:29:43,388
Thanks, Nash.

595
01:29:48,504 --> 01:29:51,837
Charlie Nash, Interpol! hold your fire!

596
01:29:57,980 --> 01:29:59,948
Hey.

597
01:30:01,116 --> 01:30:03,016
Hey.

598
01:30:03,118 --> 01:30:06,610
- You're back in business, huh?
- Yep.

599
01:30:06,722 --> 01:30:09,782
Are you sure you wanna go back
to Gangland Homicide?

600
01:30:09,892 --> 01:30:12,827
- It's what I do.
- It's your first time?

601
01:30:14,096 --> 01:30:17,122
Nah. I've been there before.

602
01:30:17,232 --> 01:30:19,166
I can imagine.

603
01:30:21,403 --> 01:30:24,702
If you get lonely at night, don't call me.

604
01:30:36,101 --> 01:30:38,763
I love this job.

605
01:30:45,577 --> 01:30:50,446
<i>I don't think
this was the life my father envisioned for me.</i>

606
01:30:50,549 --> 01:30:52,847
<i>But... maybe it was.</i>

607
01:30:55,487 --> 01:30:57,751
<i>I know he would have been proud.</i>

608
01:31:01,226 --> 01:31:05,560
<i>I've stood when standing was not easy...</i>

609
01:31:05,664 --> 01:31:08,758
<i>and have found something to believe in.</i>

610
01:31:11,203 --> 01:31:13,797
<i>Something worth fighting for.</i>

611
01:31:15,106 --> 01:31:17,267
<i>The Order of the Web.</i>

612
01:31:31,223 --> 01:31:33,748
Gen!

613
01:31:41,666 --> 01:31:43,759
There's more work to be done.

614
01:31:45,237 --> 01:31:48,638
Something about this smells of an old friend.

615
01:31:52,310 --> 01:31:55,939
- But Bison's dead.
- We need to recruit.

616
01:31:56,047 --> 01:31:58,015
<i>They've been talking about
a fighter in Japan...</i>

617
01:31:58,116 --> 01:32:00,346
<i>Ryu... something.</i>

618
01:32:00,452 --> 01:32:03,319
<i>I hear he's a force to be reckoned with.</i>

619
01:32:03,421 --> 01:32:05,116
Wanna come?

620
01:32:07,892 --> 01:32:09,792
Maybe next time.

621
01:32:09,894 --> 01:32:11,828
Does this mean you're done fighting?

622
01:32:26,044 --> 01:32:29,377
No. For now, I'm home.

623
01:33:01,780 --> 01:33:04,613
<i>Ace... hood.!</i>

624
01:33:04,716 --> 01:33:07,583
<i>hood.! Brother.!</i>

625
01:33:07,686 --> 01:33:10,587
<i>Look at that.! Shit. hey.</i>

626
01:34:09,447 --> 01:34:11,711
<i>Yeah.</i>
