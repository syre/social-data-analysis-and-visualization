- Happy birthday.
- [woman] Happy birthday, darling!

3
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:45,169
- [woman laughs]
- [man] Whoo-hoo!

4
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,171
- [man] Look at that.
- [woman] Happy birthday.

5
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:50,591
[man] Wow. Wait, wait, wait.
Don't blow them out just yet.

6
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,968
Hon, give me the camera,
and l'll, um, get a shot

7
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,970
- of you and Caitlyn blowing them out.
- [woman] OK.

8
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,724
- And...
- [blowing]

9
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:01,602
- Oh, my God.
- [man] Good girl.

10
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:03,062
- [man] Well done.
- Happy birthday.

11
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,981
- All in one go.
- Come on, give it back.

12
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:10,444
- [man] Don't forget to make your wish.
- [Caitlyn] l wish for...

13
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,988
[woman gasps] You're not supposed
to tell us your wishes.

14
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:16,825
l wish the lights would come back on.

15
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:19,828
[man] They will, my darling,
don't worry about that.

16
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,580
[Caitlyn] l need to go toilet.

17
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,249
[man] OK. Well, quickly then.
You gotta cut this cake.

18
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,085
[woman] Hurry up.

19
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,836
[man] Don't go near that front door,
though, OK?

20
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,129
Stay away from that front door.

21
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,840
- l will.
- Good girl.

22
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:35,928
[sighs]

23
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:40,099
[woman] Look, we can't keep this up,
Tom. She knows something's wrong.

24
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,892
Why don't we take the Land Rover
to the village?

25
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:44,144
No. Look, they told us to stay here.

26
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,563
Whatever it is out there,
it's contagious.

27
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,607
l'm sure they'll send someone
when it's all sorted.

28
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,567
And we've got enough stuff here
to be getting on with anyway.

29
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:53,112
lt'll be fine, honestly.

30
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,739
[woman] l'm not... l'm not sure.
l don't know.

31
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,324
We'll be fine.

32
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,495
[woman] Oh, my God. What was that?

33
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,664
[Tom] l don't know. Let me have a look.

34
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,917
[woman] Can you see anything?

35
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:09,419
[Tom] lt's so dark out there,
l can't see a thing.

36
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:14,383
Bring that camera with you
so l've got a bit more light.

37
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,802
[woman] OK, but be careful.

38
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,764
l think there's something in the river.

39
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,308
[woman] What's that?

40
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:27,980
Caitlyn, just get back in the house,
please, darling? Go on.

41
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,731
Everything's OK.

42
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,901
l'm gonna take a look.

43
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,655
[woman] Tom, just get back
inside the house.

44
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:39,408
lt's fine. lt's fine.
l'll just take a quick look.

45
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:53,672
[rustling]

46
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,424
[woman] Careful.

[water sloshes]

48
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,429
- Did you hear that?
- [woman] What was it?

49
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,266
l'm not sure.

50
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,189
[woman] Tom.

51
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,024
Hold on.

52
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,734
[woman groans]

53
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,618
[woman] You see anything?

54
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,083
Tom?

55
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,548
[water sloshing]

56
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,300
[woman] Great.

57
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:43,055
[woman sighs]

58
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:45,682

[woman panting, gasping]

62
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,423
[woman whimpering] Where is she?

63
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,008
[whispering] Caitlyn?

64
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,388
Caitie?

65
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,348
Oh no, God, please.

66
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,852
Caitlyn?

67
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,855
[sobbing] Baby, where are you?

68
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,361
Caitlyn?

69
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,038
[sobbing] Oh, God, there...
Thank God, there you are.

70
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,292
Are you all right, darling?

71
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,211
Let me see. Let me see. Are you OK?

72
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,963
- lt's OK, sweetheart.
- Mommy...

73
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,881
[woman whispering] Just be quiet, OK?

74
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:04,136
Hug Bunny, hug Bunny close.
Just be quiet.

75
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,388
- [thumping, glass shatters]
- Oh, God. Shh. Shh.

76
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,725
Everything's gonna be OK.
Just be quiet. Please.

77
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,893
- [banging]
- [stifled sobbing] Oh, my God.

78
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,397
- [glass shatters]
- Shh, shh...

79
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,400
- l'm here, l'm here.
- [banging, footsteps]

80
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,193
- [Caitlyn whimpers]
- Shh, shh!

81
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,821
- Mom?
- Baby, you have to be so quiet.

82
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,407
- Be quiet. Shh, shh.
- [Caitlyn whimpering]

83
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:30,162
- lt's gonna be OK. Shh...
- [thumping]

84
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,748
l know, l know. Shh, shh.

[off-air tone drones]

91
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,970
[exhales]

92
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,640
My name's Nick Jones.
l'm an army photographer

93
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,226
with the Platoon of the East Anglia
and Fourth Battalion.

94
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,562
Our current location
is a military outpost

95
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,981
in Hertfordshire, United Kingdom.

96
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,485
The tape you just saw was something
we picked up a few weeks ago

97
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,112
whilst we were out on the road.

98
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,907
We've seen some pretty bad stuff
in the past few months,

99
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:51,159
just like what you saw
with that family.

100
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,082
So it's been about...

101
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:00,669
...four months since the outbreak,
and we're still alive.

102
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,798
And, uh... that's exactly
what l'm trying to document.

103
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,845
So l'll show you around the place,
introduce you to some of the guys.

104
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:16,268
We're all TA in the platoon,
so we're all reservists.

105
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:19,813
To give you an idea, though...
Maddy over there is a truck driver.

106
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,357
Johno is a bloody financial advisor.

107
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,236
At the end of the day,
we're just normal people.

108
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:31,074
We were on exercise
when this thing took hold.

109
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,995
So we were drafted in by the army
to secure certain areas, which we did.

110
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:40,292
So, we've seen a lot
of horrible stuff, though.

111
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,043
Really horrible.

112
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,754
[Jones] And your training, l presume,

113
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,215
must've helped you
and the platoon survive?

114
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,761
Absolutely. But nothing really prepares
you for when it really happens.

115
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,056
You can't plan for this sort of stuff.

116
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,518
So we're just living
day by day at the moment,

117
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,770
trying to help each other out.

118
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:07,402
Everyone's lost pretty much everyone,
so it's just us.

119
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,156
[Jones] Are you scared?

120
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,870
We're all afraid.
Anyone who says they're not afraid

121
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:20,081
is either lying or needs
their fucking head examined.

122
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,625
Sorry.

123
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:25,045
[Jones] Lieutenant Andrews, you're in
command of this platoon and the outpost.

124
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,297
Can you tell us
a bit about where we are?

125
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,841
Well, the entire country's
in utter chaos.

126
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,969
There's no law.
There's just bands of survivors like us.

127
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,514
As you can see,
we've got perimeter fencing,

128
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,725
not fool-proof, though, but stops
those things from getting in.

129
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,143
There's a water supply nearby

130
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,479
and there's limited power
from the generators.

131
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,397
l think you found that useful
for your camera.

132
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,124
- What happened, Corporal?
- We had contact, sir.

133
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,377
One casualty, Private O'Hara.

134
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,087
- Wounded?
- Dead, sir.

135
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:14,427
lt was Hatchworth.
The place is crawling with those things.

136
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:20,475
Take O'Hara's body to sickbay.
We need to bag him up properly.

137
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,479
- Sir.
- [truck engine revving]

138
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:31,278
- Do you mind, Nick?
- He's a bit shaken up, man.

139
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,530
[man] Fuckin' sick of this shit.

140
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,532
[Andrews] lt was meant
to be a simple raid.

141
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:38,618
lnto the town,
straight in, straight out, job done.

142
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,413
Now l've got another man dead.
Second in a week.

143
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,915
Sir, l'll be honest with you.
These raids are getting too dangerous.

144
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,293
There were far more
than we've encountered before. O'Hara...

145
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:49,004
O'Hara fucked up and got himself killed.

146
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,172
- He was just a kid.
- l don't want to hear it, Maddox.

147
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:54,259
The boys get one chance out here.
Now it's the same for everyone.

148
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,803
You take your eye off the ball,
this is what happens.

149
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,888
lt's only a few klicks from here, sir.

150
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:03,393
Look, l'd like your input this evening.

151
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,894
[Maddox] Sir.

152
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,820
This is where they brought
the civilians in.

153
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:18,450
- [coughing]
- [moaning]

154
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,535
[heart monitor beeping]

155
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,082
[Jones] Fucking hell.

156
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,501
[coughing, gagging]

157
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:29,836
[Jones] Jesus Christ.

158
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,296
Doc.

159
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,257
Damn it. Nurse.

160
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,968
lf you want to be useful, Jones,
get the nurse for me.

161
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,428
[Jones] That all, sir?

162
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:41,389
Do me a favor and get out of here
with that thing.

163
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:56,321
- [man] Yeah.
- [man 2] Yeah. See you out there.

164
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,578
[Jones] Hey, guys.
What happened at Hatchworth?

165
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,583
lt was all fucked up, mate.

166
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,544
We were loading
our food and supplies from a store

167
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:14,089
when several of those things came at us.

168
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,342
O'Hara was outside on his own.

169
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,594
Didn't see 'em coming.

170
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,972
No good after you're bitten.

171
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,266
Shot himself before he turned.

172
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,435
- [man] You sure that's what it says?
- [man 2] Mm-hm.

173
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,854
[Andrews] This part of the message
stays between us.

174
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,065
- l don't want to cause alarm.
- Good.

175
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,274
Jonesy.

176
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,864
- l'm sorry about earlier, Jonesy.
- [Jonesy] That's OK.

177
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:43,576
lt's just that... that while in there,
she's not going to last much longer.

178
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,788
Same for most of them.

179
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:51,543
Had to lock O'Hara's body
in a storeroom till morning.

180
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,503
What a bloody mess.

181
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,213
[Jonesy] What about her?

182
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:57,632
[doctor] l've had to keep her sedated
and locked up.

183
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,802
Been prone to violent attacks.

184
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,930
[Jonesy] Yeah, l can see that.
lt looks like you came off worse.

185
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,683
Yeah.

186
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,394
l'll be honest with you.

187
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:12,731
lf she were an animal,
l'd put her down.

188
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:16,526
There's no specialists left
to give her what she needs.

189
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:21,740
[slow, muffled breathing]

190
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,838
[alarm blaring]

191
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,423
[panting]

192
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:42,302
Just heard word from Corporal Nicholson.
We got contact at the perimeter.

193
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,638
Why are these fucking gates open?!

194
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,098
[siren wailing]

195
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,391
[Andrews]
Nicholson, are you seeing this?

196
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,560
[Nicholson] Sir, l don't know how,
but they breached the compound.

197
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,896
[Andrews] Shit. No choice.
We have to engage.

198
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,856
[Nicholson] Sir. Engage! Engage!

199
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,941
[gunfire]

200
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,985
[man] God damn you, fire!

201
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,321
[Jonesy] Help me!

202
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:04,032
No! Fuck no!

203
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,744
[shouting]

204
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,537
Help me!

205
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,622
No!

206
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,082
- Fall back!
- Outflank 'em!

207
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,840
[continued screaming, gunfire]

208
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,595
[Jonesy] Someone! Help me!

209
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,974
Fall back! Fall back!

210
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,851
Fall back!

211
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:45,031
[alarm blaring]

212
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:48,827
[doctor] Jonesy!

213
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,495
[man screaming]

214
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,747
[doctor] Help. Help.

215
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,335
[Jonesy] Turner! Turner!

216
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,841
Jesus. God.

217
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:07,262
- [woman screaming]
- [alarm continues blaring]

218
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,935
[Jonesy screams]

219
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,366
Jones, you all right?

220
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,702
[Jonesy] Yeah. Sickbay's fucked,
everyone's dead.

221
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,662
- We're getting out of here.
- [Jonesy] How?

222
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:35,874
We're taking one of the trucks.
This whole place is compromised now.

223
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,543
We'll get as much weapon
and ammunition as we can.

224
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,837
- You got a sidearm?
- [Jonesy] No.

225
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,214
You know how to use it.

226
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,383
- [woman] We need find Carter!
- [man] l haven't seen him.

227
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,760
[Maddox] See if you can grab anyone
from the other side of the barracks.

228
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,680
lf Carter's there, get him.
We're leaving.

229
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,891
[Jonesy] OK. OK.

230
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,851
[alarm, siren continuing]

231
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:59,772
- [Jonesy] Maddox!
- [alarm silences]

232
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:02,191
Maddox!

233
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,485
Quick. Give me a hand.

234
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,864
- We can't leave her.
- We can't. She's a liability.

235
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:11,618
[Jonesy] What, you want to be
a murderer? Just... Just help her!

236
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,870
- [Maddox] All right, stand back.
- [fires gun]

237
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,997
[siren wailing]

238
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:24,380
[woman shouts, whimpers]

239
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,759
[Maddox] Listen to me!

240
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,594
We are getting out of this place.

241
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,972
l need you to do as l say.
You understand?

242
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,891
Understand?!

243
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:37,977
OK. Let's go.

244
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,648
[rapid gunfire]

245
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,326
[Jonesy] Maddox!

246
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,119
Where's Andrews?
We're taking the truck!

247
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,080
Last time l saw him,
he was on the other side.

248
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,916
And the main gate's been breached.
We need to bug out.

249
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,126
[woman] We're not leaving
without Carter!

250
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,337
[Nicholson]
l can't see shit out here, Kayne!

251
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,465
[Jonesy] There he is! Carter!

252
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:11,886
[Kayne] Stop!

253
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,480
- [zombie growling]
- [Jonesy] Andrews!

254
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:28,152
Oh, fuck, they're everywhere.

255
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,992
Nicholson, what the fuck are you doing?!

256
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,327
l'm gonna draw them away
so you can get the truck out.

257
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,662
[Jonesy] You're fucking mad.

258
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:40,707
All of you, back to the truck, now!

259
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,710
[Jonesy] Stay behind us!

260
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,295
Jonesy, move it! Move it!

261
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,095
Jones, come on, come on, come on.

262
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,476
[Jonesy] We need to wait for Nicholson.

263
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,562
We gotta go.
We gotta go now.

264
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,939
[gunfire]

265
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,454
[Jonesy] Nicholson! Nicholson!

266
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,625
Nicholson!

267
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:31,049
[panting]

268
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,925
We're just leaving the base.

269
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,552
We left Nicholson behind.

270
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:38,139
Fuck... Oh, God, Nicholson.
He's left behind.

271
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:41,601
Um... Someone left the gate open.
[pants]

272
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:44,312
l don't know who the fuck did that,
but the gate is left open.

273
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,648
[indistinct radio chatter]

274
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,655
[Jonesy] Are you OK?

275
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,909
[Kayne] We shouldn't be taking her.

276
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,410
[Jonesy] She wouldn't have
made it otherwise.

277
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,704
That ain't my problem.

278
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,290
The girl was locked up.
She's crazy.

279
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:07,043
- She'll slow us down.
- [Maddox] Knock it off.

280
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,545
She's with us now, so get used to it.

281
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,341
You sure you're OK?

282
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:17,929
l'm Corporal Maddox, by the way.
What's your name?

283
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,764
Leeann.

284
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:23,017
Here. Put this on.

285
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,731
[Maddox] You were quite
handy back there.

286
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,650
You almost took my head off.

287
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,612
You've met Jonesy already?
This is Kayne.

288
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:37,490
She's a good soldier,
same goes for Carter up front.

289
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,450
They'll protect you.

290
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,953
We're gonna try and find
somewhere safe, OK?

291
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,881
[wind howling]

292
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:03,808
This place should be all right. lt's in
our recon area, if the others make it.

293
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,977
Too dangerous to drive
with those things around, Corporal.

294
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,980
Yeah, l agree. They must be
all over the place by now.

295
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:12,150
The truck's out of sight.
Gone down quiet, though.

296
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:15,319
Yeah, too quiet.
And the weather's closing in.

297
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,121
[wind howling]

298
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,461
[Maddox] We need to gain entry.

299
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,590
[Carter] Don't worry. l've got a key.

300
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:43,222
[Maddox whispers] Go. Go.

301
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,604
[wind howling outside]

302
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,165
Kayne... check the place out.

303
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,545
We need to secure the location,
make it as hard as possible

304
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,547
for those things to get in.

305
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,965
[Carter] Area clear.

306
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,490
Pretty hairy back there, eh?

307
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,451
- Seen worse.
- Mm.

308
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,746
She does speak. [laughs]

309
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:55,086
So, Jonesy tells me
you're some kind of reporter.

310
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,255
That's right.

311
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,840
Where from?

312
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,842
London.

313
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,136
So how did you end up out here?

314
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:07,932
Leave her out, Carter.
Her friends were attacked.

315
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:10,184
[Leeann] My friends were murdered.

316
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:16,607
No one here is gonna hurt you. OK?

317
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:20,027
Yeah. Whatever.

318
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:35,167
Hm... lt's beautiful.

319
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,963
[Jonesy] What is?

320
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:42,091
Snow.
l've never seen it before.

321
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,805
[Jonesy] Oh, wow. l didn't realize.

322
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,266
Uh, Maddox needs you inside.

323
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,104
Let's go.

324
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,233
[Maddox] l want you to see this.

325
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,361
You, too, Leeann.
This involves all of us.

326
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:05,156
l managed to take this from the base
before it was overrun.

327
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,700
Now, l'm sure you all heard
about the messages we'd been receiving.

328
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:11,746
Well, Andrews worked out it was coming
from Hope's Point on the east coast.

329
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,497
- Survivors?
- Yeah.

330
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:16,542
- [Carter] There's no one there.
- That's what we thought, but there are.

331
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:19,170
- And there's a lot more in Holland.
- [Kayne] Holland?

332
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,629
There's a large community over there

333
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:24,342
who have got a plan
to sit this thing out over winter.

334
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,761
Now, ten klicks from our position
is Hinxston Forest.

335
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,137
lt's the best way to avoid the towns.

336
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:31,640
lf we take the road through the forest
and stick to the country route

337
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:34,935
to the coast, then regroup
with the survivors at Hope,

338
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,022
then we get over to Rotterdam
and hold out till spring.

339
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,690
This is Andrews's last orders.

340
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,359
Andrews is gone, Maddox.

341
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,861
We should be heading north,
not to the coast.

342
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,405
You need to forget about Manchester.

343
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,367
- We've all lost people, Carter.
- Hope Point is crazy.

344
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,035
There's nothing left for us here.

345
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,661
And look at what you're wearing.

346
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:56,040
We're more hated than those creatures.
After what happened in the beginning...

347
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,918
We had orders. So did you.

348
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,837
- l didn't wanna do it.
- Yeah, l know, none of us did.

349
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:05,591
But people blame the likes of us
after what happened.

350
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,968
We run into a group of survivors
who have all lost loved ones,

351
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,221
they'll most likely lynch you.

352
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:11,806
We're a symbol of that old authority.

353
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,558
Whether you like it or not,
we are better off moving now.

354
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,977
- You're wrong.
- This whole country is fucked.

355
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,562
What are you gonna do?
You gonna throw down your rifle

356
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,523
and pretend you're a civvie
like everyone else?

357
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,109
Use your head, man.

358
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:27,321
Rotterdam? Uh...

359
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,157
Fuck.

360
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,345
[wind howling outside]

361
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:00,020
[distant thumping]

362
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:12,116
[clock ticking]

363
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:23,169
[Jonesy] Carter.

364
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,964
Keep it down, mate.
They're outside.

365
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,299
[Jonesy] Shit.

366
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:32,636
Started coming by about an hour ago,
just hanging around.

367
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,680
[Jonesy]
They better not try and get in.

368
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:38,517
- They don't know we're here.
- [thumping]

369
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,685
[Jonesy] What was that?

370
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,736
Stay on me.

371
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,406
[Carter sighs]

372
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,542
[faint thumping]

373
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:04,877
[Jonesy] lt's coming from down there.

374
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:07,296
[Carter whispers] l hear it, mate.
Keep it down.

375
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,089
[thumping]

376
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:28,526
[Jonesy] Be careful, Carter.

377
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,326
There's a door.

378
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:50,464
On three.
One... two... and three.

379
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,187
Slowly. OK. OK.

380
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,368
l'm not sure about this.

381
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:21,120
[Carter] Shh.

382
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,086
[Jonesy] lt's not good.

383
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,594
Leave it.

384
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,197
OK. OK.

385
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,752
[thumping]

386
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,349
[Carter] Jonesy, what's that sound?

387
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:28,520
- [flies buzzing]
- [Jonesy] Carter, shit!

388
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,522
- [Carter] Fuck.
- Behind me, out.

389
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,067
[Jonesy] Go, go, go, go, go!

390
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:35,527
Behind me.

391
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:47,956
[panting, whispers] Jesus.
We need to get out of here.

392
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:51,377
- [Carter] lt's a fucking death trap.
- l know. They're everywhere outside.

393
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,670
[glass shatters]

394
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:55,339
- They'll get in.
- OK, we've got no choice.

395
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:57,800
We're bugging out.
Head around to the truck.

396
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:00,928
- Don't engage with weapons.
- [Carter] Got it.

397
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,659
Jonesy, get in the back.

398
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,202
- Look out!
- [zombie growling]

399
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:26,912
[Carter grunts]

400
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:31,125
[grunting]

401
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,756
[discordant industrial sounds play]

402
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:55,107
- [Carter] Fuck.
- [Leeann] What's happening?

403
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,192
- [Kayne] The ride is over.
- All right, everyone out.

404
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,989
[fires gun]

405
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:07,411
- [Carter] Truck's totaled.
- Fuck it.

406
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:10,998
- [Leeann] Oh, Jesus.
- All right, on me. Let's move.

407
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,803
Kayne, watch from the tree line.

408
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,388
l don't think they're
gonna come this far.

409
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,931
[Carter] Christ.

410
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,308
What now, man?

411
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:31,977
- [Jonesy] Are you OK?
- Yeah, l'm fine.

412
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,771
[Carter] Fuck.

413
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,981
Hold the perimeter.
There's a shallow river up ahead,

414
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:38,150
and make sure everyone gets
their canteens filled.

415
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,652
- Jonesy, use the purifying tablets.
- [Jonesy] Yep.

416
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:48,368
[muffled breathing]

417
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:07,012
[wind howling]

418
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:13,227
- How's everyone down at the camp?
- [Jonesy] Yeah, not bad.

419
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,187
You get any sleep?

420
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:17,481
[Jonesy] A little bit.
Damn weather though.

421
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:19,483
Yeah, it's fucking cold.

422
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:22,903
This is no good.
We stand out like sore fucking thumbs.

423
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,532
[Jonesy] So you really want
to leave the country?

424
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,827
Don't get me wrong, mate.
l understand people wanna find out

425
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:33,705
how their loved ones are, but...

426
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,083
We have to assume they're dead.

427
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,631
l want to show you something.

428
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,763
[whispers] lt's just down there.

429
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,312
[Jonesy] Jesus.

430
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:59,439
[Maddox] We are not alone out here.

431
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:04,945
Somebody didn't just kill this creature.
They enjoyed it.

432
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:09,575
OK. Let's head back to the camp.

433
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:13,078
Jones, keep this between ourselves,
yeah?

434
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,376
[clicking]

435
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,837
[Jonesy] Where'd you get that thing?

436
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:24,965
My grandfather was a collector.
Been in the family for years.

437
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,385
[Maddox] All right, so what have we got?

438
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:32,598
Got the two SA80s with four mags,

439
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:35,225
one pistol, one clip, one shotgun,
several shells,

440
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,562
my rifle, my Mauser.

441
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:41,356
No grenades, though.
Not much, is it?

442
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:44,526
Best way to deal with these creatures
is to avoid them.

443
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,612
That should be enough
to get us to Hope's Point.

444
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:48,196
[Kayne] Then what?

445
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,573
We'll be OK.

446
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:52,576
- l can shoot.
- [Kayne] You?

447
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,620
Used to go shooting with my dad.

448
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:57,539
Made the county finals a few years back.

449
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:00,292
Now l've heard it all.

450
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:02,961
Leeann, you're under
our protection for now.

451
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,506
[Carter] Guys, look at this!

452
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:10,093
lt must have been there for weeks.

453
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,095
[Jonesy] Fucking hell, it's everywhere.

454
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,847
You forgetting something?

455
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,849
We all fucking drank
from here last night.

456
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:18,268
- [Leeann] Oh, God. [gags]
- Everyone, calm down.

457
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,937
[Kayne] lt's OK.

458
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:22,105
Our boot marks, upstream.

459
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,650
lt's all right.

460
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:28,403
- [Jonesy] That's lucky.
- Too fucking lucky.

461
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:32,449
No point in polluting the rest
of this fucking area.

462
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:34,785
[grunting]

463
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:39,748
So, what are we doing
about transport?

464
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,458
Well, we can forget about the truck.

465
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,669
Getting a new vehicle means
heading into a town or village,

466
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:46,129
and l don't wanna risk that.
We proceed on foot.

467
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,255
[Carter] Come on, man.

468
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,342
Private, l want all the kits
squared and ready to go.

469
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:52,970
We head to Hinxston Forest as planned.

470
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,889
We need to get some distance
between this place and us.

471
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,198
[Leeann] Carter!

472
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:20,163
[Jonesy] Trip wire. Careful.

473
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:21,623
[Maddox] Kayne, check it out.

474
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:34,594
lt's a crossbow. Bandits.

475
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,896
l'll disarm it.

476
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:51,028
Whoa! Fuck! Shit! [panting]

477
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:54,531
Carter, come back very slowly.

478
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:56,616
We need to keep off the main paths.

479
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,333
Do you fucking see this?

480
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,505
[Carter] Bandits.

481
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,465
OK, on me, move.

482
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,776
[zombie hissing]

483
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,028
[man shouts]

484
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,531
[man singing indistinctly]

485
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,868
[man] Put your back into it, come on.

486
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:34,214
- [man] Whoo! [laughs]
- [engine revving]

487
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,883
[man humming]

488
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:42,848
Fucking hell, Weasel.
Have l got to show you where to put it?

489
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,267
Come on.

490
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:47,060
Are you a fucking virgin? Come on!

491
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,396
[man 2] l hope you're
using fucking protection.

492
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,860
Dirty bastard. Whoo!

493
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:58,530
[man] There we go. [laughs]

494
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,664
OK. Now, Goke...

495
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:11,585
- Jesus Christ, live a little.
- Problem?

496
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,336
l thought we were gonna fucking
save her for Billy.

497
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,130
Shut up.

498
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,889
Jesus, Manny. Dirty fuck.

499
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,433
Let's go, come on.

500
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:38,278
- [Carter] lt's no good.
- l can take them from here.

501
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:51,082
[Jonesy] Leeann, you all right?

502
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,838
OK, let's move. Kayne, take point.

503
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,472
[muffled breathing]

504
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,276
[Jonesy] What do you think?

505
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,695
We take the most direct route,
straight through the forest.

506
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,280
[Jonesy] l don't know, Maddox.

507
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:25,575
We're not moving across open ground
with bandits around.

508
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,411
We need to move fast.
Time is not on our side.

509
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,247
[Jonesy] Yeah, l realize that.

510
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,998
No, you don't.

511
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,251
Look, there's something
you all need to understand.

512
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,921
We've not got much time left.

513
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,881
[Jonesy] What do you mean?

514
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:42,259
There are boats leaving for Rotterdam
from Hope's Point.

515
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:45,553
They leave in two days,
and they won't wait.

516
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,639
Two days, that's all we've got.

517
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:48,890
[Kayne] What?

518
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:51,935
There's something else.

519
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:54,646
l haven't said anything 'cause
l don't know if it's true yet, but...

520
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,608
lf we don't make it there in time,

521
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:03,113
the chances of our survival
in this country are gonna be zero.

522
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:05,323
Kayne, you can't say this to Carter.

523
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,993
Why not? He's one of us.

524
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:11,288
lf what we heard happens,
l know he will try and find his family,

525
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:14,624
and he will die trying.

526
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,335
l'm sorry,
but you've gotta trust me on this.

527
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,838
lt's not right.

528
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:23,008
Kayne, we need him.

529
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:33,518
- [Maddox] SlTREP.
- Not good.

530
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:35,979
The forest is fucking
full of those things.

531
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:38,440
[Maddox] Can we make it through?

532
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,401
All right, let's move.

533
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,112
[whispers] Come on, let's go.

534
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:03,840
- [Leeann grunts]
- Leeann, l need your help.

535
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:05,717
Take these.

536
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:09,512
Kayne, Carter, right flank.

537
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,056
Jones, Leeann, with me.

538
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,141
- Prepare to move.
- Ready.

539
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,102
Ready.

540
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,188
- Ready.
- Move!

541
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:34,287
- Covering fire!
- [Carter] Go!

542
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:39,626
[gunfire]

543
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:56,976
[Carter] Go!

544
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,937
Cover!

545
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,992
Covering fire!

546
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,331
[Maddox] On me!

547
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,878
Follow me!

548
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,273
[panting]

549
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:45,024
[Maddox] Let's get the fuck out of here.

550
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,784
[Leeann grunts]

551
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,787
[all panting]

552
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,293
[Kayne] No sign.

553
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:04,836
We're clear for now.

554
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,796
[Maddox] They'll be following.

555
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,549
These fuckers are slow,
but they don't give up.

556
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,759
Leeann, you did good.

557
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:46,169
- Maddox, l'm freezing.
- l know.

558
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,171
Don't worry, we'll start a fire.

559
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:51,174
This is a good place to rest.
We can see anything coming.

560
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:07,982
We're close, maybe one or two klicks
till we're through the forest.

561
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,442
We'll come across a couple of villages.

562
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:12,570
Good. Maybe we can find a set of wheels.

563
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:17,033
Doubtful, but we do need food and water.
This is pretty much the last of it.

564
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:19,702
We'll have a look at daybreak,
but l'm not taking any chances.

565
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:22,956
l don't like it out here.
lt feels too open.

566
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:26,501
Be glad when we get to the coast.

567
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:28,878
The people at Hope's Point
know what they're doing.

568
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,171
Yeah.

569
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:33,633
l just wanna leave places
like London behind now.

570
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,927
[Jonesy] Have you got any family there?

571
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,554
Yeah.

572
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:40,223
lt scares me,
the thought of ever going back.

573
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:43,142
- Married?
- [laughs] No.

574
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,395
Just Mom and Dad.

575
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:47,397
l wanted a career back then.

576
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:49,899
All seems so pointless now.

577
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,485
[Carter] l had a wife and a daughter.

578
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:58,032
Up in Manchester.
Wish l knew where they are.

579
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:00,827
Just need to find out what happened,
you know?

580
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,374
[Leeann] Jonesy.

581
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,668
Here, give me that.

582
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,257
- [Leeann] So, what about you?
- What do you mean?

583
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:16,092
[Leeann] lt's about time you tell us
a bit about yourself?

584
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:18,761
[Carter] Yeah, mate, you've been
asking us a lot of questions.

585
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,140
OK.

586
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,685
My wife left me three years ago.

587
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:31,274
Uh, l suppose it was
my own fault, really.

588
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:33,651
l was always away on work.

589
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:37,196
[Leeann] Looks like you still are.

590
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:40,617
Yeah.

591
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:43,202
l suppose it's all l got left now.

592
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:49,459
But it's important, isn't it?
To document all this.

593
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:51,502
[Leeann] Any other family?

594
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,129
Just my dad.

595
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:56,716
He went to America
a few years ago, and, uh...

596
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,970
...l haven't heard
from him since Christmas.

597
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:03,056
lt was just a card.

598
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:07,810
And no kids, actually.

599
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:11,606
lt's a pretty good job, considering,
isn't it? All this, what's happened.

600
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:19,822
- Don't go asking Corp.
- [Leeann] Why? What's the big secret?

601
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,492
lt's no secret.

602
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,077
[Leeann] Well?

603
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:27,914
- You really wanna know?
- [Leeann] Yeah, l really wanna know.

604
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,582
l was a schoolteacher.

605
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,959
[Leeann] A teacher? Are you serious?

606
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:33,628
Yeah.

607
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:37,256
Taught geography
to secondary school kids.

608
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,884
Just a regular job like everyone else.

609
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:43,346
But l'll say this. Um...

610
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:46,391
l'm sorry, Jonesy, but you're wrong.

611
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:48,810
Kids are our only hope now.

612
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:51,729
That's why it's so important
we find other survivors.

613
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:56,025
lf not, our generation's
gonna be the last,

614
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,945
and things will never get back
to the way they were.

615
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:01,989
[Leeann] What about you, Kayne?

616
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:07,954
l look after him.

617
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:13,835
Ha-ha.

618
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,753
You fucks.

619
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:19,257
[Leeann] Here.

620
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:24,554
l'm gonna go pee.

621
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:26,472
Stay close.

622
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:41,154
[muffled breathing]

623
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,009
Leeann, you all right?

624
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:07,054
Leeann?

625
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:12,560
[Carter] Leeann!

626
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:15,980
[man shouts]

627
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,732
lf any of those things eat her...

628
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,196
Fall back behind those trees.

629
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:27,116
[running footsteps]

630
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:39,837
- The cunts were just here.

[Leeann shouts]

640
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:07,824
You're a tough girl
to get hold of, Leeann.

641
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:11,869
Be still. Your friends at the base

642
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:15,581
- Fucking animals!

00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:17,708
[Manny] What are we gonna do with her?

644
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:19,669
[Goke] What do you think, Manny?

645
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:22,380
l'm gonna fucking ruin her.

You already been there, mate.

No, we got something

[Manny laughs, claps]

650
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:36,936
That wasn't nice.

651

Hold her down.

652
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:43,484

until we get clear,

664
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:31,866
then you follow, that's an order.

665
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,910
Carter,

No. We gotta wait for Carter.

675
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:06,817
Look, Carter knows what he's doing.
We've gotta go.

676

687
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:07,294
[sobbing] He didn't wanna come
on this fucking mission.

688
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:08,713
We'll get through this.

689
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:11,257
- We will get to safety.

They'll have their hands full
for a while.

[wind howling]

699

There's a village up ahead.

00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:51,589
OK. We're gonna try and find
a vehicle.

701
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:54,425
But the first sign of trouble,
and we're out of there.

702
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:56,677
There could be hostiles around
so keep your eyes peeled.

703
00:50:56,762 --> 00:51:01,432
Leeann, Jonesy,
do not engage unless l say.

704
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:03,476
OK. Stay sharp.

[whispers] lt's too fucking quiet.
What do you see?

706
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:26,624
[Jonesy whispers] Nothing.

707

00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:10,955
[Kayne] Better be quick.
They'll be more of these.

[Leeann] We need to get out
of this fucking village, now!

726
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:03,799
Kayne, come on, let's move! Kayne!

Kayne, what's up?

731
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,338
Something doesn't feel right.

732
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:58,020
[Jonesy] Scarecrows? What the fuck?

733
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:02,608
You're right.
Something doesn't feel right.

Jones, Leeann, l want you two to head
across to those trees on the other side.

00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:29,259
- Understood? Leeann?

Oh, yeah. Vanessa.

784
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:11,481
She was a right little whore.

786
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:18,947
He was a cunt.

787
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:21,533
[Kayne screams]

788
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:24,411
[Goke] Party's getting started.

789
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:27,497
What the fuck are you doing to her?
You fucks.

790
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:32,294
You talk again,
and l'll blow your fucking head off.

791
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:36,340
[Goke] Calm down, soldier boy.

792
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:38,425
lf he wants to fuck her, he will.

793
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:43,055
Billy! Get in here!

794
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:48,769
Come here.

795
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:52,814
Go now. Go on.

796
01:00:57,737 --> 01:01:01,198
Now, you see, Billy here
likes to build scarecrows.

797
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:02,949
Ain't that right?

798
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:06,953
The kid's a real talent.

799
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:13,502
Do you remember
what we talked about last night?

800
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:15,420
[stammers] Last night, yeah.

801
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,589
Yeah, last night, that's right.
Go on. Tell me.

802
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:22,177
[stammers] We're...
We're gonna fuck them up.

803
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:23,929
[chuckles] Good boy.

804
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:29,393
Now, why don't you show me
on this cunt here.

805
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:33,438
You see him?
You see that filthy uniform?

806
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,982
- [Leeann] Goke, don't!
- Shut the fuck up.

807
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:43,323
Go on, Billy.

808
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:48,036
You want to be part of the group,
you gotta pass the test.

809
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:49,621
Then go fuck him up.

810
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:54,292
Do it!

811
01:01:57,964 --> 01:02:00,132
[grunting]

812
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:02,551
[man] Do it, Billy! Have him!

813
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:04,886
[grunting]

814
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:12,728
Good boy, you're doing well.

815
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:18,483
Good boy.

816
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:23,238
Curtis, keep an eye on them.

817
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:27,242
Any of them moves,
shoot them in the face.

818
01:02:27,326 --> 01:02:29,536
Come on, Billy. Give me that.

819
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:34,166
[Kayne gasping]

820
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:37,252
Look who's here.

821
01:02:37,336 --> 01:02:39,463
Stay there, bitch.

822
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:41,465
[Goke] Billy's here to learn about life.

823
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:46,595
[chuckles] Sure is.
With the big boys now. Huh?

824
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,894
Look at him. Look at him.

825
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:58,064
What's the matter, Billy?

826
01:02:58,149 --> 01:03:00,066
Don't you like her?

827
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:03,570
[Goke] Go on, mate. You like her?

828
01:03:03,696 --> 01:03:07,199
- l do...
- [laughs] Told ya.

829
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:14,039
You so much as move,
l'll cut your throat out.

830
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:16,792
You got me?

831
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:19,878
Billy, hold that.

832
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:23,089
[Kayne screams]

833
01:03:27,386 --> 01:03:30,347
[screaming, moaning]

834
01:03:43,444 --> 01:03:45,904
Now...

835
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:48,990
l spy with my little eye

836
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:51,409
something beginning with "T."

837
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:54,079
What is it, Billy?

838
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:55,580
Billy!

839
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:57,249
[Goke] That'll be titties, Billy.

840
01:03:59,585 --> 01:04:01,503
[laughs] Titties.

841
01:04:01,587 --> 01:04:05,924
Come on. This is for you.
This is all for you.

842
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:10,595
[Billy] Can't.

843
01:04:10,888 --> 01:04:13,014
Can't! l can't!

844
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:15,684
[Goke] How about we leave you
on your own?

845
01:04:15,768 --> 01:04:18,186
We're the ones that found you.
Remember when we found you?

846
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:20,522
[Billy] Don't wanna be on my own!

847
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:23,108
Yeah, Billy, you won't survive
without us.

848
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:25,151
You'll be all on your own.

849
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:27,654
Now do it.

850
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:29,030
Time to be a man.

851
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:31,449
- [Kayne sobs] No.
- Get 'em off.

852
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:37,455
- [Kayne] No! No!
- Come on!

853
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:42,085
- Come on.
- [sobbing] No!

854
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:45,630
What the fuck?

855
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:48,258
You can do it, right?

856
01:04:48,342 --> 01:04:50,260
Get that thing in there.

857
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:54,472
- Fucking be a man!
- [Kayne sobbing]

858
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:04,774
- [Manny laughs]
- [Billy cries]

859
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:07,986
Fuck him.

860
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:11,573
l'll show you, bitch.
Humiliate my friend like that?

861
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,244
Billy.

862
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:18,079
You can't let her do that to you.

863
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:21,416
Use that knife... and cut her.

864
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:22,709
Cut her here.

865
01:05:25,379 --> 01:05:29,132
[Kayne gasping] No. No. [sobbing]

866
01:05:29,967 --> 01:05:31,468
- Cut her!
- [screaming]

867
01:05:31,552 --> 01:05:34,429
- Deeper! Deeper! Cut her!
- [screaming]

868
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:36,890
Fucking cut her!

869
01:05:36,974 --> 01:05:40,060
[Kayne screaming]

870
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:47,651
- [screaming stops]
- [Billy grunting, panting]

871
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:56,284
[laughing]

872
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:58,453
[Manny] Fucking hell.

873
01:05:58,537 --> 01:06:02,624
[Goke] You're sick, Billy.
You're fucking sick.

874
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:04,876
Fuck me, our boy did it.

875
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:06,753
[Goke] You're part
of the club now, Billy.

876
01:06:09,173 --> 01:06:10,840
Your turn now, mate.

877
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:12,425
[Goke] All right.

878
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:19,683
Curtis.
Bring that soldier boy in here.

879
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:21,810
[clattering]

880
01:06:21,894 --> 01:06:23,603
What the fuck's going on back there?

881
01:06:23,688 --> 01:06:27,482
- [gunfire]
- [Manny] Fuck. Fuck's going on?

882
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:37,325
[Manny] Guys! Fuck, Goke,
there's another one of them.

883
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:39,202
[gunfire]

884
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:46,001
[Maddox] Nicholson,
they got Kayne in the other room.

885
01:06:48,796 --> 01:06:50,630
[Nicholson] Do it now!

886
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:52,132
Drop the fucking knife!

887
01:06:52,216 --> 01:06:54,509
[Maddox]
Nicholson, lower your weapon.

888
01:06:54,593 --> 01:06:56,594
[Nicholson] Drop that fucking knife!

889
01:06:57,888 --> 01:06:59,639
[gunfire]

890
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:08,440
[metal clattering]

891
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:13,903
- [gunfire]
- [Maddox] Get back, get back, get back.

892
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:21,619
Pussy!

893
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:51,149
Fuck.

894
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:56,404
Come on.

895
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:00,617
[Maddox] Jesus fucking Christ.

896
01:08:03,704 --> 01:08:05,663
[Jonesy] How did you find us, Nicholson?

897
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:09,292
l've been tracking you for days.

898
01:08:09,376 --> 01:08:11,753
Got fucking lucky finding you.

899
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:15,965
[Jonesy] They would have killed us
for sure. They got Carter too.

900
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:18,885
[Maddox] They've been after us
for some time.

901
01:08:18,969 --> 01:08:22,097
Fucking scum. [sniffles]

902
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:24,432
Oh, fuck's sake.

903
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:26,935
He's just a kid, he didn't know
what he was doing.

904
01:08:27,019 --> 01:08:28,603
[Nicholson] Yeah.

905
01:08:28,687 --> 01:08:30,647
You didn't need to shoot him.

906
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:35,151
[Maddox] We need to bury her.

907
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:38,071
[Leeann] Remember what you did to me?

908
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,703
[coughs, moans]

909
01:08:47,873 --> 01:08:49,874
Hi, Leeann.

910
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:51,793
[groans]

911
01:08:54,421 --> 01:08:57,173
[laughs] That's a big gun.

912
01:08:59,885 --> 01:09:02,762
What's the matter?

913
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,848
You look angry.

914
01:09:10,312 --> 01:09:19,237
[gunshot]

915
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:23,533
[muffled breathing]

916
01:09:40,092 --> 01:09:42,594
[wind howling]

917
01:09:47,099 --> 01:09:49,392
[Jonesy] Anyone wanna say anything?

918
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:01,487
[Jonesy] Leeann, take this.

919
01:10:18,505 --> 01:10:20,798
At least your burden's gone, Kayne.

920
01:10:25,721 --> 01:10:27,680
Maddox.

921
01:10:28,974 --> 01:10:32,810
l think you gotta tell us
everything you know.

922
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:36,898
l heard you by the comms room
with Andrews.

923
01:10:36,982 --> 01:10:40,902
- The other night. What was it?
- [Nicholson] Maddox?

924
01:10:40,986 --> 01:10:43,321
[Jonesy] Well, what is it we weren't
supposed to tell Carter?

925
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:48,910
We heard a message on the radio
about an operation

926
01:10:48,994 --> 01:10:51,996
to eradicate the threat, entirely.

927
01:10:53,332 --> 01:10:56,751
lt seems the UK has been the hardest hit
by this thing.

928
01:10:56,835 --> 01:11:00,588
And once those boats leave tomorrow...

929
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:02,465
...that's it.

930
01:11:02,549 --> 01:11:05,718
They're calling it Operation lnferno.

931
01:11:05,803 --> 01:11:09,597
Pretty soon, this entire country
is gonna be one big fucking graveyard.

932
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:11,641
They can't do that!

933
01:11:11,725 --> 01:11:14,435
They can, and they will.

934
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,646
[distant rumbling]

935
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:18,606
[Leeann] lt's already started.

936
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:21,734
We'll be at Hope's Point by nightfall.
Come on, let's move.

937
01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:25,029
Give me that.

938
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:58,563
Fifth Battalion.

939
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:01,399
[distant explosion]

940
01:12:19,209 --> 01:12:21,252
[muffled breathing]

941
01:12:46,653 --> 01:12:48,780
[Nicholson] Jesus Christ.

942
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:52,283
[Leeann] All of them.

943
01:12:54,328 --> 01:12:56,913
[Jonesy]
They must have swarmed in.

944
01:12:56,997 --> 01:12:59,207
Overrun before they knew it.

945
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:03,544
[Leeann] What...
What about the broadcast?

946
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:05,880
[Maddox] We need to go inside
and check the radio bunker.

947
01:13:05,964 --> 01:13:07,465
There might still be survivors inside.

948
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:11,511
Keep your eyes peeled,
there may be hostiles around.

949
01:13:11,595 --> 01:13:13,471
lt's not over yet.

950
01:13:52,219 --> 01:13:55,763
OK, Nicholson. You wait for us here,
keep a lookout.

951
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:57,932
You see anything at all,
you let us know.

952
01:13:58,016 --> 01:13:59,350
Copy that.

953
01:14:15,534 --> 01:14:17,702
[Leeann] Oh, my God.

954
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:30,715
Last stand.

955
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:34,302
This leads down to the comms room.
Stay sharp.

956
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:25,228
[wind howling]

957
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:31,400
[Jonesy] What the fuck's that?

958
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:33,945
[Maddox] Must lead further down
into the complex.

959
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:34,005
OK.

960
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:44,473
[Jonesy] Oh, my God.

961
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:46,392
What the fuck is going on?

962
01:16:47,728 --> 01:16:49,770
[Maddox] Jesus Christ.

963
01:16:52,733 --> 01:16:55,192
[Leeann] We are the last, aren't we?

964
01:16:59,031 --> 01:17:01,365
What do we do now, Maddox?

965
01:17:02,659 --> 01:17:05,953
We can get to the boats.
We can still get out of this.

966
01:17:06,038 --> 01:17:07,246
Come on, move it.

967
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:10,833
[Jonesy] They're all gone,
no one's left.

968
01:17:10,917 --> 01:17:12,168
[Maddox] We can still get out of this.

969
01:17:12,252 --> 01:17:14,879
Jones, you and l will head down
the beach. We'll check on the boats,

970
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:18,674
- and we'll move at first light.
- Maddox! There's no one left.

971
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:20,509
We need to hold this bunker.

972
01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:23,346
l'm still following orders!
This island is dead!

973
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:25,973
Jones, l need your help.
Corporal Nicholson.

974
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:31,395
Jez, Jez, l need you to stay
with Leeann until we return.

975
01:17:52,876 --> 01:17:57,004
[Jonesy] l don't get it. There's
signal fires, but where are they?

976
01:17:57,089 --> 01:17:59,423
Where the fuck are the boats?
They've gone without us, Maddox!

977
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:04,178
No. They were waiting for them.

978
01:18:04,262 --> 01:18:06,889
- [Jonesy] What do you mean?
- l was wrong.

979
01:18:06,973 --> 01:18:10,851
They were waiting to be rescued,
but the boats must have taken too long.

980
01:18:10,936 --> 01:18:13,229
[Jonesy] Then we need
to get out of here.

981
01:18:13,313 --> 01:18:16,857
No. The message we intercepted
said they leave in two days.

982
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:19,151
That's tomorrow morning.

983
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:21,237
They're still coming, Jonesy.

984
01:18:21,321 --> 01:18:23,239
[Jonesy] We can't rely on that message.

985
01:18:23,323 --> 01:18:25,324
lt's our last fucking chance of hope.

986
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:27,326
Help me stoke the fires.

987
01:18:27,411 --> 01:18:29,537
They need to be able
to see the shoreline.

988
01:18:29,621 --> 01:18:32,707
- Come on!
- [jet engine roaring overhead]

989
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:34,208
Help me.

990
01:18:34,292 --> 01:18:35,751
[Jonesy] We've gotta
get back to the base.

991
01:18:37,462 --> 01:18:39,422
Stop fucking filming and help me!

992
01:18:39,506 --> 01:18:42,383
They could be out there now
looking for our signal.

993
01:18:42,467 --> 01:18:44,885
[Jonesy] We've gotta get back
to the bunker, Maddox.

994
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:46,887
And then what?!

995
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:49,890
This is our last chance
at survival, Jones.

996
01:18:52,269 --> 01:18:54,562
[Jonesy] Come with me.
lt's safer underground.

997
01:18:54,646 --> 01:18:57,815
l'm staying, Jonesy.
These boats are coming, believe me.

998
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:05,322
[Jonesy] Fuck's sake, Maddox!

999
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:07,742
You said it's safe
if we stick together.

1000
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:13,247
- Maddox, listen to me!
- Just go then!

1001
01:19:13,331 --> 01:19:15,624
Go!

1002
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:17,835
l have to wait here.

1003
01:19:17,919 --> 01:19:19,503
Please.

1004
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:32,725
Hello!

1005
01:19:44,821 --> 01:19:47,072
[muffled breathing]

1006
01:20:00,378 --> 01:20:02,630
You shouldn't have fucking left him!

1007
01:20:02,714 --> 01:20:05,299
[Jonesy] l had no choice, Leeann.
He wouldn't come back.

1008
01:20:06,092 --> 01:20:07,343
Here.

1009
01:20:08,428 --> 01:20:11,263
- Which way to the tunnels?
- That way.

1010
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:12,681
Follow me.

1011
01:20:44,798 --> 01:20:47,842
[zombies moaning]

1012
01:20:47,926 --> 01:20:50,344
[Nicholson] Fall back! Fall back!

1013
01:20:50,428 --> 01:20:52,388
[gunfire]

1014
01:21:01,314 --> 01:21:03,357
Fall back! Fall back!

1015
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:21,292
[thumping]

1016
01:21:21,376 --> 01:21:23,627
lt's fucking blocked!
We can't get through!

1017
01:21:27,757 --> 01:21:30,593
[Jonesy] What we gonna do?
What we gonna do?!

1018
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,137
We fight!

1019
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:37,641
[grunting, shouting]

1020
01:21:53,116 --> 01:21:56,160
- [yelling]
- [Jonesy] Nicholson!

1021
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:02,917
[Leeann grunting]

1022
01:22:03,001 --> 01:22:05,836
[Jonesy] Leeann! Just come on, get back.

1023
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:16,263
[Leeann] Fuck!

1024
01:22:20,226 --> 01:22:22,645
[grunting]

1025
01:22:22,729 --> 01:22:24,647
[Jonesy] Oh no! Leeann!

1026
01:22:26,858 --> 01:22:30,110
[Leeann moaning, screaming] Jonesy!

1027
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:38,202
This is Nick Jones.

1028
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:40,955
l don't know
if anyone's gonna see this...

1029
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:44,291
lt's over. For me, it's over.

1030
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,884
[whimpering]

1031
01:22:56,888 --> 01:22:59,139
[zombie growling]

1032
01:22:59,224 --> 01:23:00,474
- [screaming]
- [gunshot]

1033

[muffled breathing]

1034

[helicopter flying overhead]

1035
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:27,084
[voice echoes] Leave it, Jonesy.

1036
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:39,430
[waves sloshing]

1037
01:24:41,951 --> 01:24:51,752
[speaks foreign language]

1038
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:55,714
l don't understand you.

1039
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:05,557
We're in England now,
you need speak English.

1040
01:25:07,685 --> 01:25:10,270
l'm sorry. She's scared.

1041
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:12,731
We both are.

1042
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:18,862
lt's taken us a long time to get here.

1043
01:25:20,073 --> 01:25:23,826
We came from Holland. Rotterdam.

1044
01:25:24,702 --> 01:25:27,663
lt's gone.

1045
01:25:27,747 --> 01:25:29,206
The whole city's on fire.

1046
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:33,377
lt seems like all of Europe is.

1047
01:25:35,547 --> 01:25:39,716
They said to come here... the UK.

1048
01:25:40,844 --> 01:25:46,390
lt's an island... so it's safe. Right?

1049
01:25:50,812 --> 01:25:53,230
[woman] They said survivors
are gathering here.

1050
01:25:53,314 --> 01:25:55,691
ls it true?

1051
01:25:55,775 --> 01:25:58,110
Can you help us?
