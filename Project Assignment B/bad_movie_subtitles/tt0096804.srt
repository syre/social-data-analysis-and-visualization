LOS ANGELES 1979

2
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:51,708
Come on!

3
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:04,792
- Yeah... yeah!
- Come on!

4
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:20,375
Let's try and do this nice and easy,
without any blood.

5
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:22,750
Like a cobra, huh?

6
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,292
And if we can't?

7
00:01:25,542 --> 00:01:27,875
I said we can try, Andreas.

8
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,875
Here in America, there's always
some smartass who tries to be a hero.

9
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:38,083
We'll soon be out of America.
We'll have money to build my new plant.

10
00:01:38,292 --> 00:01:41,500
We've got a great future together.
Don't blow it.

11
00:01:54,917 --> 00:01:57,958
Hey, Sean. When's your dad coming on?

12
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:01,250
One more fight
and they'll start the main event.

13
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:03,458
Where's Sean?

14
00:02:03,667 --> 00:02:07,958
I don't know. This kid's never around
when you want him.

15
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:17,583
Come on!

16
00:02:20,417 --> 00:02:24,167
Yo, work this shoulder.

17
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,625
Now breathe.

18
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:33,667
Go, go! Go!

19
00:02:33,917 --> 00:02:37,000
- Hey, Sean! Sean, where you going?
- I'll be right back.

20
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:41,500
- Wait! I'll come with you.
- No. I'll be back before the next.

21
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:00,458
Go.

22
00:03:40,917 --> 00:03:43,167
Use the crowd noise to cover our move.

23
00:04:00,792 --> 00:04:04,833
- Get up! Get up against the wall!
- If they move, kill them.

24
00:04:23,042 --> 00:04:24,750
- Come here, boy.
- Sean!

25
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,750
- Stand back!
- Don't shoot my son!

26
00:04:28,042 --> 00:04:29,375
No!

27
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,708
- Sean, look out!
- Dad!

28
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:43,958
Dad...

29
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,792
Help him, Izumo. Help him!

30
00:04:55,667 --> 00:04:59,167
I'm bleeding. The little brat bit me!

31
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:07,458
<i>- Izumo? Is he...?
- I'm afraid he is.</i>

32
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:24,500
Sean, in the last months you have
proven yourself a worthy student.

33
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:26,833
Thank you, Master.

34
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:31,792
Now it is time to continue your training

35
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:36,250
<i>in the art of mikkyo, the secret doctrine.</i>

36
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,292
First position.

37
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,292
Second position.

38
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,625
Third position.

39
00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:51,667
Fourth position.

40
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,083
Fifth position.

41
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:58,333
Very good, Sean. First position.

42
00:05:58,542 --> 00:06:01,000
First strike. Second position.

43
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:04,375
Third position.

44
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,542
Angle the sword down.

45
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,917
Fourth position.

46
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:12,375
Fifth position. Well done, Sean.

47
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:22,542
<i>That's OK.</i>

48
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:25,667
Four, five.

49
00:06:25,917 --> 00:06:27,917
One, two.

50
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:31,958
- One, two...
- Ow!

51
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:38,583
<i>Your body is merely
the vehicle of your soul.</i>

52
00:06:38,792 --> 00:06:43,417
<i>Ultimate physical power can be achieved
only by way of spiritual power.</i>

53
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:48,083
<i>Your mind and soul over your body.
Remember that, Sean.</i>

54
00:06:48,292 --> 00:06:51,042
<i>Mind and soul over your body.</i>

55
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,458
Sean?

56
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,333
Do you remember the first technique?

57
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,667
It's been a long time.

58
00:07:09,917 --> 00:07:11,667
<i>Hai!</i>

59
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:32,917
<i>We have overcome your tragedy
and turned it into opportunity.</i>

60
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:37,250
<i>My doubts and fears of bringing you here
are at rest.</i>

61
00:07:37,542 --> 00:07:41,583
<i>Your ability shows that
a greater destiny awaits you.</i>

62
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:52,917
<i>Now you must seek out this destiny alone.</i>

63
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:56,417
<i>Your training is at last complete, Sean.</i>

64
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,958
<i>Now you are a ninja.</i>

PORT SAN LUCO, TRIANA
PRESENT DAY

66
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,333
Gentlemen, may I have your attention?

67
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:30,417
Thank you for coming. Please be seated.

68
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:33,708
Today is really a great day.

69
00:08:33,917 --> 00:08:37,292
This project has been
over ten years in research.

70
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:42,417
But I'm glad that I can tell you that there
will be no more inefficient hijackings.

71
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:47,042
No more bungled kidnappings
or mistimed bombings.

72
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:54,417
Now terrorism can be scientifically
focused to be totally effective.

73
00:08:54,542 --> 00:08:57,583
It all sounds quite impressive, Doctor.

74
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:01,167
But untiI you prove its ability
to defeat any human -

75
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:06,375
or should I say even the strongest
human? - they're not buying.

76
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:11,833
Very good, GeneraI Andreas.
That's a good challenge. I'll accept it, too.

77
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:17,042
We'll find a superhuman and show you
the power of our new experiment.

78
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:20,542
We'd be ready to strike within a month,
if not sooner.

79
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:39,583
Things seem to be going nicely.

80
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:44,500
Except for GeneraI Andreas. I don't know
how you tolerate his incessant demands.

81
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,708
His dissatisfaction
can work to our advantage.

82
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:53,167
UntiI he's outlived his usefulness, let him
think he runs the island. It doesn't matter.

83
00:09:55,417 --> 00:09:58,167
<i>Air Triana announces
the departure of its flight...</i>

84
00:09:58,167 --> 00:10:01,875
Excuse me. You're Sean Davidson, right?

85
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,583
Yeah.

86
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:07,750
- Curtis. Curtis Jackson!
- That's right.

87
00:10:07,917 --> 00:10:11,333
- Good to see you again, man.
- Good to see you.

88
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,875
- Fighting lightweight?
- I'm just gonna do the sword competition.

89
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:20,792
<i>Excuse me. Sorry. You made the cover
of Inside Karate this month.</i>

90
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,667
- Dex.
- Hi, Dex. Sean Davidson.

91
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:27,208
Good to meet you, man.
It's a pleasure. It really is.

92
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:32,083
<i>- Hey, this is Curtis Jackson.
- Dex.</i>

93
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:36,500
- Of course. The sword man.
- That's right.

94
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:40,875
<i>Boy. The English look, uh...
very pale, wouldn't you say?</i>

95
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:46,000
That's Joe Simpson there. He's tough.

96
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,000
I see Tom Wright from Australia's
here also.

97
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:54,500
<i>I ain't worried. I mean, uh...
we're Americans, right?</i>

98
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:57,833
- This your first time?
- Yeah.

99
00:10:58,042 --> 00:11:01,042
<i>- Come on.
- ... please board immediately.</i>

100

102
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:47,167
Oh.

103
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:58,167
- Well, they've all arrived.
- Great. Please, sit down.

104
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,875
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thanks.

105
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:06,292
Arranging that tournament was actually
a fabulous idea. Really fabulous.

106
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,042
Well, only if the right one is here.

107
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:12,875
Remember, GeneraI Andreas
asked for a superhuman.

108
00:12:13,042 --> 00:12:15,792
Yes. That is the question.

109
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:23,083
I saw the American team at the airport.
I think the guy we're after is one of them.

110
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,958
Really?

111
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:31,750
Very good. Watch the tournament.
If you think he's the one, let me know.

112
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,958
- Absolutely. I will.
- Thank you.

139

No point.

140
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:44,333
<i>Despite Davidson's contact hit, it was
a no point. Simpson was out of bounds.</i>

<i>Continue.</i>

142

<i>Sean Davidson wasn't going
to leave anything to chance.</i>

<i>He defeated Simpson
with a fast kick to win the match.</i>

145
00:16:06,917 --> 00:16:12,708
Wow, would you look at those two!
I'm gonna get us a table with them, OK?

146
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,917
If he introduces me again
as the karate champion...

147
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:19,250
- May we join you, my friends and I?
- Yeah.

148

Guys, come on over for a beer.

149

- Powerhouse.

154

I'm Dex.
Kind of the... heartthrob of the group.

155
00:16:44,417 --> 00:16:48,125
- Your best one yet!
- Can we have three beers, please?

156
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:51,625
- No. Make mine a Coke, if you will.
- Make that two.

157
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:55,875
<i>- Are you with the tournament?
- We represent the United States.</i>

158
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,458
- Who do you represent?
- Myself.

159
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:04,458
Yourself? I'm very glad.
Perhaps there is a God.

160
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:07,833
Thank you. You're very charming.

161
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,333
<i>Hey, Sean, what's up?</i>

162
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,833
Can you keep up with him? OK.

163
00:17:18,042 --> 00:17:18,833
Go.

164
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:04,417
Hey. An orientaI man, older guy,
and a couple of other guys. What room?

165
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,833
<i>What room?</i>

166
00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:14,125
Upstairs on the right.

167
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,083
Izumo.

168
00:19:18,042 --> 00:19:19,417
Sean.

169
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,583
It's you.

170
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:26,042
Izumo, what's going on?

171
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:30,083
What are you doing here?
Who are those people?

172
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,667
<i>Sean! Help me!</i>

173
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,333
Sean!

174
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,000
Sean!

175
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,042
Help, Sean!

176
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,708
<i>Sean!</i>

177
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:13,542
This way, Sean!

178
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,875
Izumo!

179
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:55,292
What the hell?

180
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,917
This comb has history. Yeah, it's...

181
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:27,750
Jackson! Jackson.

182
00:24:28,042 --> 00:24:30,833
- I've got to talk to you.
- Sure. Excuse me.

183
00:24:31,042 --> 00:24:33,625
- Come here, man.
- Yeah. How you doin'?

184
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:35,833
- Later, girls!
- What happened to you?

185
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:37,667
I'm not sure.

186
00:24:37,917 --> 00:24:39,708
You're a mess.

187
00:24:39,917 --> 00:24:41,458
Look...

188
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:47,292
I have a master, Izumo.

189
00:24:48,417 --> 00:24:52,500
He raised me since my father's killing

190
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:54,833
in the way of ninja.

191
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,500
- You're a ninja?
- Yes.

192
00:24:57,833 --> 00:25:00,125
So that explains a few things.

193
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:04,250
I saw Izumo here.

194
00:25:04,458 --> 00:25:07,917
He was being kidnapped by the ninja.

195
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:10,833
The ninja. Not again.

196
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:13,833
I thought ninja only hung out in Japan.

197
00:25:14,042 --> 00:25:16,625
No, they were here.

198
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:21,000
Look... I don't want you guys
to get involved.

199
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:24,250
I'm in, buddy.

200
00:25:24,458 --> 00:25:27,375
OK, but what about the tournament?

201
00:25:28,167 --> 00:25:31,667
To me, Izumo is much more important.

202
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:38,292
- Dr Saxon, sorry for barging in.
- How are we doing, my dear?

203
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:41,083
He fell for the Izumo disguise.

204
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:44,417
But he's so good he got away from us.

205
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:48,458
Perhaps we should use
more direct methods.

206
00:25:48,667 --> 00:25:51,917
No, no, no.
Chan Lee is right in her pursuaI.

207
00:25:52,167 --> 00:25:56,167
If she hasn't ensnared him yet
it's because he's doubly powerfuI,

208
00:25:56,333 --> 00:25:58,167
in body and mind.

209
00:25:58,333 --> 00:26:03,167
I have every confidence in you, Chan Lee.
Bring him back, OK?

210
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,417
Thank you.

211
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:16,167
<i>- You guys hungry?
- I don't think I want any of this here.</i>

212
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:23,125
Let's go grab some of that Caribbean food.
Maybe a glass or two of wine, huh?

213
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:26,750
We could get some dates.
What do you say, guys, huh?

214
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:28,667
Sounds good, huh, guy?

215
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:30,375
Wait.

216
00:26:31,917 --> 00:26:34,208
- What is it?
- I don't know.

217
00:26:35,792 --> 00:26:37,208
A feeling.

218
00:26:40,667 --> 00:26:43,000
<i>Who the hell are these guys?</i>

219
00:26:43,167 --> 00:26:45,792
You gotta be kidding.

220
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:50,542
Well, got no choice.

221
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:54,583
- OK. Let's spread out.
- Hm.

222
00:26:55,792 --> 00:26:57,167
Right. OK.

223
00:27:23,417 --> 00:27:26,000
Can't believe I'm looking for ninjas.

224
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:29,167
I thought I stopped doing this
when I left Joe back in the army.

225
00:29:43,292 --> 00:29:44,917
What a damn day.

226
00:29:50,417 --> 00:29:52,500
Where's Izumo? Tell me!

227
00:30:02,042 --> 00:30:04,333
- Sean.
- Jackson. You all right?

228
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,292
- Yeah.
- Hey, guys. I got one. Guess what?

229
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,750
- What are you doing up there?
- I saw where some went. There.

230
00:30:13,958 --> 00:30:17,333
OK, come on down. Let's go.

231
00:30:17,458 --> 00:30:19,167
Right this way.

232
00:30:20,833 --> 00:30:25,375
<i>They're doing something in there
they want nobody to know about.</i>

233
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:31,083
<i>- We're being watched.
- Yep.</i>

234
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:33,292
Like they've been waiting for us.

235
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:35,542
It's all too convenient.

236
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,500
Would someone mind telling me
what's going on?

237
00:30:39,833 --> 00:30:43,292
<i>- It's saiminjutsu.
- Huh?</i>

238
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:46,292
Way of the mind game.

239
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,583
- Which is?
- We're being manipulated.

240
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:02,542
I'm here to see the minister's secretary.

241
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,958
- Right through there, please.
- There?

242
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:16,542
Sir. May I help you?

243
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:22,000
Yes. Hi, uh... I'm Sean Davidson.
I called your office about Mr Izumo.

244
00:31:22,292 --> 00:31:25,333
- Yes, they told me. Please take a seat.
- Thank you.

245
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:28,125
I've done some checking for you,

246
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:31,708
but there's been nothing
on anyone named Izumo

247
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:35,167
or any Japanese gentleman
entering the country.

248
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:38,500
No, but I saw him here.

249
00:31:40,292 --> 00:31:44,750
I have reason to believe that he's being
held at East Bay Laboratories.

250
00:31:45,042 --> 00:31:50,792
Please understand. East Bay is a scientific
research centre. It's low-profile.

251
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:54,500
Dr Saxon is doing
some very valuable work there.

252
00:31:54,667 --> 00:31:58,583
- What kind of work?
- They develop and manufacture drugs.

253
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,792
- Drugs?
- Yes.

254
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:06,125
The kind that cure people. The kind
that can't be made in the United States.

255
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:10,500
- Is there a problem?
- No, sir. No problem, everything's fine.

256
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:14,333
Would you bring me the file
on East Bay Labs, please?

257
00:32:15,958 --> 00:32:19,542
- Excuse me...
- Oh, I'm sorry. I really am very busy.

258
00:32:19,667 --> 00:32:22,833
I have to attend to the minister's business.

259
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:27,917
- Could you just tell me...
- I am busy. I hope I've been of some help.

260
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:33,208
Fine. Thank you.

261
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:00,333
You know, I keep getting the feeling
they're all around us.

262
00:33:00,542 --> 00:33:01,958
Who?

263
00:33:03,708 --> 00:33:05,792
What's up?

264
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:09,333
I got nowhere
with the minister's secretary today.

265
00:33:09,583 --> 00:33:12,167
Hm. Tell me something new.

266
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:16,667
Sean, how about if we spoke
to the locaI police?

267
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:22,250
No, we're gonna need
a more aggressive approach.

268
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,458
Hm. I'll give it a crack anyway.

269
00:33:25,667 --> 00:33:29,042
Who knows?
Maybe they speak my language.

270
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:33,792
- Thanks. Appreciate it.
- OK.

271
00:33:42,167 --> 00:33:44,917
- Excuse me.
- Address?

272
00:33:45,208 --> 00:33:46,917
Excuse me.

273
00:33:48,958 --> 00:33:50,500
- Excuse me.
- What?

274
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:55,208
Who can I see about a missing person?

275
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:57,333
Captain.

276
00:33:58,375 --> 00:33:59,792
Inside.

277
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:04,833
So none of you guys
have ever seen this man?

278
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:09,375
Perhaps he doesn't want to be found.

279
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,875
People come here to get away,

280
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:17,250
from other people,
from financiaI problems, to get married.

281
00:34:17,458 --> 00:34:20,958
Yeah, yeah. Captain,
I think you're starting to jerk me around.

282
00:34:21,167 --> 00:34:23,583
What makes him so speciaI?

283
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:27,417
Number one,
my friend saw him kidnapped.

284
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:32,875
And number two, we think
he's being held in East Bay Labs.

285
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:36,917
East Bay Labs is one of this community's
strongest supporters.

286
00:34:37,167 --> 00:34:41,333
Their business is making drugs,
not trouble.

287
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,500
Well, Captain, baby,
that's kind of a contradiction.

288
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:49,083
If they're not looking for trouble,
why all the high security over there, hm?

289
00:34:49,375 --> 00:34:52,917
To protect their work from thieves
and prying eyes.

290
00:34:53,042 --> 00:34:56,667
- And...
- I resemble that remark.

291
00:34:57,792 --> 00:35:00,833
Look, Lancelot, here's some money.

292
00:35:01,042 --> 00:35:03,958
Now go see a movie. Cheer up!

293
00:35:05,417 --> 00:35:07,917
- Look, my man...
- I'm not your man.

294
00:35:08,208 --> 00:35:12,792
Now, look. The less straight answers I get,
the more curious I'm gonna be.

295
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,708
I wouldn't follow that route if I were you.

296
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,708
- Are you threatening me?
- Not yet.

297
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:24,250
Remember, you and your friends
were invited as guests to this island.

298
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:28,625
- Don't abuse your privilege.
- Or what?

299
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:31,708
Good day, sir.

300
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:39,833
You're breathing my air.

301
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,292
Give me back my money.

302
00:35:53,958 --> 00:35:58,625
<i>Invading bacteriaI phages,
penetrating and destroying cells.</i>

303
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:02,792
Mutating viruses change form so quickly.

304
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,417
Before a vaccine can be invented, they've
changed form and become immune.

305
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:13,667
This is the basis for the most potentially
dangerous warfare known to mankind.

306
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:16,583
Germ warfare.

307
00:36:18,542 --> 00:36:22,125
When will you show us your experiment
and stop lecturing?

308
00:36:22,292 --> 00:36:26,417
Excuse me, GeneraI Andreas.
This is not a military sideshow.

309
00:36:26,625 --> 00:36:29,542
This is a precise scientific exercise.

310
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:33,042
AII I'm asking of you
is just three more days.

311
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:37,042
Then I'll show you the most
fantastic scientific advancement

312
00:36:37,292 --> 00:36:39,417
ever known to mankind.

313
00:36:39,625 --> 00:36:42,750
Three more days.
That's not too much to ask.

314
00:36:45,375 --> 00:36:50,083
The other guests seem content
to wait for your demonstration.

315
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:52,875
But I have never been a patient man.

316
00:36:53,042 --> 00:36:58,958
Listen, my impatient man. I've given you
your power and I can take it away.

317
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:02,958
These nice people seem content to wait.
So you be content.

318
00:37:03,167 --> 00:37:06,083
Relax. Have a nice day.

319
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:08,333
All right.

320
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,375
Drive.

321
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:21,458
Chan Lee. How are we doing?

322
00:37:21,583 --> 00:37:24,375
I have never failed you.

323
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:29,375
He's not like the others. He's ninja.
Why have you chosen him?

324
00:37:29,667 --> 00:37:33,333
He's gonna show people
who live off the miseries of others

325
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:36,250
that they're vulnerable like anybody else.

326
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:40,417
I can't see why anyone would want
to stop a cure for disease.

327
00:37:40,667 --> 00:37:45,917
I've seen men do a lot worse things
than that. All right? Just believe me.

328
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:51,000
We must find out
what they've done with Izumo.

329
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:55,875
<i>There's a lot of clues. We need
to put it together, make sense out of it.</i>

330
00:37:58,292 --> 00:38:01,417
It's time to pay a visit to East Bay Labs.

331
00:38:03,917 --> 00:38:07,750
- How do we get in?
- Nobody's afraid of flying, are they?

332
00:38:35,458 --> 00:38:39,375
- OK. Do your thing.
- Piece of cake. I'll take care of it.

333
00:38:41,583 --> 00:38:43,000
<i>Come on, Dexter.</i>

334
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:46,000
Let's go, Junior.

335
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,000
You're mine.

336
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,875
- Can he really do this?
- I hope so.

337
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:56,208
Junior, come on.

338
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:58,958
- I'll tell you one thing.
- What?

339
00:38:58,958 --> 00:39:03,417
- It has nothing to do with what you hear.
- OK, come on, do it.

340
00:39:04,667 --> 00:39:06,875
- It's about time.
- Good.

341
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,750
Here we go.

342
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:11,167
<i>- Wow.
- Boy, there they are.</i>

343
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,375
Two of us have got a ride.

344
00:39:15,583 --> 00:39:20,667
- I'm gonna try and get this truck started.
- OK. We'll get this.

345
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:24,958
<i>Curtis will wait
and get us out with the truck, all right?</i>

346
00:39:33,083 --> 00:39:36,917
<i>- You still with me, Dex?
- Right behind you, Ace.</i>

347
00:39:44,625 --> 00:39:46,792
<i>Ever flown one of these before, Dexter?</i>

348
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,542
<i>Lots of times.</i>

349
00:39:48,708 --> 00:39:50,792
<i>Whoa... Aah! Whoa...!</i>

350
00:39:53,417 --> 00:39:58,667
<i>When we hit the lab, I'll find Izumo.
You get Curtis inside with the truck.</i>

351
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:21,750
<i>- Any sign of Curtis?
- Yeah. There he is. And he's cooking.</i>

352
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:34,417
<i>Sean, is it OK if I go down
and give Mr Jackson a little hello?</i>

353
00:40:34,542 --> 00:40:38,958
<i>I think we'd better keep our minds
on the mission, Dex.</i>

354
00:40:39,208 --> 00:40:41,625
<i>No problem, Sean. It's all under control.</i>

355
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:49,167
<i>- Sean, I've got a problem!
- Don't panic. Try the gas pump.</i>

356
00:40:49,292 --> 00:40:51,625
<i>The line's burst. I'm going down!</i>

357
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:55,083
<i>Pull the engine cord.</i>

358
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:58,208
<i>- It's not catching.
- Keep trying, Dexter.</i>

359
00:40:58,458 --> 00:41:00,833
<i>Come on, baby. Don't do this to me.</i>

360
00:41:01,583 --> 00:41:02,917
<i>OK, you got it.</i>

361
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:06,167
<i>Sean, I'm losing control.</i>

362
00:41:06,292 --> 00:41:09,292
<i>Push up on the bar and level off.</i>

363
00:41:09,542 --> 00:41:12,458
<i>Now try the engine again.</i>

364
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:21,250
<i>- Sean, I'm gonna hit!
- Don't quit, Dex. Start that engine.</i>

365
00:41:24,042 --> 00:41:25,625
<i>You did it, Dex.</i>

366
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:30,083
<i>The engine will never make it.
I've got to try to land on that road.</i>

367
00:41:30,375 --> 00:41:33,333
<i>That road's too rough.
You'll smash that thing apart.</i>

368
00:41:33,542 --> 00:41:35,625
<i>I've got to do something right now.</i>

369
00:41:35,833 --> 00:41:38,708
<i>You're gonna land
on the back of the truck.</i>

370
00:41:38,958 --> 00:41:43,375
<i>- No way! I'll never make it.
- It's your only chance. You've got to try.</i>

371
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:45,333
<i>- But, Sean...
- Do it, Dexter.</i>

372
00:41:47,167 --> 00:41:50,583
<i>Just relax, Dex. Let the controls flow.</i>

373
00:41:51,917 --> 00:41:54,000
<i>All right. Here I go.</i>

374
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:02,875
<i>- I don't like this, Sean.
- Careful, Dex. You're going too fast.</i>

375
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,458
<i>- That was too close.
- This is crazy. I can't do it.</i>

376
00:42:09,708 --> 00:42:14,625
<i>Try again, Dex. This time I'll talk you
through it. Circle around.</i>

377
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:22,292
<i>Last chance, Sean.
The engine's gonna go any second.</i>

378
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:27,292
<i>Keep your front wheel up.</i>

379
00:42:27,417 --> 00:42:30,958
<i>Steady. Now cut your speed.</i>

380
00:42:34,333 --> 00:42:37,167
<i>Steady. Steady.</i>

381
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:39,083
<i>Now take her in.</i>

382
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:42,583
<i>Yeah!</i>

383
00:42:45,083 --> 00:42:48,250
<i>Way to go, Dex.</i>

384
00:42:48,417 --> 00:42:52,042
<i>Thanks, Sean.
Wouldn't have made it without you.</i>

385
00:42:52,292 --> 00:42:55,917
<i>I gotta get to Izumo.
Wait for me outside the lab.</i>

386
00:42:56,208 --> 00:42:58,208
<i>You guys be careful.</i>

387
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:02,250
- Some landing! Was I good or what?
- Yeah, great.

388
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:07,333
Sky King, let's dump that baby. We've got
to meet Sean and Izumo outside the lab.

389
00:44:59,167 --> 00:45:01,250
Close the door quietly.

390
00:45:05,667 --> 00:45:07,292
Let's go.

391
00:47:32,667 --> 00:47:35,458
<i>He must have got in OK by now.</i>

392
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:39,375
Maybe. Let's just hope he found Izumo.

393
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:43,083
So, shall we go?

394
00:47:45,375 --> 00:47:47,042
Mm-mm. No.

395
00:50:32,208 --> 00:50:35,583
<i>Aaah!</i>

396
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:06,500
So, you came here as I planned.

397
00:51:07,667 --> 00:51:09,042
Who are you?

398
00:51:09,208 --> 00:51:12,917
- Why'd your men attack me?
- To get you here.

399
00:51:13,125 --> 00:51:15,750
To tickle my fancy.

400
00:51:16,042 --> 00:51:19,458
Curiosity is a reaI dangerous drug,
you know.

401
00:51:21,792 --> 00:51:25,833
So the tournament
was a scam to lure me here.

402
00:51:26,042 --> 00:51:28,542
No. To lure the best one here.

403
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:33,542
That just turned out to be you.

404
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:35,625
A ninja.

405
00:51:36,875 --> 00:51:39,167
Is that why you have my master Izumo?

406
00:51:40,458 --> 00:51:44,833
- Yes, I guess you might say that.
- So he's here?

407
00:51:46,208 --> 00:51:49,750
Let's just say
that really doesn't count right now.

408
00:51:50,042 --> 00:51:53,667
What's important is your usefulness to me,

409
00:51:53,875 --> 00:51:58,167
proving the power
and the effectiveness of my new disease.

410
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:01,083
Boys.

411
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:25,958
<i>Well, no news is good news.</i>

412
00:52:29,667 --> 00:52:32,917
- OK, Curtis. What now?
- We wait, Junior.

413
00:53:28,042 --> 00:53:29,250
Who are you?

414
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:33,042
I need some answers.
I know you are ninja.

415
00:53:35,833 --> 00:53:40,333
- So?
- Listen, your life is in terrible danger.

416
00:53:42,667 --> 00:53:45,958
Who else knows about Izumo?

417
00:53:46,167 --> 00:53:49,708
- Why should I tell you?
- I'm here to help.

418
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,500
Please.

419
00:53:53,667 --> 00:53:56,708
My two friends know,

420
00:53:56,917 --> 00:54:00,500
the police and the minister's secretary.

421
00:54:00,708 --> 00:54:04,375
- Now everyone's involved.
- What is going on here?

422
00:54:04,667 --> 00:54:07,333
I'm not sure yet.

423
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:11,500
- But I'm gonna find out.
- Wait.

424
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:19,750
<i>Dr Saxon, the minister's secretary is here.</i>

425
00:54:19,958 --> 00:54:22,417
Nice of you to see me at short notice.

426
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:25,292
We like to help people of the community.

427
00:54:25,583 --> 00:54:30,042
Dr Holger, could you see to it
that our mouse is fed?

428
00:54:30,167 --> 00:54:32,750
It's breakfast time in the lab, you know.

429
00:54:33,917 --> 00:54:36,625
What can I do for you this fine morning?

430
00:54:36,917 --> 00:54:40,583
Doctor, you probably don't realise,

431
00:54:40,833 --> 00:54:44,292
but the minister has concerns about you
and your operation.

432
00:54:44,542 --> 00:54:46,375
He doubts your sincerity.

433
00:54:46,625 --> 00:54:51,167
My sincerity? My dear girI, my whole life's
work is tied up in this project.

434
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:56,000
Yes, but the question is,
what exactly is that work?

435
00:54:56,333 --> 00:54:59,708
Well, if you don't understand
the nature of my experiment,

436
00:54:59,917 --> 00:55:02,375
one of my scientists could explain it.

437
00:55:02,583 --> 00:55:06,042
No, that's not the point.
We've done some checking.

438
00:55:06,208 --> 00:55:10,208
Er... A certain GeneraI Andreas

439
00:55:10,417 --> 00:55:16,375
was known to InterpoI as a notorious
terrorist, missing for severaI years.

440
00:55:16,625 --> 00:55:20,083
I don't think we could be
talking about the same man.

441
00:55:20,208 --> 00:55:23,417
These deadly virus strains
you've been working with...

442
00:55:23,625 --> 00:55:29,583
With minor modifications, could they not
be usefuI to a man in his line of work?

443
00:55:29,833 --> 00:55:32,042
What is it exactly that you want?

444
00:55:33,167 --> 00:55:37,500
Well, my position has some prestige to it,

445
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:43,083
but the burdens are enormous
and the salary unfortunately is less so.

446
00:55:43,292 --> 00:55:45,333
Ah. I see.

447
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,208
It's funny you mention it.

448
00:55:47,417 --> 00:55:51,375
Dr Holger and I were discussing
the need for an assistant

449
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:54,292
to help us further our operations.

450
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:57,500
Could I put my name up for consideration?

451
00:55:57,667 --> 00:56:01,917
Absolutely. I can't think of anyone
who'd be more qualified.

452
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:05,542
I'll just, uh... send you over
a retainer cheque tomorrow.

453
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:07,125
- That'd be fine.
- Great.

454
00:56:07,375 --> 00:56:10,167
Now, if you'll excuse me.

455
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:12,958
Give my regards to the minister, will you?

456
00:56:13,042 --> 00:56:16,042
And thank you so much for coming.

457
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:19,083
You're a great woman
and I appreciate your advice.

458
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:20,958
Thank you.

459
00:56:21,167 --> 00:56:22,542
Bye.

460
00:56:29,583 --> 00:56:31,583
She knows.

461
00:56:31,792 --> 00:56:35,167
I warned you. She's excessively ambitious.

462
00:56:36,458 --> 00:56:39,708
My dear boy, we'll just have to do
what we have to do.

463
00:56:39,917 --> 00:56:42,500
Relieve her of that unfortunate ailment.

464
00:56:45,083 --> 00:56:47,333
I'll see to it myself.

465
00:57:21,083 --> 00:57:25,583
<i>It's the minister's secretary.
What has she been doing here?</i>

466
00:57:31,333 --> 00:57:34,125
- Let's get back to the truck.
- OK.

467
00:57:35,625 --> 00:57:37,625
Everything in order. Thank you.

468
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:49,458
Calm down.

469
00:59:58,333 --> 00:59:59,875
That'll do for now.

470
01:00:00,792 --> 01:00:02,417
Go. Relax.

471
01:00:05,542 --> 01:00:10,625
Electronarcosis. A little something
we developed in the lab. Works well.

472
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:15,708
- What do you want from me?
- Nothing personaI, my dear boy.

473
01:00:15,958 --> 01:00:18,542
You're just a victim for this experiment.

474
01:00:18,625 --> 01:00:21,292
By the time this gun's effect wears off,

475
01:00:21,458 --> 01:00:25,083
- you will have outlived your usefulness.
- We'll see.

476
01:00:30,917 --> 01:00:35,875
Ah, impatient one, how are you? I trust
this subject meets with your approvaI.

477
01:00:36,708 --> 01:00:38,000
Yes.

478
01:00:39,958 --> 01:00:41,417
Perfect.

479
01:00:41,708 --> 01:00:43,333
Very good. Come, relax.

480
01:00:43,667 --> 01:00:47,458
I'll show you the ultimate test
in designer death.

481
01:00:49,792 --> 01:00:51,417
I'm really worried about Sean.

482
01:00:51,625 --> 01:00:54,083
Me too, but let's give him more time.

483
01:00:54,292 --> 01:00:56,750
Time? Man, he's had enough.

484
01:00:59,667 --> 01:01:02,083
We've got to do something.

485
01:01:03,333 --> 01:01:07,500
I'm beginning to like your attitude.
No more wine, women and song?

486
01:01:07,667 --> 01:01:09,375
That was before.

487
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:13,417
Time is running out.
We can't afford to waste any more.

488
01:01:14,625 --> 01:01:16,333
And who are you?

489
01:01:22,708 --> 01:01:26,625
- The only one who can help you.
- All right, start explaining.

490
01:01:26,875 --> 01:01:31,250
Your friend has been caught
by the head of East Bay Labs.

491
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:36,583
He's known as the Cobra and he plans
to kill your friend. He must be stopped.

492
01:01:36,875 --> 01:01:41,375
Unfortunately, my ninja are no longer
loyaI to me. I need your help.

493
01:01:43,458 --> 01:01:45,750
Now we got ninjettes.

494
01:01:50,625 --> 01:01:52,833
Let's talk, sweetheart.

495
01:02:13,875 --> 01:02:15,875
Not so strong, huh, ninja?

496
01:02:25,625 --> 01:02:29,292
Take our soon-to-be-dead friend
to the ship.

497
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,625
If Cobra kills Sean with his virus,

498
01:02:31,875 --> 01:02:34,875
he will prove to Andreas
how powerfuI they can be.

499
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,292
Let me get this straight.

500
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,958
He's selling out to a terrorist?

501
01:02:40,125 --> 01:02:41,500
Exactly.

502
01:02:41,792 --> 01:02:43,792
That's wholesale slaughter.

503
01:02:44,125 --> 01:02:46,542
That sounds like reaI bad news to me.

504
01:02:46,792 --> 01:02:49,792
Hey, don't underestimate that man.

505
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,958
He's not called the Cobra for nothing.

506
01:02:53,292 --> 01:02:55,250
It's your call, Curtis.

507
01:02:59,042 --> 01:03:00,833
OK, darling.

508
01:03:02,875 --> 01:03:04,875
Let's go kick some ass.

509
01:03:06,417 --> 01:03:08,583
We need to head for the docks.

510
01:03:10,333 --> 01:03:13,000
<i>The Cobra
will have injected Sean with the virus.</i>

511
01:03:13,208 --> 01:03:16,333
He'll be taking him to his ship.

512
01:03:26,167 --> 01:03:28,417
<i>Good. He's only just arrived.</i>

513
01:03:28,625 --> 01:03:32,208
<i>But look at the state he's in.
He can hardly walk.</i>

514
01:03:32,458 --> 01:03:34,292
Where are they gonna take him?

515
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:38,333
Out of here,
so no one will know what Cobra's up to.

516
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:40,458
- Time to do it.
- Wait.

517
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:46,000
I go first. No slip-ups.
Cobra's not the forgiving type.

518
01:03:46,333 --> 01:03:49,917
You just get there, ninjette baby.
We'll do the rest.

519
01:05:43,375 --> 01:05:44,833
Curtis!

520
01:05:49,708 --> 01:05:51,125
Get out of my way.

521
01:05:51,958 --> 01:05:53,292
Jerk.

522
01:06:18,375 --> 01:06:20,667
<i>Well done, ninjette baby.</i>

523
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:27,375
<i>This way.</i>

524
01:06:39,875 --> 01:06:42,583
- Junior!
- Thanks.

525
01:06:45,208 --> 01:06:47,583
- Wait...
- No time to explain.

526
01:06:47,792 --> 01:06:52,042
On the contrary.
There's plenty of time to explain.

527
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:54,375
- Who's this?
- Cobra's partner.

528
01:06:54,708 --> 01:06:57,625
Shut your mouth. Get away from him.

529
01:06:57,833 --> 01:07:00,292
He's the only one of value.

530
01:07:03,375 --> 01:07:05,042
I said move!

531
01:07:09,333 --> 01:07:12,458
- So it's me you want.
- Uh-huh.

532
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:17,750
- And no sudden moves.
- You got it.

533
01:07:26,667 --> 01:07:28,208
All right.

534
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:37,833
- No!
- Sean!

535
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:47,292
- We don't have much time.
- For what?

536
01:07:47,417 --> 01:07:49,625
To get you the antidote.

537
01:07:49,958 --> 01:07:53,667
No. That electronarcosis stuff
has about worn off.

538
01:07:53,917 --> 01:07:56,000
He zapped you with a virus.

539
01:07:56,208 --> 01:07:58,792
- We've got to get Izumo.
- Sean...

540
01:08:17,542 --> 01:08:19,125
<i>You are a kunoichi?</i>

541
01:08:19,417 --> 01:08:20,375
Yes.

542
01:08:21,708 --> 01:08:25,042
<i>- Hensojutsu?
- I am a master.</i>

543
01:08:26,458 --> 01:08:28,458
Now I see.

544
01:08:30,625 --> 01:08:33,292
- Izumo...
- Izumo was you.

545
01:08:34,417 --> 01:08:35,958
Yes.

546
01:08:38,792 --> 01:08:44,000
I thought I was doing the right thing.
I did not know that they were eviI.

547
01:08:47,333 --> 01:08:50,000
It's time for action. Let's go.

548
01:08:50,208 --> 01:08:51,042
OK.

549
01:09:15,833 --> 01:09:19,250
The minister's secretary
is here to see Dr Saxon.

550
01:09:20,792 --> 01:09:23,958
How can she make herself
into different people so perfectly?

551
01:09:24,125 --> 01:09:27,792
<i>Disguise and illusion. Hensojutsu.</i>

552
01:09:28,083 --> 01:09:31,917
<i>- Hensojutsu?
- It's the ancient art of impersonation.</i>

553
01:09:32,167 --> 01:09:36,417
<i>The kunoichi, the female ninja,
they're masters at it.</i>

554
01:09:49,667 --> 01:09:51,375
Where'd she go?

555
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:15,125
Machine-gun work?

556
01:10:16,083 --> 01:10:18,167
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

557
01:10:22,333 --> 01:10:23,917
- I'm OK.
- Good.

558
01:10:24,875 --> 01:10:28,958
Look, if we don't get that vaccine in time,
you've got to kill me.

559
01:10:29,167 --> 01:10:31,208
- What?
- If it doesn't work...

560
01:10:31,375 --> 01:10:35,917
- It will.
- If it doesn't, and I lose it,

561
01:10:36,208 --> 01:10:37,708
you gotta kill me.

562
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:39,542
You or Jackson.

563
01:10:44,542 --> 01:10:46,625
Do you understand?

564
01:10:48,417 --> 01:10:50,917
You know what we're up against here.

565
01:10:53,083 --> 01:10:55,167
I have your word?

566
01:10:56,917 --> 01:10:58,917
Yeah. You got it.

567
01:10:59,958 --> 01:11:00,792
OK.

568
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,833
Let's go.

569
01:12:38,667 --> 01:12:40,667
What's going on? Sirens are blazing.

570
01:12:40,833 --> 01:12:43,083
The minister's unhappy.
It's all going crazy.

571
01:12:43,333 --> 01:12:47,917
The Americans escaped...
and GeneraI Andreas is dead.

572
01:12:48,167 --> 01:12:51,625
Andreas is dead.
This could ruin us, you know.

573
01:12:51,792 --> 01:12:53,500
Get me Chan Lee.

574
01:12:53,708 --> 01:12:57,000
The ninjas say
that she helped them get away.

575
01:12:57,167 --> 01:12:58,833
Stupid incompetent idiot!

576
01:13:00,292 --> 01:13:03,958
Well... they're turning against me.

577
01:13:04,167 --> 01:13:06,375
It's happened before,

578
01:13:06,583 --> 01:13:09,167
and I must say to no avaiI.

579
01:13:11,208 --> 01:13:15,500
Alert the ninja.
I think we'll be having company.

580
01:13:15,625 --> 01:13:20,125
And don't screw it up this time!
Shut off those sirens.

581
01:13:35,542 --> 01:13:36,792
Good evening.

582
01:13:50,167 --> 01:13:53,292
- I, er... I thought I might meet you here.
- Ah.

583
01:13:54,208 --> 01:13:58,167
Well, it appears that you're after
much more than just a meeting.

584
01:13:58,333 --> 01:14:00,333
Not at all, Doctor.

585
01:14:00,542 --> 01:14:05,208
Come on.
Your disguise is quite apparent, Chan Lee.

586
01:14:16,458 --> 01:14:19,542
You said your cause
was for the good of mankind.

587
01:14:19,667 --> 01:14:24,417
- My cause is a good one.
- For those possessed by eviI.

588
01:14:30,667 --> 01:14:33,250
I was taking the antidote to the American.

589
01:14:33,458 --> 01:14:36,917
Oh, really? Do what you have to do.

590
01:14:37,958 --> 01:14:40,583
But I'm telling you, you are deluded.

591
01:14:40,875 --> 01:14:45,083
I'm not going to listen to you any more.
You are the snake.

592
01:18:15,875 --> 01:18:17,292
Die!

593
01:18:20,167 --> 01:18:22,458
Take these. I'll meet you at the car.

594
01:18:22,583 --> 01:18:25,875
- Is there...?
- No, just get the hell out of here!

595
01:18:30,875 --> 01:18:32,833
Is everything all right?

596
01:19:06,625 --> 01:19:09,167
All right, Cobra.

597
01:19:09,375 --> 01:19:11,500
Your turn to die.

598
01:19:44,542 --> 01:19:47,167
- One answer. Where's the lab?
- Why?

599
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:53,167
Just be carefuI of this stuff, will you?
It's dangerous. It's glass.

600
01:19:53,375 --> 01:19:55,250
What is it?

601
01:19:55,417 --> 01:19:56,792
What is it?

602
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:01,333
- Uh... It's a urine sample.
- Jesus, don't piss me off!

603
01:20:01,667 --> 01:20:03,042
What is it?

604
01:20:03,250 --> 01:20:07,083
It's viraI antidote. Be carefuI, will you?

605
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:11,625
Very good, Stretch. Now, again - the lab?

606
01:20:11,875 --> 01:20:14,875
Up those stairs. Up there.

607
01:20:21,792 --> 01:20:23,583
All right.

608
01:20:55,042 --> 01:20:56,917
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

609
01:20:57,042 --> 01:20:58,708
Right here, Stretch.

610
01:22:32,125 --> 01:22:33,875
Oh, no.

611
01:22:35,833 --> 01:22:37,208
Oh, Chan...

612
01:22:40,958 --> 01:22:43,042
Oh, God...

613
01:23:02,083 --> 01:23:05,708
Another illusion you believed in
shattered?

614
01:23:05,833 --> 01:23:11,042
- There's no cure for your disease.
- Give me the damn antidote.

615
01:23:11,292 --> 01:23:16,667
- Sure. I've got all the formulas.
- You won't get away with it.

616
01:23:18,042 --> 01:23:19,542
Really?

617
01:23:19,667 --> 01:23:22,167
But I am getting away with it.

618
01:23:22,333 --> 01:23:25,583
Like I said,
you've outlived your usefulness.

619
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:45,875
<i>Your mind and soul
over your body.</i>

620
01:23:45,875 --> 01:23:50,917
<i>Remember that, Sean.
Mind and soul over your body.</i>

621
01:24:34,375 --> 01:24:35,792
Cobra.

01:25:59,958 --> 01:26:02,875
Hey, Sean. Here's the antidote, man.

623
01:26:04,625 --> 01:26:07,875
<i>I don't need it any more.</i>

624
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,667
- Hey, you OK?
- Yeah.

625
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:15,292
You know what I went through
to get this for you?

626
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,667
Let's go home.

627
01:26:27,083 --> 01:26:29,292
Hai... ya!

628
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:40,208
I think you're finished. Let's go, paI.

629
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:42,500
Look, if we're gonna remain friends,

630
01:26:42,708 --> 01:26:45,833
can't we fight other bad guys,
like robbers, thieves and muggers?

631
01:26:46,042 --> 01:26:51,875
Does it have to be ninjas? You know
how long I've been fighting ninjas?

632
01:27:18,083 --> 01:27:23,833
<i># There's a shadow
Falling over you and me</i>
