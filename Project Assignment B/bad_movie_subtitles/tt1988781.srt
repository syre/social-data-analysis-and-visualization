1
00:00:57,127 --> 00:00:59,735
¶ By the light ¶

2
00:00:59,756 --> 00:01:02,652
¶ Of the silvery moon ¶

3
00:01:04,177 --> 00:01:06,949
¶ I want to spoon ¶

4
00:01:08,972 --> 00:01:11,244
¶ To my honey, I'll croon ¶

5
00:01:11,265 --> 00:01:14,207
¶ Love's tune... ¶

6
00:01:14,228 --> 00:01:17,251
¶ Honey moon ¶

7
00:01:17,272 --> 00:01:20,463
¶ Keep a-shinin' in June ¶

8
00:01:22,153 --> 00:01:24,342
¶ Your silvery beams ¶

9
00:01:24,363 --> 00:01:26,595
¶ Will bring love's dreams ¶

10
00:01:26,616 --> 00:01:30,931
¶ We'll be cuddling soon ¶

11
00:01:30,952 --> 00:01:35,020
¶ By the silvery moon ¶

12
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:58,792
Get her out of my house!

13
00:01:58,813 --> 00:02:00,419
Elizabeth!

14
00:02:03,736 --> 00:02:05,591
I said get out!

15
00:02:05,612 --> 00:02:06,968
Ohh!

16
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:10,095
You don't give the orders
in this house.

17
00:02:10,116 --> 00:02:11,889
I do.

18
00:02:14,289 --> 00:02:15,726
Get out.

19
00:02:15,747 --> 00:02:17,186
We're done here.

20
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,233
You promised me,
not in the house.

21
00:02:23,338 --> 00:02:26,446
Get out of my room.

22
00:03:13,013 --> 00:03:14,118
Oh...

23
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:16,912
you poor child.

24
00:03:16,933 --> 00:03:19,625
You know, we... we could leave,
if you want to.

25
00:03:20,812 --> 00:03:23,543
We'd just pack all our things.

26
00:03:23,564 --> 00:03:25,503
Where would we go?

27
00:03:30,073 --> 00:03:31,260
Oh...

28
00:03:51,302 --> 00:03:53,367
Did you see the ghosts?

29
00:03:53,388 --> 00:03:56,244
No, that's just the storm.

30
00:03:56,265 --> 00:04:00,249
It's time for sleeping,
my angels.

31
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,127
No, I can't go to sleep.

32
00:04:04,148 --> 00:04:06,420
I'm afraid of the storm.

33
00:04:06,441 --> 00:04:08,797
You're safe inside, darling.

34
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:12,343
Mommy, what happened
to your lip?

35
00:04:12,364 --> 00:04:14,720
Are you hurt?

36
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:16,639
I'm all right, sweet pea.

37
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,641
It's just an accident.

38
00:04:18,662 --> 00:04:20,894
Why don't you kiss it
and make it better?

39
00:04:22,581 --> 00:04:24,730
Mother, you need to be
more careful.

40
00:04:24,751 --> 00:04:27,234
I will, Amanda.

41
00:04:27,255 --> 00:04:28,859
Now it's time for bed.

42
00:04:31,216 --> 00:04:32,572
Good night.

43
00:04:40,309 --> 00:04:42,416
Good night. Heh.

44
00:04:54,531 --> 00:04:57,305
Sean?

45
00:04:57,326 --> 00:04:59,098
Are you all right?

46
00:05:00,746 --> 00:05:03,687
Sean, dear, what's the matter?

47
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,022
Is it the storm?

48
00:05:09,005 --> 00:05:10,777
Let's go to bed.

49
00:05:43,955 --> 00:05:45,896
Auntie May?

50
00:05:45,917 --> 00:05:47,855
Why are you not in bed?

51
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:54,695
Oh, God.

52
00:05:56,884 --> 00:05:58,200
Uhh!

53
00:08:19,236 --> 00:08:21,883
¶ I can't ¶

54
00:08:21,904 --> 00:08:24,304
¶ Seem to shake ¶

55
00:08:24,325 --> 00:08:28,433
¶ This feeling ¶

56
00:08:29,747 --> 00:08:34,523
¶ Can't help thinking no one ¶

57
00:08:34,544 --> 00:08:38,858
¶ Really likes me... ¶

58
00:08:47,473 --> 00:08:50,704
You know what? I think I was killed.
You know that?

59
00:08:50,725 --> 00:08:53,248
What are you talking about?

60
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:56,461
In my last life. There was...
I'm reading about this guy here.

61
00:08:56,482 --> 00:08:58,213
He smoked this crazy shit.

62
00:08:58,234 --> 00:08:59,922
Now he remembers
his past life and everything,

63
00:08:59,943 --> 00:09:01,299
even speaks the language.

64
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,882
Okay.

65
00:09:02,903 --> 00:09:06,513
Come on, man. You ever
think about that? Come on,

66
00:09:06,534 --> 00:09:08,890
like, what you were before,
what you might come back as?

67
00:09:08,911 --> 00:09:12,017
Like... I don't know...
a ballerina or something?

68
00:09:12,038 --> 00:09:16,020
I probably was,
but now I'm a very bad dancer.

69
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,399
- I know that.
- Ha ha!

70
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,442
I think about that shit
every day.

71
00:09:20,463 --> 00:09:22,111
Yeah, well, see, I have a life.

72
00:09:22,132 --> 00:09:24,320
I mean, look at this guy,
though, man.

73
00:09:25,969 --> 00:09:27,365
That explains a lot.

74
00:09:27,386 --> 00:09:29,159
- Ha ha!
- Yeah, it does.

75
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:34,415
Hey, did...

76
00:09:36,103 --> 00:09:39,168
Well, look, I find it... it's just
fascinating shit to me.

77
00:09:41,442 --> 00:09:43,173
You okay?

78
00:09:44,738 --> 00:09:46,635
Yeah.

79
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:59,231
Boy,
this is a quiet bunch.

80
00:09:59,252 --> 00:10:00,608
Didn't you all have some fun?

81
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:02,985
Yeah, it was a great resort.

82
00:10:03,006 --> 00:10:05,112
What brought you
out this way?

83
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:06,822
I'm a doctor.

84
00:10:06,843 --> 00:10:08,823
We were part of the convention
at the resort.

85
00:10:08,844 --> 00:10:11,994
Cool. I'm actually going into
my second year at med school.

86
00:10:12,015 --> 00:10:15,122
Good luck to you.
Tough road ahead.

87
00:10:15,143 --> 00:10:16,999
You know,
they keep telling me that.

88
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,416
Hey, he's my kid brother.

89
00:10:18,437 --> 00:10:20,419
He's not gonna sweat it.

90
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,756
We came to invigorate
our marriage.

91
00:10:22,777 --> 00:10:24,298
Didn't we, honey?

92
00:10:26,197 --> 00:10:27,717
Yeah.

93
00:10:39,584 --> 00:10:41,231
All right, last stop, people.

94
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,651
You want anything?

95
00:10:43,672 --> 00:10:45,736
Coffee.

96
00:10:45,757 --> 00:10:47,364
Sex would be nice...

97
00:10:47,385 --> 00:10:49,239
once in a while.

98
00:10:56,518 --> 00:10:57,623
God.

99
00:10:58,896 --> 00:11:00,541
Tornado-like winds...

100
00:11:00,562 --> 00:11:02,211
are ripping through
the Midwest,

101
00:11:02,232 --> 00:11:05,005
leaving behind death
and destruction.

102
00:11:05,026 --> 00:11:07,925
- Rescue crews have...
- Hey, you want a cold one?

103
00:11:07,946 --> 00:11:09,217
- splintered houses...
- No, I'm good.

104
00:11:09,238 --> 00:11:11,553
and smashed cars.
Fires burning from...

105
00:11:11,574 --> 00:11:12,888
Keeping it healthy, huh?

106
00:11:12,909 --> 00:11:14,973
airports are
expecting delays.

107
00:11:14,994 --> 00:11:16,809
- What have we got here?
- Authorities are calling this

108
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,686
the deadliest storm
to hit the area...

109
00:11:18,707 --> 00:11:21,312
- Barbecue.
- in literally 100 years.

110
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,858
- Stay tuned for more updates.
- Is that all?

111
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:26,361
Other than your name, yeah.

112
00:11:26,382 --> 00:11:29,029
I have a boyfriend.

113
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,698
Look, I wasn't asking you out.

114
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:33,324
I was just trying
to be friendly.

115
00:11:33,345 --> 00:11:35,661
It's Courtney.

116
00:11:35,682 --> 00:11:36,995
It's a pretty name.

117
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,915
- Together?
- Uh-huh, yeah.

118
00:11:40,936 --> 00:11:42,710
Why, you got a real natural look
over there.

119
00:11:42,731 --> 00:11:44,420
Bonita.

120
00:11:45,901 --> 00:11:48,423
$17.20, please.

121
00:11:48,444 --> 00:11:49,465
Okay.

122
00:11:49,486 --> 00:11:51,136
I got it, bro.

123
00:11:51,157 --> 00:11:52,762
Thank you.

124
00:11:55,619 --> 00:11:57,640
Hurry up, boys,
before they, uh...

125
00:11:57,661 --> 00:11:59,352
I could imagine
waking up to her every day.

126
00:11:59,372 --> 00:12:00,769
I could imagine
kicking your ass every day.

127
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:03,230
Leave us behind.

128
00:12:03,251 --> 00:12:05,314
Yeah, I hear you.

129
00:12:05,335 --> 00:12:07,735
- It's good to dream.
- Yeah, I agree. Thank you.

130
00:12:07,756 --> 00:12:09,485
See you.
It's good meeting you.

131
00:12:09,506 --> 00:12:10,486
Take care.

132
00:12:10,507 --> 00:12:13,241
After you, Romeo.

133
00:12:13,262 --> 00:12:15,033
Hello.

134
00:12:15,054 --> 00:12:17,203
- Boys will be boys.
- Oh, yeah.

135
00:12:17,224 --> 00:12:18,662
Can I have a pack
of those, too, please?

136
00:12:18,683 --> 00:12:20,289
Sure.

137
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:22,959
- Anything else?
- Uh...

138
00:12:24,647 --> 00:12:26,252
I'm Bill.

139
00:12:26,273 --> 00:12:27,504
Courtney.

140
00:12:30,361 --> 00:12:32,176
Ahh.

141
00:12:32,197 --> 00:12:34,803
So, what does your wife
say about all of this?

142
00:12:34,824 --> 00:12:36,764
She doesn't say a thing.

143
00:12:41,414 --> 00:12:43,812
Here. You, uh, give me a call.

144
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,188
I'll show you Chicago.

145
00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:48,818
"Bill McCormick...
corporate lawyer".

146
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:50,987
I hate big cities...

147
00:12:51,008 --> 00:12:55,408
almost as much
as cheating husbands.

148
00:12:55,429 --> 00:12:57,242
Heh.

149
00:13:03,937 --> 00:13:05,751
You like me.

150
00:13:05,772 --> 00:13:08,462
Heh. Get out of here.

151
00:13:08,483 --> 00:13:10,838
You know how I can tell?

152
00:13:10,859 --> 00:13:12,965
Come here.

153
00:13:12,986 --> 00:13:14,760
You didn't charge me.

154
00:13:14,781 --> 00:13:17,514
Forget it. Ha ha ha!

155
00:13:17,535 --> 00:13:21,516
Have fun in the...
your life in the gas station.

156
00:13:21,537 --> 00:13:23,142
Asshole.

157
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:29,442
Where's my coffee?

158
00:13:29,463 --> 00:13:31,653
What?
Oh, they didn't have any.

159
00:13:31,674 --> 00:13:33,570
They didn't have any coffee?

160
00:13:33,591 --> 00:13:34,947
Nope.

161
00:14:08,335 --> 00:14:10,648
Is there any girl in the world

162
00:14:10,669 --> 00:14:12,860
that you wouldn't
want to sleep with?

163
00:14:15,132 --> 00:14:17,906
You knew what I was like
before we got married.

164
00:14:37,447 --> 00:14:39,511
Whoa!

165
00:15:02,805 --> 00:15:03,951
Thank you, sir.

166
00:15:03,972 --> 00:15:06,622
Name is Jack. You okay?

167
00:15:06,643 --> 00:15:08,915
Yeah.

168
00:15:11,397 --> 00:15:13,128
I think he might be dead.

169
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:16,381
- Aren't you a doctor?
- I'm a med student.

170
00:15:16,402 --> 00:15:18,050
You're a med student?
You can't tell the difference

171
00:15:18,071 --> 00:15:19,592
if someone's alive or dead?

172
00:15:19,613 --> 00:15:22,764
He's dead.
Anybody else hurt?

173
00:15:22,785 --> 00:15:25,432
What?
That's... that's it.

174
00:15:26,913 --> 00:15:28,853
You're all lucky to be alive.

175
00:15:28,874 --> 00:15:30,979
Hardly call this lucky.

176
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,648
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

177
00:15:32,669 --> 00:15:34,441
- I'm gonna... I'm okay.
- You hit your head.

178
00:15:34,462 --> 00:15:36,151
- Can you come look at this?
- I'm all right.

179
00:15:36,172 --> 00:15:38,320
Oh, my God. We need
to get him to a hospital.

180
00:15:38,341 --> 00:15:40,655
Not gonna happen.
Not in this weather.

181
00:15:40,676 --> 00:15:42,492
Hospital is two hours away.

182
00:15:42,513 --> 00:15:45,620
Just nothing a good shot
of whiskey won't cure.

183
00:15:45,641 --> 00:15:47,664
What about going back
to the gas station?

184
00:15:47,685 --> 00:15:49,290
My house is just up the road.

185
00:15:50,311 --> 00:15:51,500
Let's go.

186
00:15:51,521 --> 00:15:53,542
- Oh.
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

187
00:15:53,563 --> 00:15:56,381
It's all right, boys.
Just a head rush.

188
00:15:56,402 --> 00:15:58,549
Goddamn phone.

189
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:01,343
No, those phones don't work
out here, son. Let's go.

190
00:16:01,364 --> 00:16:03,095
- Come on, Adam.
- What about the driver?

191
00:16:03,116 --> 00:16:04,554
We can't just...
can't just leave him here.

192
00:16:04,575 --> 00:16:06,849
I'll make a call when we
get back to my house.

193
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:09,518
Can't help him now.
Let's go.

194
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:11,979
The storm is coming soon.

195
00:16:16,004 --> 00:16:18,778
We're lucky you came along.
Thank you.

196
00:17:15,062 --> 00:17:18,295
Jack, I need a washcloth,
rubbing alcohol,

197
00:17:18,316 --> 00:17:20,463
any bandages and an ice pack,

198
00:17:20,484 --> 00:17:22,299
and let's get the room
ready for him.

199
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,842
- Straight ahead.
- Thanks.

200
00:17:23,863 --> 00:17:26,095
- A little help, guys.
- Sure, sure. What do you need?

201
00:17:43,591 --> 00:17:46,239
Why don't you sit on a chair
like a normal person?

202
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,866
Show some respect.

203
00:17:47,887 --> 00:17:49,535
Would you look at me? Look.

204
00:17:49,556 --> 00:17:51,620
I'm covered
in your fruit punch,

205
00:17:51,641 --> 00:17:54,455
your Kool-Aid,
whatever you drank.

206
00:17:54,476 --> 00:17:58,127
Yeah, warm and sticky,
just like I like 'em.

207
00:18:00,858 --> 00:18:04,216
You are the most
disgusting man in the world,

208
00:18:04,237 --> 00:18:06,427
and I am married to you.

209
00:18:06,448 --> 00:18:08,429
Yeah, well, I tell you...

210
00:18:12,912 --> 00:18:15,143
You used to be nice to me.

211
00:18:15,164 --> 00:18:18,271
Yeah, before you died inside.

212
00:18:21,629 --> 00:18:24,736
Well, what do we have here?

213
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,573
Don't touch that.

214
00:18:27,594 --> 00:18:29,199
Huh?

215
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,326
It's very valuable.

216
00:18:31,347 --> 00:18:34,872
A family heirloom. Very sharp.

217
00:18:36,435 --> 00:18:38,875
What are you,
a bear hunter?

218
00:18:40,523 --> 00:18:45,090
Fuck you. I know how
to handle a knife, Tonto. Hmm?

219
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,510
I bet you do, too.

220
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:55,600
Oh. Look at this handsome devil.

221
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,355
Very auspicious.

222
00:18:59,376 --> 00:19:01,482
Uh, family relative?

223
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,318
All right, fuck you.
I'm just being cordial.

224
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:06,862
May I have your phone, please?

225
00:19:10,677 --> 00:19:13,827
Will you show me
where your phone is, please?

226
00:19:13,847 --> 00:19:15,995
I don't have one.

227
00:19:18,185 --> 00:19:20,836
What do you mean, you don't
have one? Where's your phone?

228
00:19:22,481 --> 00:19:24,797
Where's your phone?
That's why we came here.

229
00:19:24,818 --> 00:19:27,382
Now, would you have preferred
to have been left outside?

230
00:19:27,403 --> 00:19:29,758
I would prefer to be back
at the gas station.

231
00:19:29,779 --> 00:19:31,803
You wouldn't have made it.

232
00:19:31,824 --> 00:19:34,599
How... how...
That's nothing you can know.

233
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:36,267
What, do you have
all the answers?

234
00:19:36,288 --> 00:19:38,726
I have one answer.

235
00:19:38,747 --> 00:19:41,188
You're stuck here now.

236
00:19:41,209 --> 00:19:44,733
Stuck? And you look
pretty thrilled about...

237
00:19:44,754 --> 00:19:46,484
I'm onto you, Jack.

238
00:19:46,505 --> 00:19:48,695
I'm sorry. He has a head injury,
which is making him...

239
00:19:48,716 --> 00:19:50,071
- Shut the fuck up.
- an asshole.

240
00:19:50,092 --> 00:19:53,367
Shut up!
Listen, you think I don't know?

241
00:19:53,388 --> 00:19:54,825
I think you had a hand...

242
00:19:54,846 --> 00:19:56,495
in having that girl
in the middle of the road.

243
00:19:56,516 --> 00:19:58,748
I think you're gonna eat us all,
one by one.

244
00:19:58,769 --> 00:20:00,790
- Bill!
- I'm serious!

245
00:20:00,811 --> 00:20:01,792
Look at him.

246
00:20:03,273 --> 00:20:05,419
Bill.

247
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,007
I'm sorry.
He's a little disoriented.

248
00:20:08,028 --> 00:20:09,633
He needs a pill.

249
00:20:09,654 --> 00:20:11,801
Take your pill, sweetheart.

250
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:20,936
You think that any of us

251
00:20:20,957 --> 00:20:23,730
are gonna make it through
the night? I don't think so.

252
00:20:28,046 --> 00:20:30,529
I can feel it in my bones.

253
00:20:32,592 --> 00:20:34,699
Do you guys have anything
to drink around here?

254
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,951
My liquor cabinet.

255
00:20:36,972 --> 00:20:38,203
Help yourselves.

256
00:20:38,224 --> 00:20:40,788
Oh, thank you very much.

257
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:43,832
I'm going to get some firewood
from the barn.

258
00:20:50,153 --> 00:20:52,259
Could you guys get us
something to drink, please,

259
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,927
some whiskeys?

260
00:20:53,948 --> 00:20:55,805
Cheers to that.

261
00:20:56,994 --> 00:20:59,474
Come on.
Let's go upstairs.

262
00:20:59,495 --> 00:21:01,643
It's kind of creepy
in here, man.

263
00:21:01,664 --> 00:21:03,104
I know.

264
00:21:09,338 --> 00:21:11,570
Hey, look what you found.

265
00:21:14,093 --> 00:21:16,283
How is it?

266
00:21:16,304 --> 00:21:18,076
Okay. Like that, huh?

267
00:21:18,097 --> 00:21:20,078
Ohh.

268
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:22,123
Maybe this will be better.
What do you think?

269
00:21:22,144 --> 00:21:23,914
Mm.

270
00:21:27,648 --> 00:21:29,170
Mm-hmm.

271
00:21:34,031 --> 00:21:38,014
You remember how Mom used to say
there were no accidents?

272
00:21:40,245 --> 00:21:41,223
Yeah.

273
00:21:42,829 --> 00:21:44,853
To Mom.

274
00:21:48,503 --> 00:21:51,901
Okay. I'm gonna get this
up to our guy.

275
00:21:51,922 --> 00:21:54,279
Mm-hmm. I'll be here.

276
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,747
There you go.

277
00:22:03,768 --> 00:22:06,041
Thank you.
Bring the whole bottle.

278
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:13,256
You hear that?
Did you hear that?

279
00:22:13,277 --> 00:22:15,216
What, the wind?

280
00:22:15,237 --> 00:22:18,260
No, no, no, it sounded like
girls screaming in the...

281
00:22:18,281 --> 00:22:20,766
Okay, you're only
doing water for now.

282
00:22:20,787 --> 00:22:21,931
No, listen.

283
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,600
The curtains keep moving.

284
00:22:23,621 --> 00:22:24,976
Even though the window's closed,

285
00:22:24,997 --> 00:22:27,228
the wind keeps blowing
right through the wall.

286
00:22:27,249 --> 00:22:28,479
Bill, it's okay.

287
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,606
You're just
a little bit delirious.

288
00:22:29,627 --> 00:22:31,192
You need to relax.

289
00:22:31,213 --> 00:22:33,027
No, I don't...

290
00:22:33,048 --> 00:22:34,985
You can't relax with Jack here.

291
00:22:35,006 --> 00:22:38,239
This... it's the whole place.
We have to get out of here.

292
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,868
Jack and the house, everything.

293
00:22:40,889 --> 00:22:42,952
The man is trying to help.

294
00:22:42,973 --> 00:22:46,122
No. No, he's not.

295
00:22:46,143 --> 00:22:49,084
You... the longer we stay,
the more in danger we are.

296
00:22:49,105 --> 00:22:51,295
Now, I want you to help me
out of here right now.

297
00:22:51,316 --> 00:22:52,920
Bill, we're all gonna be fine,
all right?

298
00:22:52,941 --> 00:22:55,382
Please don't leave.
Just stay here.

299
00:22:55,403 --> 00:22:57,510
Just a little while. Please?

300
00:22:57,531 --> 00:22:59,677
Okay.

301
00:22:59,698 --> 00:23:01,846
Bill, I know
I'm just a med student,

302
00:23:01,867 --> 00:23:03,765
but you gotta relax.

303
00:23:03,786 --> 00:23:06,600
You gotta just
get some rest, okay?

304
00:23:06,621 --> 00:23:10,356
Look, we're gonna stay with you
till you calm down.

305
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,115
Hey. Hey, Jack.

306
00:23:21,136 --> 00:23:23,035
You got a nice place here, man.

307
00:23:23,056 --> 00:23:24,786
Thanks.

308
00:23:28,144 --> 00:23:30,708
Uh, excuse me, Jack.
Do you have a bathroom

309
00:23:30,729 --> 00:23:32,084
I can use to clean up
a little bit?

310
00:23:32,105 --> 00:23:33,335
Sure. One minute.

311
00:23:33,355 --> 00:23:36,464
I got some dry things here,
if you want.

312
00:23:36,485 --> 00:23:37,674
Um...

313
00:23:37,695 --> 00:23:39,926
I got...
I got a shirt.

314
00:23:39,947 --> 00:23:41,886
Okay, thank you.

315
00:23:41,907 --> 00:23:44,139
Cool.

316
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,683
Okay, right this way.

317
00:24:09,058 --> 00:24:11,709
Oh!

318
00:24:35,293 --> 00:24:37,275
She did it. She did it.

319
00:24:39,924 --> 00:24:42,572
All right. Okay.

320
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:54,000
Jack, do you happen to have
any food or anything over there?

321
00:24:54,021 --> 00:24:56,212
Venison.

322
00:24:56,233 --> 00:24:58,339
Help yourself.

323
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,673
You hunt, Jack?

324
00:25:02,905 --> 00:25:04,512
Mm-hmm.

325
00:25:07,117 --> 00:25:10,682
Hey, Jack, how far is
that gas station from here?

326
00:25:12,705 --> 00:25:14,730
About four miles.

327
00:25:14,751 --> 00:25:16,105
You mind if I borrow
your truck, go back,

328
00:25:16,126 --> 00:25:17,732
see if their phones work?

329
00:25:17,753 --> 00:25:19,651
No point.

330
00:25:19,672 --> 00:25:21,737
Roads were closed earlier.

331
00:25:21,758 --> 00:25:23,864
I know, but I...
I gotta try.

332
00:25:23,885 --> 00:25:25,865
Not a good idea.

333
00:25:25,886 --> 00:25:27,952
There's already one dead body.

334
00:25:27,973 --> 00:25:29,451
You're much safer here.

335
00:25:29,472 --> 00:25:31,121
Yeah, he might be right, Adam.

336
00:25:31,142 --> 00:25:32,663
Look, if it's
too crazy out there,

337
00:25:32,684 --> 00:25:34,624
I'll turn around
and come right back.

338
00:25:34,645 --> 00:25:36,084
Oh, that's a stubborn one, eh?

339
00:25:36,105 --> 00:25:37,293
Yeah, he is.

340
00:25:39,942 --> 00:25:41,715
Well, I'm starving. Do you
think you could you pick up

341
00:25:41,736 --> 00:25:43,383
some food or some snacks
or something?

342
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:47,512
Well...

343
00:25:47,533 --> 00:25:50,472
don't say I didn't warn you.

344
00:25:50,493 --> 00:25:52,309
Okay.

345
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,228
Key is by the front door.

346
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,063
Okay.

347
00:26:01,005 --> 00:26:03,195
Storm is approaching.

348
00:26:26,237 --> 00:26:27,968
Shit.

349
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,888
Haven't we met before?

350
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:34,351
Oh, the friendly guy.

351
00:26:34,372 --> 00:26:36,519
You need a ride?

352
00:26:41,045 --> 00:26:43,192
What's the, uh...
what's the problem?

353
00:26:43,213 --> 00:26:45,613
I knew I should've
filled up this morning.

354
00:26:45,634 --> 00:26:47,904
I was practically on empty.

355
00:26:47,925 --> 00:26:49,907
Don't you work at a gas station?

356
00:26:49,928 --> 00:26:51,784
Funny.

357
00:26:51,805 --> 00:26:53,619
That's like a plumber
who doesn't turn the water off

358
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,496
when he's fixing a leak or...
I don't know... a dentist...

359
00:26:56,517 --> 00:26:59,000
who eats a steady diet of
candy bars, but never flosses.

360
00:26:59,021 --> 00:27:02,253
You know, you'd think...
You'd think they'd just know.

361
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:07,050
Ha ha!
Okay, here's a better question.

362
00:27:07,071 --> 00:27:10,218
If you're out of gas, why are you
looking under the hood?

363
00:27:12,158 --> 00:27:15,643
This kind of reminds me...
You know that ad

364
00:27:15,664 --> 00:27:18,686
with the hot chick
on the side of the road?

365
00:27:18,707 --> 00:27:20,813
They got grease
on her cleavage.

366
00:27:20,834 --> 00:27:23,816
She's posing all sexy
next to her car.

367
00:27:23,837 --> 00:27:26,068
Hood's up,
smoke's just billowing out,

368
00:27:26,089 --> 00:27:28,404
and she's waiting
for some phantom cowboy

369
00:27:28,425 --> 00:27:30,823
to ride her off
into the sunset.

370
00:27:30,844 --> 00:27:32,701
I don't watch TV.

371
00:27:32,722 --> 00:27:36,163
Well, it's not so much
a fantasy, is it?

372
00:27:37,852 --> 00:27:39,748
What's your name again?

373
00:27:39,769 --> 00:27:42,169
- Adam.
- Adam.

374
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:45,129
Adam, better hop back
in your pickup and scram

375
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:50,385
before that handsome cowboy
sees you and keeps on going.

376
00:27:50,406 --> 00:27:52,511
Thanks a bunch, buddy.

377
00:27:52,532 --> 00:27:54,764
Okay, well...

378
00:27:54,785 --> 00:27:57,184
I'm not the stud cowboy
with the white horse,

379
00:27:57,205 --> 00:28:01,397
but I am a nice guy
who wants to help you.

380
00:28:01,418 --> 00:28:04,190
You don't have to.
It's okay. I'll be fine.

381
00:28:04,211 --> 00:28:06,108
Yeah? Well, considering you're
looking for spare gas

382
00:28:06,129 --> 00:28:10,239
in the engine, something
tells me you might not be.

383
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,365
No, really. I got it handled.

384
00:28:12,386 --> 00:28:15,160
Come on. It is gonna pour
any second now.

385
00:28:15,181 --> 00:28:16,411
Your only option is to get in

386
00:28:16,432 --> 00:28:20,625
this vomit-green,
cozy, dry pickup.

387
00:28:20,646 --> 00:28:22,625
I'll take you back
to the gas station.

388
00:28:24,607 --> 00:28:27,171
Good point.

389
00:28:27,192 --> 00:28:29,091
That's a good choice.

390
00:28:30,404 --> 00:28:31,717
Here. I'll get it.

391
00:28:31,738 --> 00:28:33,260
- Thank you.
- You got it.

392
00:28:41,206 --> 00:28:43,187
It's a good color, right?

393
00:28:49,048 --> 00:28:50,863
Cool car.

394
00:28:50,884 --> 00:28:52,614
Yeah.

395
00:29:09,818 --> 00:29:11,882
So, um, what's your story?

396
00:29:11,903 --> 00:29:14,595
Married?
Have any kids?

397
00:29:14,616 --> 00:29:17,598
Divorced. No little Lipskis
running around.

398
00:29:18,912 --> 00:29:20,809
- Free man.
- Yeah.

399
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,434
Only way to fly.

400
00:29:26,002 --> 00:29:28,858
So, I guess you're single.

401
00:29:28,879 --> 00:29:30,443
Yeah.

402
00:29:32,467 --> 00:29:34,782
Just me. Well, my brother Adam.

403
00:29:35,969 --> 00:29:38,826
See, our mom, she...
she just passed.

404
00:29:40,641 --> 00:29:44,207
You know, we thought
we'd get away...

405
00:29:44,228 --> 00:29:46,709
forget our troubles,
be brothers again.

406
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,836
I'm so sorry for your loss.

407
00:29:48,857 --> 00:29:51,087
Thank you.

408
00:29:51,108 --> 00:29:53,759
What was your mom like?

409
00:29:56,699 --> 00:29:58,595
Mom?

410
00:29:58,617 --> 00:30:00,556
Yeah, she was...
she was amazing.

411
00:30:01,702 --> 00:30:04,100
She was, uh, incredible,
you know?

412
00:30:04,121 --> 00:30:06,395
Smart and warm,

413
00:30:06,416 --> 00:30:08,855
and everybody loved her.

414
00:30:10,588 --> 00:30:12,653
A lot like Adam, you know?

415
00:30:16,134 --> 00:30:17,531
And what about you?

416
00:30:17,552 --> 00:30:20,828
Yeah, I...
I took after Pops.

417
00:30:26,603 --> 00:30:28,626
So, uh,
where's Prince Charming?

418
00:30:28,647 --> 00:30:30,837
- What?
- Your boyfriend.

419
00:30:30,858 --> 00:30:35,882
He's not worthy of discussion,
believe me.

420
00:30:35,903 --> 00:30:39,137
Hey, that's the road
to the Food Mart!

421
00:30:41,243 --> 00:30:43,225
Okay.

422
00:30:43,246 --> 00:30:46,352
Well, I guess I'll be
a gentleman and take you home.

423
00:30:46,373 --> 00:30:48,187
Don't think we're gonna make it.

424
00:30:48,208 --> 00:30:50,482
It's a good 15 miles from here.

425
00:30:50,503 --> 00:30:52,233
If there are trees down here,

426
00:30:52,254 --> 00:30:54,526
there are trees down everywhere.

427
00:30:54,547 --> 00:30:59,032
All right, looks like
you're coming with me.

428
00:31:09,814 --> 00:31:11,210
Yeah, you know,
it's been about a...

429
00:31:11,231 --> 00:31:12,461
about a month since we
lost her, and, you know...

430
00:31:12,482 --> 00:31:14,965
I'm so sorry
for that, Isaac.

431
00:31:14,986 --> 00:31:17,966
- Here's to life.
- Cheers. Cheers.

432
00:31:17,987 --> 00:31:19,260
Hey. No way.

433
00:31:19,281 --> 00:31:22,179
Hey, guys. Uh...
this is Courtney.

434
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,346
Hi.

435
00:31:23,367 --> 00:31:24,391
- Hello, Courtney.
- Hi. How are you?

436
00:31:24,412 --> 00:31:26,183
I'm Jack.

437
00:31:26,204 --> 00:31:27,727
You work at the Food Mart.

438
00:31:27,748 --> 00:31:29,561
Yes.

439
00:31:29,582 --> 00:31:31,563
Thank you for letting me
into your home.

440
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:35,235
Oh, well... home,
sweet home.

441
00:31:35,256 --> 00:31:36,569
Hey, Courtney, you, uh...
you need some clean clothes?

442
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,238
What?

443
00:31:38,259 --> 00:31:39,448
I got clean clothes
if you need 'em.

444
00:31:39,469 --> 00:31:41,115
No, thanks. I'll survive.

445
00:31:41,136 --> 00:31:42,492
Okay.

446
00:31:42,513 --> 00:31:45,327
I think I have something more...

447
00:31:45,348 --> 00:31:47,247
suitable for you upstairs.

448
00:31:47,268 --> 00:31:48,915
Follow me.

449
00:31:54,357 --> 00:31:56,797
What's this?

450
00:32:06,704 --> 00:32:08,600
Ahh.

451
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,940
It's a little dated,
but it's clean.

452
00:32:14,461 --> 00:32:16,149
It's beautiful.

453
00:32:59,422 --> 00:33:01,113
Better.

454
00:33:43,216 --> 00:33:44,739
No.

455
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,534
Help me.
Please, please, help me.

456
00:33:47,555 --> 00:33:50,619
There's bad people here.

457
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,872
They're trying to hurt...

458
00:33:52,893 --> 00:33:54,665
What's wrong?

459
00:33:54,686 --> 00:33:57,000
What's going on?

460
00:33:57,021 --> 00:33:58,502
I'm so glad you're here.

461
00:33:58,523 --> 00:34:01,047
I just need your help.

462
00:34:01,068 --> 00:34:03,299
We're in danger.
We've got to get out of here.

463
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,593
What are you talking about?

464
00:34:04,614 --> 00:34:06,469
You have to help me, please.

465
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:08,513
I want you to stay
with me, please.

466
00:34:08,534 --> 00:34:10,766
- Please stay. Just...
- Let me go.

467
00:34:10,787 --> 00:34:12,892
No, no, just wait.
Let me explain.

468
00:34:12,913 --> 00:34:14,101
Let me explain, please.

469
00:34:14,122 --> 00:34:15,602
- We're in danger.
- Okay.

470
00:34:15,623 --> 00:34:17,063
Just stay here with me,
please. Please.

471
00:34:17,084 --> 00:34:19,107
I'll go get you some help.
Just let me go.

472
00:34:19,128 --> 00:34:21,066
Just let me go. I'm gonna
get you some help, okay?

473
00:34:21,087 --> 00:34:23,443
Okay. Don't... don't...
it matters who... who...

474
00:34:23,464 --> 00:34:25,571
- Wait. Wait!
- You're hurting me! Let me go!

475
00:34:25,592 --> 00:34:27,947
- Wait! Wait!
- You're hurting me!

476
00:34:37,896 --> 00:34:39,418
Hey.

477
00:34:39,439 --> 00:34:41,296
- Hey, what's up?
- Where's Lipski?

478
00:34:41,317 --> 00:34:43,632
I don't know. Have you seen Jack,
though? I need some food.

479
00:34:43,653 --> 00:34:45,298
Listen, something's wrong
with McCormick. I don't know.

480
00:34:45,319 --> 00:34:47,258
We've got to find Jack.
I'm gonna get the doc.

481
00:34:47,279 --> 00:34:48,385
What are you talking about?

482
00:34:48,406 --> 00:34:49,385
Hey, slow down.
What do you mean?

483
00:34:49,406 --> 00:34:51,263
Aah!

484
00:34:51,284 --> 00:34:54,432
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

485
00:34:54,453 --> 00:34:56,435
Bill?

486
00:34:56,456 --> 00:34:59,314
Bill? Bill!

487
00:34:59,335 --> 00:35:01,189
Why isn't he answering me?!

488
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:03,735
- What happened?
- Hey, what's going on here?

489
00:35:03,756 --> 00:35:06,402
- He was fine when I left him.
- Oh, my God. I think he's dead!

490
00:35:06,423 --> 00:35:07,948
I knew we should've
taken him to the hospital.

491
00:35:07,969 --> 00:35:09,950
We did
everything we could.

492
00:35:09,971 --> 00:35:12,035
He seemed okay.

493
00:35:12,056 --> 00:35:14,287
What? What?! What?!

494
00:35:14,308 --> 00:35:17,038
There are some marks around his neck,
but I don't remember...

495
00:35:17,059 --> 00:35:19,165
- if they were there before.
- What do you mean, marks?

496
00:35:19,186 --> 00:35:20,584
What do you mean,
you don't remember?

497
00:35:20,605 --> 00:35:22,128
I don't know
how I could've missed them,

498
00:35:22,149 --> 00:35:24,420
- but I'm not sure.
- What kind of fucking doctor

499
00:35:24,441 --> 00:35:26,256
- are you?
- Try to fucking remember!

500
00:35:26,277 --> 00:35:28,134
Were the marks there
before or not?

501
00:35:28,155 --> 00:35:29,635
What?!

502
00:35:29,656 --> 00:35:31,387
I'm sorry.
I just can't remember.

503
00:35:31,408 --> 00:35:33,722
You did this.

504
00:35:33,743 --> 00:35:35,766
You screwed up.

505
00:35:35,786 --> 00:35:38,184
You fucking murderer.
Fucking liar!

506
00:35:38,205 --> 00:35:41,690
Get off me! Get off me!

507
00:35:41,711 --> 00:35:43,399
Let me go!
Get your hands off me!

508
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:46,987
Everyone just calm down.

509
00:35:47,008 --> 00:35:50,574
I'm sorry.
I just don't remember.

510
00:35:50,595 --> 00:35:52,574
Yes, you are sorry.

511
00:36:00,562 --> 00:36:03,377
Who was the last person
to see him alive?

512
00:36:04,732 --> 00:36:07,131
I saw him about
ten minutes ago.

513
00:36:07,152 --> 00:36:08,506
What were you doing
in his room?

514
00:36:08,527 --> 00:36:10,342
I heard him calling for help.

515
00:36:10,363 --> 00:36:11,926
Then I went to get you.

516
00:36:11,947 --> 00:36:13,597
Yeah, I told Courtney
to go look for you.

517
00:36:13,618 --> 00:36:15,806
And I couldn't find her.

518
00:36:15,827 --> 00:36:17,558
So, where were you?

519
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:20,186
What? Me?

520
00:36:20,207 --> 00:36:22,520
What, are you accusing me
of killing my own husband?

521
00:36:22,541 --> 00:36:24,439
She was the last person
in his room.

522
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,026
She was going for help, okay?

523
00:36:28,256 --> 00:36:29,903
Look, there were...

524
00:36:29,924 --> 00:36:33,323
there were no red marks
on his neck. I'm positive.

525
00:36:33,344 --> 00:36:35,534
You're not helping.
You're just scaring everyone.

526
00:36:35,555 --> 00:36:36,703
Well, maybe we should be scared.

527
00:36:36,724 --> 00:36:38,121
He's right. You know what?

528
00:36:38,142 --> 00:36:39,705
You may think
maybe I'm crazy, but...

529
00:36:39,726 --> 00:36:41,958
I think we should get outta here
right now, all of us.

530
00:36:41,979 --> 00:36:43,292
Courtney, come with us.

531
00:36:43,313 --> 00:36:44,376
Yeah, come on. You, too.

532
00:36:44,397 --> 00:36:45,960
But either way, I'm out of here.

533
00:36:49,903 --> 00:36:53,385
Isaac! Come on.
We gotta wait for Courtney!

534
00:36:53,406 --> 00:36:55,054
Yeah, right.

535
00:36:55,075 --> 00:36:57,514
Hey, God damn it, please,
just give her a minute.

536
00:36:58,996 --> 00:37:00,809
Okay, one minute, Adam.

537
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:02,478
If she's not here,
we're leaving without her, okay?

538
00:37:02,499 --> 00:37:03,938
Now screw your fucking head on!

539
00:37:12,133 --> 00:37:13,822
I got nothing here.
Help me out.

540
00:37:13,843 --> 00:37:15,242
Open her up.

541
00:37:18,265 --> 00:37:20,121
What have we got?

542
00:37:20,142 --> 00:37:21,746
What the hell?

543
00:37:21,767 --> 00:37:24,708
- Come here.
- What is it?

544
00:37:26,482 --> 00:37:28,003
Oh, great.

545
00:37:29,527 --> 00:37:31,925
Fucking great.

546
00:37:31,946 --> 00:37:33,759
God damn it. God damn it!

547
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,762
I guess we're staying, huh?

548
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,266
Jack.

549
00:37:40,287 --> 00:37:41,350
Yeah.

550
00:37:50,212 --> 00:37:52,111
Why'd you fuck up
the truck, Jack?

551
00:37:52,132 --> 00:37:54,737
Hmm? Fuck up the truck?

552
00:37:54,758 --> 00:37:56,282
Yeah, all the wires are cut.

553
00:37:56,303 --> 00:37:58,993
Who do you think
you're accusing?

554
00:37:59,014 --> 00:38:00,369
Who else would it be, Jack?

555
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:02,956
Oh, I'm gonna trash
my own truck?

556
00:38:02,977 --> 00:38:05,331
Yeah, maybe so. It'd be
a good way to trap us, wouldn't it?

557
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,544
You were the last one
to use the truck.

558
00:38:09,565 --> 00:38:11,046
- That's bullshit.
- That's fuckin' bullshit,

559
00:38:11,067 --> 00:38:12,422
and you know it.

560
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,765
You got a flashlight, Jack?

561
00:38:21,786 --> 00:38:25,019
Find it your damn self.

562
00:38:27,583 --> 00:38:29,983
Some more lights wouldn't hurt.

563
00:38:32,756 --> 00:38:35,405
Ah, shit!

564
00:38:35,426 --> 00:38:37,281
What?

565
00:38:37,302 --> 00:38:39,075
What happened? Are you okay?

566
00:38:39,096 --> 00:38:41,369
Yeah, I'm fine. It's just
a nail or something here.

567
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,037
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, shit.

568
00:38:43,058 --> 00:38:45,123
Let me see.
It needs to get cleaned.

569
00:38:45,144 --> 00:38:46,707
I'll get some towels.

570
00:38:46,728 --> 00:38:48,791
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

571
00:38:48,812 --> 00:38:50,668
You are one clumsy
son of a bitch.

572
00:38:50,689 --> 00:38:52,628
Yeah, I am.

573
00:38:52,648 --> 00:38:55,090
- Let me see.
- What do you think?

574
00:38:55,111 --> 00:38:56,593
- You'll survive.
- Here.

575
00:38:56,614 --> 00:38:58,593
Let me clean this.

576
00:38:59,949 --> 00:39:01,221
- Uhh!
- Does it hurt?

577
00:39:01,242 --> 00:39:02,305
Yeah, a little bit.

578
00:39:02,326 --> 00:39:04,934
Poor thing. You're such a girl.

579
00:39:05,956 --> 00:39:06,934
Yeah, I know.

580
00:39:06,955 --> 00:39:08,478
I'll get that. Fine?

581
00:39:08,499 --> 00:39:10,357
- Thank you.
- Okay.

582
00:39:13,296 --> 00:39:17,196
We're not just gonna
let Jack slide on this, are we?

583
00:39:17,217 --> 00:39:19,030
You kidding me? No, we're not.

584
00:39:19,051 --> 00:39:20,742
We should take care
of McCormick's body

585
00:39:20,763 --> 00:39:22,284
before rigor sets in.

586
00:39:22,305 --> 00:39:25,496
Can you give me a hand now?
Come on.

587
00:39:25,517 --> 00:39:27,582
Okay, watch your back, eh?

588
00:39:28,936 --> 00:39:31,793
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

589
00:39:31,814 --> 00:39:33,545
Are you sure you're okay?

590
00:39:33,566 --> 00:39:36,339
Yeah, I'm okay.
I'm a baby, but not that bad.

591
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:42,012
Doc...

592
00:39:42,033 --> 00:39:44,764
look, right before
Brooklyn screamed,

593
00:39:44,785 --> 00:39:47,519
no one knew where Jack was.

594
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:51,688
And you saw he was...
he was the last to get here.

595
00:39:51,709 --> 00:39:54,776
I don't know.
I just can't be sure...

596
00:39:54,797 --> 00:39:57,736
this wasn't
because of the accident.

597
00:39:57,757 --> 00:39:59,737
I wanted to get him
to the hospital.

598
00:39:59,758 --> 00:40:02,533
Don't you think
you would've seen the marks?

599
00:40:02,554 --> 00:40:06,078
I'm telling you,
I didn't see a thing on the guy.

600
00:40:06,099 --> 00:40:08,415
I honestly can't be sure.

601
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:13,961
I just started
my practice again.

602
00:40:16,067 --> 00:40:18,216
Yeah?

603
00:40:18,237 --> 00:40:20,925
What? What...
what happened?

604
00:40:20,946 --> 00:40:23,637
I had a problem
with painkillers.

605
00:40:23,658 --> 00:40:25,640
It clouded my judgment.

606
00:40:27,329 --> 00:40:29,059
I missed things.

607
00:40:31,666 --> 00:40:34,231
You second-guess yourself a lot,
don't you?

608
00:40:36,545 --> 00:40:39,902
I'm just
not as confident as I was.

609
00:40:39,924 --> 00:40:42,489
Well, you didn't
misdiagnose this.

610
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:44,658
I'm telling you,
I looked closely.

611
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:47,579
There were
no red marks on his neck.

612
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,164
It was just a head wound.

613
00:40:50,185 --> 00:40:52,749
I don't...
I don't know.

614
00:41:36,314 --> 00:41:39,047
My mom used to say that...

615
00:41:39,068 --> 00:41:41,299
death was the end
of one chapter

616
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,049
and the beginning of another.

617
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:45,178
Mm-hmm.

618
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:47,513
You were close to your mother.

619
00:41:49,577 --> 00:41:50,598
Yeah.

620
00:41:51,955 --> 00:41:53,768
You were her favorite.

621
00:41:55,251 --> 00:41:57,147
You've been talking
to Isaac, I see.

622
00:41:57,168 --> 00:42:00,651
No. I just knew it.

623
00:42:00,672 --> 00:42:03,069
How long have you had
this house?

624
00:42:05,425 --> 00:42:08,034
Feels like...

625
00:42:08,055 --> 00:42:09,618
forever.

626
00:42:12,141 --> 00:42:14,748
We're done here.

627
00:43:41,065 --> 00:43:42,711
Aah!

628
00:43:57,373 --> 00:43:59,145
We interrupt this broadcast...

629
00:43:59,166 --> 00:44:01,356
to bring you some breaking news.

630
00:44:01,377 --> 00:44:04,317
We're under a tornado watch
for the following counties...

631
00:44:04,338 --> 00:44:08,361
Scott, Bernette, Polk,
Marshall and Red Lake.

632
00:44:08,382 --> 00:44:11,572
There is severe wind,
lightning and rain.

633
00:44:11,593 --> 00:44:15,743
Several inches have fallen
in just a few hours tonight.

634
00:44:15,764 --> 00:44:17,288
Travel is near impossible

635
00:44:17,309 --> 00:44:19,955
due to downed trees
and flooded roads.

636
00:44:19,976 --> 00:44:21,667
Officials told Newswatch

637
00:44:21,688 --> 00:44:24,043
that five people have perished
in the storm.

638
00:44:24,064 --> 00:44:25,713
The aforementioned counties

639
00:44:25,734 --> 00:44:27,421
have been declared
a weather emergency.

640
00:44:27,442 --> 00:44:28,965
How are you?

641
00:44:28,986 --> 00:44:31,676
Terrifying nightmares.

642
00:44:31,697 --> 00:44:36,014
This is the worst storm
to hit this area in a 100 years.

643
00:44:36,035 --> 00:44:38,725
Regardless,
I need to get some sleep.

644
00:44:38,746 --> 00:44:40,851
Yeah, I could use
some rest, too.

645
00:44:40,872 --> 00:44:43,523
I'll show you to your rooms.

646
00:44:43,544 --> 00:44:45,774
You two can share a room, yes?

647
00:44:45,795 --> 00:44:48,193
Uh... yeah.

648
00:44:50,133 --> 00:44:52,487
You'll sleep on the floor.

649
00:44:52,508 --> 00:44:55,784
Guess I'll be down here,
checking this thing.

650
00:44:55,805 --> 00:44:57,743
Okay, I'll flip you for it.

651
00:44:57,764 --> 00:45:00,289
- ¶ Of the silvery moon ¶
- If you want, brother.

652
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:02,164
- Call it.
- Heads.

653
00:45:02,185 --> 00:45:04,042
- ¶ I want to spoon ¶
- Tails.

654
00:45:04,063 --> 00:45:06,337
Sleep tight, brother.

655
00:45:06,358 --> 00:45:09,548
¶ To my honey, I'll croon ¶

656
00:45:09,569 --> 00:45:12,217
- ¶ Love's tune ¶
- Hey, you okay?

657
00:45:12,238 --> 00:45:13,885
- ¶ Honey moon ¶
- It's gonna be okay.

658
00:45:47,982 --> 00:45:50,172
Are you asleep?

659
00:45:51,611 --> 00:45:52,758
Nope.

660
00:45:54,155 --> 00:45:55,801
Don't get any ideas...

661
00:45:55,822 --> 00:45:58,555
but maybe you could
sleep up here with me?

662
00:45:58,576 --> 00:46:00,348
I'm a little frightened.

663
00:46:01,788 --> 00:46:04,894
Uh, yeah. You know...

664
00:46:04,915 --> 00:46:07,147
since you asked me nicely.

665
00:46:27,021 --> 00:46:30,295
I don't mean to scare you,

666
00:46:30,316 --> 00:46:33,756
but I think I saw something
earlier in the mirror.

667
00:46:35,446 --> 00:46:36,885
You saw something?

668
00:46:38,075 --> 00:46:40,722
Actually, it was a little boy.

669
00:46:40,743 --> 00:46:43,142
He was staring at me
in the mirror.

670
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:47,228
Never mind.
You don't believe me.

671
00:46:47,249 --> 00:46:50,397
No. No, no, no.
I, uh...

672
00:46:50,418 --> 00:46:53,150
I've actually been
seeing things, too.

673
00:46:53,171 --> 00:46:55,070
Like what?

674
00:46:56,718 --> 00:47:00,784
I saw the woman in the robe
that McCormick talked about.

675
00:47:01,849 --> 00:47:03,869
Do you believe in ghosts?

676
00:47:05,893 --> 00:47:08,959
I don't know.
I mean...

677
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:11,754
I've never really
thought about it.

678
00:47:11,775 --> 00:47:14,924
You think this has
anything to do with...

679
00:47:14,945 --> 00:47:16,757
What, McCormick's death?

680
00:47:16,778 --> 00:47:19,928
No. No. I don't think so.

681
00:47:23,036 --> 00:47:25,057
Hey, don't be scared.

682
00:48:18,966 --> 00:48:21,406
Oh, it's you.

683
00:48:21,427 --> 00:48:24,409
Hey, you've been busy, huh?

684
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:26,995
I guess you're good
with that ax, right, Jack?

685
00:48:31,104 --> 00:48:33,460
Wow, this weather's
not so good, huh?

686
00:48:35,524 --> 00:48:36,879
Hey, Jack.

687
00:48:38,234 --> 00:48:40,507
May I ask you a question?

688
00:48:40,529 --> 00:48:43,345
Living out here by yourself
in the middle of nowhere,

689
00:48:43,366 --> 00:48:46,348
you ever get lonely,
freaked out?

690
00:48:46,369 --> 00:48:48,516
Mm-mm.

691
00:48:51,165 --> 00:48:53,481
I was meant to be here.

692
00:48:55,462 --> 00:48:56,858
Yeah.

693
00:48:59,674 --> 00:49:02,030
I just know I couldn't do it.
That's all.

694
00:49:02,051 --> 00:49:04,573
I sense you feel alone.

695
00:49:09,393 --> 00:49:10,997
Well, you know, I guess.

696
00:49:11,018 --> 00:49:13,626
I guess we all do
sometimes, right?

697
00:49:23,364 --> 00:49:25,303
You know...

698
00:49:25,324 --> 00:49:27,764
You know, even as a kid,
you know, my brother Adam,

699
00:49:27,785 --> 00:49:30,517
he was kind of hard
to get to know sometimes.

700
00:49:30,538 --> 00:49:32,687
I mean, I love him.

701
00:49:32,708 --> 00:49:36,023
Heh. Sometimes he thinks
he knows everything. That's all.

702
00:49:38,086 --> 00:49:40,485
And you're the oldest.

703
00:49:40,506 --> 00:49:43,154
Uh-huh.

704
00:49:45,095 --> 00:49:47,742
He was your mother's favorite.

705
00:49:52,811 --> 00:49:56,668
She loved me, man.
She loved me.

706
00:49:56,689 --> 00:49:59,378
He got the grades,
got the looks,

707
00:49:59,399 --> 00:50:01,965
scholarships.
You know how it is.

708
00:50:09,453 --> 00:50:11,057
Jack...

709
00:50:13,414 --> 00:50:16,479
you can kind of
sense things, right?

710
00:50:17,626 --> 00:50:19,649
Mm-hmm.

711
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:21,192
Cool.

712
00:50:22,966 --> 00:50:24,362
How you doing?
Hey, let me help you.

713
00:50:27,426 --> 00:50:29,451
So, when you were a kid,
even back then,

714
00:50:29,472 --> 00:50:31,411
you could... you could
feel things, sense things,

715
00:50:31,432 --> 00:50:32,830
or what?

716
00:51:28,363 --> 00:51:30,803
Hey. Wait.

717
00:51:37,248 --> 00:51:39,020
Oh, my God.

718
00:51:40,416 --> 00:51:41,981
No, no, no!

719
00:51:56,809 --> 00:52:03,418
Okay.

720
00:52:05,818 --> 00:52:07,840
Whew! Oh, my God.

721
00:52:07,861 --> 00:52:11,053
I think we're all,
uh... on edge here.

722
00:52:11,074 --> 00:52:12,303
Let's have a drink. Cheers.

723
00:52:12,324 --> 00:52:14,180
Cheers.

724
00:52:21,083 --> 00:52:23,564
Hey, brother, you wanna play
some cards, have a drink?

725
00:52:23,585 --> 00:52:25,442
- Yeah.
- Where were you?

726
00:52:25,463 --> 00:52:27,442
I woke up,
and you weren't there.

727
00:52:27,463 --> 00:52:30,572
I, uh... I think...

728
00:52:30,593 --> 00:52:34,324
I think I saw a little boy
kill a little girl.

729
00:52:34,345 --> 00:52:35,619
What are you talking about?

730
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,746
Nightmares? You, too?
Yeah, join the club.

731
00:52:37,767 --> 00:52:40,582
No. No, no,
it's not a nightmare.

732
00:52:40,603 --> 00:52:42,126
I'm telling you, it was, like,

733
00:52:42,147 --> 00:52:45,420
as real as I'm fucking
standing here right now.

734
00:52:45,441 --> 00:52:46,880
It was like that.

735
00:52:46,901 --> 00:52:48,714
Let me ask you...
Hang on. Slow down.

736
00:52:48,735 --> 00:52:51,301
You're telling me you saw,
like, a little boy?

737
00:52:51,322 --> 00:52:53,010
- Yeah.
- Dark hair, dark eyes?

738
00:52:53,031 --> 00:52:54,137
Yeah.

739
00:52:55,702 --> 00:52:58,266
I know. Yeah.

740
00:52:58,287 --> 00:53:00,434
Hang on. Wait a second.

741
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,776
Like this?

742
00:53:18,432 --> 00:53:20,622
Yeah, it was that.
It was that.

743
00:53:20,643 --> 00:53:22,707
It was him.
Yeah, this kid right here,

744
00:53:22,728 --> 00:53:24,584
and he... he killed this girl...

745
00:53:25,813 --> 00:53:26,961
right here.

746
00:53:26,982 --> 00:53:28,755
It was his face
I saw in the mirror.

747
00:53:28,776 --> 00:53:30,423
I saw this little girl.

748
00:53:31,905 --> 00:53:34,426
Okay, something is
going on in this house.

749
00:53:34,447 --> 00:53:35,510
- Yeah, there... yeah, there is.
- Yeah?

750
00:53:35,531 --> 00:53:37,471
- Yeah.
- Okay, uh...

751
00:53:39,744 --> 00:53:40,850
We gotta find Jack.

752
00:53:43,791 --> 00:53:46,606
Okay. I'll go with you, okay?

753
00:53:48,713 --> 00:53:50,110
I'm staying with you.

754
00:53:50,131 --> 00:53:51,737
Yeah, it's okay.

755
00:53:51,758 --> 00:53:53,446
It's gonna be okay.
Don't worry.

756
00:54:20,118 --> 00:54:22,392
I'm not going in there.

757
00:54:22,413 --> 00:54:23,809
Why not?

758
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:27,814
I don't think
he'd want us going in there.

759
00:54:29,378 --> 00:54:31,484
Okay.

760
00:54:31,505 --> 00:54:33,194
Stand guard.

761
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:34,444
Make it fast.

762
00:55:03,662 --> 00:55:05,811
You okay?

763
00:55:05,832 --> 00:55:06,810
Yeah.

764
00:55:06,831 --> 00:55:08,063
Stay with me.

765
00:55:38,989 --> 00:55:40,511
What?

766
00:55:43,077 --> 00:55:44,765
Oh, my God.

767
00:55:48,123 --> 00:55:50,855
"Child killer"...

768
00:56:03,098 --> 00:56:05,496
You okay?

769
00:56:05,517 --> 00:56:07,623
Yeah. Just please go away.

770
00:56:07,644 --> 00:56:09,957
You give me a shout
if you need me.

771
00:56:09,978 --> 00:56:11,668
Yeah.

772
00:56:49,852 --> 00:56:52,333
Jack.

773
00:56:52,354 --> 00:56:56,212
No.

774
00:57:01,614 --> 00:57:03,261
What is this?

775
00:57:05,702 --> 00:57:07,641
Find what you're looking for?

776
00:57:23,553 --> 00:57:24,867
Isaac?

777
00:57:42,572 --> 00:57:44,678
Ohh! Oh, my God!

778
00:57:44,699 --> 00:57:46,930
I'm sorry. I heard you call my name.
Are you okay?

779
00:57:46,951 --> 00:57:49,390
- You scared the crap out of me.
- I'm sorry.

780
00:57:49,411 --> 00:57:51,185
You okay?

781
00:57:51,206 --> 00:57:53,436
I don't know.
Did you find Jack?

782
00:57:53,457 --> 00:57:55,771
No, not yet.
I'm gonna keep looking.

783
00:57:55,792 --> 00:57:57,229
You should...
you should get some rest.

784
00:57:57,253 --> 00:57:58,484
Yeah, right.

785
00:57:58,505 --> 00:58:01,068
I'll see you in a minute.

786
00:58:05,845 --> 00:58:07,951
Questions?

787
00:58:09,057 --> 00:58:10,286
Yeah.

788
00:58:14,269 --> 00:58:16,708
Who... who are these people?

789
00:58:18,733 --> 00:58:23,174
A tragedy struck this house
a century ago.

790
00:58:24,531 --> 00:58:26,844
Tragedy?

791
00:58:26,865 --> 00:58:28,388
Have a seat.

792
00:58:52,866 --> 00:58:54,230
Hello?

793
00:59:09,531 --> 00:59:10,831
Hello?

794
00:59:41,564 --> 00:59:44,547
This is William,

795
00:59:44,568 --> 00:59:47,717
the adopted boy's father.

796
00:59:49,323 --> 00:59:51,178
So, what led him to kill 'em?

797
00:59:51,199 --> 00:59:53,638
He was a very disturbed
little boy.

798
00:59:55,330 --> 00:59:58,935
When the authorities asked him
why did he kill his family,

799
00:59:58,956 --> 01:00:01,523
he... he...

800
01:00:01,544 --> 01:00:04,983
he said
that he didn't remember.

801
01:00:05,004 --> 01:00:07,986
He said that he didn't know
that he killed them.

802
01:00:09,258 --> 01:00:10,907
When the storm came on,

803
01:00:10,928 --> 01:00:14,327
he said he felt like
he was possessed...

804
01:00:14,348 --> 01:00:15,411
a demon.

805
01:00:18,186 --> 01:00:22,376
There was a storm this size
that night also.

806
01:00:23,649 --> 01:00:25,796
How do you live
in this house, Jack?

807
01:00:27,194 --> 01:00:28,549
You must get spooked.

808
01:00:32,657 --> 01:00:34,638
This is my sanctuary.

809
01:00:34,659 --> 01:00:37,308
Your sanctuary? Jesus.

810
01:00:39,081 --> 01:00:41,396
Yes.

811
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:47,402
Why'd you keep this a secret
from us this whole time?

812
01:00:48,673 --> 01:00:51,155
The time wasn't right.

813
01:00:51,176 --> 01:00:53,282
Well, it's time
to tell the others.

814
01:00:59,477 --> 01:01:01,457
Hmm.

815
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:09,882
100 years ago...

816
01:01:09,903 --> 01:01:13,053
a little boy murdered
his entire family

817
01:01:13,074 --> 01:01:14,721
in this house.

818
01:01:16,244 --> 01:01:18,683
Some people say
they've seen...

819
01:01:18,704 --> 01:01:22,186
the ghost of the boy
and his family.

820
01:01:22,207 --> 01:01:26,606
Sometimes, when a person
dies a violent death,

821
01:01:26,627 --> 01:01:29,111
their spirit can't rest.

822
01:01:30,716 --> 01:01:33,572
So, it's possible
that their spirits

823
01:01:33,593 --> 01:01:35,742
are living in this house.

824
01:01:35,763 --> 01:01:37,326
Why didn't you tell us?

825
01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:41,872
Would you have preferred
that I left you outside

826
01:01:41,893 --> 01:01:44,083
while the storm was approaching?

827
01:01:44,104 --> 01:01:46,669
Heh. No, I think we all agree

828
01:01:46,690 --> 01:01:49,880
that you're much safer in here.

829
01:01:49,901 --> 01:01:55,594
Now, it's been a long,
long day for all of us.

830
01:01:55,615 --> 01:01:57,847
I'm going to get some sleep,

831
01:01:57,868 --> 01:02:00,598
and I suggest you do the same.

832
01:02:05,292 --> 01:02:07,231
Boo!

833
01:02:07,252 --> 01:02:09,317
Ha ha ha ha!

834
01:02:13,215 --> 01:02:16,575
I'm sorry
I got you into this mess.

835
01:02:16,596 --> 01:02:19,870
Actually, I feel like
I should be apologizing to you.

836
01:02:19,891 --> 01:02:21,454
Hmm?

837
01:02:23,351 --> 01:02:26,709
Bad things seem to follow me
wherever I go.

838
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:30,379
I swear, sometimes I'm cursed
or something.

839
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,882
Ah, we all have trouble
in our lives.

840
01:02:32,903 --> 01:02:36,468
Trust me, I'm hard to top.

841
01:02:36,489 --> 01:02:41,431
When I was ten, my dad
shot my mother and himself.

842
01:02:41,452 --> 01:02:43,101
Oh, my God.

843
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:47,689
I'm so sorry.

844
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:50,649
We had just moved to the U.S.

845
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:53,360
I got home from school.

846
01:02:53,381 --> 01:02:56,655
The police were already there.

847
01:02:56,676 --> 01:02:58,782
I spent the next eight years

848
01:02:58,803 --> 01:03:01,785
going from one foster home
to another.

849
01:03:01,806 --> 01:03:04,206
And the stuff I saw,

850
01:03:04,227 --> 01:03:06,458
I experienced,

851
01:03:06,479 --> 01:03:08,834
I can't talk about it.

852
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:16,301
So, how did you
find your way out here?

853
01:03:16,322 --> 01:03:19,970
I wanted to get as far away
as I could from everything.

854
01:03:19,991 --> 01:03:23,807
It's quiet out here,
you know, peaceful.

855
01:03:23,828 --> 01:03:27,435
Something about it
just felt like home.

856
01:03:29,334 --> 01:03:32,440
Yeah, I know what you mean.

857
01:03:32,461 --> 01:03:35,444
Mm-hmm.

858
01:03:35,465 --> 01:03:38,739
I don't know.
Maybe it's you, but...

859
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,450
something about you
feels like home.

860
01:03:46,142 --> 01:03:47,957
We should get some sleep.

861
01:03:47,978 --> 01:03:49,583
Okay.

862
01:03:54,192 --> 01:03:57,092
This couch is so uncomfortable.

863
01:03:58,197 --> 01:04:00,554
I can't sleep.

864
01:04:05,328 --> 01:04:08,018
Well, you've been
through a lot, you know.

865
01:04:08,039 --> 01:04:09,519
It's understandable.

866
01:04:15,170 --> 01:04:17,695
Hey, look, I'm...
I'm really sorry.

867
01:05:00,801 --> 01:05:02,697
Are you okay?

868
01:05:02,718 --> 01:05:04,408
Ohh.

869
01:05:07,558 --> 01:05:09,661
I saw more of the murders.

870
01:05:12,396 --> 01:05:15,502
An old lady in a wheelchair.

871
01:05:15,523 --> 01:05:19,590
And the other sister,
he... he killed her.

872
01:05:22,529 --> 01:05:24,261
Babe, it was just a dream.

873
01:05:24,282 --> 01:05:27,849
I don't know. It...
I mean, it happened here.

874
01:05:27,870 --> 01:05:30,100
It happened.

875
01:05:30,121 --> 01:05:32,937
I can't take this anymore.

876
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:36,564
Look.

877
01:05:37,838 --> 01:05:40,070
I found this...

878
01:05:40,091 --> 01:05:41,904
in the study.

879
01:05:43,593 --> 01:05:46,242
That looks exactly like Jack.

880
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:50,328
But this is so old.

881
01:05:50,349 --> 01:05:52,122
Could it be his grandfather?

882
01:05:52,143 --> 01:05:53,456
That's his face.

883
01:05:57,648 --> 01:05:59,380
I don't know,
but I say we leave.

884
01:05:59,401 --> 01:06:01,673
I say we...

885
01:06:02,861 --> 01:06:04,842
What is it?

886
01:06:10,997 --> 01:06:13,851
Adam, maybe someone else
is in the house.

887
01:06:20,255 --> 01:06:22,319
What just happened?

888
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:24,153
Stay here.

889
01:06:29,513 --> 01:06:31,453
What about you?
You get any rest?

890
01:06:31,474 --> 01:06:34,205
In this place?
Not a wink.

891
01:06:39,481 --> 01:06:41,045
You sure you don't want
to get some real sleep

892
01:06:41,066 --> 01:06:42,340
upstairs in the bed?

893
01:06:46,865 --> 01:06:48,929
i don't want to be alone.

894
01:06:50,995 --> 01:06:52,934
It's okay.

895
01:06:52,955 --> 01:06:55,309
I'll come with you.
I'll keep an eye on you.

896
01:06:55,330 --> 01:06:57,521
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

897
01:06:57,542 --> 01:06:59,315
Come on.

898
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:16,016
Yeah, you're gonna feel okay

899
01:08:16,037 --> 01:08:17,560
when you get some sleep,
you know?

900
01:08:17,581 --> 01:08:18,601
- Ohh.
- What is it?

901
01:08:18,622 --> 01:08:21,063
The floor's wet or something.

902
01:08:23,337 --> 01:08:24,316
No, it's not.

903
01:08:24,337 --> 01:08:25,484
Blood.

904
01:08:25,505 --> 01:08:26,902
- What the...
- Aah!

905
01:08:26,923 --> 01:08:29,321
- Okay.
- Ohh! Oh, my God!

906
01:08:31,218 --> 01:08:33,368
Okay. Hang on.

907
01:08:38,476 --> 01:08:40,958
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

908
01:08:42,855 --> 01:08:43,962
It's okay.

909
01:08:52,198 --> 01:08:53,679
Adam.

910
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:55,597
Somebody was in this room.

911
01:08:55,618 --> 01:08:57,140
- What?
- Yeah...

912
01:08:57,161 --> 01:08:58,724
Are you okay?

913
01:08:58,745 --> 01:09:00,185
- It's not mine.
- What happened to you?

914
01:09:00,206 --> 01:09:01,478
It's Lipski's. He's dead.

915
01:09:01,499 --> 01:09:03,105
- What?
- What?

916
01:09:03,126 --> 01:09:04,815
We found him in Brooklyn's room.
His throat was cut.

917
01:09:04,836 --> 01:09:06,525
Okay, we're getting
the hell out of here right now.

918
01:09:06,546 --> 01:09:07,692
Well, that's a good idea, Adam.
I've been ready for a while.

919
01:09:07,713 --> 01:09:08,902
- Shall we? Let's go.
- Yeah.

920
01:09:08,923 --> 01:09:11,072
Okay, you guys
grab whatever you need.

921
01:09:11,093 --> 01:09:12,739
Let's grab some supplies
from the barn.

922
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:14,241
Okay, good idea.

923
01:09:35,657 --> 01:09:36,931
Flashlight's gonna help.

924
01:09:57,180 --> 01:10:00,829
If we keep heading west,
I think we'll hit the highway.

925
01:10:00,850 --> 01:10:02,706
I still got nothin' on my phone.

926
01:10:02,727 --> 01:10:04,248
Yeah, keep trying, brother.

927
01:10:04,269 --> 01:10:06,084
What's the fuckin' purpose
of these things?

928
01:10:06,105 --> 01:10:08,086
- Aah!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?

929
01:10:08,107 --> 01:10:09,503
Hey, hey, hey. Are you okay?

930
01:10:09,524 --> 01:10:12,217
- I twisted my ankle.
- Ah, shit.

931
01:10:12,238 --> 01:10:14,469
What happened here?

932
01:10:14,490 --> 01:10:16,970
Go. I'll catch up. Go, go.

933
01:10:16,991 --> 01:10:18,095
I'm not leaving you behind.

934
01:10:18,116 --> 01:10:19,389
Look, I gotta
take a look at this.

935
01:10:19,410 --> 01:10:22,225
You guys go ahead,
and we'll catch up.

936
01:10:22,246 --> 01:10:24,395
Okay. Make it fast,
Adam, please.

937
01:10:24,416 --> 01:10:26,312
Yeah.

938
01:10:26,333 --> 01:10:28,023
- Does it hurt?
- You stay with me, okay?

939
01:10:28,044 --> 01:10:29,025
- Stay close.
- Okay.

940
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:36,657
This... this place
is creepy as shit, man.

941
01:10:42,558 --> 01:10:44,288
You see that?

942
01:11:05,206 --> 01:11:07,229
I have no idea
where we are.

943
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:09,982
Brooklyn. Brooklyn?

944
01:11:16,009 --> 01:11:18,782
- Ahh!
- How does that feel?

945
01:11:18,803 --> 01:11:21,158
- Let me see.
- Okay.

946
01:11:23,473 --> 01:11:25,414
- Easy, easy.
- Ah, yeah.

947
01:11:25,435 --> 01:11:27,791
Yeah, it's better.

948
01:11:27,812 --> 01:11:29,710
Okay, let's just take it slow.

949
01:11:29,731 --> 01:11:31,085
Okay.

950
01:11:35,819 --> 01:11:38,092
Hey.

951
01:11:38,113 --> 01:11:40,470
Thank you for staying with me.

952
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:44,974
I got you.

953
01:11:44,995 --> 01:11:46,935
- Come on.
- Okay.

954
01:11:53,505 --> 01:11:55,318
What was that?

955
01:12:00,054 --> 01:12:01,574
Shh.

956
01:12:05,225 --> 01:12:07,165
- Who is that?
- You okay?

957
01:12:07,186 --> 01:12:09,206
- Whoa. Isaac?
- Yeah.

958
01:12:09,227 --> 01:12:10,335
What are you doing?

959
01:12:10,356 --> 01:12:12,251
Look, Brooklyn, she's gone.

960
01:12:12,272 --> 01:12:13,754
- What do you mean, gone?
- What?

961
01:12:13,775 --> 01:12:15,340
I was walking. I turned around.
She disappeared.

962
01:12:15,361 --> 01:12:16,841
I mean literally disappeared.
I've been everywhere.

963
01:12:16,862 --> 01:12:18,674
- I can't find her.
- Oh, that's perfect.

964
01:12:18,695 --> 01:12:21,179
We gotta find her, bro.

965
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:22,720
- Okay?
- Okay.

966
01:12:22,741 --> 01:12:25,141
I'll go this way.
Keep her safe.

967
01:12:25,162 --> 01:12:27,099
- Let's meet back right here.
- Yeah.

968
01:12:29,206 --> 01:12:31,104
I'll be right back.

969
01:12:31,125 --> 01:12:36,068
Okay. Get back A.S.A.P., okay?

970
01:12:37,923 --> 01:12:40,322
Or quicker if I scream.

971
01:13:00,530 --> 01:13:02,886
Isaac?

972
01:13:05,618 --> 01:13:07,475
Isaac!

973
01:13:10,833 --> 01:13:12,311
Oh, it's you.

974
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,447
Courtney, you okay?

975
01:13:22,468 --> 01:13:24,616
There is light over there.

976
01:13:24,637 --> 01:13:26,200
It looks like a house.

977
01:13:26,221 --> 01:13:27,953
Oh, yeah. I see it.

978
01:13:27,974 --> 01:13:29,789
Hey.

979
01:13:29,810 --> 01:13:31,331
- Did you find her?
- No.

980
01:13:31,352 --> 01:13:33,041
We got a house
or something over here.

981
01:13:33,062 --> 01:13:35,002
There's lights.
I don't know about you guys,

982
01:13:35,023 --> 01:13:36,503
but I say we go get some help.

983
01:13:36,524 --> 01:13:38,129
Let's go find out.

984
01:13:58,921 --> 01:14:01,319
The light at the end
of the tunnel.

985
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:03,780
Yeah. Let's hope so.

986
01:14:10,182 --> 01:14:12,372
Let's go see
if they have a phone.

987
01:14:18,608 --> 01:14:21,339
¶ By the light ¶

988
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:25,759
¶ Of the silvery moon ¶

989
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:28,263
¶ I want to spoon ¶

990
01:14:30,329 --> 01:14:33,185
¶ To my honey, I'll croon... ¶

991
01:14:33,206 --> 01:14:36,187
Ah, Adam,
this is the same house.

992
01:14:36,208 --> 01:14:37,856
We've gone in one big circle.

993
01:14:37,877 --> 01:14:39,774
I'm telling you, guys,
we were headed west.

994
01:14:39,795 --> 01:14:41,358
¶ Keep a-shinin' in June ¶

995
01:14:41,379 --> 01:14:42,526
Okay, let's go.

996
01:14:43,550 --> 01:14:44,904
¶ Your silvery beams ¶

997
01:14:44,925 --> 01:14:47,491
¶ Will bring love's dreams... ¶

998
01:14:47,512 --> 01:14:48,533
This isn't happening.

999
01:14:48,554 --> 01:14:51,245
Welcome home.

1000
01:14:53,016 --> 01:14:55,207
¶ By the silvery moon ¶

1001
01:14:55,228 --> 01:14:57,374
I gotta be dreaming.
I gotta be dreaming.

1002
01:14:57,395 --> 01:14:59,045
No, this isn't possible.

1003
01:14:59,066 --> 01:15:01,005
Sure it is.

1004
01:15:01,026 --> 01:15:03,132
You're not leaving.

1005
01:15:03,153 --> 01:15:05,759
This is your home.

1006
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:08,010
It always has been,

1007
01:15:08,031 --> 01:15:10,431
and it always will be.

1008
01:15:10,452 --> 01:15:12,098
Have a seat.

1009
01:15:12,119 --> 01:15:13,975
I saw his throat cut.

1010
01:15:15,582 --> 01:15:19,480
No, I gotta be...
I gotta be dreaming, right, Jack?

1011
01:15:19,501 --> 01:15:23,317
I assure you,
you're not dreaming.

1012
01:15:23,338 --> 01:15:26,446
I have your favorite drink.

1013
01:15:26,467 --> 01:15:27,739
Relax. Have a seat.

1014
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:30,368
No, no. I'm okay.

1015
01:15:30,389 --> 01:15:31,702
Okay, we're getting
out of here right now.

1016
01:15:31,723 --> 01:15:34,496
- And going where?
- Let's go.

1017
01:15:34,517 --> 01:15:36,874
- This is your home!
- You stay away from us!

1018
01:15:36,895 --> 01:15:38,250
This is your home!

1019
01:15:52,076 --> 01:15:54,182
Oh, my God. Brooklyn!

1020
01:15:56,122 --> 01:15:57,185
No.

1021
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:02,983
Ohh.

1022
01:16:03,004 --> 01:16:04,734
- Isaac! Wait!
- Brooklyn.

1023
01:16:04,755 --> 01:16:08,239
- Be right back.
- Talk to me. Brooklyn.

1024
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:15,246
¶ Swing low, sweet chariot ¶

1025
01:16:15,267 --> 01:16:20,040
¶ Coming for to carry me home ¶

1026
01:16:20,061 --> 01:16:26,192
¶ Swing low, sweet chariot ¶

1027
01:16:26,213 --> 01:16:28,593
¶ Swing low, sweet chariot ¶

1028
01:16:28,614 --> 01:16:33,012
¶ Coming for to carry me... ¶

1029
01:16:33,033 --> 01:16:34,932
Home.

1030
01:16:38,122 --> 01:16:43,648
Isaac!

1031
01:17:29,757 --> 01:17:33,449
What is that?

1032
01:17:41,601 --> 01:17:43,667
What's your name?

1033
01:17:45,189 --> 01:17:46,710
Uh...

1034
01:17:48,901 --> 01:17:52,217
Courtney, what are
you doing here?

1035
01:17:52,238 --> 01:17:53,885
You see the boy?

1036
01:18:00,204 --> 01:18:01,977
Where'd he go?

1037
01:18:08,470 --> 01:18:09,802
Isaac!

1038
01:18:17,603 --> 01:18:18,803
Isaac!

1039
01:18:41,245 --> 01:18:45,396
"McKnight, Amanda".

1040
01:18:47,419 --> 01:18:49,065
"Sara".

1041
01:18:54,008 --> 01:18:56,531
"Brooklyn".

1042
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:01,577
"Lipski".
No.

1043
01:19:17,071 --> 01:19:19,763
No. No.

1044
01:19:19,784 --> 01:19:20,972
No.

1045
01:19:24,079 --> 01:19:27,020
This... this isn't happening.

1046
01:19:28,125 --> 01:19:30,689
Courtney.

1047
01:19:30,710 --> 01:19:32,734
What's going on here?

1048
01:19:49,438 --> 01:19:50,418
You killed them.

1049
01:19:53,108 --> 01:19:55,673
And you buried 'em out here.

1050
01:19:57,070 --> 01:20:00,346
No? Then who did?

1051
01:20:08,332 --> 01:20:12,066
No, that's not...
That's not possible.

1052
01:20:12,087 --> 01:20:13,650
Huh.

1053
01:20:13,671 --> 01:20:16,528
It's what was meant to be.

1054
01:20:18,216 --> 01:20:20,532
It's happening again.

1055
01:20:20,553 --> 01:20:24,244
It took a century
for you to come back home.

1056
01:20:24,265 --> 01:20:25,912
What are you...
what are you talking about?

1057
01:20:29,228 --> 01:20:32,837
She has blood on her hands.

1058
01:20:32,858 --> 01:20:35,255
I don't understand
what you mean. What...

1059
01:20:35,277 --> 01:20:36,964
I don't get...
I don't understand this.

1060
01:20:36,985 --> 01:20:39,593
Stop filling him with your lies.

1061
01:20:42,701 --> 01:20:46,474
What's happening now
is bigger than all of us.

1062
01:20:48,331 --> 01:20:51,313
There's a grave
with my brother's name on it.

1063
01:20:51,334 --> 01:20:54,607
Jack, why is there
an empty grave?

1064
01:20:54,628 --> 01:20:57,735
The cycle must be complete.

1065
01:20:58,841 --> 01:21:00,072
Cycle?

1066
01:21:00,093 --> 01:21:01,740
The cycle of death!

1067
01:21:06,265 --> 01:21:10,331
Call it fate, karma,

1068
01:21:10,352 --> 01:21:12,543
the cycle of carnage.

1069
01:21:21,323 --> 01:21:23,136
What does this... what does this
have to do with me?

1070
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:28,267
Destiny.

1071
01:21:29,913 --> 01:21:33,812
You must complete the cycle.

1072
01:21:33,833 --> 01:21:36,190
Sara.

1073
01:21:38,923 --> 01:21:41,279
Sara!

1074
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:42,779
Why are you calling me that?

1075
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,575
- Sara?
- No, stop it.

1076
01:21:45,596 --> 01:21:46,951
- Sara?
- Stop it!

1077
01:21:46,972 --> 01:21:49,329
Your destiny awaits you, Sara!

1078
01:21:49,350 --> 01:21:52,832
Why are you calling me that?
I... I don't understand!

1079
01:21:52,853 --> 01:21:55,834
In your last incarnation,

1080
01:21:55,855 --> 01:21:58,880
you were murdered by Sean,

1081
01:21:58,901 --> 01:22:01,798
your adopted brother.

1082
01:22:01,819 --> 01:22:06,346
You give me one good reason
why I don't bury you out here.

1083
01:22:08,035 --> 01:22:11,308
We're all family here,
my dear boy.

1084
01:22:11,329 --> 01:22:13,354
You're Sean, Jack.

1085
01:22:14,666 --> 01:22:16,146
You're the killer.

1086
01:22:18,713 --> 01:22:22,445
I was a servant in those times.

1087
01:22:22,466 --> 01:22:27,992
It was up to me to see
that destiny was fulfilled.

1088
01:22:28,013 --> 01:22:32,580
And now I'm here once again
to seal your fate.

1089
01:22:33,978 --> 01:22:36,708
Your souls belong to me.

1090
01:22:36,729 --> 01:22:38,543
I don't buy it.

1091
01:22:38,564 --> 01:22:41,255
You don't have to.

1092
01:22:41,276 --> 01:22:44,509
The past is set.

1093
01:22:44,530 --> 01:22:47,388
The past doesn't change.

1094
01:22:47,409 --> 01:22:50,808
The past only repeats itself.

1095
01:22:50,829 --> 01:22:54,144
You killed
McCormick and Lipski, and...

1096
01:22:54,165 --> 01:22:55,311
Shh.

1097
01:22:56,916 --> 01:22:59,607
Look at me. Hmm.

1098
01:23:01,088 --> 01:23:03,404
It's not in my nature.

1099
01:23:03,425 --> 01:23:05,029
You're a liar!

1100
01:23:05,050 --> 01:23:07,240
The truth is in you.

1101
01:23:07,261 --> 01:23:10,575
You're the killer,
you sick son of a bitch.

1102
01:23:10,596 --> 01:23:13,538
It's her birthright.

1103
01:23:13,559 --> 01:23:16,457
It's not for me to claim.

1104
01:23:16,478 --> 01:23:19,042
What's up to me...

1105
01:23:19,063 --> 01:23:22,380
is to reveal your fate.

1106
01:24:01,939 --> 01:24:03,880
Courtney, what are you
doing here?

1107
01:24:03,901 --> 01:24:05,882
You see the boy?

1108
01:24:07,197 --> 01:24:09,052
Where'd he go?

1109
01:24:10,407 --> 01:24:12,221
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1110
01:24:12,242 --> 01:24:13,556
Where'd you get this?

1111
01:24:13,577 --> 01:24:14,807
Put the knife down, Courtney.

1112
01:24:14,828 --> 01:24:16,601
Courtney, I don't want
to hurt you.

1113
01:24:16,622 --> 01:24:18,644
You put the knife down, okay?

1114
01:24:20,584 --> 01:24:23,357
You're gonna give me the knife.

1115
01:24:23,378 --> 01:24:26,693
Please. Okay?

1116
01:24:26,715 --> 01:24:28,072
Okay.

1117
01:24:30,345 --> 01:24:31,908
Aah!

1118
01:24:39,102 --> 01:24:42,294
Aah!

1119
01:24:44,524 --> 01:24:48,882
She was and still is

1120
01:24:48,903 --> 01:24:51,094
the killer amongst us.

1121
01:24:55,953 --> 01:24:58,726
I'm sorry, Adam. I'm so sorry.

1122
01:24:58,747 --> 01:25:01,897
The cycle ends with your death.

1123
01:25:01,918 --> 01:25:03,565
No.

1124
01:25:03,586 --> 01:25:05,067
My parents, my past...

1125
01:25:05,088 --> 01:25:06,733
I'm cursed. I've known it.

1126
01:25:06,754 --> 01:25:08,737
You can't escape it.

1127
01:25:11,468 --> 01:25:13,116
Who the hell are you?

1128
01:25:14,931 --> 01:25:17,203
Well, I've been called
by many names

1129
01:25:17,224 --> 01:25:19,498
throughout the centuries.

1130
01:25:19,519 --> 01:25:22,834
I prefer to be called...

1131
01:25:22,855 --> 01:25:25,462
the agent of destiny.

1132
01:25:27,109 --> 01:25:29,716
I have to end it...

1133
01:25:29,737 --> 01:25:30,842
now.

1134
01:25:31,989 --> 01:25:34,471
No. No, Courtney, Courtney...

1135
01:25:34,492 --> 01:25:35,720
drop the knife.

1136
01:25:35,741 --> 01:25:37,890
Stay away!

1137
01:25:37,911 --> 01:25:39,642
Get back!

1138
01:25:39,663 --> 01:25:42,978
Wake up, baby. Baby, wake up.

1139
01:25:42,999 --> 01:25:44,231
- Kill him!
- Don't listen to him.

1140
01:25:44,252 --> 01:25:45,399
You look at me.

1141
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:46,732
Look me in the eyes.

1142
01:25:46,753 --> 01:25:50,069
You know me.

1143
01:25:52,342 --> 01:25:55,199
Courtney, trust me.

1144
01:25:55,220 --> 01:25:58,703
Please, just... just...

1145
01:25:58,724 --> 01:26:01,038
listen to me.

1146
01:26:05,814 --> 01:26:07,129
No.

1147
01:26:11,570 --> 01:26:13,550
Oh, Jesus!

1148
01:26:13,571 --> 01:26:15,177
Ohh!

1149
01:26:15,198 --> 01:26:17,181
Courtney, hang on, baby.

1150
01:26:17,202 --> 01:26:18,890
Come on. Stay with me.

1151
01:26:18,911 --> 01:26:21,684
- Adam, I...
- I'm here.

1152
01:26:21,705 --> 01:26:24,771
I wanted to tell you that...

1153
01:26:24,792 --> 01:26:30,568
that I've felt alone
my whole life...

1154
01:26:30,589 --> 01:26:34,530
except the time
I spent with you.

1155
01:26:34,551 --> 01:26:36,657
Oh, baby.

1156
01:26:39,599 --> 01:26:42,997
No. No, no. I'm so sorry, baby.
I'm so sorry.

1157
01:26:53,321 --> 01:26:54,884
You're free now.

1158
01:26:59,953 --> 01:27:01,557
Huh.

1159
01:27:34,193 --> 01:27:35,801
Courtney?

1160
01:27:35,822 --> 01:27:37,928
Baby, hang on.

1161
01:27:37,949 --> 01:27:39,552
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1162
01:27:39,573 --> 01:27:41,974
Come on. Yes.

1163
01:28:08,479 --> 01:28:11,961
Hey, baby. How's it coming?

1164
01:28:11,982 --> 01:28:14,379
- Perfectly.
- Mmm, good.

1165
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:16,299
I am starving.

1166
01:28:18,113 --> 01:28:19,759
Everything okay?

1167
01:28:22,034 --> 01:28:24,640
Sweetheart?

1168
01:28:24,661 --> 01:28:26,435
Hmm?

1169
01:28:26,456 --> 01:28:29,228
Let's celebrate our happiness.

1170
01:28:35,882 --> 01:28:37,485
I love you.

1171
01:28:37,506 --> 01:28:39,488
I love you more.

1172
01:28:40,968 --> 01:28:42,574
Heh.
