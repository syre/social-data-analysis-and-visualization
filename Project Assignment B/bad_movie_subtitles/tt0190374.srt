1
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:39,747
The empire of Izmer
has long been a divided land.

2
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:44,501
Ruled by the Mages,
an elite group of magic users.

3
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:51,633
The lowly commoners, those without
magic, are little more than slaves.

4
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:56,263
Izmer's young empress, Savina,
wishes quality and prosperity for all.

5
00:00:56,348 --> 00:01:00,392
But, the evil Mage, Profion,
has other intentions.

6
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:31,066
We're are not.

7
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,601
Yes!

8
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:11,148
At last.

9
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,527
Come Damodar.

10
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,997
Release him.

11
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,370
You are mine now.

12
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,708
Come to me.

13
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:24,722
Yes. I told you it could be done.

14
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:28,517
You have the power of the immortals.

15
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:33,272
You can control dragons.
- With the dragon army at my command,

16
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:38,235
I can crush the Empress and control
what is rightfully mine!

17
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:43,782
You don't like it, do you? Good.
I can use every ounce

18
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:48,162
of your rage. Come on. Follow me.

19
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,417
Follow me!

20
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,504
I said follow me!

21
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:30,829
What now, my lord, Profion?
- We shall have to modify our plans.

22
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:34,541
Summon the high council of Mages
immediately.

23
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:40,506
They are about to learn something
Of our young Empress,

24
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:45,052
that may give them pause for thought.
- It will be done.

25
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:01,193
I'm telling you this' gotta be some
twisted magic experiment gone wrong.

26
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:05,155
Why is it every time something bad
happens, you gotta blame the Mages.

27
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,326
Well, when was the last time you saw
a river catch on fire? You think they

28
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:13,497
care if anyone got hurt? I'd just
love to find a way to give those

29
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:17,459
Mages some payback.
- Oh yeah. Ridley the Savior.

30
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:24,299
That'll be the day. Look, Ridley.
Things are the way they are and

31
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:28,470
there's nothing you can do to change
it. Ok? You got your haves and your

32
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:31,640
I'm telling you this' gotta be some
twisted magic experiment gone wrong.

33
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,769
Right about now we gotta get paid.

34
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:40,357
The magic school.
- The what? The magic school?

35
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,695
Are you crazy?
- We'll break into. There's anything.

36
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:48,157
'Cause the fire, it won't be guarded.
- No.

37
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:53,787
Think of the challenge Snails.
Think of what we could find in there.

38
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:59,084
If we pull this off, we'd be the envy
of every thief in Sumdall.

39
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,086
Trust me.

40
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:10,929
And why would the Empress try to
disband this counsel? It's a concept

41
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:14,850
I find difficult to believe.
- Now Azmath, your loyalty

42
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:19,021
is commendable. But we've all watched
the Empress' growing up. We have all

43
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:23,942
heard her views on what she considers
to be the injustices of this land.

44
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:27,946
But she is just a young woman.
Young people speak from the heart.

45
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:31,992
Not he mind. In time, with our
counsel, she will come to understand

46
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:36,789
why things cannot be changed.
- Maybe so. But, is that a risk you are

47
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:41,502
willing to take? Her revolutionary
ideas have already taken root among

48
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:46,173
the people.
In time her influence will grow.

49
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:50,928
As the months go by, she will learn to
master the powers of her scepter.

50
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:55,099
And when she does, I have no doubt
that she will use it to enforce

51
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:59,770
her changes upon us.
- Then, what do you propose, Profion?

52
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:05,484
I humbly ask that we vote
to remove the scepter

53
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:08,821
from the Empress' control.

54
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:13,659
So that government in Izmer
Will remain secure.

55
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:17,079
Remove the scepter, which looms above
our heads and destroy

56
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,249
the threat of revolution forever!

57
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,587
And if she does not agree?
- Then...

58
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:30,592
then her true intentions
will become clear.

59
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:36,724
And the we will be forced to do
whatever we must to protect

60
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:40,352
the strength and the unity of Izmer.

61
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:45,024
What say you?

62
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:04,043
How could he get the council persuade?
- He plays on the fears of the others.

63
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:09,256
Their fears of change.
- Yes, I know, Vildan. But, the changes

64
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:13,427
I propose are for the good of the
people. All people deserve

65
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:17,306
to be free and equal,
whether commoner or mage.

66
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:22,436
I know this within the depths
of my soul. And if necessary,

67
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:26,565
I would die to make that the way
Izmer is run.

68
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:31,445
What can I do to stop Profion?
- You must outsmart him.

69
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:36,367
Over the past years, I have been
searching for an ancient

70
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:40,371
artifact called the Rod of Savrille.
It holds the same powers

71
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:43,540
as your scepter. With one difference.

72
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:48,754
It controls Red Dragons.
If you could obtain it,

73
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:54,343
you could relinquish your scepter and
still have protection against Profion.

74
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:58,514
I must have that Rod of Savrille!
With one wave of it

75
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:03,310
I will topple her and bring down
That useless council of idiots

76
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:07,523
with her.
- What is your wish, My Lord?

77
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,657
Pay a visit to the Magic School.
And see our friend Vildan.

78
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:20,744
Persuade him to give you the scroll
of which he speaks.

79
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,914
And bring it here to me.

80
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:30,587
And Damodar? Make sure that he's
No longer around to give

81
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:33,799
our young Empress anymore good advice.

82
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,556
Come my friend.

83
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:50,190
Ridley, why's it gotta be so high?
- Snails, let go of me.

84
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:55,946
Can't we just rob the first floor next
time? Why don't we just rob God?

85
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:59,074
Come on.
- You said this was going to be easy?

86
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:03,162
No. I said it wasn't impossible.
- That's the same thing you said when

87
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:07,333
we robbed that house. Who'd he catch?
Who'd he beat from the waist down? Me.

88
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,960
Are you gonna jump?
- Gonna catch me?

89
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:12,046
Yeah!
- Promise?

90
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,673
I promise. Now jump.
- All right.

91
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:21,805
Sorry. I thought I heard something.

92
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,225
You did. Me hitting the ground.

93
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:32,524
That is a big dragon.

94
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:37,821
Now we're talking.

95
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:41,742
All right. Let's get to work.

96
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:53,462
I already told you, Marina.
The Empress can't use her scepter for

97
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:57,633
dragon control or Profion will paint
her as a tyrant to the council.

98
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:01,679
Profion must be made to expose himself
to them. Dammit, I know it's here.

99
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:04,848
Where is it?
- It should be right here.

100
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:09,061
You're sure you put it in its place?
- I'm sure.

101
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:14,066
Sure, are you? Why is it filed here
among these volumes on alchemy?

102
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:18,237
It belongs in dracology. Now then,
where is it? I know I've got it

103
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:21,573
somewhere. Ah yes. This was it.

104
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:26,995
Mariana. You must stop doodling. The
Empress only has 3 days the council

105
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,874
forces her to relinquish her scepter.
- I'm sorry.

106
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,045
But you must be more serious.
- I know. But, I feel I should be doing

107
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:39,216
more than shelving books.
- I understand, Marina. But, you must

108
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,137
learn to be patient to maintain focus.
That is the best help you can

109
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:46,682
provide right now.
- I suppose you're right.

110
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:59,862
I never saw a scroll so hard
to decode. Itâ€™s protected by very

111
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:04,158
ancient magic. Marina,
fetch me some Manticore wing.

112
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,420
What's that?
- Dragon tooth.

113
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:20,591
Put it back. Put it back.
- Ok. What about a gold dragon tooth?

114
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,801
Itâ€™s too big. Put it back.

115
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:37,649
Hey, Snails. Snails.

116
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:42,404
Here.
- What'd you do that for?

117
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:47,743
Pick it up. Come on.
- Ain't got enough of these at home?

118
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,412
Look at this.

119
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,125
We're gonna be rich.

120
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:59,463
Ridley? You know how much we could
get for one of these?

121
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,633
Snails! Don't touch that!

122
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,931
One of the lab creatures must have not
loose again. Go and check on it.

123
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,058
All right.

124
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,897
Snails, relax.

125
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:22,027
Itâ€™s an illusion.
- Ok. I knew that.

126
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:27,449
Now, don't touch anything else.
- All right.

127
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:34,081
What are you doing?
- The cleaning crew.

128
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:42,339
Dirty.
- Cleanup crew is more like it.

129
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,718
You're thieves trying to rob us.

130
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:57,062
She must have put some kind of holding
spell on us with that bracelet!

131
00:14:57,147 --> 00:15:01,233
Itâ€™s the only way she can get guys.
- Iâ€™d have to put a feeble-minded spell

132
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:05,529
on myself to want to take you home.
- That was funny.

133
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,824
You're going to the city dungeons.
- That wasn't.

134
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,703
Thank you when they cut my head off.
- You should.

135
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:15,873
It'd be an improvement.

136
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:20,044
There's that superior intelligence
you mages are so famous for.

137
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:25,007
Speaking of intelligence. What kind of
genius would break into magic school?

138
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:28,802
He'd have to be really stupid. Or...
- Or what?

139
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:32,097
Well... Lester!

140
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:39,688
If you don't tell me which scroll
it is...

141
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:43,567
I'll have to kill you painfully.
- Never!

142
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,546
The Chief of the Crimson Brigade!

143
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:08,509
To the street of Sumdall!

144
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,803
Follow them, you fools!

145
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:21,438
Where are we going? Hey! Nice trick.
- Hey, no! The other way!

146
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:23,565
Watch out!

147
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:36,245
Lady, please stop to listen.
Escapes are our bread and butter.

148
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:48,424
...oughta-

149
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:01,770
Nice lid.
- You shouldn't have done that.

150
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,273
Shut that door!

151
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:23,667
Stop him!
- In that fifth? That's disgusting!

152
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:36,889
Post brigades
at every sewer entrance and exit.

153
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,518
I want them found.

154
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:44,855
Now.

155
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:51,195
Marina of Pretensa, student mage...

156
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:55,908
I don't believe that.
- Better believe it.

157
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:01,372
They hang on it to us.
- No, on you, thieves.

158
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:05,876
Me not. As aristocrate, mage...
- An insignificant mage, totally

159
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,255
dispensable, practical worthless.
- That's ridiculous!

160
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:14,760
I clear it up. I can't clear it up.
To whom I should explain?

161
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:18,806
Right! They put you into prison and
torture you, until you confess.

162
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:23,143
Let us hold together, you heard it,
we're companions.

163
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,398
Ok! Come on!

164
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:49,545
You allow a slip of a girl to escape

165
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,342
you with the scroll. And now, Norda,

166
00:18:56,678 --> 00:19:00,139
the Empress' finest tracker,
is in pursuit.

167
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:04,977
And you tell me not to concern myself?

168
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:10,357
It was a mistake.
It will not happen again.

169
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:15,821
Now there, you are right.

170
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,949
And here's why.

171
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:03,660
Just a friend I'm sending along
For the ride.

172
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:07,581
A gentle reminder
not to make any more mistakes.

173
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:13,420
The moment you deliver me the rod,
I'll ensure that he...

174
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:15,964
It vacate the premises.

175
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:23,597
Now. May I suggest that once you two
have become fully acquainted,

176
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:27,267
you follow the Empress' tracker,
Norda. She happens to be good

177
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:31,522
at her job. She will lead you
to our missing friends

178
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:38,987
and the scroll.
- And this time, Damodar,

179
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:42,366
don't fail me.

180
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:24,783
So, if we find the rod,
the Empress heaps us with gold. Huh?

181
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:30,998
Why don't you try and rise above
being a dwarf? This isn't about gold.

182
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:34,168
Itâ€™s about saving our empire.
- Empire?

183
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:39,465
Who cares about the empire? You mages
are the only ones who benefit from it.

184
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:43,635
Oh really? That's an interesting
sentiment from a guy who steals

185
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,307
things for a living.
- Have you ever heard of honor amongst

186
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:52,436
thieves? We might live outside the
law, but we respect each other.

187
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:57,733
Unlike a bunch of back-stabbing mages.
- That is just the sort of

188
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:03,614
half-baked illiterate drivel that
proves commoners really are common.

189
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:08,660
That's it. We'll go into hiding for
a while. She'll find the rod herself.

190
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:10,788
Fine.

191
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:20,172
I thought you were leaving.
- You mind if we eat first?

192
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:23,342
No. Be my guest.

193
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:34,395
You know, those red marks there look
like the locks my father used to put

194
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:38,941
on plans for his carriages.
- This is an ancient scroll,

195
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:43,237
not a blueprint for a buggy.
- You don't know what you're doing, so

196
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:47,700
you might as well let me have a look.
- Give that back!

197
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:52,454
Let's see. He used to put his fingers
like this. And he would say something

198
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:56,166
like Alinor sala. What was that word?
- Bidet.

199
00:22:56,501 --> 00:23:00,212
Bidet? Bedarra! Bedarra.
Alinor salla bedarra!

200
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:11,598
You can't blame me for trying.
At least l...

201
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:21,775
See that there?
I knew that boy had talent.

202
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:25,738
Alinor salla bedarra.

203
00:23:52,057 --> 00:23:54,850
Do not let them escape or you will

204
00:23:56,102 --> 00:24:00,272
suffer a fate far worse
than that inflicted upon me.

205
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:08,113
I lie on the floor. On the back.
Hands and feet bound like a pig.

206
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:12,326
This Orc appears to stab me
with a stick. Huh!

207
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:17,289
Hopeless situation. I said to myself:
Do I have anything to lose?

208
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:21,502
So, I take my spear
and throw him towards my enemy.

209
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:30,636
Really lovely.

210
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:38,769
An elf? You are kidding?
You know, the hook on an elf is,

211
00:24:38,895 --> 00:24:41,522
they are too skinny.
No, my dear,

212
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:47,194
a fifty pound dwarf, that will do.
With hair on her chin

213
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:50,948
that you can hang on to.
- No, thanks.

214
00:25:07,757 --> 00:25:10,342
Excuse me, little man.

215
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:16,849
Hi. Are you looking for somebody
in particular?

216
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:20,477
Or, are you just looking
for somebody?

217
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:26,984
Actually, I'm looking for someone
just like you.

218
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:34,158
What a coincidence. 'Cause I was
looking for someone just like you.

219
00:25:34,242 --> 00:25:36,702
We gotta celebrate. Bartender?

220
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:40,789
Give me a bottle of your best wine.

221
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:44,752
Make that your cheapest.

222
00:26:13,865 --> 00:26:15,908
Wait.

223
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:20,496
I need the girl.

224
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:37,721
Bring me that girl!
- No time for a romance.

225
00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:40,974
What?
- Come on!

226
00:26:43,228 --> 00:26:47,272
Wait! I'm falling in love.
- With an elf? They almost think,

227
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:50,442
humans are a kind of funny stuff!

228
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:03,247
Ok. Let's get Ridley out of here.

229
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:11,255
That wraith must have been defective.
- He seemed pretty reliable to me.

230
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:13,382
Ridley?

231
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:20,139
Itâ€™s Damodar, man. He's onto us.
- Yeah, with what we walked into,

232
00:27:20,223 --> 00:27:23,559
everyone's going to be onto us.
- What do you mean, everybody?

233
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:27,312
Tell him what you got us into.
- Me? But you...

234
00:27:27,939 --> 00:27:30,941
Yeah. Tell me what you got us into.

235
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:35,821
According to the wraith inside the
scroll, the rod we're looking for

236
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:39,033
caused the Great War.
- Oh. Is that all?

237
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:44,455
Have you lost your damn mind? Huh?

238
00:27:44,748 --> 00:27:49,043
What does this rod do?
- Maybe to control Red Dragons.

239
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:55,507
This sounds like a bad idea to me.
- It gets better. This map leads to a

240
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:59,928
Dragon Temple. In order to get in,
we need the Eye of the Dragon from the

241
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:03,682
Guildmaster of the Thieves Guild
in Antius City.

242
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:07,770
Zilus? Get! No way!
- I know she's crazy, but she keeps

243
00:28:07,854 --> 00:28:11,732
going on about Profion and the Empress.
- Profion?

244
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:16,278
They can take care of themselves.
I suggest we lay low, let the whole

245
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:20,908
thing blow over, come back, rob
everybody. That's our plan. Let's go.

246
00:28:20,992 --> 00:28:23,535
There's one more small problem.

247
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:30,793
Problem? What's the problem, Ridley?

248
00:28:33,296 --> 00:28:36,090
I kind of committed us to find it.

249
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:40,219
Ridley?
How could you do something like that?

250
00:28:49,354 --> 00:28:52,398
I can't believe this. I can't...

251
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:58,946
This is our big chance, huh?
Let's rob the magic school.

252
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:04,118
That's what you said to me, right?
This is dumb! Dumb! Dumb! Dumb! Dumb!

253
00:29:04,202 --> 00:29:06,245
You know what?

254
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:11,166
I got a new name for dumb! Ridley!
This is the Ridleyest thing...

255
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:14,962
Snails? I'll understand if you
don't wanna go.

256
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:21,635
What do you mean I can't go?
Really, Ridley?

257
00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:27,057
All I'm saying is that, don't you
think that's just a little bit out of

258
00:29:27,142 --> 00:29:30,894
our league? Just a little bit?
- Snails, listen.

259
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:36,316
This Dragon-Eye we're supposed to get?
Itâ€™s a ruby the size of your fist.

260
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:38,444
I don't.

261
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:42,948
A ruby the size of my fist?
- Yeah. So we'll use her to help us

262
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:46,994
get it. And we'll take off.
We'll make a fortune.

263
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:50,497
Trust me.

264
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:54,877
I hate when you say that!

265
00:30:01,426 --> 00:30:06,722
Oh Ridley, I'm going to regret this.
- Ha! I knew you'd come through for me!

266
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:09,933
Don't touch me. Ok, just a little bit.

267
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:13,437
We're in. How about you?

268
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:22,946
I don't see what choice I have.
Just tell me one thing!

269
00:30:23,031 --> 00:30:25,866
If I help, who is going to pay me?

270
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:33,165
We'll worry about that later.

271
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:42,216
That's a terrible way to do business.

272
00:31:36,354 --> 00:31:38,355
Ridley? Check it out.

273
00:31:40,442 --> 00:31:42,526
Let's go.

274
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,703
Snails.

275
00:31:54,956 --> 00:31:56,999
Ok.

276
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:09,219
Listen. We're looking for esteemed
Guildmaster Zilus. We thought

277
00:32:09,304 --> 00:32:13,390
perhaps you'd know him.
- The only thing I know is, you oughta

278
00:32:13,475 --> 00:32:17,519
take your business out of town before
you end up with the words

279
00:32:17,604 --> 00:32:22,107
"Outsiders Not Appreciated" branded
right where your nose used to be.

280
00:32:22,233 --> 00:32:24,276
Get it?

281
00:32:28,698 --> 00:32:30,741
Thanks for your time!

282
00:32:31,701 --> 00:32:36,080
If I ain't drinking,
you sure ain't shopping. Come on!

283
00:32:39,334 --> 00:32:43,212
There you are! Where have you been?
- Don't look at us.

284
00:32:43,296 --> 00:32:48,050
Who's been shopping? Is that
three-eyed hyper bastard watching us?

285
00:32:52,097 --> 00:32:56,392
All right. If we follow him, he'll
probably lead us right into the guild.

286
00:32:56,476 --> 00:32:58,477
There he goes.

287
00:33:23,169 --> 00:33:25,212
Come on!

288
00:33:42,939 --> 00:33:46,233
Elwood, we'll go in.
You keep a look out.

289
00:33:55,493 --> 00:33:57,536
Nice.

290
00:34:00,165 --> 00:34:03,459
Isn't that Tony?
- The guy that kidnapped.

291
00:34:11,009 --> 00:34:15,471
All right. Let's go find Zilus.
- That won't be necessary. Like I said,

292
00:34:15,555 --> 00:34:19,558
outsiders not appreciated.
- You're talking to us? We're confused.

293
00:34:19,642 --> 00:34:24,480
Your third eye was looking
at somebody completely different.

294
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:30,819
Take him away!

295
00:34:33,656 --> 00:34:38,494
Where do you think they took Snails?
- He'll be fine. Just let me talk.

296
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:42,748
So, this is it, huh?
Everything a thief strives for?

297
00:34:42,874 --> 00:34:44,833
Yeah.

298
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:48,712
You must be Zilus. Ridley Freeborn.
Practitioner of the larcenist crafts.

299
00:34:48,797 --> 00:34:53,175
Member in good standing with the
Sumdall guild. Itâ€™s a pleasure

300
00:34:53,176 --> 00:34:56,553
to meet you.
- A fellow thief.

301
00:34:57,305 --> 00:35:00,307
Well, the pleasure is all mine.
- See?

302
00:35:01,226 --> 00:35:06,063
Sumdall, eh? How is old Sumdall?
That's a pretty tough town, isn't it?

303
00:35:06,147 --> 00:35:08,357
All those mages.
- We get by.

304
00:35:10,985 --> 00:35:15,072
Yes, I guess you must be very
accomplished to have such a precious

305
00:35:15,156 --> 00:35:17,366
morsel travelling with you.

306
00:35:18,993 --> 00:35:23,539
So what might I do for you?
- The unity of our kingdom...

307
00:35:24,374 --> 00:35:29,503
We understand you have the Dragon-Eye.
- We desperately need it.

308
00:35:30,422 --> 00:35:34,466
Yes well, I'm always happy
to help a fellow thief.

309
00:35:34,759 --> 00:35:38,387
Have you ever heard of
the Antius Guild Maze?

310
00:35:39,889 --> 00:35:43,684
Of course. Every thief heard of it.
- Wonderful.

311
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:47,938
You'll know that the Eye of the Dragon
is the prize at the center of my

312
00:35:48,023 --> 00:35:53,068
guild maze, won't you? You finish
the maze, you win the prize.

313
00:35:54,112 --> 00:35:57,656
Has anyone ever finished it before?
- Uh, no.

314
00:35:58,366 --> 00:36:00,409
They all died trying.

315
00:36:01,494 --> 00:36:06,623
But look on the bright side.
At least the prize is still there.

316
00:36:08,543 --> 00:36:11,295
Good health. And jolly good luck.

317
00:36:39,783 --> 00:36:42,785
This is a good one, Ridley.

318
00:37:45,348 --> 00:37:47,641
40 seconds.
- 1 minute.

319
00:37:48,018 --> 00:37:51,770
They bet on whether or not he lives?
- Au contraire, precious morsel.

320
00:37:51,855 --> 00:37:55,315
They're betting on
how long before he dies.

321
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,632
Be careful, Ridley!

322
00:38:39,944 --> 00:38:41,987
Oh my.

323
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:50,537
Very clever. But is it clever enough?
The game ain't over yet.

324
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,123
Uh!

325
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,931
Very light on his feet, isn't he?

326
00:40:39,564 --> 00:40:42,649
What kind of vault is that?

327
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:13,889
I think she wants to visit her friend.

328
00:41:50,427 --> 00:41:52,469
Nice.

329
00:41:57,017 --> 00:42:00,102
Yes, yes, yes! Very clever. Well done.

330
00:42:01,229 --> 00:42:04,273
You were absolutely amazing.
- Thank you.

331
00:42:04,357 --> 00:42:08,402
No, no. Thank you. You know, Iâ€™ve
waited 1 5 years for somebody to come

332
00:42:08,486 --> 00:42:12,573
along and pick that lock. I knew that
the man that could get through that

333
00:42:12,657 --> 00:42:16,744
maze alive would be able to get into
that vault. And now, here he is.

334
00:42:16,828 --> 00:42:22,041
Then man. You. So, why don't you give
me what's rightfully mine?

335
00:42:24,669 --> 00:42:27,421
What about honor amongst thieves?

336
00:42:29,049 --> 00:42:33,093
Oh, what a romantic notion.
Do you honestly believe I could have

337
00:42:33,178 --> 00:42:37,264
amassed the wealth I have if I worried
about honor? Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

338
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:40,476
So, pretty boy. If you don't want Hugo

339
00:42:41,644 --> 00:42:45,230
here to come rearrange
your features for you,

340
00:42:45,482 --> 00:42:47,941
I suggest you just give it up.

341
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:57,284
Who the hell is he?
Who the hell are you?

342
00:43:07,295 --> 00:43:12,049
Listen. I don't know who you are,
but be prepared for a lesson in pain.

343
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:18,597
You must be joking.
- I never joke...

344
00:43:19,808 --> 00:43:22,476
when mages trespass in my guild!

345
00:43:29,693 --> 00:43:32,069
This is the map you're after.

346
00:43:33,113 --> 00:43:35,864
Clear a path and I'll put it out.

347
00:43:41,246 --> 00:43:43,288
Do it.

348
00:45:10,627 --> 00:45:12,670
Ridley!

349
00:45:13,338 --> 00:45:15,381
Marina!

350
00:45:19,469 --> 00:45:21,845
You ok?
- We gotta save Marina.

351
00:45:23,264 --> 00:45:27,935
Wait! What about the dwarf?
- You get the dwarf, I'll get the girl.

352
00:45:28,019 --> 00:45:32,022
Wait! How come I always gotta get
the dwarf? Damn!

353
00:45:45,704 --> 00:45:49,081
Marina!
- Ridley. We have the Dragon's Eye.

354
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:54,920
Let's just sell it in Sumdall.
- We're not leaving without Marina.

355
00:45:55,005 --> 00:45:59,216
You're gonna risk all for a mage?
- Listen, Snails...

356
00:46:00,218 --> 00:46:02,261
What?

357
00:46:03,346 --> 00:46:06,098
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

358
00:46:18,403 --> 00:46:21,071
Hey. Itâ€™s you. Hi.
- You know her?

359
00:46:22,949 --> 00:46:26,535
We're acquainted.
- That elf you were drooling over?

360
00:46:26,619 --> 00:46:30,330
Well, I wouldn't put it that way.
But, yeah. That's her. Pretty, huh?

361
00:46:30,415 --> 00:46:33,334
They all look alike to me.
- Silence!

362
00:46:34,878 --> 00:46:38,172
Where's the girl?
- None of your business.

363
00:46:38,506 --> 00:46:41,884
Human.
It is my business to arrest you and

364
00:46:42,469 --> 00:46:46,555
Marina of Pretensa. And to take you
and the scroll you stole back

365
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:49,725
to the Empress of Izmer.

366
00:46:51,603 --> 00:46:55,522
Oh. You're the law, are you?
I should have known.

367
00:46:56,024 --> 00:47:00,110
One of your fellow lawmen, the Chief
of the Crimson brigade beat you to the

368
00:47:00,195 --> 00:47:03,906
punch. He just took off with Marina.
- Damodar.

369
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,785
Yeah, that's him.
- Only he's not working for the law

370
00:47:07,869 --> 00:47:12,247
anymore. He's working for Profion.
He's the one you want. Not us.

371
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:32,351
Your Majesty.

372
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:38,190
Yes, Norda? Have you found the scroll?
- No, your highness.

373
00:47:38,274 --> 00:47:42,361
It seems Profion

374
00:47:42,445 --> 00:47:45,906
also seeks the rod.
- But how could he know?

375
00:47:46,616 --> 00:47:50,536
I do not know, my lady. Damodar has
captured Marina of Pretensa

376
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:55,249
and the scroll. But, I have her
companions in my custody.

377
00:47:56,042 --> 00:47:58,961
What is your command?

378
00:48:01,047 --> 00:48:03,882
Seek Damodar out.
We need that rod.

379
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:08,971
The counsel demands my response
imminently.

380
00:48:09,431 --> 00:48:13,058
Norda, please hurry.
Our time is running out.

381
00:48:14,686 --> 00:48:16,687
As you wish.

382
00:48:26,364 --> 00:48:29,658
Gather the horses.
We will track Damodar.

383
00:48:30,952 --> 00:48:35,164
They will travel with us.
Should they try to escape,

384
00:48:35,874 --> 00:48:37,916
kill them.

385
00:49:00,023 --> 00:49:03,484
Tell me.
Why were you at the Thieves Guild?

386
00:49:06,196 --> 00:49:09,656
It isn't exactly a sightseeing spot,
is it?

387
00:49:12,285 --> 00:49:14,745
We needed money. For supplies.

388
00:49:29,636 --> 00:49:32,554
You'll have to do better than that.

389
00:49:36,851 --> 00:49:39,019
I'm curious. You're a mage.

390
00:49:42,232 --> 00:49:45,067
Yet, you're disgracing your family

391
00:49:47,195 --> 00:49:51,615
by consorting with thieves.
- You're a disgrace to Izmer,

392
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:54,201
conspiring against the Empress.

393
00:49:57,872 --> 00:50:01,166
I have no dispute with that.
You know me.

394
00:50:02,127 --> 00:50:06,171
I have served her family loyally
for many a years.

395
00:50:09,134 --> 00:50:12,261
It is Profion's desire
to dethrone her.

396
00:50:14,848 --> 00:50:16,890
Not mine.

397
00:50:18,184 --> 00:50:20,227
Then why do you help him?

398
00:50:27,485 --> 00:50:33,949
Look at me.

399
00:50:37,287 --> 00:50:39,496
If I do not obtain the rod,

400
00:50:40,915 --> 00:50:42,958
I will die.

401
00:50:45,045 --> 00:50:47,087
Please.

402
00:50:47,422 --> 00:50:49,423
Help me.

403
00:50:52,761 --> 00:50:55,512
I'm sorry, but I cannot help you.

404
00:51:04,105 --> 00:51:06,148
Foolish girl.

405
00:51:08,485 --> 00:51:11,236
I can suck any information I want

406
00:51:14,657 --> 00:51:16,700
right out of you.

407
00:51:37,138 --> 00:51:39,264
Your friends have procured

408
00:51:42,102 --> 00:51:45,771
the Eye of the Dragon from the
Thieves' Guild.

409
00:51:48,608 --> 00:51:50,651
A key of some sort.

410
00:52:17,012 --> 00:52:19,013
Can't I just walk?

411
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:24,727
Don't you people know dwarves are
terrified of horses?

412
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:28,272
Get over it.
- A lot of dwarves are afraid

413
00:52:29,107 --> 00:52:32,109
to show their feelings. I'm not, ok?

414
00:52:56,217 --> 00:53:00,095
They've followed the valley.
I know these lands.

415
00:53:00,555 --> 00:53:05,476
There's a shortcut up ahead through
the forest and over those hills.

416
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:09,605
It means leaving the trail,
but if Damodar sets up camp

417
00:53:09,689 --> 00:53:14,401
and we ride all night, we stand a good
chance of cutting him off.

418
00:53:14,486 --> 00:53:17,571
All right. Let's go.

419
00:53:18,782 --> 00:53:21,700
You know, I love the way you track.

420
00:53:22,494 --> 00:53:26,372
You wouldn't happen to be single,
are you? What?

421
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:31,293
No harm in asking, is there? You know,
it just so happens, I'm single.

422
00:53:31,378 --> 00:53:34,380
Can you believe it?
- How old are you?

423
00:53:35,715 --> 00:53:39,718
23. Yeah, I know I'm a little young
for you. What if I get my hands

424
00:53:39,803 --> 00:53:44,264
on aging potion?
I'll sacrifice a couple years for you.

425
00:53:44,432 --> 00:53:46,517
I'm 234.
- Damn.

426
00:53:49,979 --> 00:53:52,981
I didn't mean that much of a change.

427
00:54:18,633 --> 00:54:23,679
Ridley, look. We're hopeless.
- Relax. We'll just sneak around.

428
00:54:31,604 --> 00:54:34,356
Now what?
- We need a diversionary.

429
00:54:54,169 --> 00:54:57,254
All right, Snails. Stay close.

430
00:55:05,096 --> 00:55:07,139
All clear.

431
00:55:15,815 --> 00:55:18,901
Ok. I'll get Marina. You get the map.

432
00:55:19,361 --> 00:55:23,447
Ok. Wait, wait. How do you get a girl
and I get a map?

433
00:55:23,531 --> 00:55:27,326
We gotta work on some new plans.
- Would you go?

434
00:55:31,706 --> 00:55:33,791
Hey, Snails?
- What?

435
00:55:34,709 --> 00:55:36,752
Be careful.

436
00:55:37,379 --> 00:55:40,464
All right. Hey, Ridley.

437
00:55:42,092 --> 00:55:44,134
You too.

438
00:55:55,897 --> 00:55:57,940
Let's go in.

439
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:02,486
We were not meant to enter this place.

440
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:06,448
This task they must complete alone.

441
00:56:27,595 --> 00:56:29,638
I'm Damodar.

442
00:56:58,168 --> 00:57:01,295
A little black magic.

443
00:57:09,346 --> 00:57:12,431
All right, Damodar.

444
00:57:13,558 --> 00:57:15,601
Nice!

445
00:57:19,898 --> 00:57:22,441
Piece of cake.

446
00:57:28,365 --> 00:57:31,033
Oh no! I knew this was too easy!

447
00:57:46,841 --> 00:57:48,884
Need a hand?

448
00:58:44,107 --> 00:58:46,150
Marina?

449
00:58:50,321 --> 00:58:52,364
Hey.

450
00:58:59,497 --> 00:59:01,540
Hey. Itâ€™s ok.

451
00:59:08,173 --> 00:59:11,091
Let's get you out of here. Come on.

452
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:28,650
Just like you thieves.
Always taking things

453
00:59:30,028 --> 00:59:33,655
that don't belong to you.
- That's enough. So!

454
00:59:34,324 --> 00:59:36,367
Now I'm mad.

455
00:59:37,744 --> 00:59:41,622
Oh. You want to play, do you?
- Yeah. Let's play.

456
00:59:44,834 --> 00:59:47,920
Ok, you win. Game over.

457
01:00:11,528 --> 01:00:15,406
So much for getting out of here
without a fight.

458
01:00:24,249 --> 01:00:26,834
Thanks.
- Any time.

459
01:00:52,944 --> 01:00:56,030
Marina! Get him!

460
01:01:00,869 --> 01:01:02,911
Snails!

461
01:01:24,267 --> 01:01:26,310
Let's go.

462
01:01:41,743 --> 01:01:43,786
Oh, no!

463
01:02:03,014 --> 01:02:05,057
Come on.

464
01:02:07,894 --> 01:02:11,980
You cannot be serious.
- Iâ€™ve never been so serious.

465
01:02:13,233 --> 01:02:15,275
Oh please.

466
01:02:40,468 --> 01:02:43,929
If you'll give me the Dragon's Eye,

467
01:02:44,305 --> 01:02:46,598
I might decide to let

468
01:02:48,643 --> 01:02:50,894
you die quickly.
- Go to hell.

469
01:03:21,509 --> 01:03:23,552
Damodar!

470
01:03:31,144 --> 01:03:34,313
Not your usual punctual self.

471
01:03:37,692 --> 01:03:40,778
Where's my Dragon's Eye?

472
01:03:47,535 --> 01:03:49,578
I have it.
- Really?

473
01:03:52,165 --> 01:03:55,250
Show it to me.

474
01:03:57,962 --> 01:04:00,756
Let him go first. And it's yours.

475
01:04:08,598 --> 01:04:10,641
Snails, don't!

476
01:04:11,893 --> 01:04:13,894
No!

477
01:04:41,548 --> 01:04:45,342
Make it easy on yourself.
Give me what is mine.

478
01:04:51,224 --> 01:04:54,601
Never!
- You're as stubborn as your friend.

479
01:04:59,357 --> 01:05:02,276
Very well. You've made your choice.

480
01:05:11,202 --> 01:05:13,245
Come on, Ridley.

481
01:05:17,334 --> 01:05:19,376
Wherever Norda is!

482
01:05:23,506 --> 01:05:25,549
Come on, Ridley. Come on.

483
01:05:55,288 --> 01:05:59,958
The council has voted. You must
oblige us. Do you understand the

484
01:06:00,043 --> 01:06:04,922
consequences of your decision?
- Do not patronize me, Azmath.

485
01:06:05,548 --> 01:06:08,008
For I understand all too well.

486
01:06:10,428 --> 01:06:14,139
Yes, I violate the law in defying
the council.

487
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:19,019
But, if I were to give you this
scepter, my crime

488
01:06:19,604 --> 01:06:23,691
would be graver yet. I would be
defying my conscience

489
01:06:23,775 --> 01:06:26,360
and our people.

490
01:06:28,113 --> 01:06:31,990
Have you all forgotten?
This council was created

491
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:36,620
to protect the people of Izmer. But,
ask yourselves. Is this what you

492
01:06:36,705 --> 01:06:39,790
are doing? I say not.

493
01:06:41,501 --> 01:06:45,671
Your concern is only for yourselves.
Not the people.

494
01:06:46,673 --> 01:06:50,718
And your Majesty is forcing the empire
to the verge of civil war

495
01:06:50,802 --> 01:06:54,888
in the best interest of the people?
- The man who convinced you to take the

496
01:06:54,973 --> 01:06:58,642
scepter from me so that he would

497
01:06:59,019 --> 01:07:03,188
leave the state defenseless.
Be careful, my friends.

498
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:08,235
For once he's done with me,
this council may be next.

499
01:07:11,531 --> 01:07:15,242
War benefits no one, Profion.
And I oppose it.

500
01:07:17,537 --> 01:07:22,416
But, if it is necessary to obtain
the freedom of our people?

501
01:07:22,667 --> 01:07:26,962
Then no cost could be too great
to achieve that goal.

502
01:07:27,047 --> 01:07:31,258
Do you hear her words?
She violates our highest law.

503
01:07:33,136 --> 01:07:36,055
And then threatens to force us into

504
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:41,477
submission with the threat of war!
- Each citizen of Izmer,

505
01:07:41,603 --> 01:07:45,773
whether a commoner or a mage,
deserves an equal right

506
01:07:45,857 --> 01:07:48,400
for prosperity. And as Empress,

507
01:07:50,236 --> 01:07:53,197
this is how I decree Izmer shall be

508
01:07:54,407 --> 01:07:58,160
run from this day forward.
- Such pretty words.

509
01:07:59,704 --> 01:08:03,749
My friends, I warn you.
That this headstrong child

510
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:09,213
will defy you. And destroy you.

511
01:08:10,507 --> 01:08:14,134
Her youth denies her the wisdom
to understand

512
01:08:14,886 --> 01:08:18,764
why some things cannot be changed.
That idealism

513
01:08:19,808 --> 01:08:22,726
is for children. And a child is not

514
01:08:24,312 --> 01:08:28,273
fit to govern an empire.
I ask you one last time!

515
01:08:29,025 --> 01:08:32,653
Will you submit to the ruling
of this council

516
01:08:33,196 --> 01:08:36,657
and relinquish your scepter?
- I was praying

517
01:08:37,909 --> 01:08:41,829
that you would find the wisdom to see
that the path I propose for Izmer

518
01:08:41,913 --> 01:08:43,956
is the right one.

519
01:08:47,085 --> 01:08:50,963
I do not wish to fight you.
But I will not leave

520
01:08:52,173 --> 01:08:56,427
the empire at the mercy of
an unscrupulous charlatan.

521
01:08:56,511 --> 01:08:58,554
So, decide as you must.

522
01:09:01,599 --> 01:09:03,642
But, know one thing.

523
01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:07,312
I am not afraid.

524
01:09:23,038 --> 01:09:26,040
A wonderful performance. My friends,

525
01:09:27,542 --> 01:09:31,503
ask yourselves.
Are we prepared to see our empire

526
01:09:31,755 --> 01:09:33,797
destroyed by a child?
- No!

527
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:40,137
Then is now not the time
we should act?

528
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:43,432
Yeah!
- Then, down with the tyrant!

529
01:10:09,167 --> 01:10:11,210
Wow.

530
01:10:17,759 --> 01:10:19,802
What is he doing?

531
01:10:21,638 --> 01:10:24,848
Isnâ€™t he going to use any spells?
- Wait.

532
01:10:54,087 --> 01:10:56,130
Hello, Ridley.

533
01:10:58,091 --> 01:11:01,844
How did you do that?
- The elven peoples do not require

534
01:11:01,928 --> 01:11:04,513
spells to work with magic.

535
01:11:05,265 --> 01:11:08,350
You use magic.

536
01:11:08,852 --> 01:11:11,812
We are part of it.

537
01:11:12,147 --> 01:11:16,483
You're part of the magic?
- As are all living creatures

538
01:11:16,693 --> 01:11:19,695
including dragons. Sadly, humans see

539
01:11:20,905 --> 01:11:23,365
only their destructive powers.

540
01:11:25,201 --> 01:11:27,578
Sshh!
- I had a dream. I saw...

541
01:11:28,329 --> 01:11:31,957
You saw a dragon being born.
- It was amazing.

542
01:11:33,043 --> 01:11:36,879
Life was exploding all around it.
- So it should. You see,

543
01:11:36,963 --> 01:11:41,050
when dragons are born,
they bring new magic with them.

544
01:11:41,134 --> 01:11:45,220
Magic is the life force of our world.
It keep nature

545
01:11:45,305 --> 01:11:48,307
and everything around us in balance.

546
01:11:52,937 --> 01:11:58,359
And if many dragons should die?
- Oh, life would wither as it must.

547
01:11:59,819 --> 01:12:02,821
And the balance would be destroyed.

548
01:12:03,448 --> 01:12:05,449
The rod.

549
01:12:06,910 --> 01:12:10,829
You and your countrymen are very
close to irreparably destroying

550
01:12:10,914 --> 01:12:14,375
the fabric of magic with this rod
you seek.

551
01:12:15,627 --> 01:12:18,712
The rod is man-made.

552
01:12:19,130 --> 01:12:22,132
Unnatural. It must not be disturbed.

553
01:12:25,595 --> 01:12:27,638
Sshh. You must rest.

554
01:12:56,710 --> 01:12:58,752
I'm sorry about Snails.

555
01:13:01,172 --> 01:13:03,215
Yeah.

556
01:13:03,925 --> 01:13:05,968
I'm sure you are.

557
01:13:10,056 --> 01:13:13,976
Ridley, he died for a good cause.
- A good cause?

558
01:13:17,188 --> 01:13:19,231
What cause is that? Hmm?

559
01:13:20,650 --> 01:13:22,943
The Empress against Profion?

560
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:28,282
Politics.

561
01:13:29,659 --> 01:13:31,785
I'm through with all that.

562
01:13:34,581 --> 01:13:38,417
I'm not going to die over some power
struggle between a couple of mages.

563
01:13:38,501 --> 01:13:42,212
No. No, you're wrong.
- No! You're wrong! Mage!

564
01:13:42,964 --> 01:13:47,468
You never had to live on the other
side. You know what? Snails was right.

565
01:13:47,552 --> 01:13:51,722
We can nothing do to change it. If I
had listened to him, he'd be alive.

566
01:13:51,723 --> 01:13:56,685
Just because some mages are evil does
not mean they all are! I'm not!

567
01:13:56,811 --> 01:13:58,812
I'm not!

568
01:14:00,774 --> 01:14:04,860
Let me let you in on a little secret.
The Empress that Snails died for

569
01:14:04,944 --> 01:14:09,531
stands to lose everything because
she is fighting to change things.

570
01:14:09,616 --> 01:14:12,743
As if she has anything to worry about.

571
01:14:14,079 --> 01:14:16,121
You are so naive.

572
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:21,627
She risks everything because she does
not believe the system is fair.

573
01:14:21,711 --> 01:14:25,798
Profion seeks to dethrone her because
she believes that mages and commoners

574
01:14:25,882 --> 01:14:29,968
should be treated as equals.
She is fighting to change

575
01:14:30,053 --> 01:14:32,096
what you hate so much!

576
01:14:34,265 --> 01:14:37,351
That, Ridley, is what Snails died for.

577
01:14:52,409 --> 01:14:57,621
You now, when Vildan told me what was
happening with the Empress

578
01:14:57,914 --> 01:15:01,041
I wanted to do all I could
to help her.

579
01:15:02,502 --> 01:15:06,880
But, even then I did not understand
why she would want

580
01:15:07,716 --> 01:15:10,175
commoners to be equal with us.

581
01:15:11,636 --> 01:15:15,597
But now. After being with you for
only a few days

582
01:15:16,349 --> 01:15:20,394
and seeing how you, you always manage
to find your way,

583
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:23,605
I understand why the Empress is right.

584
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:32,823
Please, Ridley.

585
01:15:33,992 --> 01:15:37,202
Help show that we are not
like they are.

586
01:15:44,461 --> 01:15:46,503
You know, for a mage

587
01:15:51,301 --> 01:15:53,344
you're pretty smart.

588
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:34,343
It will protect you.

589
01:16:35,845 --> 01:16:37,888
Thank you.

590
01:17:14,509 --> 01:17:19,304
All right. This is it.
This is the entrance to the dungeon.

591
01:17:28,606 --> 01:17:31,775
What happened? What is it?

592
01:17:33,987 --> 01:17:39,116
Itâ€™s a wall of force of some kind.
Iâ€™ve never seen this kind of magic.

593
01:17:44,664 --> 01:17:46,874
Only you were meant to pass.

594
01:17:52,339 --> 01:17:55,424
I guess I go alone then.

595
01:17:56,259 --> 01:17:58,302
Ridley?

596
01:18:00,263 --> 01:18:04,308
Be careful.
- Don't worry. I'll be fine.

597
01:19:12,335 --> 01:19:14,378
Great.

598
01:19:15,839 --> 01:19:17,881
Now what?

599
01:20:58,692 --> 01:21:00,734
Sorry, Snails.

600
01:21:25,510 --> 01:21:28,804
Finally.
A mage who got what he deserved.

601
01:21:29,889 --> 01:21:33,017
Why do you disturb the
Rod of Savrille?

602
01:21:35,395 --> 01:21:37,646
To save the empire of Izmer.

603
01:21:39,024 --> 01:21:41,775
Who? What are you?
- I am Savrille.

604
01:21:43,236 --> 01:21:47,239
Creator of the rod. Cursed for the
crime of trying to control

605
01:21:47,323 --> 01:21:51,201
the Red Dragons.
And sentenced to this purgatory

606
01:21:51,703 --> 01:21:56,832
until someone worthy of its power
takes it. You are such a man?

607
01:21:59,586 --> 01:22:02,713
I don't know if anybody is such a man.

608
01:22:03,673 --> 01:22:06,759
But, I'm gonna find out.

609
01:22:07,135 --> 01:22:11,096
Be warned.
Anyone who wields the power of the rod

610
01:22:11,222 --> 01:22:15,309
shall suffer a horrible fate.
For the evil it creates cannot

611
01:22:15,393 --> 01:22:18,479
be undone.
Unless it's spell is broken.

612
01:22:19,105 --> 01:22:23,233
How do I break the spell?
- That, you must discover.

613
01:23:39,227 --> 01:23:42,980
The Empress has called
all her dragons upon us.

614
01:23:45,650 --> 01:23:49,737
Don't just stand there admiring them!
Destroy them before they reach us!

615
01:23:49,821 --> 01:23:51,864
Hurry! Hurry!

616
01:23:52,907 --> 01:23:55,325
Prepare to fire!
- Fire!

617
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:04,793
Is that the best you can do?

618
01:24:06,046 --> 01:24:08,088
Get up!

619
01:24:18,099 --> 01:24:20,142
Prepare to fire again!

620
01:24:22,687 --> 01:24:25,189
Aim for their wings, you fools!

621
01:24:28,735 --> 01:24:31,820
Fire, you fools! Fire!

622
01:24:53,551 --> 01:24:56,470
What have I done?

623
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:58,722
Yeah!

624
01:25:00,475 --> 01:25:02,559
Come to me.

625
01:25:24,416 --> 01:25:26,458
I found the rod!

626
01:25:28,169 --> 01:25:31,171
Thanks for saving me the trouble.

627
01:25:45,478 --> 01:25:50,065
Feels good, doesn't it? Ah! Remember
your stupidity and persistence

628
01:25:50,150 --> 01:25:52,526
got your thief friend killed.

629
01:25:55,030 --> 01:25:58,949
Don't let it be responsible for
finishing off the rest of your

630
01:25:59,034 --> 01:26:01,076
social circle.

631
01:26:04,789 --> 01:26:06,832
Oh. Look. Iâ€™ve cut her.

632
01:26:10,128 --> 01:26:12,504
What a shame.
- Don't hurt her!

633
01:26:13,757 --> 01:26:17,551
Then give me the rod!
- And you'll release them?

634
01:26:19,137 --> 01:26:22,222
Don't do it, Ridley.

635
01:26:24,684 --> 01:26:27,394
You have my word.

636
01:26:52,545 --> 01:26:55,547
Finally.
- You said you'd let them go!

637
01:27:00,845 --> 01:27:03,931
I lied. Kill them.

638
01:27:07,310 --> 01:27:09,311
Slowly.

639
01:27:59,571 --> 01:28:02,239
Ridley! No! No!

640
01:28:26,056 --> 01:28:28,265
Give that to me.

641
01:28:36,566 --> 01:28:38,776
You said you'd set me free.

642
01:28:45,033 --> 01:28:47,076
Yes!

643
01:28:48,453 --> 01:28:50,496
Now what about my head?

644
01:29:08,973 --> 01:29:11,016
Here they come!

645
01:29:14,604 --> 01:29:17,731
Come, Damodar! To the roof of Sumdall!

646
01:29:31,371 --> 01:29:33,372
Fire!

647
01:30:03,528 --> 01:30:05,571
My destiny.

648
01:30:10,410 --> 01:30:12,453
Come to me.

649
01:30:20,462 --> 01:30:22,504
Damodar!

650
01:31:21,439 --> 01:31:24,191
Look. Iâ€™ve cut you. What a shame.

651
01:32:27,672 --> 01:32:30,841
You can run your ladyship.

652
01:32:31,926 --> 01:32:34,595
But you'll never run far enough!

653
01:32:36,723 --> 01:32:39,558
Let their blood rain from the sky!

654
01:32:52,489 --> 01:32:54,907
You'll pay for that, boy.

655
01:32:55,617 --> 01:32:59,495
Did you really think you could steal
my destiny?

656
01:32:59,913 --> 01:33:03,290
Iâ€™ve got a new destiny
especially for you.

657
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,669
Full of pain. New kinds of pain.

658
01:33:08,171 --> 01:33:12,800
And new senses to feel it with.
- Not if I kill you first.

659
01:33:15,178 --> 01:33:18,013
Now, this will be a real pleasure.

660
01:33:38,785 --> 01:33:42,913
Not so talented, Mr. Ridley?
Iâ€™ve enjoyed our little chat.

661
01:33:42,997 --> 01:33:45,374
But, now is your time to die.

662
01:34:04,185 --> 01:34:06,186
My little tracker.

663
01:34:08,940 --> 01:34:10,983
Hey mage!

664
01:34:11,151 --> 01:34:14,695
Why don't you pick on someone your
own size?

665
01:34:16,865 --> 01:34:20,743
Oh, do you really think that you
could use that,

666
01:34:21,036 --> 01:34:23,078
you little burglar?

667
01:34:41,973 --> 01:34:45,976
That's impossible?
- Bring them down on him Ridley!

668
01:34:46,895 --> 01:34:48,896
Destroy him!

669
01:35:06,539 --> 01:35:08,582
No.

670
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:13,462
I won't become you!

671
01:35:19,511 --> 01:35:21,553
What have you done?

672
01:35:22,889 --> 01:35:24,932
Profion!

673
01:35:27,352 --> 01:35:29,353
Your majesty?

674
01:35:34,693 --> 01:35:37,820
Itâ€™s over, Profion.
- The battle may be,

675
01:35:39,239 --> 01:35:41,281
your Majesty. Maybe.

676
01:35:44,411 --> 01:35:46,453
But not the war!

677
01:37:04,032 --> 01:37:06,075
Thank you.

678
01:37:06,701 --> 01:37:08,744
Norda?

679
01:37:34,604 --> 01:37:38,065
People of Izmer. At long last,
I do declare

680
01:37:39,234 --> 01:37:41,443
that you are now all equal.

681
01:37:43,571 --> 01:37:45,698
Let the celebration begin!

682
01:38:02,841 --> 01:38:04,842
Hear that, buddy?

683
01:38:06,011 --> 01:38:08,053
That's for you.

684
01:38:10,390 --> 01:38:13,600
Nothing's gonna be the same
without you.

685
01:38:15,145 --> 01:38:19,565
But, I guess I'll have to get
used to that. I just hope

686
01:38:19,774 --> 01:38:21,817
wherever you are,

687
01:38:23,653 --> 01:38:26,864
you know that you did make
a difference.

688
01:38:29,159 --> 01:38:31,201
You helped things change.

689
01:38:45,258 --> 01:38:47,301
You finally got it.

690
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:50,763
Your big score.

691
01:38:58,146 --> 01:39:02,232
Well, I guess I better get going. Or,
I'll miss my own knighting ceremony.

692
01:39:02,317 --> 01:39:05,402
Ridley the savior.
Can you believe it?

693
01:39:13,495 --> 01:39:15,537
I'm gonna miss you, pal.

694
01:40:06,673 --> 01:40:10,718
No not question your gift.
Your friend awaits you.

695
01:40:59,392 --> 01:41:01,560
