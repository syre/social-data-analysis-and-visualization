1
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:12,389
-Good evening, Mrs. Gant.
-What does my husband want now?

2
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,893
His plans changed. He's available
to spend time with Michael.

3
00:03:17,102 --> 00:03:19,396
Michael just came home.

4
00:03:19,896 --> 00:03:22,148
He's expecting his son, ma'am.

5
00:03:28,697 --> 00:03:31,783
Hello, it's Vinn.
I need to speak to Gant.

6
00:03:32,242 --> 00:03:34,119
-Yeah?
-Robert, what are you doing?

7
00:03:34,244 --> 00:03:37,205
He flew to Europe.
Five days later, you send him home?

8
00:03:37,372 --> 00:03:39,791
Come on, Michael. Daddy's waiting.

9
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,585
-He'll be fine.
-Bye, Mommy.

10
00:03:41,877 --> 00:03:45,714
Robert, you bastard.
This wasn't our agreement.

11
00:04:18,997 --> 00:04:23,460
-Unit 1, do you copy?
-Let's go, Michael! Come on with me.

12
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,720
-Take the flank.
-Got you.

13
00:04:45,857 --> 00:04:48,318
Okay, come on.
Hang on to me, Michael.

14
00:05:26,314 --> 00:05:29,609
Stay here, all right?
Stay here and be brave.

15
00:06:40,555 --> 00:06:42,349
Jeremiah Ecks?

16
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,268
No, sorry.

17
00:06:46,895 --> 00:06:48,980
That's you, isn't it?

18
00:06:50,398 --> 00:06:52,442
What happened to your head?

19
00:06:52,609 --> 00:06:54,277
Bad haircut.

20
00:06:55,362 --> 00:06:58,907
Look, we've been instructed
to bring you in.

21
00:07:00,283 --> 00:07:02,869
I'm not the man you want.

22
00:07:03,161 --> 00:07:07,332
Forget this. We'll do it the hard way.

23
00:07:08,124 --> 00:07:11,086
-That's not a healthy attitude.
-Neither is yours.

24
00:07:11,294 --> 00:07:15,298
-Relax, Addis.
-Yeah, relax. Listen to your partner.

25
00:07:16,174 --> 00:07:17,884
This guy's nothing.

26
00:07:24,015 --> 00:07:25,517
Who sent you?

27
00:07:25,642 --> 00:07:29,646
FBI Assistant Director Julio Martin.

28
00:07:29,855 --> 00:07:31,439
Julio.

29
00:07:45,328 --> 00:07:47,122
Hello, Ecks.

30
00:07:51,668 --> 00:07:53,712
We need to talk.

31
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,218
The answer is no.

32
00:08:09,728 --> 00:08:12,564
I'll need a car here at 3:00.

33
00:08:12,731 --> 00:08:17,736
No, make it 2:30. I don't want
to get stuck in this holiday traffic.

34
00:08:25,035 --> 00:08:26,870
Vinn is alive.

35
00:08:27,454 --> 00:08:28,997
You're lying.

36
00:08:29,206 --> 00:08:32,000
Taken off a cellular sweep.

37
00:08:32,417 --> 00:08:35,712
-I saw her die.
-You saw an explosion.

38
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:39,799
-I went to her funeral.
-You saw a closed casket.

39
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:45,514
-You waited seven years to tell me?
-I'd have told you if I'd known.

40
00:08:45,931 --> 00:08:47,891
Where is she?

41
00:08:50,936 --> 00:08:52,521
I don't know.

42
00:08:52,896 --> 00:08:57,317
-Then why are you here?
-I need you to do a job for me.

43
00:09:04,032 --> 00:09:06,284
Where is my wife?

44
00:09:08,453 --> 00:09:10,163
I'm sorry.

45
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:13,750
-I need you to do it...
-Where is she?

46
00:09:15,085 --> 00:09:18,129
When the job is done,
I'll give you what I got.

47
00:09:20,674 --> 00:09:23,134
No, you don't want to do this.

48
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:27,722
I don't have a choice. I have
a situation and you're my only option.

49
00:09:27,931 --> 00:09:31,142
I tell you what I know right now,
and you're gone.

50
00:09:34,688 --> 00:09:36,731
I'm gone anyway.

51
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:45,240
Sit in the corner.
You'll provoke him when he returns.

52
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:40,587
You'll be joining an FBI
transnational special task force.

53
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:51,181
Make it 2:30. I don't want
to get stuck in this holiday traffic.

54
00:11:33,306 --> 00:11:36,059
You were supposed to protect my son.

55
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:38,520
She took us by surprise.

56
00:11:39,688 --> 00:11:42,190
How do I explain that to my wife?

57
00:11:47,237 --> 00:11:50,282
In more noble times...

58
00:11:51,157 --> 00:11:54,119
...when a knight failed his king...

59
00:11:54,244 --> 00:11:56,663
...he fell on his sword.

60
00:11:56,872 --> 00:11:58,665
Sir?

61
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:03,879
Do the honorable thing, Agent Curtis.

62
00:12:11,428 --> 00:12:13,263
Take the gun.

63
00:12:25,942 --> 00:12:28,403
Put it against your head.

64
00:12:35,869 --> 00:12:37,496
Pull the trigger.

65
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,335
Now.

66
00:12:56,223 --> 00:12:58,391
How much time do we have?

67
00:12:58,558 --> 00:13:01,728
Based on our tests,
we have 28 hours left.

68
00:13:02,729 --> 00:13:04,439
Then my son dies.

69
00:13:05,941 --> 00:13:10,278
Do whatever it takes, Ross.
Get me Michael.

70
00:13:10,487 --> 00:13:14,824
You know who we're up against.
You know what she wants.

71
00:13:16,743 --> 00:13:20,413
Well, I can't give it to her, now can I?

72
00:13:50,068 --> 00:13:54,155
On the left is A.J. Ross. His team
arrived in Vancouver five hours ago.

73
00:13:54,322 --> 00:13:58,994
-His nickname: Prince of Darkness.
-lf you know so much, just pick him up.

74
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:05,167
I don't want him. I want the man
he works for, Robert Gant.

75
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,710
Robert Gant?

76
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:10,797
Intel is purposely limited.
But a shadow government...

77
00:14:10,922 --> 00:14:15,135
...in the name of national security
is still a shadow government.

78
00:14:16,887 --> 00:14:21,391
This is Gant's latest acquisition.
Code name "SoftKill."

79
00:14:21,558 --> 00:14:23,894
He's been trying
to build a perfect assassin.

80
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:28,231
But he's never been able to lick
the one thing that got in his way.

81
00:14:28,398 --> 00:14:30,609
The human factor.

82
00:14:30,775 --> 00:14:35,363
For Gant, emotions are a liability.
A machine would solve that problem.

83
00:14:35,572 --> 00:14:41,119
He could give a head of state a heart attack
or an aneurysm. Totally undetectable.

84
00:14:41,244 --> 00:14:45,999
-It's the future of his business.
-Looks like he licked the problem.

85
00:14:46,124 --> 00:14:48,627
More like he stole it.

86
00:14:48,793 --> 00:14:51,796
A prototype was developed
at a facility in Berlin.

87
00:14:51,922 --> 00:14:56,801
Last week, the place was torched.
The media called it an accident.

88
00:14:57,135 --> 00:15:00,347
Ross just happened to be there.

89
00:15:01,014 --> 00:15:02,516
And the prototype?

90
00:15:02,682 --> 00:15:06,520
We thermoscanned Ross and his men
before they boarded their plane.

91
00:15:06,686 --> 00:15:09,064
All clean. No sign of the prototype.

92
00:15:09,231 --> 00:15:12,943
-Thank you, Louise.
-It all checked out until last night.

93
00:15:13,109 --> 00:15:18,448
-Ecks, this is Special Agent Harry Lee.
-We pulled that from a traffic cam.

94
00:15:18,657 --> 00:15:22,744
This woman single-handedly took out
an armed DIA escort detail...

95
00:15:22,911 --> 00:15:25,330
...and kidnapped a young boy.

96
00:15:27,374 --> 00:15:29,292
Gant's son.

97
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:33,505
Based on Ross being here,
yes, we think so.

98
00:15:38,468 --> 00:15:40,679
Obviously a professional.

99
00:15:41,429 --> 00:15:44,391
-Is she ours or theirs?
-No idea.

100
00:15:44,724 --> 00:15:48,186
My money pegs her as disaffected DIA.

101
00:15:49,938 --> 00:15:53,525
-Profiles, photos, anything?
-Just that.

102
00:15:56,862 --> 00:16:00,031
If she's DIA, she's orphan class,
out of China.

103
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,702
-Orphan class?
-Chinese have this rule:

104
00:16:03,869 --> 00:16:05,537
One child per family.

105
00:16:06,538 --> 00:16:08,456
All families want a boy.

106
00:16:08,999 --> 00:16:12,377
The DIA secretly adopts
some of these girls.

107
00:16:12,586 --> 00:16:15,714
They're weaned on violence.
Trained to do nothing...

108
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,927
...but kill in a thousand ways.
No fear. No conscience. No morality.

109
00:16:21,261 --> 00:16:23,889
Exactly what Gant wants
in an employee.

110
00:16:24,055 --> 00:16:28,185
Whoever she is,
she's obviously pissed off at him.

111
00:16:29,686 --> 00:16:32,606
That's why I need you to find her.

112
00:16:33,982 --> 00:16:35,942
Of course you do.

113
00:17:41,925 --> 00:17:44,052
Is that why they call you "X"?

114
00:17:44,845 --> 00:17:46,972
I'm on a diet.

115
00:17:54,688 --> 00:17:57,274
That's my wife and my daughter.

116
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,823
Her name's Mali.

117
00:18:09,828 --> 00:18:11,621
Do you love her?

118
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:13,957
Of course.

119
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,919
Then get out of this business.

120
00:18:35,729 --> 00:18:38,190
Gun team, disable target
on my command.

121
00:18:38,356 --> 00:18:41,234
Don't cancel.
We need her alive. Acknowledge.

122
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:43,528
-Roger that.
-Affirmative.

123
00:18:45,739 --> 00:18:47,991
-Is the target aware?
-No, sir.

124
00:18:48,158 --> 00:18:51,620
-Is her back to you?
-Affirmative. Positive visual.

125
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,580
We got her too.

126
00:19:01,004 --> 00:19:02,923
Freeze.

127
00:19:05,383 --> 00:19:08,595
-She's got a gun!
-Get down!

128
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,102
Close One is not responding.

129
00:19:16,269 --> 00:19:18,855
I've lost her. Too much motion.
You have her?

130
00:19:19,022 --> 00:19:20,482
Negative. Please advise.

131
00:19:20,649 --> 00:19:24,361
Call in the local P.D.
We'll use them for cover.

132
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,706
-Target clear.
-Why is she standing there?

133
00:19:36,873 --> 00:19:39,292
She knows you won't kill her.
Pin her down!

134
00:19:39,459 --> 00:19:42,879
The local P.D. has been alerted.
They're coming in.

135
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:08,321
Move! Move!

136
00:20:08,488 --> 00:20:11,366
-Gun team, do you see her?
-Negative.

137
00:20:14,161 --> 00:20:17,247
Do not let her breach the perimeter.

138
00:20:45,358 --> 00:20:46,401
Jesus!

139
00:20:48,111 --> 00:20:51,698
Do not cancel target.
Keep her contained.

140
00:20:55,118 --> 00:20:56,703
Where's my tactical team?

141
00:21:12,093 --> 00:21:13,637
Run.

142
00:21:14,387 --> 00:21:15,889
Don't shoot!

143
00:21:19,601 --> 00:21:22,896
Sniper One, what are you waiting for?
Disable target!

144
00:21:38,787 --> 00:21:43,166
All units, shots fired.
Suspect is female. vancouver Library.

145
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,460
That's her.

146
00:21:45,627 --> 00:21:47,629
-Julio?
-We heard. We're on it.

147
00:21:48,046 --> 00:21:49,965
Tracking target.

148
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,419
All right, let's move it!

149
00:22:28,336 --> 00:22:30,005
Get her!

150
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:57,240
-We lost contact with our tactical unit.
-Who's manning the assault vehicle?

151
00:23:01,912 --> 00:23:03,246
Shit!

152
00:23:05,165 --> 00:23:06,750
Get out of here!

153
00:23:19,429 --> 00:23:20,889
Get down!

154
00:23:27,229 --> 00:23:29,356
Cover me! Cover me!

155
00:24:29,124 --> 00:24:30,959
Stay back please, sir.

156
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,339
You shouldn't be here.

157
00:24:36,548 --> 00:24:39,176
Somebody get too much foam
in their latte?

158
00:24:39,342 --> 00:24:41,761
-I'm in no mood.
-That makes two of us.

159
00:24:41,928 --> 00:24:46,600
I know about that job you pulled
in Berlin. You're getting sloppy.

160
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:51,062
Enjoy your stay in Vancouver.

161
00:25:10,207 --> 00:25:12,209
Who's the woman?

162
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:16,296
Somebody your boss pushed too far?

163
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:19,925
Stay out of this.
This is an issue of national security.

164
00:25:20,091 --> 00:25:21,760
You mean job security?

165
00:25:22,135 --> 00:25:26,097
Wouldn't want to be you
when Gant sees this mess.

166
00:25:38,401 --> 00:25:39,986
You're sweating.

167
00:25:41,988 --> 00:25:44,074
It's been raining.

168
00:25:44,199 --> 00:25:47,369
Be smart. Walk away.

169
00:25:51,748 --> 00:25:53,333
Julio?

170
00:25:54,501 --> 00:25:56,086
Yeah.

171
00:25:56,711 --> 00:25:58,630
Take your people out of here.

172
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,593
-What is it?
-A feeling. Get them out. Now.

173
00:26:03,718 --> 00:26:07,597
-What the hell are you talking about?
-She will retaliate.

174
00:26:08,807 --> 00:26:12,185
We're covered.
A curtain call here would be suicide.

175
00:26:12,394 --> 00:26:14,020
You're wrong.

176
00:26:14,354 --> 00:26:17,566
-How can you be sure?
-Trust me.

177
00:26:18,024 --> 00:26:20,569
She's not done yet.

178
00:26:31,288 --> 00:26:33,165
Down! Get down!

179
00:26:33,915 --> 00:26:35,417
Julio!

180
00:26:35,709 --> 00:26:38,879
She knows.
She knows where your wife is.

181
00:26:42,424 --> 00:26:43,967
Martin is down!

182
00:26:46,511 --> 00:26:49,973
Paramedic! Paramedic!
Over here!

183
00:26:54,394 --> 00:26:57,063
Come on, baby. Come on.

184
00:26:57,272 --> 00:26:58,857
Yeah.

185
00:27:00,817 --> 00:27:03,403
Hey, beautiful! What...

186
00:27:04,946 --> 00:27:06,698
My nose!

187
00:27:14,331 --> 00:27:16,500
-I think it's broken.
-Let me see.

188
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:19,252
-Where is she?
-I didn't touch her.

189
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,174
Mobile Unit One on-site.
Situation out of hand.

190
00:28:06,341 --> 00:28:09,052
Suggest the locals take this one.

191
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:29,239
Bitch.

192
00:28:32,826 --> 00:28:35,036
Head for the highest vantage point.

193
00:28:35,203 --> 00:28:38,582
They're on foot.
They can't be hard to spot.

194
00:29:14,659 --> 00:29:17,204
Drop your weapon!

195
00:29:24,711 --> 00:29:27,839
You kill me, you kill Gant's son.

196
00:29:27,964 --> 00:29:30,509
I don't work for Gant.

197
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:32,886
I just want my wife.

198
00:29:36,932 --> 00:29:38,475
Shit!

199
00:29:43,647 --> 00:29:45,065
I'm okay.

200
00:29:47,776 --> 00:29:50,403
The bullet hit my vest.

201
00:29:53,114 --> 00:29:55,951
Ross, do you have my son yet?

202
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,704
We've sighted our target.
No word on the package.

203
00:29:59,871 --> 00:30:01,998
We may have another problem.

204
00:30:11,633 --> 00:30:13,927
Where is my wife?

205
00:30:15,846 --> 00:30:17,472
Where is she?

206
00:30:33,613 --> 00:30:35,949
What's your hurry?

207
00:31:00,515 --> 00:31:03,476
Chase One,
we have your hot target locked.

208
00:31:03,643 --> 00:31:06,438
Our new player might do the job
for us. Advise.

209
00:31:06,563 --> 00:31:08,607
Don't let them cancel each other.

210
00:31:17,407 --> 00:31:20,076
Roger that.
Going green for a quarantine.

211
00:31:36,593 --> 00:31:39,888
Target's on the move,
over north side of building.

212
00:32:54,546 --> 00:32:56,506
It's not polite to stare.

213
00:33:00,552 --> 00:33:02,512
I see you've met Mali.

214
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:04,639
Come here, sweetie.

215
00:33:04,806 --> 00:33:08,226
How you doing? What's up?

216
00:33:14,733 --> 00:33:16,484
Go find Mom.

217
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,621
So my daughter wanted to know
why you look so sad.

218
00:33:28,788 --> 00:33:32,584
I told her it's because
you just got beat up by a girl.

219
00:33:42,093 --> 00:33:45,472
You know, Ecks,
Martin didn't want to do it.

220
00:33:46,306 --> 00:33:51,269
Use your wife as bait to get you back
in the game. But he had no choice.

221
00:33:53,813 --> 00:33:55,524
How is he?

222
00:33:57,317 --> 00:34:03,240
Not bad, considering. Bullet missed
his heart by about a centimeter.

223
00:34:04,783 --> 00:34:06,827
She doesn't miss.

224
00:34:07,118 --> 00:34:09,037
What are you saying?

225
00:34:10,539 --> 00:34:12,040
Nothing.

226
00:34:13,291 --> 00:34:15,085
Could you give me a laptop...

227
00:34:15,293 --> 00:34:19,214
-...and Julio's notes on this case?
-I thought you might say that.

228
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:35,540
Let me see your hand.

229
00:36:41,648 --> 00:36:44,276
Who's running the task force now?

230
00:36:44,442 --> 00:36:48,405
Nobody. We're suspended
pending an inquiry.

231
00:36:49,406 --> 00:36:52,576
Which means I probably
shouldn't watch you do this.

232
00:36:52,742 --> 00:36:55,120
-You're not even here.
-Right.

233
00:37:06,089 --> 00:37:08,091
Sever.

234
00:38:16,743 --> 00:38:19,371
Freeze! Get your hands
above your head!

235
00:38:19,496 --> 00:38:20,497
Oh, man.

236
00:38:20,705 --> 00:38:24,626
You're under arrest for the shooting
of Agent Julio Martin.

237
00:38:35,011 --> 00:38:37,222
We have her online, sir.

238
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:39,558
Put her through.

239
00:38:41,935 --> 00:38:46,231
-Where's my son, Sever?
-Maybe the same place my son is.

240
00:38:47,065 --> 00:38:51,153
Don't blame me. You broke profile.

241
00:38:51,319 --> 00:38:54,114
Is that what you call having a child?

242
00:38:54,281 --> 00:38:56,741
They weren't supposed
to be there.

243
00:39:14,718 --> 00:39:16,678
Sever?

244
00:39:17,179 --> 00:39:18,889
Sever?

245
00:39:20,724 --> 00:39:24,603
-How's Michael?
-Fine.

246
00:39:25,228 --> 00:39:27,772
He's a good boy.

247
00:39:27,939 --> 00:39:30,233
But he misses his mother.

248
00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:36,865
-I want him back.
-You mean you want what he's carrying.

249
00:39:37,032 --> 00:39:39,367
He could die
if we don't get it out.

250
00:39:39,493 --> 00:39:44,831
I didn't put it in him. You did.
Tell that to your wife.

251
00:39:46,166 --> 00:39:47,375
What do you want?

252
00:39:49,211 --> 00:39:51,630
Your life for Michael's.

253
00:39:53,089 --> 00:39:57,802
-It didn't have to come to this, Sever.
-Well, now it has.

254
00:40:10,982 --> 00:40:12,317
You pulled his file?

255
00:40:12,484 --> 00:40:16,571
Yes, sir. Here's the printout.

256
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,662
Sever still has Gant's kid.

257
00:40:24,746 --> 00:40:27,332
I don't know what
you're talking about.

258
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:35,423
You better pay attention because
she won't stop until she gets him.

259
00:40:36,258 --> 00:40:37,926
I can find her...

260
00:40:38,093 --> 00:40:40,303
...bring back the kid.

261
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:44,808
Sever is DIA.
She knows all your tricks.

262
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:48,186
She doesn't know mine.

263
00:40:48,353 --> 00:40:50,981
We can handle this.

264
00:40:51,147 --> 00:40:54,484
You're certainly doing a great job of it.

265
00:40:54,693 --> 00:40:56,820
Why do you care?

266
00:41:00,115 --> 00:41:02,492
That's my business.

267
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:13,753
-Yes.
-The local P.D. has our man.

268
00:41:13,962 --> 00:41:19,050
-ID?
-Former FBI agent named Jeremiah Ecks.

269
00:41:21,511 --> 00:41:22,679
Get rid of him.

270
00:41:27,684 --> 00:41:30,020
Sorry, Ecks, you're a local matter.

271
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:32,981
-We're done here.
-You're making a mistake.

272
00:41:33,982 --> 00:41:36,026
She's gonna kill you.

273
00:41:36,651 --> 00:41:39,488
Captain, this isn't my jurisdiction...

274
00:41:39,613 --> 00:41:44,284
...but I suggest you take him away
before I make it my jurisdiction.

275
00:41:48,413 --> 00:41:49,789
Good luck.

276
00:42:19,528 --> 00:42:22,572
-Is he alive?
-Yes, I'm sure of it.

277
00:42:22,739 --> 00:42:25,534
-Why do they want Michael?
-I don't know.

278
00:42:25,659 --> 00:42:27,994
-You're lying.
-I swear.

279
00:42:28,203 --> 00:42:31,623
-Do they want money?
-I don't know.

280
00:42:33,208 --> 00:42:38,213
This should have never happened.
Michael should have been home with me.

281
00:42:38,588 --> 00:42:41,633
I'm doing everything I can to find him.

282
00:42:42,217 --> 00:42:46,596
-What are you doing exactly?
-You know I can't divulge details.

283
00:42:47,055 --> 00:42:49,933
-Of course.
-I'm sorry.

284
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:52,811
You promised me
this wouldn't happen.

285
00:42:52,936 --> 00:42:56,314
You think I haven't tried
to keep that promise?

286
00:42:56,481 --> 00:42:58,567
Just find him.

287
00:43:21,173 --> 00:43:23,675
Mobile Two has visual of target.

288
00:47:17,659 --> 00:47:19,161
Shit!

289
00:48:53,213 --> 00:48:55,257
You wanted your wife?

290
00:48:56,132 --> 00:48:58,552
You'll find her with Gant.

291
00:49:27,247 --> 00:49:29,291
We need to talk.

292
00:49:40,427 --> 00:49:46,433
-We're running out of options.
-Ecks is mobile. Sever helped him escape.

293
00:49:53,064 --> 00:49:55,567
What the hell does she want with him?

294
00:49:56,526 --> 00:49:59,446
Can I ask why this man
is so dangerous?

295
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:03,033
No.

296
00:50:06,995 --> 00:50:09,206
What did you find out?

297
00:50:11,249 --> 00:50:12,834
They're still looking.

298
00:50:13,168 --> 00:50:16,379
You needed to lock
yourself in the study for that?

299
00:50:17,631 --> 00:50:19,382
You know how it works.

300
00:50:19,841 --> 00:50:23,929
-I'll take care of it.
-Why is this person trying to hurt us?

301
00:50:24,054 --> 00:50:27,474
-What did you do to him?
-Her.

302
00:50:27,682 --> 00:50:31,561
-She used to work for me.
-Oh, God. God, no.

303
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:33,939
She won't hurt Michael.

304
00:50:34,147 --> 00:50:37,275
-How can you be so sure?
-Trust me.

305
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,572
I need you to be strong.

306
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:44,741
Then leave.

307
00:50:47,369 --> 00:50:50,121
-Where are you going?
-Out.

308
00:50:55,126 --> 00:50:56,878
How much time do we have?

309
00:50:57,087 --> 00:50:59,297
Less than 12 hours.

310
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:29,536
Thank you.

311
00:52:57,582 --> 00:52:59,584
Hello, Vinn.

312
00:53:03,505 --> 00:53:05,507
Jeremy?

313
00:53:19,104 --> 00:53:21,398
What's going on, Jeremy?

314
00:53:23,817 --> 00:53:26,653
I am taking a deep cover assignment.

315
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:35,162
Baby...

316
00:53:36,454 --> 00:53:38,874
...please don't take this one.

317
00:53:40,792 --> 00:53:43,378
I wish I didn't have to.

318
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:45,213
Then don't.

319
00:53:45,922 --> 00:53:47,674
Quit.

320
00:53:52,637 --> 00:53:55,348
This is my job.

321
00:53:55,557 --> 00:53:57,559
This is what I do.

322
00:54:12,324 --> 00:54:15,494
Why did this have to happen to us?

323
00:54:20,749 --> 00:54:23,418
It's a means to an end.

324
00:54:27,005 --> 00:54:30,550
Gant had an agenda.

325
00:54:32,135 --> 00:54:37,599
Me, he had to get rid of, and you...
Well, you he wanted.

326
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:40,727
And so he took you.

327
00:54:43,271 --> 00:54:47,359
I know, I know. I'm late.

328
00:54:47,818 --> 00:54:50,070
I know he loved me...

329
00:54:50,278 --> 00:54:52,948
...but I only became his wife...

330
00:54:53,114 --> 00:54:55,033
...in name.

331
00:54:56,326 --> 00:55:01,832
You're the one that I love.
I never stopped loving you.

332
00:55:01,998 --> 00:55:04,376
You had a son with him.

333
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:09,089
No. Not with him.

334
00:55:15,637 --> 00:55:17,722
Michael?

335
00:55:21,893 --> 00:55:25,397
I knew that day in the restaurant.

336
00:55:25,689 --> 00:55:27,190
I wanted to tell you.

337
00:55:27,899 --> 00:55:32,070
I wanted you to stay, but I didn't
want you to worry about me...

338
00:55:32,529 --> 00:55:34,489
...about us.

339
00:55:38,368 --> 00:55:43,039
He's our son. Yours and mine.

340
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,254
He was the only piece of you
I had left.

341
00:56:06,271 --> 00:56:09,065
Oh, God, no!

342
00:56:09,566 --> 00:56:12,360
Jeremy!

343
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:38,178
I thought that staying with Gant...

344
00:56:38,345 --> 00:56:40,805
...was the only way to protect Michael.

345
00:56:41,473 --> 00:56:43,183
But I was wrong.

346
00:56:43,350 --> 00:56:45,352
Michael.

347
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:49,231
Hey, listen to me.

348
00:56:50,398 --> 00:56:52,651
I found you.

349
00:56:53,693 --> 00:56:55,987
We'll find him.

350
00:57:00,408 --> 00:57:02,869
What do we do now?

351
00:57:07,749 --> 00:57:09,459
Run.

352
00:57:37,612 --> 00:57:42,450
-Is that the bitch who stole our son?
-I see you found your wife.

353
00:57:45,579 --> 00:57:48,165
-Where is Michael?
-Your son?

354
00:57:48,373 --> 00:57:50,208
Yes, my son.

355
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:04,222
Get in.

356
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:07,726
And by the way...

357
00:58:07,893 --> 00:58:10,645
...l'm the bitch protecting him.

358
00:58:23,408 --> 00:58:27,245
Air One to Command,
we have target in sight.

359
00:58:41,134 --> 00:58:43,887
How do you know about Michael?

360
00:58:52,854 --> 00:58:56,608
Prison bus. I could have been killed.

361
00:58:57,150 --> 00:58:59,236
But you weren't.

362
00:59:03,698 --> 00:59:07,160
-You do know we have company.
-Of course.

363
00:59:09,663 --> 00:59:11,665
Of course.

364
00:59:54,708 --> 00:59:56,084
Air One to Command.

365
00:59:56,251 --> 01:00:00,130
Target's destination is the south end
of victoria Park.

366
01:00:09,014 --> 01:00:10,974
He's up there.

367
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:22,444
Michael?

368
01:00:22,611 --> 01:00:25,071
Mommy!

369
01:00:25,697 --> 01:00:28,700
Sweetie.

370
01:00:30,702 --> 01:00:32,996
Where were you, Mom?

371
01:00:35,081 --> 01:00:37,709
Are you okay?

372
01:00:37,876 --> 01:00:39,336
Thank God.

373
01:00:39,544 --> 01:00:42,172
I was so worried about you.

374
01:00:45,217 --> 01:00:47,344
I missed you so much.

375
01:00:47,511 --> 01:00:50,680
I missed you too, Mommy.

376
01:00:51,014 --> 01:00:53,850
I wasn't even scared.

377
01:00:55,101 --> 01:00:56,978
You weren't?

378
01:00:57,604 --> 01:00:59,940
Who's that man?

379
01:01:00,857 --> 01:01:02,818
Come on.

380
01:01:07,322 --> 01:01:09,115
Hello.

381
01:01:10,408 --> 01:01:12,619
I am Jeremy.

382
01:01:13,787 --> 01:01:15,997
You're Michael, right?

383
01:01:33,849 --> 01:01:35,600
Go.

384
01:01:39,604 --> 01:01:42,732
You'll be safer up there until this is over.

385
01:02:12,304 --> 01:02:14,890
Where do you get all this ordnance?

386
01:02:16,016 --> 01:02:18,435
Some women buy shoes.

387
01:02:19,644 --> 01:02:21,438
Sweet.

388
01:03:57,242 --> 01:04:00,537
-All teams are in position.
-They move on my order.

389
01:04:00,745 --> 01:04:04,624
-What about your wife and son?
-Ecks will protect them.

390
01:04:04,791 --> 01:04:07,085
And Sever?

391
01:04:07,252 --> 01:04:12,048
She's been mourning her family
long enough. Let's reunite them.

392
01:04:15,385 --> 01:04:20,724
Sir, with all due respect, that's
an unacceptable level of exposure.

393
01:04:21,641 --> 01:04:25,645
Let's see. You lost my son.
You just lost my wife.

394
01:04:25,812 --> 01:04:28,190
You think I've lost my mind too?

395
01:04:28,356 --> 01:04:32,402
I didn't set this in play.
You did. I warned you of the risks.

396
01:04:32,569 --> 01:04:38,033
Your job is to fix my messes.
It should never have gotten this far.

397
01:04:41,077 --> 01:04:43,079
Let's get this over with.

398
01:04:43,246 --> 01:04:45,248
Gant.

399
01:04:47,584 --> 01:04:49,252
Sever.

400
01:04:49,753 --> 01:04:53,089
This doesn't have to get messy.
I just want you.

401
01:04:53,215 --> 01:04:57,552
I make you the same offer.
Send out what belongs to me.

402
01:04:57,719 --> 01:05:00,180
Then we can discuss your reinsertion.

403
01:05:00,347 --> 01:05:02,766
It's a little late for that.

404
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:06,895
-It's never too late.
-Tell that to Vinn.

405
01:05:11,316 --> 01:05:15,946
I can upgrade your status.
Allow you the luxury of a family.

406
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:18,073
I had a family.

407
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:22,786
You know who we are, Sever.
Targets and objectives come first.

408
01:05:22,953 --> 01:05:24,913
This is the way our world is.

409
01:05:25,622 --> 01:05:27,624
They were innocent.

410
01:05:27,833 --> 01:05:33,797
There are no innocent people.
You know that. Only killers and victims.

411
01:05:33,964 --> 01:05:36,007
-Take her out.
-Yes, sir.

412
01:06:14,671 --> 01:06:16,464
Go.

413
01:06:30,729 --> 01:06:32,189
My turn.

414
01:07:10,727 --> 01:07:11,853
Get down!

415
01:07:25,492 --> 01:07:27,160
Go.

416
01:07:27,369 --> 01:07:30,372
Move out! Go!

417
01:07:33,542 --> 01:07:37,462
-Moving in!
-Go, go, go!

418
01:07:45,554 --> 01:07:47,514
Give me that.

419
01:09:37,833 --> 01:09:40,293
Let's finish this.

420
01:10:46,193 --> 01:10:47,736
Shit.

421
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:56,888
Hello, Jeremiah.

422
01:11:58,598 --> 01:12:01,268
Agent Clark.

423
01:12:01,893 --> 01:12:04,646
It's been a long time.

424
01:12:08,775 --> 01:12:10,735
Why?

425
01:12:11,653 --> 01:12:14,990
Come on. You should know by now.

426
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:18,493
We had to get rid of Agent Clark...

427
01:12:18,702 --> 01:12:22,539
...so there could be a Robert Gant.

428
01:12:22,706 --> 01:12:26,877
So you rise from the ashes with
a license to do whatever you want.

429
01:12:27,377 --> 01:12:31,882
Power and profit. It's what we do.

430
01:12:33,758 --> 01:12:36,386
Where are my wife and son?

431
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:41,057
Last time I checked,
they were not yours.

432
01:12:44,728 --> 01:12:47,272
Come on, Jeremiah.

433
01:12:47,481 --> 01:12:51,902
I'd hate for either of them
to get hurt in the middle of this.

434
01:12:52,402 --> 01:12:55,906
You're standing pretty close...

435
01:12:56,072 --> 01:12:57,782
...Gant.

436
01:13:00,035 --> 01:13:03,872
What if I decided to lift my foot right now?

437
01:13:05,165 --> 01:13:11,171
I guarantee you won't walk away
from this one.

438
01:13:14,341 --> 01:13:16,259
Run!

439
01:13:45,705 --> 01:13:49,793
-Make sure he's dead.
-Yes, sir.

440
01:15:49,579 --> 01:15:53,500
-Ross.
-Sever.

441
01:17:37,354 --> 01:17:39,022
Just like old times.

442
01:17:48,865 --> 01:17:53,036
One big happy family.
Right, Sever?

443
01:19:21,291 --> 01:19:23,793
Hello, my love.

444
01:19:26,671 --> 01:19:28,256
-Robert.
-Are you okay?

445
01:19:28,465 --> 01:19:31,760
-What do you want?
-I've come for my family.

446
01:19:31,968 --> 01:19:36,765
-Just stay away from us, okay?
-Why would I ever stay away from you?

447
01:19:39,184 --> 01:19:40,769
Are you okay, Michael?

448
01:19:41,394 --> 01:19:44,231
Have you been taking care of Mommy?

449
01:19:45,065 --> 01:19:46,358
Yes.

450
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:48,443
Look at this.

451
01:19:51,154 --> 01:19:54,783
-Look what I got for you.
-What are you doing?

452
01:19:56,076 --> 01:19:59,746
-Give me your hand.
-Robert, no.

453
01:19:59,913 --> 01:20:01,915
Gant.

454
01:20:06,169 --> 01:20:07,754
You're still here.

455
01:20:08,797 --> 01:20:11,383
He was about to do something
to Michael.

456
01:20:11,591 --> 01:20:14,845
No. It was never about Michael.

457
01:20:15,387 --> 01:20:19,266
-Of course it's about Michael.
-What are you talking about?

458
01:20:19,432 --> 01:20:24,855
A piece of hardware Gant wants.

459
01:20:25,313 --> 01:20:27,816
He stole it in Berlin.

460
01:20:28,733 --> 01:20:31,862
Used Michael to carry it
across the border.

461
01:20:32,487 --> 01:20:35,365
You used my son?

462
01:20:35,574 --> 01:20:38,493
You sick son of a bitch.

463
01:20:44,332 --> 01:20:46,501
Come here, Michael.

464
01:20:47,252 --> 01:20:49,504
It's okay.

465
01:20:53,550 --> 01:20:55,844
Give me your hand.

466
01:20:58,597 --> 01:21:00,682
That's a good boy.

467
01:21:10,192 --> 01:21:13,612
It's not here.

468
01:21:15,363 --> 01:21:17,157
Come here, sweetie.

469
01:21:17,616 --> 01:21:19,075
Where is it?

470
01:21:21,786 --> 01:21:23,371
Where is it?

471
01:21:24,706 --> 01:21:26,791
Ask her.

472
01:21:41,223 --> 01:21:43,767
She's gonna kill you.

473
01:21:45,936 --> 01:21:47,187
Good luck.

474
01:22:15,423 --> 01:22:19,344
All that training.
Is that the best you can do?

475
01:22:20,470 --> 01:22:21,972
No.

476
01:22:23,265 --> 01:22:25,225
This is.

477
01:23:09,603 --> 01:23:13,482
-Let's go, let's go. Move it.
-Get that fire knocked down!

478
01:23:42,052 --> 01:23:45,013
They weren't kidding about you.

479
01:23:46,264 --> 01:23:48,141
I can't take credit for this.

480
01:23:48,308 --> 01:23:50,685
Where's our mysterious killer?

481
01:23:50,852 --> 01:23:54,064
-She's not a killer.
-Then what is she?

482
01:23:54,231 --> 01:23:56,441
A mother.

483
01:23:56,608 --> 01:23:58,568
Okay, then where is she?

484
01:24:37,232 --> 01:24:39,151
Thank you.

485
01:24:41,611 --> 01:24:44,447
Take care of your family.

486
01:24:49,661 --> 01:24:51,872
I will.
