1
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:46,087
Oh, something's
back there.

2
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,717
Oh.

3
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:51,187
Oh.

4
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:52,925
You got one, too.

5
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:54,296
Oh! Thanks.

6
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,857
You're welcome.

7
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,026
Oh.

8
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:35,239
Nice outfit. I meant
to tell you back there.

9
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:37,367
Thanks.
Yours, too.

10
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:39,568
They think I'm crazy

11
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:40,908
to get this
for flying.

12
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,813
Me too. Shows
what they know.

13
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:45,373
Yeah. It's
all about taste.

14
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,078
I'm Dawn.

15
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:48,450
Dee.

16
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:51,615
Cool. Dawn-Dee. That's so cute.

17
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:52,953
I guess so.

18
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:55,794
Shall we
take this baby up?

19
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,454
Sounds good to me.

20
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:04,926
So what's next?

21
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:09,964
Uh. We start the engine and
we take off into the sky.

22
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,511
Okay. They make it sound so easy.

23
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:14,671
That's how they
explained it to me.

24
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:17,375
Oh-uh, tell me if I'm
doing something wrong.

25
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,180
Okay. But I'm sure you'll know first.

26
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:21,811
I'll just pay
close attention.

27
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:25,153
Wow, I feel like I'm
at Driver's Ed again.

28
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,424
Hey, great
office supplies!

29
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:29,518
Oh, thanks.

30
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,256
That's a cute pen.
Alright!

31
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,593
I want to take
some notes.

32
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,259
Okay. Alright. So, seatbelt, check.

33
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,803
Mirrors?

34
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:42,269
Don't see any.
Um. Blinkers?

35
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,868
Headlights?

36
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:50,814
I'm just gonna get my book
out. Okay. Um. Alright.

37
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:53,078
Well, I turn on
the master switch,

38
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:55,416
then the ignition?

39
00:05:57,957 --> 00:05:59,822
Okay.
Push the throttle.

40
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:04,922
We're flying!

41
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:06,624
Turn! Turn!

42
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,132
I did it!

43
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,668
I can't believe it.

44
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,037
Okay. Miss St. Dom

45
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,635
and Miss Dee Twiddle.

46
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,539
We're gonna be flying
over some incredible sce-

47
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:27,017
Amazing? Incredible scenery.

48
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,985
No!

49
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,754
Ladies!

50
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:38,558
Ladies, stop the plane.

51
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,565
Ladies! Ladies! Uh! Oh!

52
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:52,908
Stop the plane!

53
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,840
Alright, here we go!

54
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,783
Up, up and today!

55
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:08,053
Oh- Oh, God!

56
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,570
What's
wrong, Frank?

57
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:28,808
Bernie's lost his mind. He
took off without clearance.

58
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:29,973
Bernie?

59
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,209
That'd
be a first.

60
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,219
What the hell
is he thinking?

61
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,254
You can ask
him yourself.

62
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:50,525
Oh my God.

63
00:07:58,277 --> 00:07:59,904
They took the plane.

64
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,310
Who took the plane?

65
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,371
Two blondes.
Blondes.

66
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:04,507
Blondes.

67
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,420
Blondes?

68
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,957
Oh my God.

69
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,027
We're flying!

70
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:19,894
I can't believe it!

71
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,161
Do you always get this
excited when you fly?

72
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,032
Yeah. Don't you?

73
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:25,730
Sure.

74
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,432
So when did
you start flying?

75
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,101
Well, today's
my first lesson.

76
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,269
Really? Me, too.

77
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:34,470
Oh, that's funny.

78
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,621
Sean Bromley
steps up to the tee,

79
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,748
he's an amateur in
this Pro Am Tournament,

80
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,292
and as
you might see,

81
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,261
a par here could tie him for the day.

82
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,193
Oh my God!
We're gonna crash!

83
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,835
Look at that!
What a shot!

84
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:01,305
Right for the pin.

85
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,741
A hole in one?
Could it be?

86
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:10,008
That's pretty
freaking low.

87
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:12,948
Do something!

88
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,384
What?

89
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:15,477
Turn it off!

90
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,223
We're gonna crash!

91
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,024
Run for your life!

92
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,297
Look out!

93
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:34,195
Oh,

94
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:38,175
Oh!

95
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:43,745
Ladies and gentlemen,

96
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:47,308
the airplane has
just made a hole in one.

97
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,593
We're going up to the plane right now

98
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,689
there are two
people inside,

99
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:01,755
They're okay!

100
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,028
There are two women

101
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,592
who just came
out of the plane.

102
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,001
They seem to be okay.

103
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,063
We come in peace.

104
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,199
They're blond.

105
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,037
Is there
a lawyer in here?

106
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,410
Uh, I'm a lawyer!

107
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:16,539
Yeah, me too.

108
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,708
I'm a lawyer.

109
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,250
I'm a litigation attorney.

110
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:21,309
Yeah, right here.

111
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,895
So,

112
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:40,029
the bastard's
living in Vancouver.

113
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,664
Can you
believe the nerve?

114
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:44,232
Took an add out
using his real name.

115
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,835
"The Beaver
Patch Lounge. "

116
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:49,437
Seems like old Louie
hasn't changed a bit.

117
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:52,916
But the Witness Protection Program
don't know nothing about this.

118
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,453
They will soon enough.

119
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:57,751
Let me take
him out, boss.

120
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,951
It would give
me great pleasure.

121
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:03,325
No.

122
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:06,888
We need someone
to move undetected.

123
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:10,493
Too many FBl
protecting him.

124
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:14,596
In and out, in
the blink of an eye.

125
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,972
The Cat's eye.

126
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,203
The Cat?

127
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:21,440
Who better
to kill a rat?

128
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,482
The perfect assassin.

129
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:27,576
Still completely
unknown even by me.

130
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:33,455
A mastermind killer with an IQ
off the scale of normal humans.

131
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,518
She's never failed.

132
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:40,622
Even her victims haven't
seen her. A ghost.

133
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,362
She's not completely unknown
we know she's a woman-

134
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:46,633
Don't interrupt me! Who's the
freaking Godfather here, huh?

135
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,934
I'm sorry, boss.

136
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,771
Alright.

137
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:52,868
A ghost,

138
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:55,470
that never
leaves a trace.

139
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,711
Send half the kill
money to her contact.

140
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:00,342
If she nails
this one,

141
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:03,820
we'll let her take out
the infamous Mr. Wong.

142
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,616
Looks like I got
another job, Kit.

143
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,661
Woo Hoo,
party time!

144
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:44,059
The Godfather
wants me

145
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,222
to take out
Lou Rimoli

146
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:46,696
at the Beaver
Patch Lounge.

147
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,233
I thought
you were retiring.

148
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,461
Let me take this one.
You have enough kills.

149
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:52,060
I have to do
this last one, Kit.

150
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,436
A final favor
for the Godfather.

151
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:57,943
Besides, doing Lou
Rimoli will be a pleasure.

152
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,773
I promise,

153
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:02,814
after this one I'll turn
the claw over to you.

154
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:04,611
Meow.

155
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:06,878
I love you.

156
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:22,291
For driving
without a license.

157
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:25,132
Pay a $100 fine and we don't
even have to show up in court.

158
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,229
Aw, those cops
are so sweet.

159
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,898
I know, they
were cute, too.

160
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,100
I know.

161
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:34,112
Look at John Daley.
I mean, please!

162
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,616
Come on, look around.
Check all this out.

163
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:42,518
250,000 tons of snow.

164
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,749
All for me.
For my vision.

165
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,223
For my picture.

166
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:49,227
When I say "Jump" the
studio says "How high"?

167
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:50,922
Hey!

168
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,562
Oh!

169
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:58,069
All right! Let's shoot this
thing before the snow melts.

170
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:00,037
Where's my
megaphone guy?

171
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:04,666
Too slow!

172
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:05,971
You're fired!

173
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,013
Get me a new
megaphone guy.

174
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,174
What are
we listening to?

175
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,911
Oh, that's The Sound of Music.

176
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,452
Oh, cool.

177
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,579
What's the
music called?

178
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:18,680
Move! Hey!

179
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:22,625
Nobody yells "move" on my set.
I'll tell you when to move.

180
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,155
Move!

181
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,630
Oh!

182
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,500
Are you okay?

183
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:39,809
Those jerks!

184
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,109
Who were those
crazy blondes?

185
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:43,671
Are they trying
to get killed?

186
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:46,183
Didn't they see there
were no crosswalks? Jeez.

187
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:47,583
God! Stupid
Hill Piggies.

188
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,177
They'd better not
have scratched my car.

189
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,347
I know.

190
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:52,515
Are you okay?

191
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:53,853
I think so.

192
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:55,018
Are you okay?

193
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:57,028
Uh, I
think so, too.

194
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,030
What a day.

195
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,395
Take a left here
and then two rights.

196
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:08,304
Wait, no. I'm sorry. T ake a
right here and then two lefts.

197
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:11,639
Wait. Can you
say that again?

198
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,144
Um, I don't think so.

199
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,859
Hey, are we
going in circles?

200
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,866
No, don't be silly.

201
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,300
Go left. Okay,
turn left and just

202
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:38,529
Here we go!

203
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,662
Wait, sharp right.

204
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:41,000
Woo! I'm dizzy!

205
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:43,064
Beep! We're here!

206
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:49,113
Oh! I'm in this one.

207
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:00,752
How long have
you lived here?

208
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:01,850
Nine months.

209
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,053
How about you?

210
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,494
Not nearly that
long. About a year.

211
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:08,158
Oh. Hey, you wanna come see Virgil?

212
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:09,257
Is he cute?

213
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:10,359
He's really cute.

214
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:11,460
Sure!

215
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:14,696
It's so cold.

216
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:23,047
Are you a magician?

217
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:24,673
No, it always
does that.

218
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,217
Really?
Can I try?

219
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:27,183
Sure.

220
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,123
I love it! Wow!

221
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,560
I got to see him.

222
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:39,995
Virgil.
Virgil.

223
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:41,896
Virgil's your dog?

224
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,162
No, Virgil's
not a dog.

225
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:47,137
Oh, there he is. Virgil's a turtle.

226
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:48,571
Oh, Virgil.

227
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,006
It'll take 'em over
a minute to get here.

228
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,203
He's the one to win
the race, right Virgil?

229
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:56,304
Oh, Virgil. I don't think
you're gonna win many races.

230
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:59,681
Well, just a
figure of speech.

231
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,947
Baby, come
to mama.

232
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:06,014
Come here, baby.
He likes to kiss me.

233
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:09,026
He's so cute. Virgil.

234
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:11,392
Are we?

235
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:15,126
Go back under there.
There you go. Don't toot.

236
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:17,427
What was that?

237
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,266
He has a little
gas problem.

238
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:20,464
Oh, okay.

239
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,268
I got him from
a turtle orphanage.

240
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,831
Really?
They have them?

241
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:25,376
Not enough.
That's my dream.

242
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,378
I want to have my own turtle orphanage.

243
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,414
And I want to dance
in a Broadway play.

244
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:30,846
That's nice.

245
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,474
What's your dream?

246
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,782
My dream is to marry
the man of my dreams.

247
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:37,219
Who is he?

248
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:43,290
I'll show you.

249
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:45,193
Wait 'till you see him.

250
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:50,462
Oh, that's
what that's for.

251
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,163
Yeah. DVDs.

252
00:17:57,042 --> 00:18:01,945
At Superfly, our destinations
are your dream vacations.

253
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:03,743
So come fly
high with us.

254
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,477
Isn't he dreamy?

255
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:06,711
Yeah, he's cute.

256
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:08,082
Can you help
me land him?

257
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:09,552
Of course
you can land him.

258
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:10,815
Really?

259
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:12,618
I mean, you have
beauty and looks.

260
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:13,783
You can't lose.

261
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,486
Oh, thank you.

262
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:19,122
So, where are you dancing? I'd
love to come see you some time.

263
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,792
Oh, well, I'm kinda
between jobs right now.

264
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,334
Oh, me too.

265
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:25,199
Yeah, I got
fired for typos.

266
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,329
What are typos?

267
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:28,964
I have no idea.

268
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,441
I was working
at a talent agency,

269
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:36,004
you know, a receptionist
and secretarial stuff,

270
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:40,484
and I have to admit,
I'm not much of a typist.

271
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:43,419
Ah! Sh.

272
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:49,416
I love White-O.

273
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:52,623
Mr. Lean, there's something
wrong with the computer.

274
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:56,634
What, what, what?

275
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:03,203
Oh, my-

276
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:07,871
Get out! Now!

277
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:09,641
Well,

278
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:13,378
I've been working on a little
Busby Berkeley, Gene Kelley number.

279
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:17,047
Oh, here. Sorry about
that. Ta-ta-ra-ra.

280
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:20,148
Ta-ta-ra-ra.

281
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:23,023
Oh! Oh!

282
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,226
Ta-ra-ta.

283
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:28,266
Oh!

284
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:33,660
T a-ta-ra-ra.
Like this. Like that.

285
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,172
Whew!

286
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,732
I always do that. And
then, it's a big fat, oh!

287
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:44,305
Jeez. And then
it's a big Ta-ra!

288
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:45,407
Oh! Ow!

289
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:46,508
Wow!

290
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:47,643
Ow!

291
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,414
Oh!

292
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:50,955
That's it.

293
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,388
That's so good!

294
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:57,053
Wow! My God, you're
a really good dancer.

295
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,563
You came up with all
those moves yourself?

296
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:01,428
Uh-huh. Well,
I had inspirations.

297
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,990
You're really good.

298
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:05,536
Thank you. Want to give
it a try? Give it a try.

299
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:09,540
Oh, God, no. That's a hard act
to follow, I couldn't do that.

300
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:12,907
You can, I will talk you
through it. Okay? Yeah, do it.

301
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:14,377
Okay.

302
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:15,879
I'll start the
music again.

303
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:17,415
Okay. Hey.

304
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:19,074
Start with
the kicks.

305
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:22,120
Oh, shit. Well, sorry. Just, just, um.

306
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:25,384
Okay. And a one,
and a two and a three.

307
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:29,894
Flashdance! Flashdance! And perfect, oh!

308
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:33,227
Now one, two,
kick, kick those legs!

309
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,232
Kick it!

310
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:38,662
Oh my God.

311
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:42,468
Look at you.
You're so good.

312
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,133
Big finish!
Big finish!

313
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:45,233
Big finish?

314
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,039
Okay, big finish.
Big finish!

315
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:53,082
Jazz hands.

316
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:54,743
Jazz hands.

317
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,311
That's so good.

318
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:58,378
You are a natural.

319
00:20:58,457 --> 00:20:59,617
"Natural", my ass.

320
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,386
I didn't train in
8 years for that.

321
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,087
A lot of good
it did me.

322
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:06,426
Because, how many jobs really
ask you to do the splits? Zippo.

323
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:07,965
Were you a dancer?

324
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:11,002
Gymnast. I tried out for
the National Park Olympics,

325
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:12,297
I placed 90th.

326
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:14,066
What happened?

327
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:17,006
Discovered boys. It was a lot more fun.

328
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:19,441
Because the guys really
do dig my backbends,

329
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,604
so maybe it wasn't
a total waste.

330
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,275
A waste? With your talent,
honey, you're gonna make us stars!

331
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,079
Oh my God.

332
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:29,746
At last!

333
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:32,551
The first thing we do
is build up your resume.

334
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,558
We do that by
getting your first gig.

335
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,116
Oh, look at this!

336
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:39,425
"Looking for dancers
at the Beaver Patch Lounge"

337
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,432
That sounds like
a nice family show.

338
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,627
Y eah, with animals.

339
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:44,896
Like Doctor Doolittle.

340
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,597
Yeah.

341
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:49,140
You're going for this
audition and you'll get it.

342
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:50,731
With me,
you can't lose.

343
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,071
You think?

344
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,305
You know what they
say, "Great minds do. "

345
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:56,609
That's right.
I'm so excited.

346
00:21:56,682 --> 00:22:00,277
"Beaver Patch Lounge" that
sounds like a great place to work.

347
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,376
Alright.

348
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:07,224
While transporting an alleged
perpetrator in the car,

349
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:10,750
someone passed
some very nasty gas.

350
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:14,390
And you denied being the guilty
party and blamed the suspect,

351
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:18,266
Agent Campbell,
was it not in fact you,

352
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,202
who cut the cheese?

353
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:21,705
No.

354
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:25,509
Ha!

355
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:26,669
Damn!

356
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:29,339
This machine is good.

357
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:33,646
Alright, alright. It
- it's my turn now. It's my turn. Okay.

358
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:37,780
Last fall, someone
stole a donut,

359
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:41,121
off of my desk.
They took a bite,

360
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,353
and they put it back.

361
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:46,761
Was that in fact you,
Agent Gardenia?

362
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,629
No.

363
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,225
He, he.

364
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:53,100
Aw.

365
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:57,164
Okay, thi- this machine
has got to be wacko.

366
00:22:57,242 --> 00:23:00,734
Let's do one more round,
I'll give you, uh, uh,

367
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:02,040
five to one
odds on this.

368
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:03,138
Hey.

369
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,910
I got a new job
for you guys.

370
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:06,848
What's up,
boss?

371
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:09,443
Rimoli blew his cover
as protected witness.

372
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:12,581
He's running a joint called
"The Beaver Patch Lounge. "

373
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:16,525
Until I can convince him to take
on a new identity and relocate,

374
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:19,689
I want you two to shadow him.
Make sure nobody wacks him.

375
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:23,223
Leave it to us, boss. No one will
get near him with us watching.

376
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:28,401
For the past
several months

377
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:31,271
somebody's been writing
unflattering things about me

378
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:32,537
in the
bathroom stalls.

379
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:33,635
Really?

380
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:35,009
Now, would
that be you?

381
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,342
Or you?

382
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,975
Me? No. I- I-
can assure you, sir,

383
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,075
that we- we would
never do such a thing.

384
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:43,553
We're professionals.
That's out of character.

385
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:46,489
I can assure you we would
never do such a thing.

386
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:49,083
These machines, look,
they're so unreliable

387
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:51,061
that- that
we're calibrating.

388
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:52,596
Just get out
of my sight

389
00:23:52,664 --> 00:24:00,093
before I hook up your family
jewels to those things.

390
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,709
Damn. I don't
believe it.

391
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:22,085
That's a very tasty act
you got there, my dear.

392
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,752
Thank you.

393
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,469
What the hell are you
doing? I'm in an audition.

394
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:36,006
What am I doing?
Have you seen this ad?

395
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:37,439
Is the audition over?

396
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,136
No. Stay
upside down.

397
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,211
You interrupt my fun
to show me my ad?

398
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:48,377
You wrote this in the paper?
You used your real name.

399
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:53,117
No shit. The name Louie Rimoli used
to mean something in some places.

400
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:54,590
In powerful
organizations

401
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,718
it means "Kill with
extreme prejudice. "

402
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:59,821
That was a long time ago.
They've probably forgotten.

403
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:01,263
Yeah, yeah.
Louie,

404
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,096
Louie, these
people don't forget.

405
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,098
Oh, okay.
You're hired.

406
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:11,637
Send in the next girl.
So I can finish my lunch.

407
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:30,584
You know
I didn't join the Agency

408
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:32,926
to protect the
scum of the earth.

409
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:35,125
Reformed scum
of the earth.

410
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,192
That's what the Witness
Protection Program is all about.

411
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,465
Look over there.

412
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,972
Tell me
what's reformed.

413
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,065
We're here to
protect Louie Rimoli.

414
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:46,838
Can't judge a book by
it's cover, Agent Campbell.

415
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:49,813
This book should have been
judged a long time ago.

416
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,849
My mother was right.

417
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:53,851
I should have been
a bible salesman.

418
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:57,979
What?

419
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,216
Bibles.

420
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:00,622
No way.

421
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:02,159
Way.

422
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,788
Well, whatever floats
your boat, I guess.

423
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:07,559
I thought you
were a Buddhist.

424
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:22,046
What are we doing here, Swan?
We can get in big shit for this.

425
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:23,705
This is
The Cat's job.

426
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:26,910
Don't worry, Leo, You're gonna
give yourself a heart attack.

427
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:29,545
We won't
interfere, you know.

428
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:32,749
Just wanna put a face to
the reputation. That's all.

429
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:34,917
Nobody knows
what she looks like.

430
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:38,087
Ah, that's why we're here.
Okay? Now, keep your eyes peeled.

431
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:40,563
One of these women
coming in or going out

432
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:42,259
is the infamous Cat.

433
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:46,302
You're next, doll face.

434
00:26:57,716 --> 00:27:00,375
Hi.

435
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,919
We're here
for the audition.

436
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:04,316
Aren't
we all.

437
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:11,320
It amazes me the lengths people
go to to get these auditions.

438
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:12,727
I know.

439
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,492
I like
your shorts.

440
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:16,534
Are those
real nylon?

441
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,936
Oh, excuse me, do you guys
know what the show's about?

442
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:23,065
About?

443
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,768
Yeah.

444
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:30,579
Yeah. The plot. The
driving force if you will.

445
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,118
Oh! Oh,
the driving force?

446
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:36,745
Yeah, it's about producing erections.

447
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,345
Oh.

448
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:41,683
It's a musical
about architecture.

449
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,785
That's unusual, right?

450
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:46,023
No, not really.

451
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:48,588
Producing. Cool!

452
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,601
Mmm.

453
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,942
So, uh, what've
you got for me?

454
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:02,703
Surprise
of a lifetime.

455
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:03,975
Uh-huh?

456
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:09,376
It's nice.

457
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:12,150
You got another
surprise for me?

458
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,173
You like this?

459
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:32,970
Oh!

460
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:42,352
Ah! Just give uncle
Louie a taste maybe, huh?

461
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:46,049
You know what? Time
is money. Come with me.

462
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,254
Come on, show
me what you got.

463
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:55,026
There's an idea.

464
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:05,503
The Godfather
says goodbye.

465
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,704
Can I help
you girls

466
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:09,007
Mr. Ravioli?

467
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,843
Uh, no, he's inside. I'm Manny,

468
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,383
the Talent Manager.
What's your act?

469
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:14,577
We're a new team.

470
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:15,676
Together?

471
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,812
Yeah.

472
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:18,355
Well that I
would like to see.

473
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,119
We're excited about
producing your erections.

474
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:22,784
Good one.

475
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:25,295
Are you gonna
watch us, too?

476
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:27,092
It's tempting.
Tempting,

477
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:29,861
but, uh, Louie prefers to
do his business one on one,

478
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:33,392
but I'm sure he wouldn't object to a
two on one, if you know what I mean.

479
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:35,098
Ha.

480
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:51,754
Hi, Mr. Ravioli. I'm Dee
and this is my partner Dawn.

481
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:53,723
We're here to audition for your show.

482
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,590
No, no! Don't say a
word. Don't say anything.

483
00:29:57,662 --> 00:30:00,563
Just relax, sit there, have
a drink, smoke your cigar,

484
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,224
and enjoy the show.

485
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,358
Ready Freddie?

486
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:07,198
You're gonna
like this.

487
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:08,762
I think
he's interested.

488
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,671
I'm really good
at reading people.

489
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:11,936
Definitely.

490
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,034
You ready, Dee?

491
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:14,169
Yeah.

492
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:15,303
Six, seven, eight,

493
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,280
One, two, three, four.

494
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:18,872
Six, seven, eight.

495
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,145
Sorry.

496
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:23,981
Starfish!

497
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:25,818
Starfish!
Starfish!

498
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:29,817
Big finish!

499
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:30,918
Oh, big finish.

500
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,019
Big finish.

501
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:33,154
Jazz hands!

502
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:35,131
Mr. Ravioli.

503
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,292
Oh!

504
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:37,391
You killed him!

505
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:38,560
I killed him?

506
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:39,898
You threw a
stick at him.

507
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:41,666
Now he's never
gonna give us a job.

508
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:43,001
Oh my God,
you're right.

509
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:44,336
Oh, no.

510
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:46,343
I know we didn't kill' em. Maybe he's,

511
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:49,903
maybe he had a heart attack from
watching our crazy moves. It happens.

512
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:51,471
Give him the
hammock remover.

513
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:52,641
The hammock remover?

514
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:56,011
Oh!

515
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:57,918
Um, okay.

516
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:04,521
Oh, oh! His piece of
hair! Oh my God. oh!

517
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:07,030
Someone's here.

518
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:08,759
Hey.

519
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:12,064
I'll come back later.

520
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:15,503
Wow, some guys get to have all the fun.

521
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:18,366
What are we gonna do?

522
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:21,712
Just leave him
alone there.

523
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:23,713
Let's leave discreetly.

524
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:27,341
Oh my God!
Oh!

525
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:29,352
He's on fire!
Oh my God!

526
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:31,946
Oh!

527
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:33,581
Oh, no! What
have you done?

528
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:35,285
Oh God!

529
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,352
Hurry up!
Move it!

530
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:43,959
Oh my God.

531
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:52,400
Them?

532
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:54,138
No.

533
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:58,342
The Cat works alone. Besides,
those outfits are way too flashy.

534
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:01,715
A good assassin keeps
a very low profile, Leo.

535
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:04,254
You'd better
remember that.

536
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:07,155
Help! Help! Somebody!
Anybody! There's been a murder!

537
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:10,661
Murder! Help!
Murder! Help!

538
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:11,820
Oh, crap!

539
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:14,729
Then again.

540
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,735
Come here! There's been a
murder! Come on in! Come here!

541
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:22,102
Somebody help me!
My boss has been murdered!

542
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:24,937
Louie's been murdered.

543
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:32,244
I thought you said it wasn't them.

544
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:34,410
That's just what she wants you to think,

545
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:37,579
expecting to work alone,
she brings somebody along.

546
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:39,714
instead of blending in, she stands out.

547
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,315
She's brilliant!

548
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:43,257
The Godfather's
gonna want this Cat,

549
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:47,128
or kitties, if you will, to
take out Mr. Wong for sure.

550
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:51,661
I warned him, but
he wouldn't listen.

551
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:54,034
I should've guessed
they'd use The Cat.

552
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:56,369
So you think this was
the work of The Cat?

553
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:58,705
Oh yeah,
without a doubt.

554
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:00,437
They were
professionals.

555
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:02,809
They even invited me
in to watch them do it.

556
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,508
Oh my God, I could've been killed, too.

557
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:08,143
Now wait,
you said "they"?

558
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:10,653
Yeah, there
were two of them.

559
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:13,452
And we got them on
the surveillance tape.

560
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:17,221
Good. Good.

561
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:20,287
She's become brazen
and taken on a partner.

562
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:21,730
Oh! Oh!

563
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:23,027
All things considered,

564
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:25,069
I think the audition
went really well.

565
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:26,160
It did.
Didn't it?

566
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:27,397
It did.

567
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:29,531
Well, what are
we gonna do?

568
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:30,665
Oh!

569
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:31,766
Okay, we
leave town.

570
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:32,935
Let's get
out of here.

571
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,171
Pack whatever
you can,

572
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:35,507
let's get
out of here.

573
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,775
No, we're innocent.
Let's go on a vacation.

574
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:38,816
We're going to die.

575
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:41,415
Someone's
at the door.

576
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:44,182
Oh! Okay.

577
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:46,155
Oh my God!

578
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:48,658
Grab something hard.

579
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:50,626
We're not home
right now.

580
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,959
Leave a message
after the beep.

581
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,591
Here's the
beep. "Beep. "

582
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:57,099
Good one.

583
00:33:57,168 --> 00:34:01,537
Hello. Yeah. Oh my God. It's Warren,

584
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:02,937
What?

585
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:04,702
You know how they killed Louie?

586
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:06,607
They burned his friggen head off.

587
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:08,042
What?

588
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:10,672
They burned his friggen head off!

589
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:11,806
Holy shit.

590
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:15,982
Hello,

591
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,955
we're friends, ladies, uh,
we're here to offer you a job.

592
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:21,491
Oh, job. I could
really use a job.

593
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,322
So could I.

594
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,255
May we come in?

595
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:29,356
Sure.

596
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:33,997
So we were
thinking, oh.

597
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:38,865
We work for
Mr. Capella, uh,

598
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:41,343
there's no
need for violence.

599
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,401
Oh!

600
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,641
I'll be the
judge of that.

601
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:45,841
Are you
guys agents?

602
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,976
No, no, no,

603
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:50,486
uh, we work for Mr.
Capella, I swear to God.

604
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:52,352
I think I've actually heard of him.

605
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,720
He runs a
big firm, right?

606
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:55,782
Yeah, that's it.

607
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,954
A big firm, probably
one of the biggest.

608
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,726
So the rumors are true,
you've taken on a new partner?

609
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:04,097
Wow, you know,
word travels fast.

610
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:05,533
I just booked
you in today.

611
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,400
I know.

612
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:11,499
We won't waste any of your time.
Let's get right to our point of view.

613
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:13,237
We're listening.

614
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:17,839
There's a guy. He lives in Niagara
Falls. His name is Hang Wong.

615
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:21,851
We want you
to take him out.

616
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:23,386
Take him out?

617
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,183
I don't even
know 'em.

618
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:29,920
We're willing to pay big bucks.
Say a quarter of a million dollars?

619
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:31,621
Wait a second.

620
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:34,426
You're want me to take
this guy out for $25,000?

621
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:38,526
Just take him out?

622
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:41,037
250,000 dollars.

623
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:43,403
Wow. Is that more?

624
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,101
I think so.

625
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:48,145
Half now and half when you're finished.

626
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:49,702
Why me?

627
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:53,477
Why you? 'Cause you're
the best, you know?

628
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:56,952
For that kind of money I'll take
him out, take him in or all out.

629
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:58,318
I know you
guys are great,

630
00:35:58,389 --> 00:35:59,481
but it's not
that easy

631
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:00,956
this guy's
well protected.

632
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:04,552
Ah, doting mom. Don't
worry, I know the type.

633
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:08,121
Well, don't worry. I've taken out
tons and tons of guys. Lots of guys.

634
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:11,794
I've taken out doctors, lawyers, actors,

635
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:14,235
musicians,

636
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:17,172
and don't even get me started
with the high school boys.

637
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:19,573
Oh, woo wee!

638
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:22,442
High school? You were taking
out people in high school?

639
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,038
Oh yeah, only
the ones I liked.

640
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:26,913
Wait, have you
ever done any girls?

641
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:29,316
Once. I just wanted to
see what it felt like.

642
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:30,684
Me, too.

643
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:32,017
Really?

644
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:35,425
Wait, we don't have
to do this do we?

645
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:39,520
Listen, I don't care what you do to
the guy just get the job done, okay?

646
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:42,896
Well, when is
he expecting us?

647
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:45,993
He's not. But the
sooner the better, okay?

648
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,095
I think it fits
into our schedule.

649
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:49,639
Okay, we'll do it.

650
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:53,973
Okay, deal. Alright,
here's the, uh,

651
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,205
show of good faith.

652
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:59,311
Oh my God.

653
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,214
Pleasure doing
business with you.

654
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:02,809
It's American.

655
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,149
Woo! Woo!

656
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,520
We're going
to Niagara Falls!

657
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:07,888
Woo!

658
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,902
How'd it go?

659
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:29,537
Piece of cake.

660
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:32,879
Couldn't bring yourself to
turn down one last slice, huh?

661
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,349
What are you
talking about?

662
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,283
Oh, come on. It's
all over the street.

663
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:38,982
You agreed to take out
Mr. Wong in Niagara Falls.

664
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:40,819
You told me I'd
get the next one.

665
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:42,153
Wait,

666
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:45,627
someone hired The Cat
to hit Mr. Wong? Who?

667
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:47,994
Like you don't know.

668
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:50,761
The Godfather, for
a quarter of a million.

669
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:53,065
Well, well, well,

670
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:56,595
someone finally decided
to step on my paws.

671
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:59,472
Fatal mistake.

672
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:02,034
Are you saying someone
is pretending to be you?

673
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:06,106
Someone's about to
get scratched. Badly.

674
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:07,548
I'm coming with you.

675
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,882
Tell you what,
kitten, this time,

676
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,081
you get to
do the honors.

677
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:14,954
I'm in.
Meow.

678
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:16,824
Have you seen
these two women?

679
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:18,054
Yeah, I
remember 'em.

680
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,221
Two dumb blondes,

681
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,992
they came in
early this morning.

682
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:23,363
Amazing.
Their cover's flawless.

683
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:26,835
Yeah, they bought a red
Minicooper from the lot. Paid cash.

684
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:29,805
Of course, no credit
card, no paper trail.

685
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:31,273
Continue.

686
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:32,969
That's it. They left their car,

687
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:34,272
said they'd
pick it up,

688
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:36,506
when they returned from Niagara Falls,

689
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:39,606
said they were gonna take
out a Mr. Wong or something.

690
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:41,811
You'll never
see them again.

691
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:43,877
Hey, can I
keep their car?

692
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:45,751
No, I'm sorry,
it's evidence.

693
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,155
They'll probably use it to
run over innocent babies.

694
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:51,160
Can I get out
of the rain now?

695
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:52,855
Oh, please.

696
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,295
Okay.

697
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:55,992
Simply brilliant.

698
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:59,127
They knew we'd have the train
station and airport staked out.

699
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:02,036
But, we didn't.

700
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:04,768
Well, we should have.

701
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,810
Smart Mr. Wong.

702
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:10,779
Looks like they're celebrating another
notch in their kill pole, Campbell.

703
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:14,875
Run up all available agents.
We're goin to Niagara Falls.

704
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,496
Boss, we
need to talk.

705
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:34,265
So talk.

706
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:36,067
Uh,

707
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,870
We did like you said. We
delivered the money to The Cat.

708
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:41,343
And?

709
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:44,210
She's not working
alone anymore, boss,

710
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:46,841
She's hired on
another assassin.

711
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:50,478
They torched Guido at The
Beaver Patch pretty bad.

712
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:53,114
Burned his
whole head off.

713
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,384
They're bad
to the bone, boss.

714
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,119
Yeah, he's right,

715
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:59,026
if we didn't stand our ground
when delivering the money,

716
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:00,461
we wouldn't
be here now.

717
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:02,192
They were drooling
at the mouth.

718
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:05,360
They were crazed with blood lust
from the hit on Louie Rimoli.

719
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:09,532
They were gonna do some fancy
high moves of karate on us,

720
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:11,802
but we stared them
right down their eyes.

721
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:13,605
You would've
been proud of us.

722
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:17,306
Yeah, we looked death right
in the face and we laughed.

723
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:19,975
It's right. They knew
better than to mess with us,

724
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,881
finely tuned
killing machines.

725
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:24,921
What?
An apprentice?

726
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:26,047
Yeah.

727
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:28,284
But The Cat
knows better.

728
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:31,487
Any self-respecting assassin
works alone. This is not good.

729
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:32,586
No.

730
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:33,857
Nope.

731
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,195
She's got
some cojones.

732
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,928
You're
telling me.

733
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:39,492
Does she ever.

734
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,333
Yeah, she
looks good.

735
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:44,169
Boss, what
are cojones?

736
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:45,230
Yeah.

737
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:47,174
Nuts.

738
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:51,706
Teabags?

739
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,613
Oh, she's English.

740
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:55,049
That don't match here.

741
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,211
Nads.

742
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,345
Nothing.

743
00:40:57,421 --> 00:40:59,514
She's got balls,
you idiots!

744
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,524
Oh!

745
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:03,719
Okay, yeah.
Now I get it.

746
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,762
So you're
telling me,

747
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:08,697
the number one assassin in
the whole wide world, The Cat,

748
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:10,427
is a dude?

749
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:13,868
Moron! Don't you know
what a metaphor is?

750
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:16,304
Yeah, of course.

751
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:19,467
Sort of a man trapped
in a woman's body?

752
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:20,805
No.

753
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:22,539
It's when a
chick's got a dink.

754
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:24,137
No, that's-
you're an idiot.

755
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:25,409
No, it's not.

756
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,713
Will you two pea
brains knock it off?

757
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:30,583
Boss, is this metaphor thing contagious?

758
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,349
Never mind,
you idiots.

759
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:34,448
This could be serious.

760
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:45,124
Ah, the book.

761
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:47,261
Ah, here it is.

762
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:51,240
Chapter 9,
Subsection 4.

763
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:54,004
"Under no circumstance may an assassin,

764
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:56,478
"engage an apprentice
for a contracted hit,

765
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:58,708
"without the express
written permission,

766
00:41:58,782 --> 00:42:02,183
of the contractor
of said hit. "

767
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:03,982
Right. You know,

768
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:05,817
when they mention
the contractor,

769
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:07,380
they're talking
about you.

770
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:10,825
Don't you think I know that, Einstein!

771
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:13,090
There are
reasons for rules,

772
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:16,792
and the rules should not
be broken. This is not good.

773
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,357
No.

774
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:20,630
I'll have to send
someone to make sure

775
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,672
that things go
according to planned.

776
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,708
I want Wong wacked!

777
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:28,734
Oh, you know,
we would love to do it,

778
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:31,781
but, I get a bit of migraines
when I travel by air, boss.

779
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:33,908
It's bad. He does. And you know what?

780
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:35,679
I got a couple
of sick days coming.

781
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:38,085
Where the hell
did I find you two?!

782
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:40,817
You're turning a couple
of different shades of hue

783
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,758
you should calm down, you're
blood pressure is going.

784
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:46,660
I've got the solution.

785
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,631
Since you
two tough guys

786
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,225
just finished telling me how you

787
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:54,999
"Faced death" and stared down The Cat,

788
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,140
you can
have the job.

789
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:02,144
You won't get
a migraine driving.

790
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:06,615
And you, can consider
this trip to Niagara Falls

791
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:09,414
your sick days, huh?
Capische? Huh?

792
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:11,454
Boss, I don't
think it's a good idea

793
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:13,387
Enough talk!

794
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:15,254
I've spoken.

795
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:18,489
And unless you two
want something broken,

796
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:20,996
No, no, no. We get it,
boss. We get it, we get it.

797
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:23,533
Swan and I'll follow
'em to Niagara Falls

798
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:26,695
and make sure Wong is
wacked good and proper.

799
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,862
Yes.

800
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,166
So I guess
we'll just-

801
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:30,831
Whew. That's
disgusting!

802
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:32,068
Sorry.

803
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:34,474
You two keep
a low profile.

804
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:37,309
Remember Louie Rimoli was
wacked right under the nose

805
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:39,315
of the Witness
Protection Program.

806
00:43:39,383 --> 00:43:42,546
The Feds are gonna have
their brightest and their best

807
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,417
all over The
Cat's scent.

808
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:45,853
Yes, Godfather.

809
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:46,947
Sir.

810
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,526
You freaking
imbeciles.

811
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:52,425
I can see
the headlines now.

812
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:56,023
Louie the Lip, executed
in broad daylight

813
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:59,069
under the Witness
Protection Program.

814
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:02,003
You know what kind of
putzes we're gonna look like?

815
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:03,198
What's a putz?

816
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:05,104
You're a putz, moron.

817
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:07,075
I think it's
redundant, sir.

818
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:08,975
Aren't they
mutually exclusive?

819
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:10,843
Enough!
Enough.

820
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:12,313
Let's go over
the facts.

821
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:16,616
Okay. At least we have
a lead on the killer now,

822
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:19,087
we can start to turn
around this bad publicity.

823
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,589
It's killers, sir.

824
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:21,682
What?

825
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:24,091
Killers.
Plural, sir.

826
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,890
It's true, sir.

827
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:29,330
Louie the Lip was indeed
taken out by the infamous Cat,

828
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,560
but it gets worse.

829
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:32,499
Now, not only does
she have a new MO

830
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:34,332
but she has a
new partner as well.

831
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:37,966
Well, I think The Cat's
made her first mistake.

832
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:41,273
I won't be long until
the kitten leaves the roost.

833
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,973
Because you can't have
two cats in the same nest.

834
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:45,743
You mean
litter, sir.

835
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:48,785
We're not after
a litterbug, you idiot.

836
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:51,946
Not garbage litter, we're
talking about cat litter.

837
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:55,924
Are you two
geniuses mocking me?

838
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:58,791
Because I'm getting
a very bad vibe here.

839
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,887
Now, maybe we're not on the same page.

840
00:45:00,964 --> 00:45:03,364
Maybe I should put you
back on foot patrol,

841
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:05,902
because you seem kind
of fixated on garbage.

842
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:08,437
Well, there, there
is something else, sir.

843
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:09,802
Yeah, well?

844
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:12,307
Cat and her new partner
went to Niagara Falls

845
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,570
to do another hit.

846
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:15,339
Damn! We gotta stay on top of this.

847
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:17,209
Should we
go after them?

848
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:20,114
No. I want you to stay here
and bust people for littering.

849
00:45:21,585 --> 00:45:23,746
Of course I want you
two knuckleheads to go!

850
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:27,587
You think I'll let them flatfoot from
Niagara Falls steal our lightening?

851
00:45:27,658 --> 00:45:29,319
Thunder, sir.

852
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:32,385
First you mock me about
litter, now about lightening?

853
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:34,021
I should have
you two shot.

854
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:36,862
If you had us shot, it would
be very difficult for us to-

855
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:40,461
It's a figment of speech! You
moron! I'm not gonna shoot you.

856
00:45:40,537 --> 00:45:42,164
Figure of speech, sir.

857
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,434
Get out!

858
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:46,499
Now! Just get The Cat

859
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:49,569
and if you fail I suggest
you stay in Niagara Falls.

860
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:52,513
Do you understand?

861
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:58,377
I can't believe
we bought this car!

862
00:45:58,455 --> 00:45:59,581
I can't either.

863
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:02,318
Oh! Niagara Falls,
here we come!

864
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:04,292
Yeah!

865
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:05,453
Where is it?

866
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:06,723
I don't know.

867
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:08,492
Oh, we'll find it.

868
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:09,930
It can't
be too far.

869
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:27,683
I don't even see them,
are we on the right road?

870
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:30,686
There's only one road,
they've gotta be up there.

871
00:46:30,754 --> 00:46:31,812
Alright.

872
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:34,323
Did you ever have
a dream, Leo?

873
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:37,883
Yeah, it involves you, cement
socks and a fishing trip.

874
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:39,553
What?

875
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,621
Well, I
have a dream.

876
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:46,032
Long time ago, when I clutched
my first protection money,

877
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:48,264
it was a nickle, for
not thumping on a kid.

878
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:50,033
You know how
old I was?

879
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:51,131
40?

880
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:52,232
No, 7.

881
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:53,333
47?

882
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:54,434
No, just 7.

883
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:55,944
Oh.

884
00:46:56,013 --> 00:46:58,504
Yeah, I was a skinny
little thug back then.

885
00:46:58,582 --> 00:47:02,018
I had a big dream. I
wanted to be a Don someday.

886
00:47:02,085 --> 00:47:03,109
A Don?

887
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:04,586
Yeah. A Don.

888
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:07,453
A Don's got it all.
Respect, women, power, money.

889
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:09,082
But your last
name's Keith.

890
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,456
So?

891
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:12,791
So you'd be Don
Keith

892
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:15,229
Sounds like a donkey
with a lisp or something.

893
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:16,766
A friggen what?

894
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:19,200
Your enemies would be
shaking in their boots.

895
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:22,830
Here comes Don Keith.
Hee-haw! Hee-haw!

896
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:25,033
You'd be
laughed outta town!

897
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:26,302
Forget I
mentioned it.

898
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:29,277
No, that's classic.
Hee-haw! Hee-haw!

899
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:32,338
Hee-haw!
Hee-haw! Hee-haw!

900
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:34,441
Alright! Shut up!

901
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:37,419
You're distracting me,
they're gonna see us.

902
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,194
I gotta pee again.

903
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:52,826
Me too.

904
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:56,805
Keep up and don't
let them see us.

905
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,808
Alright, Jeez.

906
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:02,403
Hey, are
we being followed?

907
00:48:02,479 --> 00:48:03,639
No.

908
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,409
Okay.

909
00:48:05,482 --> 00:48:07,416
What do you think
they'd do if they saw us?

910
00:48:07,484 --> 00:48:08,781
Chop our heads off

911
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:10,183
and leave us
in the desert.

912
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:11,915
Why the desert?

913
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:13,513
I saw it on CSl.

914
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:14,614
Oh, I love
that show.

915
00:48:14,691 --> 00:48:16,352
Yeah.

916
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:19,122
Did you see the one where
they put a victim in dog food?

917
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:20,220
What?

918
00:48:20,297 --> 00:48:21,491
It's the best one.

919
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,260
I'd put
you in dog food.

920
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:24,357
What?

921
00:48:24,434 --> 00:48:25,867
Aw, never mind.
Never mind.

922
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:28,131
Do you think they know
where they're goin'?

923
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:30,696
Probably making sure
they're not followed.

924
00:48:30,774 --> 00:48:33,470
Pure genius.

925
00:48:33,543 --> 00:48:35,477
Have you been
to Niagara Falls?

926
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:38,309
No, I saw a movie with
Marylin Monroe called Niagara.

927
00:48:38,448 --> 00:48:40,780
You'd better pull
over at the next stop.

928
00:48:41,118 --> 00:48:42,881
Why?

929
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:44,853
Because I gotta
take a leak.

930
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:48,619
Come on, I just pulled
over two hours ago.

931
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:52,253
Yeah, two hours ago,
when I had a large coffee.

932
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,527
Well, I'm
not stopping.

933
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,433
What am I
supposed to do?

934
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:01,869
Hold it. What
do you think?

935
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:05,033
Hold it? Yeah,
I understand "hold it"

936
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:07,599
but I think my bladder
might have another idea.

937
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:11,478
Ugh, you know, easy
with the bumps. Okay?

938
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:13,846
You're an adult,
control your bladder.

939
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:16,385
It's mind
over matter.

940
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:20,321
Well it ain't working.
Okay? It's not working.

941
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:24,019
Hey, Gardenia, why don't you
try controlling my bladder?

942
00:49:24,094 --> 00:49:25,686
Huh? Excuse me?

943
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:28,492
Yeah, why don't you try
controlling my bladder?

944
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:32,126
Yes, have a nice, long
conversation with my full bladder.

945
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:36,161
You know, you could reason with it
and you can lay some guilt trips on it.

946
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:38,707
Hey, Gardenia!

947
00:49:38,775 --> 00:49:41,608
Aren't you the Sigmund
Freud of bladders?

948
00:49:41,678 --> 00:49:44,306
So that you would know,
you know, how I was feeling

949
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:47,111
so, like, if I were
dreaming about waterfalls,

950
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:50,483
and I'm feeling like I'm about
to explode or something like that,

951
00:49:50,554 --> 00:49:53,751
Alright! Alright! I'll
pull over at the next stop.

952
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,190
Thank you.

953
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:59,319
Just promise me you won't
use that creepy voice.

954
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:00,454
The bladder voice?

955
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:02,293
Yes! Yes!

956
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:05,096
It scares me.

957
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,159
I'm so glad we met.

958
00:50:07,237 --> 00:50:08,670
Me too.

959
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:10,172
I'm so glad
we have a job.

960
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,640
Now we're-
we're more genius.

961
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:14,904
Yeah, you're
no genius.

962
00:50:14,978 --> 00:50:18,846
Just because you took the test
doesn't make you a genius, Leo.

963
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:21,076
I missed by one freaking question.

964
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:25,383
What frequency is a sperm whale's mating
call measured at? I mean, who knows that?

965
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:27,582
47 megahertz,
come on!

966
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:29,090
That was lucky.

967
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:30,956
So I'm a genius.

968
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:34,589
No, you're not a genius,
I'm an almost genius.

969
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:38,896
Whatever. Okay, Leo. Just
don't lose 'em, almost genius.

970
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:43,099
I'm not gonna lose em! Wait
a minute, where did they go?

971
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:44,936
I think we're
getting close.

972
00:50:45,008 --> 00:50:46,999
You think you're
ready for Wong?

973
00:50:47,077 --> 00:50:49,375
How can I not be when it feels so right!

974
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:17,697
We're here!

975
00:51:17,774 --> 00:51:19,639
Oh, I can't wait
to get in there.

976
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,077
Hm.

977
00:51:25,148 --> 00:51:27,480
Wait a second.

978
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:29,849
This looks familiar.

979
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,387
What?

980
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:34,117
Maybe we should
ask for some help.

981
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:36,557
Oh! Oh!

982
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:38,491
Oh! Good,
here we are.

983
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:41,292
Let's go.

984
00:51:41,364 --> 00:51:42,353
Hi there.

985
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:43,729
Hi.

986
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,665
Are you ladies
staying here?

987
00:51:45,735 --> 00:51:47,498
Yeah, we're not
checked in though.

988
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:49,232
No problem,
I'll have your bags,

989
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:52,002
and may I ask you what is on your back?

990
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:53,872
Oh, that's
Virgil.

991
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:54,968
He's a turtle.

992
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:57,240
Isn't he cute?

993
00:51:57,314 --> 00:52:00,511
I'm sorry we actually have a, uh,
very strict no pet policy here.

994
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:01,642
Um.

995
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:02,912
What?

996
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:04,248
It's a
back pack.

997
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:06,448
Yeah, it's fake. He's a turtle backpack.

998
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:10,787
Okay! Right
this way.

999
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:12,089
Thank you.

1000
00:52:12,162 --> 00:52:14,096
I'll take these.

1001
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:19,630
Oh, excuse me.
Excuse me. Sorry.

1002
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:32,342
Hi.

1003
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:34,406
We'd like to get two
rooms with one bed.

1004
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:37,248
No, wait. One
room and two beds.

1005
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,480
That's right.
A suite.

1006
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:39,954
It's called
a suite, right?

1007
00:52:40,023 --> 00:52:41,752
Well, we're
pretty booked up.

1008
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,952
Let's check
the computer.

1009
00:52:44,027 --> 00:52:45,426
Aw.

1010
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:47,929
That was
two beds?

1011
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:51,058
Oh, I'm sorry, it seems
we're out of suites.

1012
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:54,797
We can just take whatever you
have then, that's okay. Thanks.

1013
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:56,429
How about
a penthouse?

1014
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:58,940
There you go.
Enjoy your stay.

1015
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,134
Thank you.

1016
00:53:01,211 --> 00:53:02,678
Right this
way, ladies.

1017
00:53:18,328 --> 00:53:20,125
Excusie.

1018
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:24,032
Here we
are, ladies.

1019
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:26,432
If there's anything else
that I can do for you.

1020
00:53:26,503 --> 00:53:28,198
Please don't
hesitate to ask.

1021
00:53:28,271 --> 00:53:32,105
Actually, there's something
you could do for us.

1022
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:33,608
Work on
your manners.

1023
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:44,949
No, that's not
a good feeling.

1024
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:47,589
Are you okay?

1025
00:53:47,657 --> 00:53:50,717
Uh, yeah,
I'm just um,

1026
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:53,695
trying

1027
00:53:58,235 --> 00:53:59,668
Wow.

1028
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:01,226
I wonder who's
staying there.

1029
00:54:01,304 --> 00:54:03,795
Wow. Probably
the Shrink of Araby.

1030
00:54:03,873 --> 00:54:05,067
Yeah, a Shrek.

1031
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:06,472
Shrek.

1032
00:54:06,543 --> 00:54:10,035
Wow!

1033
00:54:10,113 --> 00:54:13,549
Wow. Look! They have trees in the room!

1034
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:15,084
Oh my God!

1035
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:18,120
I'm so excited!
Cool! Look at our room!

1036
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:21,157
Oh! There's a pool
in the bedroom!

1037
00:54:21,224 --> 00:54:24,159
Oh, look
at the fireplace.

1038
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:26,388
Wow, oh, my God!

1039
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:28,328
Wow.

1040
00:54:28,398 --> 00:54:30,491
Oh, Jesus. Hey, that's our suitcase.

1041
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:32,660
Oh my God, this
must be our room.

1042
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:34,761
Oh my God!
I'm so excited!

1043
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:37,773
Wait. This is going
to be so expensive.

1044
00:54:37,841 --> 00:54:41,333
No. Remember they couldn't find
us a suite so they gave us this.

1045
00:54:41,411 --> 00:54:43,345
Oh.

1046
00:54:43,413 --> 00:54:45,904
Oh, I gotta feed Virgil.
He must be starving.

1047
00:54:45,982 --> 00:54:47,609
Poor little boy.

1048
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:49,083
Oh.

1049
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:54,286
No pesticides.

1050
00:54:58,194 --> 00:54:59,752
Dee, come
look at this!

1051
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:03,159
Come look at this.

1052
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:06,691
What? Oh my God! Oh my God! We're here!

1053
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:08,567
We're here!
We're here!

1054
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:10,606
Whoopie!

1055
00:55:10,674 --> 00:55:14,405
We're here!

1056
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,445
We're here!

1057
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:19,243
Oh, I can
see the sky!

1058
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,580
I can see
the Big Dipper!

1059
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:23,949
I can too!

1060
00:55:24,788 --> 00:55:26,119
Let's get you
ready, girlie.

1061
00:55:32,462 --> 00:55:34,453
Only one way to
accent the tushy.

1062
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:36,260
Okay. Oh,
what are they?

1063
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,357
Guess.

1064
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:38,628
Uh, okay.
Miss Sixty.

1065
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:40,693
No, Guess.

1066
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:42,704
Oh, I like this.
Okay. Um,

1067
00:55:42,772 --> 00:55:43,932
Frankie B.

1068
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:45,133
They're Guess.

1069
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:46,766
Miss Sixty.

1070
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:49,004
These are Guess.

1071
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:51,309
Okay, okay, just
give me a minute.

1072
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:52,780
Jay Ben.

1073
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:55,249
Forget it. Hey,
check these babies out.

1074
00:55:55,318 --> 00:55:56,945
For your legs,
highest heels.

1075
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,351
Oh, highest heels.

1076
00:55:58,421 --> 00:56:00,685
There are high, higher
and highest heels.

1077
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:02,520
Try 'em on.
Huh? They're cute.

1078
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:04,992
I, uh, I didn't know you
guys would be in here.

1079
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:08,724
Uh, uh, the sandwiches are on the cart.

1080
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:12,928
and, uh, I, uh,
the door was

1081
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:14,697
Oh.

1082
00:56:14,771 --> 00:56:17,467
I think
this still fits you.

1083
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,564
Yeah, let me try.

1084
00:56:18,641 --> 00:56:19,665
Arms up.

1085
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:20,801
Okay.

1086
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:23,208
I can do it.

1087
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:28,975
I love this clean air.
So pure, untouched.

1088
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,679
Do you know
where we look first?

1089
00:56:30,754 --> 00:56:32,779
I won't have to.
She'll come to me.

1090
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:34,585
We locate
Mr. Wong and we wait.

1091
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:36,750
When the hit goes down
we kill my impostor

1092
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:38,623
and we carry out
the job ourselves.

1093
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:40,686
Two dead, a lesson
taught, The Cat,

1094
00:56:40,764 --> 00:56:44,165
or I should say Kit?
is back on top.

1095
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,725
You go get
us a room

1096
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:49,169
while I make my presence
a little less known.

1097
00:57:26,209 --> 00:57:28,439
Why's everybody staring?

1098
00:57:28,511 --> 00:57:29,876
It's a good
thing, right?

1099
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,504
Yeah.

1100
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:34,277
You know what? I'll go find
Wong, I'll be right back.

1101
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:35,647
Okay.

1102
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:37,515
Excuse me, Miss.

1103
00:57:37,587 --> 00:57:39,248
I could use
some lady luck.

1104
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:41,381
Would you mind throwing the dice for me?

1105
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,426
Oh, sure.

1106
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:44,721
Thanks.

1107
00:57:54,003 --> 00:57:55,470
Thanks.

1108
00:57:55,538 --> 00:57:57,631
Don't mention it.

1109
00:58:03,112 --> 00:58:04,272
Excuse me.

1110
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:06,440
Hey, where's the
information booth?

1111
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:08,313
It's, uh, right
over there, Ma'am.

1112
00:58:08,384 --> 00:58:10,614
Oh, thanks.
Thank you.

1113
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:16,315
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

1114
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,494
Yes? Can
I help you?

1115
00:58:19,562 --> 00:58:20,961
Oh, I hope so.

1116
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:23,498
I'm trying to find Hang
Wong. I think he's French.

1117
00:58:23,566 --> 00:58:26,057
Brilliant. I would've
thought Italian.

1118
00:58:26,135 --> 00:58:27,568
Maybe.

1119
00:58:27,637 --> 00:58:30,367
Have you heard of him?

1120
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:34,843
Hotel and casino.

1121
00:58:34,911 --> 00:58:37,038
They're doing a
Dancalicious here.

1122
00:58:37,113 --> 00:58:40,207
That's Dee's favorite show. I
must tell her, I'm so excited.

1123
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:42,148
You're here to audition for Mr. Wong?

1124
00:58:42,218 --> 00:58:43,913
Oh, no, we're
here to take him out.

1125
00:58:46,422 --> 00:58:48,322
That'll be a date
he'll never forget.

1126
00:58:48,391 --> 00:58:49,949
I'm sure.

1127
00:58:51,661 --> 00:58:53,788
You can find him at
the casino restaurant.

1128
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:57,424
It's called the Tramonto. He's
always there before the show starts.

1129
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,365
The Tramonto.

1130
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:01,130
Starts with a T.
I'll find it.

1131
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,637
That's right.

1132
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:03,637
Thanks so much.

1133
00:59:04,774 --> 00:59:06,401
Yeah? Sorry.

1134
00:59:11,447 --> 00:59:12,471
Dee.

1135
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:13,743
Oh! Hi.

1136
00:59:13,816 --> 00:59:15,010
I found Wong.

1137
00:59:15,084 --> 00:59:16,949
He's at a restaurant in the hotel.

1138
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,214
That was easy.

1139
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:20,017
He owns the hotel.

1140
00:59:20,089 --> 00:59:21,420
Oh my God.

1141
00:59:21,491 --> 00:59:23,755
We need the money. No
gambling, no drinking.

1142
00:59:23,826 --> 00:59:24,918
Okay, okay.

1143
00:59:24,994 --> 00:59:26,552
Drinking's okay.
No gambling.

1144
00:59:26,629 --> 00:59:27,960
I don't know
how to gamble.

1145
00:59:28,031 --> 00:59:29,658
We'll keep
a low profile.

1146
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:32,132
We're here for one thing
only, to take out Wong.

1147
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:34,499
I'll be at Tramonto.
In his restaurant.

1148
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:38,337
There's a big sign that says Tramonto
and it's the restaurant underneath it.

1149
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:39,841
Okay, got it.
Have fun.

1150
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:41,774
Okay.

1151
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,247
Oh!

1152
00:59:56,326 --> 00:59:57,588
Oh!

1153
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:03,054
Money plays?

1154
01:00:04,667 --> 01:00:05,497
What?

1155
01:00:05,568 --> 01:00:06,899
Money plays, Ma'am.

1156
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:08,460
Will you let
the money play?

1157
01:00:08,538 --> 01:00:10,836
Uh, I don't care.

1158
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:13,341
No more bets.

1159
01:00:15,411 --> 01:00:19,507
Thirteen black. We have a
winner. Paying out 10, 000.

1160
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:34,660
Would you like
to let it ride, Ma'am?

1161
01:00:34,731 --> 01:00:35,891
What?

1162
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:38,160
Would you like to
let the money ride?

1163
01:00:38,234 --> 01:00:39,667
Let the money ride?

1164
01:00:39,736 --> 01:00:40,760
Um.

1165
01:00:40,837 --> 01:00:42,600
Let it ride!

1166
01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:43,696
Sure.

1167
01:00:43,773 --> 01:00:45,400
All right,
place your bets.

1168
01:00:48,778 --> 01:00:53,078
Tra, Tra, uh,
Tram, Tramonto.

1169
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:55,083
Tramonto.

1170
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:56,948
Hello.

1171
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:58,851
Hello. Hm.

1172
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,488
Are you
sure that's her?

1173
01:01:06,562 --> 01:01:08,291
Without a doubt.

1174
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:11,765
I heard her partner tell a total
stranger what she was going to do.

1175
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:14,234
Almost bragging.
cold fish.

1176
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:16,362
She just walks
in the front door.

1177
01:01:16,439 --> 01:01:19,272
Either she's
incredibly brave,

1178
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:21,606
or incredibly stupid.

1179
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:23,407
Come on, I want
to watch her moves,

1180
01:01:23,479 --> 01:01:26,209
and when she
strikes, we pounce.

1181
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:35,583
Hello.

1182
01:01:35,658 --> 01:01:39,150
Hi, I'm sorry, Miss Dee,
restaurant is closed for an hour.

1183
01:01:39,228 --> 01:01:40,957
There's a
private party.

1184
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:42,190
Oh, for Mr. Wong?

1185
01:01:42,265 --> 01:01:44,426
Are you with
Mr. Wong's party?

1186
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,263
I plan to be.

1187
01:01:46,335 --> 01:01:49,099
One moment.
Please wait here.

1188
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:50,639
Thank you.

1189
01:01:56,979 --> 01:01:58,037
Mm.

1190
01:02:06,255 --> 01:02:09,247
Mr. Wong's assistant will
be joining us shortly.

1191
01:02:09,325 --> 01:02:11,919
Don't say anything
about his eye.

1192
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:13,518
Oh. Okay.

1193
01:02:13,596 --> 01:02:16,156
What kind of candies
are these? They're good.

1194
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:19,123
Candies?

1195
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:23,195
Those are rocks from
the Japanese rock garden.

1196
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:28,877
I hate sushi. Ugh.

1197
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:30,435
Oh!

1198
01:02:30,513 --> 01:02:31,878
What is it?

1199
01:02:31,948 --> 01:02:34,314
I don't know. She hit
me with something hard.

1200
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:38,552
We have a
new casino record!

1201
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:44,148
This is the most fun I've
had with my clothes on!

1202
01:02:44,227 --> 01:02:45,455
What's your
bet, Ma'am?

1203
01:02:45,528 --> 01:02:49,464
You know, I think
I'll just let it ride!

1204
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:54,498
Hello.

1205
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:56,435
Are you introduced
to Mr. Wong?

1206
01:02:56,506 --> 01:02:58,736
Yes, um, you must
be Mr. Wong's pirate.

1207
01:02:58,808 --> 01:03:01,538
I mean,
ass- ociate.

1208
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:02,635
Come with me.

1209
01:03:02,712 --> 01:03:03,940
Where are
you taking me?

1210
01:03:04,013 --> 01:03:05,503
To have
a little talk.

1211
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:08,846
How could she know? I can
even think that she saw me.

1212
01:03:08,918 --> 01:03:10,545
Do you think
they're on to us?

1213
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,783
No. Nobody's that good unless
they've the sixth sense of a-

1214
01:03:13,856 --> 01:03:15,585
Cat.

1215
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,290
The lady's room?

1216
01:03:28,237 --> 01:03:30,262
You are not supposed to be in here.

1217
01:03:30,339 --> 01:03:31,636
Neither are you.

1218
01:03:31,707 --> 01:03:33,004
What?

1219
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:37,677
Why are you here?

1220
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:41,843
Well, I'm here to see,
um, I mean, I'm looking,

1221
01:03:41,918 --> 01:03:43,943
Mr. Wong is busy.

1222
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:47,148
I just saw him sitting at a table,
I saw him with my own two eyes.

1223
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:50,121
Who are you?

1224
01:03:50,193 --> 01:03:51,990
My name is Dee.

1225
01:03:52,061 --> 01:03:53,392
What's your name?

1226
01:03:53,462 --> 01:03:54,486
Wun Eye.

1227
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:57,533
But my friends
call me Eye.

1228
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,591
Ay, ay, ay.

1229
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:04,538
Well, I hope you and,
I hope we can be friends.

1230
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:06,438
You and, I.

1231
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:09,171
Well, we can get
better acquainted.

1232
01:04:09,245 --> 01:04:12,737
Okay. Oh! Jeez, not
that kind of friends.

1233
01:04:12,815 --> 01:04:15,750
Gosh, you know, you should
treat me a lot better than that.

1234
01:04:15,818 --> 01:04:17,615
Okay, you're clean.

1235
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,279
Oh, okay, well.

1236
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:21,823
Once in the morning,
once at night.

1237
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:23,654
Is Mr. Wong
expecting you?

1238
01:04:23,726 --> 01:04:26,456
No, it gonna be
a pleasant surprise.

1239
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:29,760
Look, oh shoot,
I mean, listen,

1240
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:32,596
Mr. Capellini hired me
to take Mr. Wong out.

1241
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:39,201
That's a good one. Alright,
you can call me Eye.

1242
01:04:39,275 --> 01:04:41,266
You don't think I'm
good enough for him?

1243
01:04:41,344 --> 01:04:43,107
Sure. You just
have to wait in line.

1244
01:04:43,179 --> 01:04:45,147
Oh, so he's quite
the lady killer, huh?

1245
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:48,206
Oh, yeah.
He's a killer.

1246
01:04:48,284 --> 01:04:51,310
Come on, let's go with
Mr. Wong. He'll like you.

1247
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:53,514
You couldn't have
come at a better time.

1248
01:04:53,923 --> 01:04:55,914
She's good,
I'll give her that.

1249
01:04:55,992 --> 01:04:58,119
Sweet talk your way
in and then strike.

1250
01:04:58,194 --> 01:04:59,923
Excellent.

1251
01:04:59,996 --> 01:05:03,864
Too bad I
have to kill her.

1252
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:06,128
I have a friend, she
might be looking for me.

1253
01:05:06,202 --> 01:05:09,296
She's a really cute blonde. Could
you keep and eye out for her?

1254
01:05:09,372 --> 01:05:10,805
Oops. Sorry. Um,

1255
01:05:10,873 --> 01:05:12,602
I forgot my purse
in the bathroom.

1256
01:05:12,675 --> 01:05:16,111
No. No. Stay
here. I'll get it.

1257
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:18,339
Okay. Hey, do you
have a breath mint?

1258
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:19,813
I have a little
bad breath.

1259
01:05:19,882 --> 01:05:21,543
Don't want to
meet him like that.

1260
01:05:21,617 --> 01:05:22,641
No.

1261
01:05:22,718 --> 01:05:24,015
But I have
a breath spray.

1262
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:26,884
Oh, that's good,
thanks. Oh!

1263
01:05:26,956 --> 01:05:29,618
Stay right here.

1264
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:32,126
Okay.
Okay.

1265
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:33,661
Sure.

1266
01:05:33,729 --> 01:05:36,493
Oh!

1267
01:05:38,134 --> 01:05:41,126
It's that one-eyed guy.
Let's get some practice.

1268
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:46,269
Thank you.

1269
01:05:46,342 --> 01:05:48,810
Thanks.

1270
01:05:48,878 --> 01:05:50,641
Thanks, guys.

1271
01:05:50,713 --> 01:05:52,146
Wow!

1272
01:05:52,214 --> 01:05:55,081
As you are fully aware,
I do not work for Capella.

1273
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:56,709
I work for no one.

1274
01:05:58,187 --> 01:06:00,155
Yeah. We know.

1275
01:06:00,222 --> 01:06:02,850
Mr. Capella just
wanted us to talk to you

1276
01:06:02,925 --> 01:06:04,756
one last time.

1277
01:06:04,827 --> 01:06:06,852
One last time?

1278
01:06:06,929 --> 01:06:08,897
Yeah.

1279
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:13,101
Is that a
threat, Mr. Swan?

1280
01:06:13,169 --> 01:06:14,864
I don't know.

1281
01:06:14,937 --> 01:06:18,270
Hugo and I don't take kindly to threats.

1282
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:20,206
Whew.

1283
01:06:24,013 --> 01:06:25,207
It's going down.

1284
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:29,279
It's breath spray.

1285
01:06:29,352 --> 01:06:30,376
What?

1286
01:06:30,453 --> 01:06:31,477
Breath spray.

1287
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:32,612
It's not a gun?

1288
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:35,816
Ah. Okay. Okay.
Uh.

1289
01:06:35,891 --> 01:06:39,657
Holy mackerel, I thought I
lost a contact down there.

1290
01:06:39,729 --> 01:06:42,755
I got astigmatism I
can't drive without them.

1291
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:43,890
I know.

1292
01:06:43,966 --> 01:06:45,729
So, sorry.

1293
01:07:00,983 --> 01:07:04,248
Now he knows it's not polite to
interrupt a woman in the bathroom.

1294
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:07,984
Hm.

1295
01:07:08,057 --> 01:07:10,651
No obvious weapons.

1296
01:07:10,726 --> 01:07:13,194
She's better
than I thought.

1297
01:07:15,598 --> 01:07:16,963
My turn?

1298
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:19,297
You'll
get your turn.

1299
01:07:23,305 --> 01:07:24,329
Hello.

1300
01:07:24,407 --> 01:07:25,772
Hello.

1301
01:07:25,841 --> 01:07:28,366
Do you three
know each other?

1302
01:07:28,444 --> 01:07:30,105
Nope, never
seen her before.

1303
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:31,510
Who is she?

1304
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:33,707
Yeah. These are the
guys that hired me to-

1305
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:38,152
to, uh, just show
you a good time.

1306
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:39,812
Sorry.

1307
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:41,857
Oh, so you must
be Mr. Wong.

1308
01:07:41,924 --> 01:07:44,290
Yes, I am
Hang Wong.

1309
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:47,386
Ouch!

1310
01:07:47,463 --> 01:07:49,761
Please, sit
down and join us.

1311
01:07:49,832 --> 01:07:53,928
Now, this method
I prefer much more.

1312
01:07:54,003 --> 01:07:56,699
Friends in Hong Kong
give each other gifts.

1313
01:07:56,772 --> 01:07:58,706
You are learning.

1314
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:02,669
Cheers.

1315
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:05,737
Cheers. I'm glad we're
all here together.

1316
01:08:05,815 --> 01:08:07,077
Ah!

1317
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:14,320
So, you are a
professional girl?

1318
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:15,948
Oh, yeah, I'm
a professional.

1319
01:08:16,025 --> 01:08:18,892
What is your,
uh, your specialty?

1320
01:08:18,961 --> 01:08:20,428
If you don't
mind me asking.

1321
01:08:20,496 --> 01:08:22,930
My specialty?
Well, um,

1322
01:08:22,998 --> 01:08:25,228
I'm a really
good dancer,

1323
01:08:25,301 --> 01:08:27,201
and I wanna
dance on Broadway!

1324
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:29,760
Oh! Haya, holy!

1325
01:08:31,707 --> 01:08:33,504
Is that so?

1326
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:38,377
Well maybe you'll be interested
in my play Dancalicious.

1327
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:39,414
Dancalicious?

1328
01:08:39,482 --> 01:08:41,074
You produce
Dancalicious?

1329
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:44,642
I have my hands involved
in so many operations

1330
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:47,018
as I'm sure Mr.
Swan could attest.

1331
01:08:47,089 --> 01:08:50,252
I, uh

1332
01:08:50,326 --> 01:08:52,089
My God!
Dancalicious!

1333
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:53,890
You know,
I love that musical.

1334
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:55,988
I know every word
and I know every lyric.

1335
01:08:56,065 --> 01:08:57,896
There's a six o'clock show tonight.

1336
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,298
Perhaps you
could join me.

1337
01:08:59,368 --> 01:09:01,859
There is? How are we gonna get a seat?

1338
01:09:01,937 --> 01:09:04,701
I mean, that show must be sold
out for at least two years!

1339
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:07,469
No problem, we'll just
kill two ticket holders.

1340
01:09:07,543 --> 01:09:09,807
Where did Eye
disappear to?

1341
01:09:09,879 --> 01:09:11,574
Well you're
right there.

1342
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:13,376
Not me, Eye.

1343
01:09:13,449 --> 01:09:15,576
Well, I don't know
if it's proper English,

1344
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:17,881
but, um, you're still
sitting right there.

1345
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:20,945
Hugo. Find him.

1346
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:22,081
Okay.

1347
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,591
No, no, no.
Sit down.

1348
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:24,887
Go.

1349
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,484
You just told
me to go get him.

1350
01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:28,996
No, I said Hugo.

1351
01:09:29,064 --> 01:09:30,088
Right.

1352
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:31,793
No, no, no. Sit!

1353
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:35,130
Um, you just told me to go get him.

1354
01:09:35,204 --> 01:09:39,004
No, not
"You go", Hugo.

1355
01:09:39,074 --> 01:09:42,874
Do you want me to stay
or do you want me to go?

1356
01:09:42,945 --> 01:09:45,709
I want you to stay.

1357
01:09:45,781 --> 01:09:48,841
Eye! Are you here?

1358
01:10:01,096 --> 01:10:02,563
Who are you?

1359
01:10:02,631 --> 01:10:04,895
The last pretty
face you'll ever see.

1360
01:10:04,967 --> 01:10:06,025
Meow!

1361
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:08,331
Agh!

1362
01:10:22,518 --> 01:10:25,146
Not bad.
A little messy.

1363
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:28,190
Anyway, let's
go talk strategy.

1364
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:34,923
We have a little time. Would
you like to, uh, ride my yacht?

1365
01:10:34,997 --> 01:10:38,228
Is that what
they're calling it now?

1366
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:39,562
You can ride
my dinghy.

1367
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:43,932
I have to go
to the bathroom.

1368
01:10:44,006 --> 01:10:45,439
I'm gonna freshen up.

1369
01:10:45,507 --> 01:10:47,475
Oh, I got blood
on my stole.

1370
01:10:52,615 --> 01:10:56,847
I have a feeling tonight
will be very memorable.

1371
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:59,479
Oh! Sorry.

1372
01:10:59,555 --> 01:11:00,783
There you are.

1373
01:11:00,856 --> 01:11:02,790
I was wondering
who left that.

1374
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:05,122
I think I'm a little
anxious about tonight.

1375
01:11:05,194 --> 01:11:06,491
Hot date?

1376
01:11:06,562 --> 01:11:09,190
Well, kinda.
Very profitable.

1377
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:11,631
But I think Mr.
Wong is so sweet.

1378
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:13,725
You know you should
be careful on dates.

1379
01:11:13,802 --> 01:11:16,669
A guy might already
belong to somebody else.

1380
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:18,229
Somebody who
might get upset

1381
01:11:18,307 --> 01:11:20,673
if they feel their
territory is being invaded.

1382
01:11:20,743 --> 01:11:22,734
You think he might
have a girlfriend?

1383
01:11:22,811 --> 01:11:25,041
Something like that.

1384
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:29,278
Or maybe
something worse.

1385
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:33,648
Jeez, everybody's
speaking in widdles tonight.

1386
01:11:33,722 --> 01:11:36,520
Well, it's a good thing
I'm almost done with him.

1387
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:38,184
It'll be through soon.

1388
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:39,625
Maybe you're
through now.

1389
01:11:48,237 --> 01:11:50,899
She's the luckiest
bitch that ever lived.

1390
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:53,373
God, I want her now.

1391
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:56,411
Why didn't she kill 'em?
She had 'em right there.

1392
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:59,447
She's toying with 'em, waiting
for the cruelest moment,

1393
01:11:59,515 --> 01:12:01,278
She's good,
man, really good.

1394
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:04,717
Yeah, but she seemed so
sincere, so naive, back there.

1395
01:12:04,787 --> 01:12:08,314
You don't think maybe
we got the wrong girl?

1396
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:11,086
Nah.

1397
01:12:13,729 --> 01:12:16,027
Come on, Kit. Let's kill the bitch.

1398
01:12:24,807 --> 01:12:25,831
Oh, hello.

1399
01:12:25,908 --> 01:12:27,000
Hello, shall we?

1400
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:28,373
Sure.

1401
01:12:28,444 --> 01:12:30,571
Can we check on my friend in the casino?

1402
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:32,773
Of course.

1403
01:12:34,249 --> 01:12:35,716
Shut up.

1404
01:12:35,784 --> 01:12:38,184
Whoa.

1405
01:12:38,253 --> 01:12:39,311
Blood.

1406
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:41,083
Who's blood?

1407
01:12:41,156 --> 01:12:42,748
I don't know.

1408
01:12:42,825 --> 01:12:44,850
It's going into the
women's bathroom?

1409
01:12:44,927 --> 01:12:47,657
Hello?

1410
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:49,698
Hey, you guys?

1411
01:13:08,584 --> 01:13:10,211
She's gosh darn
Charles Manson.

1412
01:13:12,788 --> 01:13:14,949
But she's not
after us, right?

1413
01:13:15,023 --> 01:13:16,820
The hell with it,
we're out of here.

1414
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:17,916
Out of
the bathroom?

1415
01:13:17,993 --> 01:13:19,585
No, out of
the country!

1416
01:13:19,661 --> 01:13:21,686
Well, uh, but
we're we gonna go?

1417
01:13:21,764 --> 01:13:23,664
I don't know.
Korea or Iraq.

1418
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:26,462
Cuba! Yeah, Castro
will take care of us.

1419
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:39,874
Oh, there she is!

1420
01:13:39,948 --> 01:13:40,972
Dee, hi!

1421
01:13:41,049 --> 01:13:42,448
Oh, hi,
Wong, I'm Dawn.

1422
01:13:42,518 --> 01:13:43,849
Hello.

1423
01:13:43,919 --> 01:13:45,944
You'll never
believe this.

1424
01:13:46,021 --> 01:13:47,045
I won.

1425
01:13:47,122 --> 01:13:48,282
Won what?

1426
01:13:48,357 --> 01:13:50,382
About five pounds.

1427
01:13:50,459 --> 01:13:52,620
A million dollars
worth of chips.

1428
01:13:52,694 --> 01:13:53,991
My God,
that's great!

1429
01:13:54,062 --> 01:13:55,996
I know,
I'm so excited.

1430
01:13:56,064 --> 01:13:57,361
That's so cool!

1431
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:59,333
Have fun.
Nice to meet you.

1432
01:13:59,401 --> 01:14:01,562
Bye.

1433
01:14:01,637 --> 01:14:03,764
Gosh, I hope
she's hungry.

1434
01:14:03,839 --> 01:14:05,500
Would she
like to join us?

1435
01:14:05,574 --> 01:14:06,802
Hello, Mr. Wong.

1436
01:14:06,875 --> 01:14:09,867
Meow. Hiss.

1437
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:13,507
Shall we, uh,
visit my yacht?

1438
01:14:13,582 --> 01:14:15,777
Oh, sure.

1439
01:14:18,754 --> 01:14:21,552
I don't know how we're gonna
find them in this madhouse.

1440
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:23,591
Don't worry, I've got men staked out

1441
01:14:23,659 --> 01:14:25,149
on every hot spot in the strip.

1442
01:14:25,227 --> 01:14:26,888
If they're here,
we'll find 'em.

1443
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:29,829
You're damn right. Son, have
you seen these two blondes?

1444
01:14:29,898 --> 01:14:32,162
Yeah, they checked in
a couple of hours ago.

1445
01:14:32,234 --> 01:14:33,929
Really?
You sure?

1446
01:14:34,002 --> 01:14:36,061
Yeah, I wouldn't
forget them,

1447
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:37,765
um, she
assaulted me.

1448
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,467
You know,
it's nothing.

1449
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:42,567
I just saw one of them, they're
in the hotel if you need them.

1450
01:14:42,644 --> 01:14:44,544
All units report to me right away.

1451
01:14:44,613 --> 01:14:46,638
A suspect has been
spotted in the hotel.

1452
01:14:46,715 --> 01:14:48,910
I repeat. A blonde
has been spotted.

1453
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:51,111
Approach with
extreme caution.

1454
01:14:53,622 --> 01:14:55,283
Show me where.

1455
01:15:00,395 --> 01:15:01,555
Are they dangerous?

1456
01:15:09,104 --> 01:15:10,833
This looks
like trouble.

1457
01:15:10,906 --> 01:15:13,136
I gotta go
find Dee.

1458
01:15:15,544 --> 01:15:18,035
Well, she
was just here.

1459
01:15:19,648 --> 01:15:23,414
Uh, I think I saw the other
blonde with, uh, Mr. Wong.

1460
01:15:23,485 --> 01:15:24,645
Mr. Wong?

1461
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:26,119
Yeah, he
owns the hotel.

1462
01:15:26,188 --> 01:15:27,883
Yes, I know
who he is. Where?

1463
01:15:27,956 --> 01:15:30,481
I think I saw
him go that way.

1464
01:15:30,559 --> 01:15:33,289
All units, we're heading
for the front of the casino.

1465
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:35,353
There goes that job.

1466
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:47,135
God! You're that guy in the commercial.

1467
01:15:49,044 --> 01:15:50,068
My friend
loves you!

1468
01:15:50,145 --> 01:15:51,169
I knew it.

1469
01:15:51,246 --> 01:15:53,612
Hey, you!
Stop! Police!

1470
01:15:53,682 --> 01:15:54,774
What? What?!

1471
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:56,977
You're coming
with me. Come here.

1472
01:15:57,052 --> 01:16:00,021
Dawn really loves him, I
gotta get his autograph.

1473
01:16:01,323 --> 01:16:02,449
This way!

1474
01:16:07,095 --> 01:16:08,790
Show time.

1475
01:16:13,201 --> 01:16:14,964
Oh, excuse me.

1476
01:16:15,037 --> 01:16:16,868
Oh my God!

1477
01:16:16,939 --> 01:16:18,304
It's you.

1478
01:16:18,373 --> 01:16:19,431
Yeah.

1479
01:16:19,508 --> 01:16:20,839
You're the
love of my life.

1480
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:25,107
That's very sweet-
Wait a second.

1481
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:27,842
2001,
Dead and Deader.

1482
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:29,213
Yes, I was
an extra.

1483
01:16:29,284 --> 01:16:31,411
Yeah, I looked for
you after my close up.

1484
01:16:31,486 --> 01:16:32,544
I couldn't find you.

1485
01:16:32,621 --> 01:16:33,485
You did?

1486
01:16:33,555 --> 01:16:35,045
Oh my God.

1487
01:16:35,123 --> 01:16:36,784
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

1488
01:16:36,858 --> 01:16:38,223
Oh my God.

1489
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:40,784
I'm trying to find my
friend. She's in trouble.

1490
01:16:40,862 --> 01:16:42,227
Did you see her?

1491
01:16:42,297 --> 01:16:44,424
The cops chased
her through that door.

1492
01:16:44,499 --> 01:16:45,830
She did? Okay.

1493
01:16:45,901 --> 01:16:47,027
Is there anything-?

1494
01:16:47,102 --> 01:16:48,592
Yeah, can you
hold this for me?

1495
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:50,228
Yeah, sure.

1496
01:16:50,305 --> 01:16:52,865
there's a million dollars
in there, so be careful.

1497
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:55,432
These shoes are really
uncomfortable to run in.

1498
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:57,444
Thank you so
much. Thank you.

1499
01:16:59,348 --> 01:17:01,179
I love you.
Thank you.

1500
01:17:01,249 --> 01:17:04,082
Yeah. Uh,
what's your name?

1501
01:17:04,152 --> 01:17:07,383
Dee! I mean, Dawn.
I'm looking for Dee.

1502
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:09,185
Bye!

1503
01:17:09,257 --> 01:17:10,622
An autograph,
please.

1504
01:17:10,692 --> 01:17:12,421
Uh, yeah. Right.

1505
01:17:18,033 --> 01:17:19,591
Come on. Go.

1506
01:17:19,668 --> 01:17:21,295
Oh!

1507
01:17:25,607 --> 01:17:26,665
Oh God!

1508
01:17:26,742 --> 01:17:28,209
Where does
this elevator go?

1509
01:17:28,276 --> 01:17:29,607
It only goes down.

1510
01:17:29,678 --> 01:17:32,078
We'll take the stairs.

1511
01:17:49,297 --> 01:17:51,390
Um, put that
in my room.

1512
01:17:51,466 --> 01:17:54,333
Ladies, I love you. I
love you. I love you.

1513
01:17:54,403 --> 01:17:55,370
No, don't go!

1514
01:17:56,538 --> 01:17:58,005
Why are the
police after you?

1515
01:17:58,073 --> 01:17:59,870
I don't know if they're the police.

1516
01:17:59,941 --> 01:18:01,602
Many people are trying to kill me.

1517
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:03,702
They can be
killers in disguise.

1518
01:18:03,779 --> 01:18:06,247
If they're cops, they
can talk to my lawyer.

1519
01:18:10,385 --> 01:18:13,912
All units. I'm in pursuit of a
blonde and an unidentified male.

1520
01:18:13,989 --> 01:18:17,288
I want all air, land and
sea assets on standby.

1521
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:20,123
Have my helicopter pick me
up at the west parking lot.

1522
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:20,179
Come on.

1523
01:19:22,557 --> 01:19:24,718
Everyone! We're
in the wharf.

1524
01:19:26,862 --> 01:19:27,988
Open up!

1525
01:19:28,063 --> 01:19:30,293
Get me a helicopter. Right away!

1526
01:19:33,869 --> 01:19:35,393
Go! Go!

1527
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:46,808
Oh, Jesus, Where are we going?

1528
01:19:46,882 --> 01:19:48,315
We're taking
a little trip.

1529
01:19:48,383 --> 01:19:49,441
I didn't pack.

1530
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:51,748
You won't
need anything.

1531
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:52,787
We going
to Tahiti?

1532
01:19:52,854 --> 01:19:54,048
Six feet under.

1533
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:55,987
Australia? I've
never been there.

1534
01:19:56,057 --> 01:19:57,490
Shut up,
Shut up!

1535
01:19:57,559 --> 01:20:00,687
If you talk to me like
that I'm not going anywhere.

1536
01:20:00,762 --> 01:20:03,492
You won't have a choice in the matter.

1537
01:20:03,565 --> 01:20:04,589
Is that real?

1538
01:20:04,666 --> 01:20:05,724
What?

1539
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:06,927
Is that real?

1540
01:20:07,002 --> 01:20:08,697
Yes! With real
bullets. Now move!

1541
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:09,794
All right!

1542
01:20:10,005 --> 01:20:11,302
Okay. Action. Go.

1543
01:20:11,373 --> 01:20:13,034
Rolling?

1544
01:20:13,108 --> 01:20:16,669
It's been one year of planning
and it all comes down to this.

1545
01:20:16,745 --> 01:20:18,872
Okay, no smiling,
more serious. Okay?

1546
01:20:18,947 --> 01:20:19,971
I'm being serious.

1547
01:20:20,048 --> 01:20:21,379
I know, but
don't smile, eh.

1548
01:20:21,449 --> 01:20:23,576
It's been one
year of planning

1549
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:25,483
and it all comes down to this moment.

1550
01:20:25,554 --> 01:20:26,680
I plan to
sneak over-

1551
01:20:26,755 --> 01:20:28,279
Help! Help!

1552
01:20:28,356 --> 01:20:30,881
I must find the yacht. My
friend's been kidnapped.

1553
01:20:30,959 --> 01:20:32,426
How do I get
to that yacht?

1554
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:34,587
The fastest way is probably right there.

1555
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:35,823
That boat there?

1556
01:20:35,897 --> 01:20:37,592
Yeah, we're
making web history-

1557
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:39,725
Do you mind?
This is serious.

1558
01:20:39,801 --> 01:20:41,530
We're filming
Crime of Mr. Wong.

1559
01:20:41,603 --> 01:20:45,869
I will sneak over that yacht,
I'll climb aboard and blend in.

1560
01:20:45,941 --> 01:20:47,738
Oh, what-
what's she-

1561
01:20:47,809 --> 01:20:49,777
Hey, no!

1562
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:51,779
She's kinda hot.

1563
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:52,973
No, wait!

1564
01:20:54,883 --> 01:20:56,373
Hey! Hey!

1565
01:20:57,619 --> 01:20:58,881
Hey!

1566
01:20:58,954 --> 01:21:01,946
I'm sorry. I have
to save my friend.

1567
01:21:02,023 --> 01:21:04,514
I'll bring her
back, I promise!

1568
01:21:04,593 --> 01:21:06,493
Keep it rolling.

1569
01:21:09,764 --> 01:21:12,858
Trim down on the motor
or you'll drop the bow.

1570
01:21:15,136 --> 01:21:16,160
Come on.

1571
01:21:16,238 --> 01:21:17,466
Oh.

1572
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:18,563
It's- Viagra!

1573
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:19,664
What?

1574
01:21:19,741 --> 01:21:20,765
I know what that is.

1575
01:21:20,842 --> 01:21:22,241
What?

1576
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:24,778
You think you'll use that
artificial stuff on me,

1577
01:21:24,846 --> 01:21:26,336
you might as
well shoot me now.

1578
01:21:26,414 --> 01:21:28,006
I'm not gonna
ride your dinghy.

1579
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:29,277
What?

1580
01:21:29,351 --> 01:21:30,784
It's Viagara.

1581
01:21:30,852 --> 01:21:33,013
It's my uncle's name.
It's named after him.

1582
01:21:33,088 --> 01:21:36,580
I'm not gonna ride your dinghy
when you made a promise to

1583
01:21:36,658 --> 01:21:39,024
You shut your mouth, I
promise I won't kill you.

1584
01:21:39,094 --> 01:21:40,118
Go, Go. Go.

1585
01:21:40,195 --> 01:21:41,219
Call my lawyer.

1586
01:21:41,296 --> 01:21:42,786
Where is
she going?

1587
01:21:42,864 --> 01:21:45,355
Back to the casino, we're
sending a helicopter.

1588
01:21:45,433 --> 01:21:47,333
Go! We're heading
down stream to the haven.

1589
01:21:47,402 --> 01:21:48,699
Move. Move. Move.

1590
01:21:56,444 --> 01:21:58,935
Hey! Dawn! Dee!

1591
01:21:59,014 --> 01:22:01,778
I mean, Dawn!

1592
01:22:29,978 --> 01:22:31,843
Let me take
the wheel.

1593
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:39,981
Keys.

1594
01:22:40,055 --> 01:22:41,579
Easy Ma'am.
I just clean 'em.

1595
01:22:41,656 --> 01:22:43,146
The keys!

1596
01:22:43,224 --> 01:22:44,782
She's all yours.

1597
01:22:48,263 --> 01:22:49,992
Untie us.

1598
01:22:52,434 --> 01:22:54,299
Bon voyage!

1599
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:02,944
There it is.
That's Wong's boat.

1600
01:23:05,213 --> 01:23:06,544
You're crazy.

1601
01:23:06,614 --> 01:23:09,276
Take a seat, sweetheart. It's show time!

1602
01:23:13,688 --> 01:23:15,986
Let's move it. Come
on, get the lead out.

1603
01:23:27,435 --> 01:23:29,699
There she is. She's got a goon with her.

1604
01:23:32,374 --> 01:23:35,400
That bitch! She thinks she's
gonna waste Wong before I do.

1605
01:23:35,477 --> 01:23:37,138
Should I
kill her first?

1606
01:23:40,081 --> 01:23:42,845
Let me do it. And you can
take your time with Wong.

1607
01:23:42,917 --> 01:23:45,943
You've already had your
kill today. I want to do it.

1608
01:23:51,593 --> 01:23:52,787
Who the
hell are they?

1609
01:23:54,562 --> 01:23:56,154
I don't know.

1610
01:23:56,231 --> 01:23:59,200
But it looks like
they're chasing,

1611
01:23:59,267 --> 01:24:01,030
that boat!

1612
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:05,267
This is
Agent Gardenia.

1613
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:08,400
I want all available
river patrol craft

1614
01:24:08,476 --> 01:24:12,037
to intercept Hang Wong's
speedboat called the Viagara.

1615
01:24:12,113 --> 01:24:15,139
We're headed downriver
from River Rock Casino.

1616
01:24:15,216 --> 01:24:18,515
Ha, ha. I love this. Like Nam. Woo-hoo!

1617
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:25,382
What are you gonna
do when we catch them?

1618
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:28,156
I don't know. Maybe you
should tell me what's going on.

1619
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:30,697
I don't know. Some rich
guy gave us a bunch of money

1620
01:24:30,765 --> 01:24:33,495
to go to Niagara and take Mr. Wong out.

1621
01:24:33,568 --> 01:24:35,968
What? Take
Wong out?

1622
01:24:36,037 --> 01:24:38,369
Yeah, just take him
out to have a good time.

1623
01:24:43,545 --> 01:24:44,705
Whose following us?

1624
01:24:46,181 --> 01:24:47,705
They're
shooting at us.

1625
01:24:47,782 --> 01:24:49,374
Get down!

1626
01:24:49,451 --> 01:24:50,543
What the hell?

1627
01:24:50,618 --> 01:24:52,586
Hey, take
a position.

1628
01:24:52,654 --> 01:24:54,781
Oh! That's
my friend Dawn.

1629
01:24:54,856 --> 01:24:56,949
Hey, do you know how to swim?

1630
01:24:57,025 --> 01:24:58,390
I was in a
hot tub once.

1631
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:00,121
Then maybe you'd better shut up!

1632
01:25:00,195 --> 01:25:02,095
Don't shoot Dawn!

1633
01:25:02,163 --> 01:25:04,222
Hey, it's
the blonde.

1634
01:25:04,299 --> 01:25:07,530
One of them. Wong must be on to
them. He's got the other blonde.

1635
01:25:07,602 --> 01:25:09,502
There should
be a flare gun.

1636
01:25:10,672 --> 01:25:12,333
Intercept
the speedboat

1637
01:25:12,407 --> 01:25:15,103
with two dark haired
women in it. They're armed.

1638
01:25:15,176 --> 01:25:16,200
I got it.

1639
01:25:16,277 --> 01:25:17,301
Okay.

1640
01:25:18,513 --> 01:25:20,378
Oh my God!

1641
01:25:20,448 --> 01:25:23,474
All units. All units. Gunfire. Gunfire.

1642
01:25:23,551 --> 01:25:25,985
They shot my
dream guy!

1643
01:25:28,456 --> 01:25:30,481
Buzz the one with a weapon. Come on!

1644
01:25:31,826 --> 01:25:32,918
Whoa!

1645
01:25:42,937 --> 01:25:46,805
Drop your weapons, ladies. We
have you covered. Give it up, now!

1646
01:25:57,485 --> 01:25:58,577
God I hope this works.

1647
01:26:02,190 --> 01:26:05,455
I don't know what the hell's
going on. Let's go to Wong's boat.

1648
01:26:12,033 --> 01:26:15,696
Can you say
something, please?

1649
01:26:19,741 --> 01:26:22,767
Patch me
into the P.A.

1650
01:26:29,918 --> 01:26:34,446
Stop that boat now. Lie it down.
Stop. Don't make us fire on you.

1651
01:26:37,358 --> 01:26:39,451
This is Agent
Gardenia, Wong.

1652
01:26:39,527 --> 01:26:43,623
Give it up. Drop your weapons
and prepare to be boarded.

1653
01:26:43,698 --> 01:26:45,723
And with what
am I charged?

1654
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:48,132
Oh, where
do I start, Wong?

1655
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:53,038
And be warned, that blonde that you're
holding might be the infamous Cat.

1656
01:26:53,107 --> 01:26:55,701
Yes, she says she was gonna take me out.

1657
01:26:55,777 --> 01:26:59,008
All units.
All units.

1658
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:01,071
Take everybody
into custody,

1659
01:27:01,149 --> 01:27:04,641
we'll sort it out back at
the River Rock Casino. Out.

1660
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:08,280
I can't wait to
see this report.

1661
01:27:08,356 --> 01:27:09,914
Let's head back
to the casino.

1662
01:27:16,331 --> 01:27:18,925
You know, I was just trying
to show you a good time.

1663
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,264
I can't remember when I've had more fun.

1664
01:27:21,336 --> 01:27:22,826
I had some fun.
You have fun?

1665
01:27:22,904 --> 01:27:24,337
Look at the
camera, people.

1666
01:27:36,517 --> 01:27:38,417
Alright. Let's
go over this.

1667
01:27:38,486 --> 01:27:42,217
The two blondes were Kit and
Cat. So we can arrest them.

1668
01:27:42,290 --> 01:27:45,384
The dark haired girl shot the actor.

1669
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:47,257
So we can
arrest her.

1670
01:27:47,328 --> 01:27:50,024
And Wong
kidnapped Cat.

1671
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:53,295
Can we arrest
him for that?

1672
01:27:53,368 --> 01:27:55,359
I'm not sure.

1673
01:27:55,436 --> 01:27:57,529
Let's go
over it again.

1674
01:27:57,605 --> 01:27:58,799
So-

1675
01:27:58,873 --> 01:28:00,932
It's cold.

1676
01:28:01,009 --> 01:28:03,341
Dee! Oh my God,
you're okay.

1677
01:28:03,411 --> 01:28:04,639
God, you
really love me.

1678
01:28:07,448 --> 01:28:08,608
Mwah!

1679
01:28:08,683 --> 01:28:11,618
Oh, Dee. This is my dream man.

1680
01:28:11,686 --> 01:28:13,517
Ken.
Meet Dee.

1681
01:28:13,588 --> 01:28:17,854
I'm Ken. It's interesting
to meet you. Both.

1682
01:28:19,827 --> 01:28:22,762
I don't understand.
Don't you know who I am?

1683
01:28:22,830 --> 01:28:26,288
You can't arrest me. I'm Hang Wong.

1684
01:28:26,367 --> 01:28:29,097
Did he just say he was hung wrong?

1685
01:28:29,170 --> 01:28:32,697
Yeah, he's Wong. That's
why he's getting arrested.

1686
01:28:32,774 --> 01:28:34,708
So, you're a
Navy Seal, huh?

1687
01:28:34,776 --> 01:28:36,141
Uh, was.

1688
01:28:36,210 --> 01:28:38,269
Navy Seal doesn't
sound very scary.

1689
01:28:38,346 --> 01:28:41,247
Maybe Navy Shark or Navy
Lion. That's a good one.

1690
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:42,613
I'll let
them know.

1691
01:28:42,684 --> 01:28:45,448
Thanks. But you're my seal, now.

1692
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:48,512
When you save someone's life,
you're responsible for it.

1693
01:28:48,589 --> 01:28:51,080
It sounds
good to me.

1694
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:54,060
Dawn tells me you're a talented dancer.

1695
01:28:54,128 --> 01:28:56,153
Well, I try.

1696
01:28:56,230 --> 01:28:58,391
A couple of our dancers
are unable to make it

1697
01:28:58,466 --> 01:28:59,990
for next week's
performance.

1698
01:29:00,068 --> 01:29:02,366
How would you like to be in the show?

1699
01:29:02,437 --> 01:29:03,995
Oh my God,
are you serious?

1700
01:29:04,072 --> 01:29:06,597
Oh my
- I'd love to. Only if Dawn can be in it too.

1701
01:29:06,674 --> 01:29:09,336
I think that can be arranged.

1702
01:29:09,410 --> 01:29:12,106
Oh, my God! We got a job!

1703
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:14,614
Let's arrest
them all.

1704
01:29:14,682 --> 01:29:17,014
Alright everybody,
gather round, listen up.

1705
01:29:17,085 --> 01:29:19,451
Officers, I want you
to arrest these two women.

1706
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:22,887
This is the infamous
Cat and her protegee.

1707
01:29:22,957 --> 01:29:25,892
Oh yeah, I've been
following you for six years.

1708
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:29,157
They're wanted for a string of
murders all across this country.

1709
01:29:29,230 --> 01:29:30,561
No, you
idiot! It's me!

1710
01:29:30,631 --> 01:29:33,327
You've been waiting
six years to capture me.

1711
01:29:33,401 --> 01:29:36,768
I'm the one responsible for killing
over 30 people without a trace.

1712
01:29:36,838 --> 01:29:38,328
I'm the criminal
mastermind!

1713
01:29:38,406 --> 01:29:40,340
I did the Lone Shark
with a piano wire.

1714
01:29:40,408 --> 01:29:42,069
I snapped Louie
Rimoli's neck.

1715
01:29:42,143 --> 01:29:45,135
I
- I'm responsible for blowing up the governor's kitchen

1716
01:29:45,213 --> 01:29:47,943
with putting the explosives
in his pate that day.

1717
01:29:48,015 --> 01:29:50,040
Me! Me! Not
these two idiots.

1718
01:29:50,118 --> 01:29:52,643
I want my credit,
and I want it now!

1719
01:29:54,956 --> 01:29:58,551
She knows about the
piano wire and the pate.

1720
01:29:58,626 --> 01:30:00,355
Pate?

1721
01:30:00,428 --> 01:30:02,453
Arrest that woman!

1722
01:30:02,530 --> 01:30:05,226
Finally,
some respect.

1723
01:30:07,135 --> 01:30:08,727
Well,

1724
01:30:08,803 --> 01:30:10,600
I guess I'm
free to go?

1725
01:30:10,671 --> 01:30:12,468
Oh, wrong-o wungy.

1726
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:16,704
You've been charged with
kidnapping this innocent young girl.

1727
01:30:16,778 --> 01:30:18,075
Cuff 'em!

1728
01:30:18,146 --> 01:30:21,343
What? Wait! Hey! You
can't do this to me.

1729
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:23,407
These girls
are innocent.

1730
01:30:23,484 --> 01:30:24,678
Free to go, ladies.

1731
01:30:27,121 --> 01:30:28,383
Oh, shoot.

1732
01:30:30,358 --> 01:30:32,883
I knew it all along. They
were using them as decoys.

1733
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:34,689
Anybody can
see that.

1734
01:30:34,762 --> 01:30:36,195
So what do
we do now?

1735
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:37,856
Spend a
million dollars.

1736
01:30:37,932 --> 01:30:40,366
Oh my God!

1737
01:30:42,236 --> 01:30:43,464
Dream man.

1738
01:30:43,538 --> 01:30:45,130
Mmm.

1739
01:30:45,206 --> 01:30:48,664
Oh, Virgil.

1740
01:30:53,147 --> 01:30:55,377
Why were you taking
flying lessons, anyway?

1741
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:57,008
Well, Dawn,
statistically,

1742
01:30:57,084 --> 01:31:00,451
um, flying is safer
than driving, I read it.

1743
01:31:00,521 --> 01:31:01,613
For you,
definitely.

1744
01:31:02,790 --> 01:31:03,916
Hi, guys.

1745
01:31:03,991 --> 01:31:05,754
Hey, you all
little chitlands. Hi!

1746
01:31:05,827 --> 01:31:07,021
Hi.

1747
01:31:07,094 --> 01:31:08,755
Welcome to
Dee and Dawn's

1748
01:31:08,830 --> 01:31:10,161
Famous
Turtle Sanctuary.

1749
01:31:10,231 --> 01:31:12,597
One day we'll have
a lot of these turtles.

1750
01:31:12,667 --> 01:31:14,100
We're gonna
rescue them,

1751
01:31:14,168 --> 01:31:16,500
and they'll be able to
run free and have fun.

1752
01:31:16,571 --> 01:31:18,266
Um, this
is Virgil.

1753
01:31:18,339 --> 01:31:19,363
It's Virgil. Yes.

1754
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:20,805
He's my friend.

1755
01:31:20,875 --> 01:31:23,503
And Virgil does a lot
of tricks. Right, Dee?

1756
01:31:23,578 --> 01:31:27,776
Right. Yeah. Kind of. There you go.

1757
01:31:27,849 --> 01:31:29,248
Come on, Virgil.

1758
01:31:29,317 --> 01:31:31,080
Wow, look at him.
Come on, Virgil.

1759
01:31:31,152 --> 01:31:32,176
He likes you guys.

1760
01:31:34,288 --> 01:31:37,815
We only have one now, but we're
gonna have a lot pretty soon

1761
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:41,557
Now, turtles
can teach us a lot.

1762
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:47,829
We already know
how to do that.
