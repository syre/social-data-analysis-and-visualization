1
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,465
Help! No!

2
00:04:42,464 --> 00:04:43,624
Let her go.

3
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,318
You have what you came for.

4
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:12,767
Tell your master we've arrived.

5
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:20,942
He already knows.

6
00:05:46,586 --> 00:05:47,848
I am standing here outside...

7
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,926
the Alexander Satellite
Network studios,

8
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:51,713
where this teeming,
overflow crowd...

9
00:05:51,673 --> 00:05:54,164
awaits any chance
to get a peek inside.

10
00:05:54,873 --> 00:05:58,070
We have had an overwhelming
response to my next guest.

11
00:05:57,976 --> 00:06:01,742
Crowds have been lining up
outside this studio all night...

12
00:06:01,623 --> 00:06:06,356
to see this special interview
of this world renowned speaker.

13
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,432
His new book, " Empower Your
Future by Embracing Our Past,"

14
00:06:10,296 --> 00:06:13,732
explores mankind's unending
quest for meaning and purpose.

15
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:17,101
Please welcome Dr. Gillen Lane.

16
00:06:17,015 --> 00:06:18,243
Let's go. Let's go.

17
00:06:36,885 --> 00:06:37,874
Stop.

18
00:06:39,637 --> 00:06:42,506
That was, uh, quite an entrance.

19
00:06:42,387 --> 00:06:46,756
Very different for a Doctor in
World Religion and Mythology...

20
00:06:46,612 --> 00:06:48,307
from Cambridge University.

21
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:50,574
They didn't know
what to do with me either.

22
00:06:53,907 --> 00:06:57,434
Like I say in my seminars, what
creates an extraordinary life,

23
00:06:57,332 --> 00:06:59,630
is an extraordinary mind-set.

24
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:01,697
Well, in addition to
your many accomplishments,

25
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,084
you seem to be an authority
on the Bible Code,

26
00:07:04,018 --> 00:07:08,114
which is back in the headlines
after Rabbi Aaron Rostenberg...

27
00:07:07,986 --> 00:07:10,216
was found murdered
in Jerusalem last week.

28
00:07:10,225 --> 00:07:12,557
Rostenberg's loss is tragic.

29
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:14,693
I was fortunate to meet him
on several occasions.

30
00:07:14,928 --> 00:07:19,627
Explain what this Bible Code is
and how it works.

31
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:25,976
Crisscrossing the Torah is
a code of words and phrases...

32
00:07:25,968 --> 00:07:28,562
that not only reveals
our past and present,

33
00:07:28,496 --> 00:07:30,327
but foretells our future.

34
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,258
Some even believe it contains
the blueprints of the universe.

35
00:07:37,647 --> 00:07:41,583
See, after removing all
the spaces and punctuation,

36
00:07:41,455 --> 00:07:44,549
hidden words appear by skipping
equal numbers of letters:

37
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:47,489
For example,
every fourth, 12th, 50th,

38
00:07:47,406 --> 00:07:49,169
like a giant crossword puzzle.

39
00:07:49,134 --> 00:07:52,331
Hitler, the Kennedy
assassinations, all encoded.

40
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:55,298
Isaac newton spent
the last 10 years of his life...

41
00:07:55,214 --> 00:07:57,580
studying the Bible Code.

42
00:07:58,028 --> 00:07:59,552
Another example,
the computer found...

43
00:07:59,533 --> 00:08:03,162
"Princess" and "Diana" encoded
at the same skip distance.

44
00:08:03,822 --> 00:08:08,555
And around it, "Paris,"
"tunnel," even "Aug"...August.

45
00:08:08,396 --> 00:08:13,561
And "5757"...
1997 in our calendar.

46
00:08:13,836 --> 00:08:16,031
The very month and year
she was killed.

47
00:08:17,483 --> 00:08:20,316
Most amazingly,
in the "Book of Daniel..."

48
00:08:21,003 --> 00:08:24,632
an angel tells him to seal up
the book until the end of days.

49
00:08:25,354 --> 00:08:28,118
But Rostenberg may have found
the key to unlock it.

50
00:08:28,043 --> 00:08:35,677
See, he believed the Bible was
a holographic computer program,

51
00:08:35,401 --> 00:08:38,495
and instead of two dimensions,
it should be studied in three.

52
00:08:39,369 --> 00:08:43,738
If this could be achieved,
the code would actually...

53
00:08:43,593 --> 00:08:45,959
feed us prophecies
of our coming future.

54
00:08:47,784 --> 00:08:49,149
Anyway...

55
00:08:51,592 --> 00:08:54,117
The reason I discuss this
in my book is because...

56
00:08:55,176 --> 00:08:57,701
what we want to believe
as religion...

57
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:01,405
traces back to myths borne of
our collective consciousness.

58
00:09:01,287 --> 00:09:04,984
Has anyone raised the question
of how people like yourself...

59
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:08,243
can believe in these
hidden codes within the Bible,

60
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,293
and yet not in the Bible itself.

61
00:09:10,695 --> 00:09:11,684
Yeah.

62
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,822
You mean like...

63
00:09:13,798 --> 00:09:19,236
"Jesus loves me, this I know,
for the Bible tells me so?"

64
00:09:21,989 --> 00:09:23,183
Yes, exactly.

65
00:09:28,229 --> 00:09:31,130
My mother used to sing me
that song,

66
00:09:31,044 --> 00:09:32,477
but you know what?

67
00:09:39,716 --> 00:09:43,049
She died in a tragic car
accident when I was 10...

68
00:09:43,811 --> 00:09:48,305
and I finally realized that
her faith in this loving god,

69
00:09:48,163 --> 00:09:50,427
her truth, was just a myth.

70
00:09:51,042 --> 00:09:53,510
Therefore, myth must be truth.

71
00:09:53,731 --> 00:09:56,393
Well, that has obviously
colored your attitude a bit.

72
00:09:58,722 --> 00:10:02,385
Cassandra, my goal is simply
to create an environment...

73
00:10:02,274 --> 00:10:04,606
to see change in people's lives.

74
00:10:07,425 --> 00:10:08,824
Somebody out there say "change."

75
00:10:08,802 --> 00:10:10,997
- Change!
- That's right.

76
00:10:12,513 --> 00:10:14,481
Change is what we're about.

77
00:10:15,009 --> 00:10:19,503
I've seen too many held back
waiting on some higher power.

78
00:10:19,361 --> 00:10:25,960
Not until we grasp
that we are the higher power,

79
00:10:25,728 --> 00:10:28,356
can we take the next step
in our evolution...

80
00:10:28,286 --> 00:10:30,811
and finally become whole.

81
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,901
Stone Alexander has again
opened his gates...

82
00:11:51,863 --> 00:11:55,264
for his annual celebrity gala
and auction for charity.

83
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:58,322
And here comes the world famous,
globe trotting Dr. Gillen Lane.

84
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:03,725
Tell us, are you a buyer
or seller this afternoon?

85
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,073
Oh, I'm just here to drink
some fine champagne.

86
00:12:06,966 --> 00:12:08,456
And support a worthy cause.

87
00:12:09,686 --> 00:12:13,213
Alexander, the beloved media
mogul turned political dynamo,

88
00:12:13,109 --> 00:12:16,340
has recently been named
chairman of the European Union.

89
00:12:16,245 --> 00:12:18,941
He plans to celebrate
his good fortune today...

90
00:12:18,868 --> 00:12:20,893
by auctioning his
Arabian stallions,

91
00:12:20,852 --> 00:12:24,117
with all proceeds going to the
African Children's Relief Fund.

92
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:53,209
Friends, Romans, countrymen,
lend me your money.

93
00:12:54,929 --> 00:12:56,829
Thank you so much for coming.

94
00:12:57,105 --> 00:13:01,439
My friend Princess
Gabrielle Fuccine of Tuscany...

95
00:13:01,297 --> 00:13:04,425
has requested this opportunity
to say a few words to you.

96
00:13:11,632 --> 00:13:12,929
In the last year,

97
00:13:12,912 --> 00:13:17,246
Chairman Alexander's
corporations have focused on...

98
00:13:17,104 --> 00:13:20,369
new ways to combat our
diminishing resources.

99
00:13:20,271 --> 00:13:23,968
Today, we have the first signs
of a breakthrough:

100
00:13:23,855 --> 00:13:28,224
The development of a cheap,
high nutrient wafer...

101
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:31,639
that can sustain an active
person for more than a day.

102
00:13:35,661 --> 00:13:39,290
And a revolutionary new form
of ocean desalinization...

103
00:13:39,182 --> 00:13:43,846
that will bring life-giving
water to the driest of deserts.

104
00:13:45,228 --> 00:13:47,458
Salute. Cheers.

105
00:13:48,621 --> 00:13:51,852
In light of
these remarkable advancements,

106
00:13:51,756 --> 00:13:54,987
I am proud to present
Chairman Alexander...

107
00:13:54,892 --> 00:14:00,330
with this year's United Nations
Humanitarian Award.

108
00:14:19,338 --> 00:14:20,896
Mr. Chairman.

109
00:14:20,873 --> 00:14:25,333
Ah, Mr. Mythology,
the motivation guru.

110
00:14:25,193 --> 00:14:26,683
It's all right, Dominic.

111
00:14:27,177 --> 00:14:30,806
So, are you going to help us
raise the roof around here?

112
00:14:30,697 --> 00:14:32,995
I'm sure the bids will be
out of my league.

113
00:14:32,936 --> 00:14:34,927
Oh, come now, Dr. Lane.

114
00:14:34,888 --> 00:14:36,913
What creates
an extraordinary life...

115
00:14:36,872 --> 00:14:38,567
is an extraordinary mind-set.

116
00:14:39,495 --> 00:14:41,463
I believe you've met
Miss Barashe.

117
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:43,808
I'm a big fan.

118
00:14:46,182 --> 00:14:47,547
Please excuse me.

119
00:14:47,527 --> 00:14:51,122
Change and forward motion
is everything.

120
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:55,076
I'd like to get together
with you and set up a meeting.

121
00:15:02,213 --> 00:15:05,205
- Who's his friend?
- Oh, you mean Dominic.

122
00:15:05,124 --> 00:15:06,716
He's one of Stone's top aides.

123
00:15:06,692 --> 00:15:08,091
A bit odd, for sure.

124
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:10,162
I think he used to be a priest.

125
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,273
Well, if I were Stone,
I'd watch my back.

126
00:15:12,804 --> 00:15:14,795
Ah, brilliant.

127
00:15:17,507 --> 00:15:19,600
- Always come prepared.
- Oh, thank you.

128
00:15:22,692 --> 00:15:25,684
- May I?
- That's very kind of you.

129
00:15:26,115 --> 00:15:27,605
What would your wife say?

130
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:33,261
We're separated,
so probably not too much.

131
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:37,158
Almost as effective as
your personal power tapes.

132
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,211
Did I do something to offend you
in a former life?

133
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,537
No. Only in this one.

134
00:15:43,298 --> 00:15:45,391
You know, Stone is a good man.

135
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:46,869
He doesn't deserve to
be exploited.

136
00:15:46,849 --> 00:15:49,409
Hey, I believe in what
he's doing for the world.

137
00:15:49,345 --> 00:15:51,540
I'd like to help people where
it's not about making money.

138
00:15:51,489 --> 00:15:55,016
Brilliant. You know the best
thing about your power tapes?

139
00:15:56,319 --> 00:15:58,446
The money back guarantee.

140
00:16:37,531 --> 00:16:38,793
So much for my run.

141
00:16:39,676 --> 00:16:40,802
Your rack, Gillen.

142
00:16:43,196 --> 00:16:44,288
You OK?

143
00:16:45,883 --> 00:16:46,872
Of course.

144
00:16:47,516 --> 00:16:49,541
Always out to play
the lone wolf.

145
00:16:51,515 --> 00:16:52,675
How's your family?

146
00:16:54,106 --> 00:16:55,539
What's that supposed to mean?

147
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,244
I don't know.

148
00:16:57,211 --> 00:16:59,702
Just a day back from pursuing
the likes of Stone Alexander,

149
00:16:59,674 --> 00:17:02,609
which I told you was a mistake,
and now you're over here.

150
00:17:02,842 --> 00:17:05,106
Hey, you invited me, remember?

151
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:07,416
You boys ready for
the good stuff?

152
00:17:07,354 --> 00:17:08,946
But you spend all your time out.

153
00:17:09,498 --> 00:17:11,090
Tennis. Golf.

154
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,093
Why are you doing this to me?

155
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:17,175
Dorothy spoke with Jennifer.

156
00:17:17,112 --> 00:17:18,443
Is that why you had me over?

157
00:17:18,424 --> 00:17:21,052
Why didn't you tell us that
you two were having problems?

158
00:17:20,984 --> 00:17:23,077
She said you're filing
for divorce.

159
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,840
Not everyone can stay married
for 30 years, Jack.

160
00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:28,148
32.

161
00:17:28,983 --> 00:17:30,384
We're trying to help.

162
00:17:30,327 --> 00:17:31,885
What about little Maddie?

163
00:17:31,864 --> 00:17:33,889
What do you want to hear?

164
00:17:33,847 --> 00:17:35,815
That I'm losing the best thing
that ever happened to me,

165
00:17:35,767 --> 00:17:36,995
but I don't know how to fix it?

166
00:17:37,046 --> 00:17:38,138
That's a start.

167
00:17:38,135 --> 00:17:39,625
We're friends, Gillen.

168
00:17:39,607 --> 00:17:41,666
Friends share things
with each other.

169
00:17:41,622 --> 00:17:44,682
Gillen, we've had
our tough times, too.

170
00:17:44,598 --> 00:17:47,066
Being the wife of a senator
hasn't been that easy.

171
00:17:46,997 --> 00:17:48,225
Sorry.

172
00:17:48,213 --> 00:17:50,977
We just promised each other
that we'd stick it out,

173
00:17:50,901 --> 00:17:53,233
that we'd make it work,
no matter what.

174
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,696
No matter what.

175
00:18:01,684 --> 00:18:02,810
Fine.

176
00:18:02,804 --> 00:18:04,499
What do you know about visions?

177
00:18:04,469 --> 00:18:05,800
Visions?

178
00:18:06,547 --> 00:18:08,014
You're the mythology expert.

179
00:18:09,396 --> 00:18:10,556
I've been seeing them.

180
00:18:12,051 --> 00:18:13,678
What kind of visions?

181
00:18:16,436 --> 00:18:18,734
I don't know.
Weird ones.

182
00:18:19,443 --> 00:18:22,708
Your collective consciousness
is telling you something.

183
00:18:22,611 --> 00:18:25,409
Great, now you're mocking me.

184
00:18:27,122 --> 00:18:31,684
I wouldn't mock the man who
empowered my last election.

185
00:18:32,721 --> 00:18:35,189
I don't know about visions.
I never had one.

186
00:18:35,122 --> 00:18:37,113
But I know about marriage.

187
00:18:37,072 --> 00:18:39,063
And I know about family.

188
00:18:39,025 --> 00:18:40,925
And I know the worth of a man...

189
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,110
will show in the countenance
of his wife's face.

190
00:19:04,111 --> 00:19:06,807
This, uh, this Dr. Lane.

191
00:19:06,734 --> 00:19:08,133
What do you think of him?

192
00:19:09,197 --> 00:19:10,926
I don't know what to think.

193
00:19:12,334 --> 00:19:14,859
Well, I find him interesting.

194
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:16,231
A man of vision.

195
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,563
Not enough people
with vision around me.

196
00:19:21,676 --> 00:19:24,110
Because you know in your heart,
you know in your soul.

197
00:19:42,442 --> 00:19:44,171
- Hello, Gillen.
- Daddy!

198
00:19:44,138 --> 00:19:46,231
Where's my birthday girl?

199
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:49,349
You can't keep spoiling her.
You already sent her birthday...

200
00:19:55,274 --> 00:19:56,502
Where are you, pumpkin?

201
00:19:57,193 --> 00:19:58,854
Sweetie...

202
00:19:59,305 --> 00:20:02,832
I need some...

203
00:20:03,304 --> 00:20:04,635
sugar!

204
00:20:07,433 --> 00:20:09,833
Guess who else came to visit you
on your birthday?

205
00:20:09,768 --> 00:20:10,757
Tickle spiders!

206
00:20:12,551 --> 00:20:13,643
Oh yeah?

207
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,734
Well, my tickle spiders are
bigger Than your tickle spiders.

208
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:19,249
I reckon if you'd loved me
half as much as her,

209
00:20:19,271 --> 00:20:20,704
we'd have one heck
of a marriage.

210
00:20:29,734 --> 00:20:31,292
Don't tell me it's not true.

211
00:20:33,094 --> 00:20:35,790
Every time you come home
I get a "hi,"

212
00:20:35,718 --> 00:20:38,346
and she gets tickles and kisses.

213
00:20:40,293 --> 00:20:41,851
You want tickles and kisses?

214
00:20:42,437 --> 00:20:43,836
I'm serious, Gillen.

215
00:20:44,293 --> 00:20:48,730
Sometimes I wonder if you take
those speaking engagements...

216
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,572
just so you don't have
to talk to me.

217
00:20:52,772 --> 00:20:54,000
I got to finish the cake.

218
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:55,887
- Jen...
- No, Gillen, don't.

219
00:20:55,843 --> 00:20:57,868
I took a teaching
position at the university.

220
00:20:59,011 --> 00:21:00,979
I want to be here...

221
00:21:02,466 --> 00:21:03,956
for you and Maddie.

222
00:21:04,835 --> 00:21:07,827
I know it'll take some time,
but I'll make it work.

223
00:21:13,475 --> 00:21:15,272
As we go deeper into our dreams,

224
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:17,293
we see how interconnected
we all are.

225
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:22,209
Someone say,
"my life might be..."

226
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,775
"My life might be..."

227
00:21:23,745 --> 00:21:27,078
- "someone else's dream."
- "Someone else's dream."

228
00:21:28,992 --> 00:21:32,553
And mythology is to society what
dreams are to the individual.

229
00:21:32,896 --> 00:21:35,490
Religion will have us believe...

230
00:21:35,424 --> 00:21:40,123
there are demons fighting
and battling over our souls.

231
00:21:40,863 --> 00:21:43,559
But who needs that.
We do well enough on our own.

232
00:21:50,847 --> 00:21:52,940
- Thanks.
- Sign my book, Professor?

233
00:21:56,222 --> 00:21:57,450
Thanks.

234
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:01,472
Stone Alexander apologizes...

235
00:22:01,437 --> 00:22:03,632
for having too many
guests and too little time.

236
00:22:03,582 --> 00:22:07,780
He would like to invite you
back to his world peace summit.

237
00:22:08,509 --> 00:22:11,910
You'll have to apologies for me.
I won't be able to make it.

238
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,719
I'm sure that'll disappoint him.

239
00:23:27,637 --> 00:23:30,299
- How do I look?
- The studio says you look great.

240
00:23:30,293 --> 00:23:32,158
Thank you, can you come in
on a medium shot?

241
00:23:32,117 --> 00:23:34,108
- OK.
- Tell me when you're framed.

242
00:23:34,133 --> 00:23:35,122
Anytime.

243
00:23:42,613 --> 00:23:44,547
Are you rolling?
We've got to get this.

244
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,900
We're interrupting right now
for a breaking story.

245
00:23:46,835 --> 00:23:49,702
Let's go live to
Cassandra Barashe in Jerusalem.

246
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,609
Cassandra?

247
00:23:51,188 --> 00:23:53,884
Behind me are the raging flames
of where the Dome of the Rock,

248
00:23:53,811 --> 00:23:56,871
one of Islam's most
sacred sites, once stood.

249
00:23:56,786 --> 00:24:01,052
Just moments ago the shrine was
rocked by an explosion...

250
00:24:08,371 --> 00:24:09,497
We lost the feed.

251
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,082
Go find out what happened,
we lost the feed.

252
00:24:26,417 --> 00:24:28,180
Where is Benjamin?

253
00:24:28,143 --> 00:24:31,510
He is gone.
You cannot help him now.

254
00:24:31,407 --> 00:24:33,898
We have a message
for you to carry,

255
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,274
but we must leave this place.

256
00:24:41,678 --> 00:24:43,646
Come with us, please.

257
00:24:48,622 --> 00:24:51,591
Into its seventh day,
both Israel and Palestine...

258
00:24:51,502 --> 00:24:54,665
are denying any involvement
in last week's explosions.

259
00:24:55,406 --> 00:24:58,136
E.U. Chairman Alexander has been
holding talks with both sides...

260
00:24:58,061 --> 00:24:59,528
for the last 3 days,

261
00:24:59,565 --> 00:25:00,930
but little progress
has been made.

262
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:04,500
World markets are
under severe pressure...

263
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:08,089
for fear fighting will spill
into the rest of the region.

264
00:25:07,981 --> 00:25:10,108
Oil is skyrocketing
as the Saudis threaten...

265
00:25:10,123 --> 00:25:13,889
to stop shipments unless Israel
confesses to the explosions.

266
00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:19,560
Looks like Maddie's out.

267
00:25:22,219 --> 00:25:23,914
Are you going back
to your place tonight?

268
00:25:24,938 --> 00:25:26,405
Or...

269
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:28,307
You could stay here.

270
00:25:29,578 --> 00:25:31,705
We could pretend like
we're newlyweds again.

271
00:25:33,257 --> 00:25:36,784
No kid, staying up late.

272
00:25:39,881 --> 00:25:42,941
- What's this?
- It's nothing.

273
00:25:42,856 --> 00:25:44,346
Stone Alexander?

274
00:25:46,376 --> 00:25:47,934
Why didn't you tell me
about this?

275
00:25:48,776 --> 00:25:50,505
Nothing to tell.
I turned it down.

276
00:25:52,937 --> 00:25:54,495
But now you're reconsidering?

277
00:25:57,735 --> 00:26:00,135
You were moving
back in this weekend.

278
00:26:07,495 --> 00:26:09,463
You know, to tell you the truth,

279
00:26:09,415 --> 00:26:11,542
I'm surprised it lasted
this long.

280
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:13,959
- It's just a week.
- A week.

281
00:26:13,893 --> 00:26:17,192
I made you and Maddie
a promise.

282
00:26:17,093 --> 00:26:18,424
I'm gonna make it work.

283
00:26:26,308 --> 00:26:27,639
It's just a week.

284
00:26:38,052 --> 00:26:41,852
Both Palestinian and Israeli
casualties continue to mount.

285
00:26:41,731 --> 00:26:44,859
E.U. Chairman Alexander
remains optimistic...

286
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,568
that he can still get both sides
to sit down to talks.

287
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:51,238
Fighting in the region escalated
to a higher level yesterday...

288
00:26:51,169 --> 00:26:55,230
as tanks from both sides
exchanged fire near Bethlehem.

289
00:26:56,674 --> 00:26:59,268
Sir, Israel is pulling out
of the talks.

290
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:06,946
I'm afraid they find
your position unreasonable.

291
00:27:07,649 --> 00:27:09,742
Tell them unreasonable people
shape the world.

292
00:27:11,808 --> 00:27:15,608
Tell them it was unreasonable
for their fathers to think...

293
00:27:15,487 --> 00:27:16,954
they could get a homeland again.

294
00:27:17,984 --> 00:27:19,849
Then tell them you'll continue
to be unreasonable...

295
00:27:19,807 --> 00:27:22,605
- until they make a deal.
- Well, that's all well and good.

296
00:27:22,591 --> 00:27:24,582
No, no, no, no.

297
00:27:25,566 --> 00:27:27,796
I'd like you to contact
the Israeli Prime Minister...

298
00:27:27,742 --> 00:27:30,438
with Lane's excellent advice,

299
00:27:30,366 --> 00:27:33,358
and I want you to get his bags
and lay another place at dinner.

300
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,061
- Now!
- Yes, sir.

301
00:27:37,694 --> 00:27:38,683
Leave me.

302
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:47,043
I knew you'd be an asset.

303
00:27:47,005 --> 00:27:48,836
That's all
these wild siblings need:

304
00:27:48,797 --> 00:27:52,233
A beast to tame their savagery.

305
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:54,753
Ah, but it's not just them.

306
00:27:54,684 --> 00:27:56,652
We're all so savage,
so disjointed,

307
00:27:56,603 --> 00:28:00,061
so... so independent.

308
00:28:00,028 --> 00:28:03,896
There's no order,
no direction, no common...

309
00:28:03,771 --> 00:28:06,137
- Vision.
- Yes.

310
00:28:07,483 --> 00:28:08,472
Rome.

311
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:12,211
The Roman empire emerged
after a century of strife,

312
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:14,091
not unlike our own century,

313
00:28:14,043 --> 00:28:20,004
yet Pax Romanus ushered in
200 years of global peace.

314
00:28:19,802 --> 00:28:21,667
Art, literature, culture...

315
00:28:21,626 --> 00:28:24,356
the world was united.

316
00:28:24,281 --> 00:28:26,078
And that is what
I would like to see.

317
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,458
Oh yes, like you,
I like to create a climate...

318
00:28:29,401 --> 00:28:32,859
to foster change
in people's lives.

319
00:28:32,761 --> 00:28:36,697
Yes, I'd like to see us take
the next step in our evolution!

320
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,807
What we need is
someone to rally behind.

321
00:28:52,822 --> 00:28:53,811
Someone to...

322
00:28:54,742 --> 00:28:58,337
- What is this music?
- Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov.

323
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:03,255
Oh, he makes me feel alive!
He inspires me.

324
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:05,252
Yes, inspires.

325
00:29:05,718 --> 00:29:08,915
We need an archetypal figure
to embody the message.

326
00:29:10,517 --> 00:29:14,283
Like... Dr. Martin Luther King...

327
00:29:15,316 --> 00:29:16,647
Gandhi...

328
00:29:18,292 --> 00:29:21,750
A new Caesar to usher
in a new peace!

329
00:29:21,652 --> 00:29:26,021
Oh no, no, no, not Caesar.

330
00:29:25,876 --> 00:29:29,175
Why, he doth stride the narrow
world like a Colossus!

331
00:29:29,075 --> 00:29:31,873
And we petty men walk
beneath his huge legs...

332
00:29:31,796 --> 00:29:35,254
and peek about to find ourselves
dishonorable graves.

333
00:29:35,155 --> 00:29:38,488
Oh, no, no,
I'm not that ambitious.

334
00:29:40,434 --> 00:29:44,029
I'm going to tell you something
to which few are yet privy.

335
00:29:45,394 --> 00:29:48,625
The bombings,
the food shortages...

336
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:51,499
the epidemics...
all connected.

337
00:29:51,409 --> 00:29:53,070
Who? Why?

338
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,373
Well, I don't yet know,
and that's what makes our job...

339
00:29:55,312 --> 00:29:56,779
all the more urgent.

340
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,152
Our job?

341
00:30:04,112 --> 00:30:06,046
The finest Barolo
in the land.

342
00:30:08,751 --> 00:30:11,015
From the vineyards
of Stone Alexander...

343
00:30:11,951 --> 00:30:13,509
A man of many talents.

344
00:30:14,511 --> 00:30:16,706
My father was a grower.

345
00:30:16,655 --> 00:30:19,055
My father...

346
00:30:18,991 --> 00:30:21,289
Fathers, that like
so many Alexanders,

347
00:30:21,231 --> 00:30:23,597
have been these parts
from morn to even fort!

348
00:30:25,069 --> 00:30:27,333
Dishonor not your mother.

349
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:31,612
Oh yes! He was also a drunken,
wife-beating womanizer...

350
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,233
a vile man.

351
00:30:35,629 --> 00:30:39,224
I've tried to separate the wheat
from the chaff, as it were.

352
00:30:54,826 --> 00:30:57,124
You've reached the Lanes.
Leave a message.

353
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,145
Hi guys.

354
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:03,735
Jen, I hoped you'd be there,

355
00:31:03,626 --> 00:31:07,255
but, well, um,
I've been offered a position...

356
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:09,735
as Chairman Alexander's
Minister of Information.

357
00:31:09,674 --> 00:31:11,665
We'd head off on
a goodwill tour tomorrow.

358
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:13,024
Don't know for how long yet,

359
00:31:13,002 --> 00:31:15,562
but everything inside me
says that this is it.

360
00:31:15,497 --> 00:31:17,556
This is my reason for being.

361
00:31:18,729 --> 00:31:20,162
Tell Maddie I love her.

362
00:31:20,649 --> 00:31:22,776
I'll try to get in touch
as soon as I can.

363
00:31:24,489 --> 00:31:25,478
Take care of yourself.

364
00:31:30,247 --> 00:31:31,475
Family...

365
00:31:32,584 --> 00:31:34,552
or the greater good?

366
00:31:36,423 --> 00:31:38,357
Oh, it's a hard choice.

367
00:31:40,422 --> 00:31:42,720
I had to make it, too...

368
00:31:42,726 --> 00:31:43,954
a long time ago.

369
00:31:45,383 --> 00:31:46,680
Ever regret it?

370
00:31:48,262 --> 00:31:52,255
You and I...
we have a higher calling.

371
00:31:55,302 --> 00:31:56,769
So come.

372
00:31:56,741 --> 00:31:59,904
Let's go and celebrate
our new association.

373
00:31:59,813 --> 00:32:03,271
Stone Alexander and
motivational guru Gillen Lane...

374
00:32:03,173 --> 00:32:07,439
embarked today on what they deem
a worldwide tour of goodwill.

375
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:11,101
They start the tour with peace
and unity rally in Washington,

376
00:32:10,979 --> 00:32:14,676
to be followed by gatherings
in capitals around the globe.

377
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,907
The Stock Market leapt
to new heights...

378
00:32:17,859 --> 00:32:21,761
with Stone Alexander's proposal
to create a global currency.

379
00:32:22,179 --> 00:32:24,545
He followed his announcement
by offering to donate...

380
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:27,282
his latest desalinization plants
to struggling nations...

381
00:32:27,202 --> 00:32:29,864
that would need help with
jump-starting their economies.

382
00:32:32,002 --> 00:32:35,563
In Jerusalem, crowds of curious
onlookers have been gathering...

383
00:32:35,521 --> 00:32:37,421
around two unidentified men...

384
00:32:37,441 --> 00:32:40,342
who are claiming to be
prophets sent from God...

385
00:32:40,321 --> 00:32:42,551
to warn the world
of its coming end.

386
00:32:42,497 --> 00:32:44,863
At the vatican, Gillen Lane,

387
00:32:44,802 --> 00:32:47,703
announcing the formation of a
united world religious council,

388
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,584
claimed that the world is
not at an end,

389
00:32:49,537 --> 00:32:51,505
but at a glorious new beginning.

390
00:32:51,457 --> 00:32:54,426
Following the conference,
Dr. Lane will remain in Rome,

391
00:32:54,336 --> 00:32:57,737
taking some much-deserved
rest at Alexander's castle.

392
00:33:07,199 --> 00:33:08,257
Hello?

393
00:33:08,254 --> 00:33:10,313
You must stop
the Mideast summit.

394
00:33:11,294 --> 00:33:13,762
What? Who is this?

395
00:33:13,695 --> 00:33:16,323
You cannot allow it to proceed.

396
00:33:16,254 --> 00:33:18,552
The summit's top secret,
hasn't even been set yet.

397
00:33:18,494 --> 00:33:21,952
- Who is this?
- It plays right into their hand.

398
00:33:21,853 --> 00:33:23,320
Whose hand?
Who is this?

399
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:25,557
I know about
Rostenberg's program!

400
00:33:26,397 --> 00:33:28,490
I can't be part
of it any longer.

401
00:33:28,861 --> 00:33:34,527
Meet me at the piazza
tomorrow at 2:00... alone.

402
00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:36,164
The truth shall set you free.

403
00:34:08,537 --> 00:34:12,371
And then he said,
the truth shall set you free.

404
00:34:12,248 --> 00:34:13,579
Probably just a wacko.

405
00:34:13,561 --> 00:34:16,997
I think you should meet him.
Who knows what we might learn?

406
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,719
I'll send some men along
for protection.

407
00:34:19,448 --> 00:34:20,779
No.

408
00:34:26,166 --> 00:34:29,658
If I go, it should be alone.
I don't want to scare him off.

409
00:35:03,603 --> 00:35:05,764
And this is all he gave you?

410
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:09,432
He didn't say who was after him?
Nothing?

411
00:35:09,362 --> 00:35:10,989
He didn't have a chance.

412
00:35:11,027 --> 00:35:12,255
I should never have let
you go alone.

413
00:35:12,242 --> 00:35:13,539
- I should have known...
- But he said...

414
00:35:13,523 --> 00:35:15,388
I don't care what he said!

415
00:35:16,338 --> 00:35:17,532
You could have been killed!

416
00:35:17,906 --> 00:35:19,373
What's this all mean?

417
00:35:20,082 --> 00:35:24,075
Wild siblings tamed by beast?
Those are practically my words.

418
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,479
And then the Hebrew code.

419
00:35:26,385 --> 00:35:27,818
To be honest, I don't know.

420
00:35:30,802 --> 00:35:34,101
What if this was designed
to dissuade us from the summit?

421
00:35:35,185 --> 00:35:38,245
I don't know how it was learned,
but I do know what it tells me.

422
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,628
We need to move ahead
before something else happens.

423
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,255
Get me the Israeli
Prime Minister on the line...

424
00:35:42,224 --> 00:35:44,021
and prepare the jet for Israel.

425
00:35:46,799 --> 00:35:50,428
I'm telling you, no, no, no,
I won't agree!

426
00:35:50,383 --> 00:35:52,613
No, I want it understood...

427
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:55,722
that we will not give up
one more grain of sand!

428
00:35:56,558 --> 00:35:58,355
My people will not stand for it!

429
00:35:58,318 --> 00:36:00,582
Gentlemen! Please!

430
00:36:01,038 --> 00:36:04,337
I understand your fears
over hidden agendas,

431
00:36:04,238 --> 00:36:06,866
but Chairman Alexander
is a reasonable man,

432
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:08,094
a giver, not a taker.

433
00:36:09,998 --> 00:36:12,660
Gentlemen, let's not get hung up
on negatives here.

434
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:16,583
Chairman Alexander has given
his wealth to the world.

435
00:36:17,516 --> 00:36:19,450
He wants to give it to you.

436
00:36:20,781 --> 00:36:23,341
And as a show of good faith...

437
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:30,429
I would like to make
to you all... a proposition.

438
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:35,255
I am very pleased
and proud to announce...

439
00:36:35,116 --> 00:36:37,209
a 7-year peace treaty...

440
00:36:37,834 --> 00:36:40,268
that not only secures
the borders of Israel,

441
00:36:40,202 --> 00:36:45,731
but grants to the Palestinian
people an independent state.

442
00:36:47,977 --> 00:36:49,706
To help restore hope,

443
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:52,142
I have agreed to begin
the healing...

444
00:36:52,073 --> 00:36:54,541
by personally funding
the rebuilding...

445
00:36:54,474 --> 00:36:56,942
both of the Dome of the Rock...

446
00:36:56,873 --> 00:36:59,341
and the famed
King Solomon's Temple...

447
00:36:59,273 --> 00:37:02,401
side by side
on the Temple Mount!

448
00:37:05,737 --> 00:37:06,897
Gillen...

449
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:09,059
Congratulations.

450
00:37:10,151 --> 00:37:11,516
Congratulations.

451
00:37:19,271 --> 00:37:22,798
Listen to me carefully.
Your life is in danger.

452
00:37:24,455 --> 00:37:27,356
OK, where's the camera?
Stone put you up to this, right?

453
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:28,891
Gillen, I am serious.

454
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,838
Look, I don't understand
any of this,

455
00:37:30,789 --> 00:37:33,690
but I have a message for you
from those prophets.

456
00:37:35,013 --> 00:37:38,005
They said to follow
the pages of blood.

457
00:37:39,589 --> 00:37:41,079
You sure it wasn't
the butler did it...

458
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,960
in the conservatory
with the candlestick?

459
00:37:43,268 --> 00:37:47,227
Gillen! Cassandra!
Come and join the celebration!

460
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,660
Chairman Alexander continued
to leave his mark...

461
00:37:54,596 --> 00:37:57,588
as U.N. Delegates approved his
plan to create a world union...

462
00:37:57,507 --> 00:38:00,567
modeled after his 10-zone
European power base.

463
00:38:00,483 --> 00:38:02,678
In return, Alexander delivered
into their hands...

464
00:38:02,627 --> 00:38:04,754
his food and water formulas...

465
00:38:04,771 --> 00:38:08,867
and a new technology that
neutralizes atomic weaponry.

466
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:16,083
Gentlemen, as a symbol of
our new tenfold global unity,

467
00:38:15,905 --> 00:38:17,998
I have great pleasure
in presenting you...

468
00:38:17,953 --> 00:38:20,820
with this enduring image.

469
00:38:32,863 --> 00:38:34,763
It's hard to believe
that so many countries,

470
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,087
including our own, would just
hand over their sovereignty!

471
00:38:37,984 --> 00:38:39,110
Oh, no, wait, wait...

472
00:38:39,103 --> 00:38:42,231
And frankly, I'm also surprised
to find myself in the minority.

473
00:38:42,208 --> 00:38:44,938
It's not about handing
over sovereignty.

474
00:38:44,863 --> 00:38:47,331
- It's about greater resources!
- Oh, no!

475
00:38:47,263 --> 00:38:50,892
Look what an Alexander-run
European Union has done there!

476
00:38:50,846 --> 00:38:54,907
The World Union is a democracy,
just on a broader level.

477
00:38:54,782 --> 00:38:57,114
- Balderdash!
- That's a cheap shot.

478
00:39:08,124 --> 00:39:09,523
Now, one year after...

479
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,628
the decree to rebuild the Temple
and the Dome of the Rock,

480
00:39:12,541 --> 00:39:15,032
work is progressing
on both holy sites.

481
00:39:18,012 --> 00:39:22,108
The mysterious prophets continue
to stir up trouble in Jerusalem,

482
00:39:21,979 --> 00:39:25,437
claiming God has given them
the power to shut the heavens...

483
00:39:25,403 --> 00:39:27,701
as part of God's judgment
on the world.

484
00:39:27,643 --> 00:39:31,704
Chairman Alexander and Dr. Lane
will return to Rome tonight,

485
00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:33,740
after celebrating
the three-year anniversary...

486
00:39:33,691 --> 00:39:36,387
of the Middle East treaty
here in Geneva.

487
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,950
They said to follow
the pages of blood.

488
00:42:31,017 --> 00:42:32,507
Chairman?

489
00:42:47,368 --> 00:42:48,960
So, you tell me.

490
00:42:50,313 --> 00:42:51,302
What?

491
00:42:52,168 --> 00:42:55,001
If fate assigns us our roles,
and we don't fulfil them,

492
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,547
are we damned for it?

493
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,099
What are you talking about?

494
00:42:59,078 --> 00:43:00,773
If Adolf Hitler was
assigned his role,

495
00:43:00,743 --> 00:43:04,645
and he played it out
perfectly to the end,

496
00:43:04,518 --> 00:43:06,509
was he damned for his obedience?

497
00:43:08,006 --> 00:43:10,668
- Stone, you are on the verge...
- Of what?

498
00:43:12,166 --> 00:43:15,329
Listen, when we took
Rostenberg's program...

499
00:43:15,781 --> 00:43:17,180
none of us could have dreamed...

500
00:43:17,158 --> 00:43:19,718
that following the prophecies
would bring all this about.

501
00:43:19,652 --> 00:43:22,883
The food breakthroughs,
the political secrets,

502
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:25,520
the remapping the Middle East,

503
00:43:25,445 --> 00:43:28,437
your name, my name, Lane's name.

504
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:31,552
If the code's phase one
was so unstoppable,

505
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:33,928
what happens when
we initiate phase two?

506
00:43:35,556 --> 00:43:38,855
All you have to do is
trust the code. Look.

507
00:43:39,939 --> 00:43:44,171
"From ten horns he will rise,
an empire built on stone.

508
00:43:44,035 --> 00:43:46,697
All bow before the beast
and his prophet."

509
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:51,119
You have to trust the code.

510
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,928
Go downstairs,
initiate phase two,

511
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:58,445
and it's prophesied that
the world will lay at your feet.

512
00:43:58,338 --> 00:44:00,568
Ah, yes, but will it be
of my own free will...

513
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:02,378
or because I am the beast?

514
00:44:02,337 --> 00:44:04,271
A pawn in something...

515
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,074
Son of a...

516
00:44:43,582 --> 00:44:44,571
Dr. Lane?

517
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:47,991
We know you're in here.

518
00:45:02,747 --> 00:45:04,374
Hold it right there.

519
00:45:06,939 --> 00:45:08,429
Put that gun away, Dominic.

520
00:45:10,011 --> 00:45:12,070
He's seen the prophecy, sir.

521
00:45:12,027 --> 00:45:13,654
Put it away.

522
00:45:17,275 --> 00:45:19,300
You stole Rostenberg's program.

523
00:45:19,257 --> 00:45:22,055
You've been following
the code like a script,

524
00:45:21,978 --> 00:45:23,741
blowing up the dome,
the synagogue.

525
00:45:23,705 --> 00:45:27,937
Yes, and look what
good we did, Gillen,

526
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,427
how many people
you and I have helped,

527
00:45:29,401 --> 00:45:31,369
how many lives we've saved.

528
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:34,881
Think of all that
we've accomplished together.

529
00:45:34,776 --> 00:45:36,368
No.

530
00:45:38,232 --> 00:45:39,961
Give me the program.

531
00:45:42,424 --> 00:45:45,416
I gave up my family,
my life, for you!

532
00:45:45,335 --> 00:45:46,529
People are dead!
Rostenberg...

533
00:45:46,519 --> 00:45:48,612
But, Gillen, listen to me.

534
00:45:49,591 --> 00:45:52,583
Life is never what it seems.

535
00:45:53,782 --> 00:45:55,875
You stand on the brink
of achieving your dreams.

536
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:58,355
Now, don't give up on them now.

537
00:45:58,295 --> 00:46:00,126
I need you...

538
00:46:00,086 --> 00:46:02,714
to be my spokesman
for this new world:

539
00:46:02,646 --> 00:46:05,809
My visionary, yes!

540
00:46:05,718 --> 00:46:07,242
My prophet.

541
00:46:09,654 --> 00:46:11,144
Leave us, Dominic.

542
00:46:12,724 --> 00:46:15,921
- I said leave us.
- You said I'd be the prophet.

543
00:46:38,515 --> 00:46:40,506
Dr. Lane shot Chairman Stone.

544
00:46:40,467 --> 00:46:42,662
He's locked me in the lab.
Get me out!

545
00:47:15,598 --> 00:47:16,895
Help the police find Lane.

546
00:47:16,879 --> 00:47:19,439
I want him dead or alive.
I don't care.

547
00:48:07,786 --> 00:48:10,346
How could he escape?
I don't care.

548
00:48:10,281 --> 00:48:13,182
I want his face in every police
department on this planet.

549
00:48:13,097 --> 00:48:14,359
Now do it!

550
00:48:15,945 --> 00:48:17,970
Outside in the hall,
either side of the door.

551
00:48:29,479 --> 00:48:31,379
Please be home, Cassandra.

552
00:48:37,575 --> 00:48:39,634
Are you all right?
Gillen!

553
00:48:40,551 --> 00:48:43,247
Gillen, what is going on?
It's all over the news.

554
00:48:44,166 --> 00:48:45,690
Dominic! Dominic shot him.

555
00:48:45,671 --> 00:48:47,104
- Oh, that's great...
- Wait!

556
00:48:47,909 --> 00:48:50,776
I found the pages.
The pages of blood?

557
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:52,093
You were right.

558
00:48:52,837 --> 00:48:56,739
- Look, I need your help.
- They'll be combing the airport,

559
00:48:56,613 --> 00:48:59,673
so I would have to sneak you
aboard one of the network jets.

560
00:49:01,221 --> 00:49:03,416
I can't believe I'm doing this.
Get in.

561
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:24,467
Bye, my friend.

562
00:49:26,179 --> 00:49:27,669
I'll take it from here.

563
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:35,059
I'm on my way down.

564
00:49:36,994 --> 00:49:40,486
Doctors are announcing
that Stone Alexander died...

565
00:49:40,386 --> 00:49:47,189
from an assassin's bullet
at 2:06 a.m. Rome time today.

566
00:49:46,945 --> 00:49:51,644
Again, the suspect is said to
be Dr. Gillen Wilcott Lane.

567
00:49:52,224 --> 00:49:54,249
Motive is unclear at this hour,

568
00:49:54,208 --> 00:49:57,200
but Lane is said to be
armed and dangerous.

569
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,451
Law enforcement agencies
from around the globe...

570
00:49:59,393 --> 00:50:02,988
are banding together
in a worldwide manhunt.

571
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:06,679
Italian authorities shut down
all avenues out of that country.

572
00:50:08,382 --> 00:50:10,373
I think I speak for
everyone when I say...

573
00:50:10,334 --> 00:50:15,966
that we are shocked at
the actions of this Dr. Lane,

574
00:50:15,774 --> 00:50:18,607
that we cannot, we must not,
let the deeds of one lunatic...

575
00:50:18,525 --> 00:50:22,518
stop or even slow down
Stone Alexander's global work.

576
00:50:22,396 --> 00:50:24,626
Every once in a while,
there comes a person...

577
00:50:24,573 --> 00:50:28,532
who is the embodiment of
the collective conscience.

578
00:50:28,412 --> 00:50:30,243
Buddha, Confucius,
Christ, Muhammad...

579
00:50:30,206 --> 00:50:33,141
and now, I believe
somebody who is worthy...

580
00:50:33,052 --> 00:50:35,919
of our praise and adoration,
Stone Alexander.

581
00:50:37,724 --> 00:50:42,184
We must not forget him.
We must embrace his work...

582
00:50:42,044 --> 00:50:45,138
with the assurance and courage
that he's watching over us.

583
00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:56,863
So what do we do after
we find the prophets?

584
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,627
Do we try and expose the truth?

585
00:51:06,905 --> 00:51:07,963
The disk.

586
00:51:16,568 --> 00:51:18,695
Rostenberg always said
the Torah contained...

587
00:51:18,648 --> 00:51:20,673
the genetic code
of the universe.

588
00:51:20,631 --> 00:51:22,121
I never thought he was serious.

589
00:51:27,095 --> 00:51:28,892
He used a prophecy
in the "Book of Daniel"...

590
00:51:28,855 --> 00:51:31,983
to create the 3-D model
and unlock the code.

591
00:51:32,438 --> 00:51:37,398
70 sevens are decreed
for people and your holy city.

592
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:41,178
70 rungs of text,
7 rows each.

593
00:51:41,526 --> 00:51:42,823
But this top rung is missing.

594
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:49,971
In "Daniel,"
it says that after 69 sevens,

595
00:51:49,845 --> 00:51:52,336
day will be cut off until
the end of the gentiles.

596
00:51:52,916 --> 00:51:56,545
Rostenberg must have never
had a chance to enter it.

597
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:20,901
Alexander.

598
00:52:30,609 --> 00:52:33,134
Out now! Get out!
Nobody gets in here.

599
00:52:38,543 --> 00:52:40,272
How?

600
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,232
Oh, never mind.
Come here.

601
00:52:45,008 --> 00:52:47,203
I said, come here.

602
00:52:48,846 --> 00:52:49,835
Closer.

603
00:52:50,895 --> 00:52:53,125
Hello, my friend.

604
00:52:53,071 --> 00:52:54,732
I'll take it from here.

605
00:52:55,951 --> 00:52:58,715
Continue to be useful to me,
and I'll keep you,

606
00:52:58,639 --> 00:53:01,699
but when that isn't the case,

607
00:53:02,766 --> 00:53:05,132
you'll watch your bowels
spill out of you...

608
00:53:05,069 --> 00:53:07,765
as Judas did when
he betrayed his master.

609
00:53:10,605 --> 00:53:11,970
Is that understood?

610
00:53:15,437 --> 00:53:16,426
Good.

611
00:53:17,645 --> 00:53:19,112
Now...

612
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:21,848
The final code.

613
00:53:23,276 --> 00:53:24,937
You've recovered it, correct?

614
00:53:25,996 --> 00:53:26,985
Hmmm?

615
00:53:43,275 --> 00:53:46,335
- No progress on the final code.
- And Lane?

616
00:53:47,018 --> 00:53:48,042
Nothing.

617
00:54:06,472 --> 00:54:08,702
Do you realize a man struggles
his entire life...

618
00:54:08,648 --> 00:54:12,516
to gain his parents' praise,
the love of a woman...

619
00:54:12,392 --> 00:54:15,452
or of a man,
and the respect of his peers,

620
00:54:15,368 --> 00:54:17,928
and they reward all this effort
by putting him in a box...

621
00:54:17,862 --> 00:54:20,831
piled high with this
sort of ghastly flowers...

622
00:54:20,742 --> 00:54:22,266
he'd never buy himself.

623
00:54:24,837 --> 00:54:26,828
In or out, Dominic?

624
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:28,849
I'm sorry, I thought
you might be resting.

625
00:54:28,806 --> 00:54:30,239
I didn't want to...

626
00:54:30,214 --> 00:54:32,739
Oh, I haven't slept
in 48 hours.

627
00:54:32,677 --> 00:54:34,668
- Then I'll go.
- No, no, no!

628
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:36,791
No, I've lost the need to sleep.

629
00:54:36,741 --> 00:54:40,199
I close my eyes
and thoughts fill my head.

630
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:43,501
Thoughts that are not my own,
thoughts... ah.

631
00:54:44,036 --> 00:54:45,333
What have you brought me?

632
00:54:46,469 --> 00:54:50,633
"7 horns bow
to wounded head."

633
00:54:52,388 --> 00:54:53,377
Splendid.

634
00:54:54,403 --> 00:54:56,394
I want you to set up
a meeting of the World Union.

635
00:54:56,356 --> 00:54:59,723
We'll see which of the ten
nations remains faithful to me.

636
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:04,402
- Here?
- Yes, why not?

637
00:55:04,322 --> 00:55:07,018
A bedside summit.

638
00:55:06,947 --> 00:55:09,279
It has a rather nice ring
to it, don't you think?

639
00:55:10,370 --> 00:55:11,359
Yes sir.

640
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:15,810
The thoughts.
Are they like the voices?

641
00:55:17,857 --> 00:55:20,485
No, no, they're more powerful.

642
00:55:21,537 --> 00:55:25,564
More powerful in the singular,
as if whoever it is has me...

643
00:55:25,441 --> 00:55:28,877
at his complete mercy
and... painful.

644
00:55:31,136 --> 00:55:34,833
So painful...
Yet sweet.

645
00:55:35,136 --> 00:55:37,764
Yes, much more sweet
than the voices.

646
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:55,182
Oh yes, I owe you a debt
of loyalty, don't I?

647
00:55:56,797 --> 00:55:59,288
I made a mistake with Lane,
but you...

648
00:55:59,229 --> 00:56:02,756
you gave up
the priesthood for me.

649
00:56:02,653 --> 00:56:05,053
You saved me from the voices.

650
00:56:04,989 --> 00:56:08,254
I wouldn't be here if you hadn't
stumbled into my confessional.

651
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:10,466
Well, I couldn't think straight.

652
00:56:10,461 --> 00:56:13,862
The blood was still on
my hands and the voices were...

653
00:56:14,909 --> 00:56:19,005
What you see as a weakness,
I see as a strength.

654
00:56:19,291 --> 00:56:23,455
Any man that's willing
to kill his own father...

655
00:56:23,323 --> 00:56:25,348
has the courage to
accomplish anything.

656
00:56:31,066 --> 00:56:32,260
Oh, yes...

657
00:56:33,817 --> 00:56:35,978
Oh, yes, indeed.

658
00:56:38,361 --> 00:56:41,353
- Are you sure this is the place?
- It's where they brought me.

659
00:56:42,874 --> 00:56:46,833
It's hard to tell because
it was dark the last time,

660
00:56:46,712 --> 00:56:50,307
but I think if I'm not mistaken,

661
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,760
that this is the room
that they brought me to.

662
00:56:53,496 --> 00:56:54,485
Yep.

663
00:57:01,176 --> 00:57:03,076
Shalom, Dr. Lane.

664
00:57:04,951 --> 00:57:07,749
We have waited
a long time to meet you.

665
00:57:08,472 --> 00:57:12,408
- Who are you guys?
- Our names do not matter.

666
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:15,049
What matters is the truth.

667
00:57:16,022 --> 00:57:19,753
Seven out of ten,
I'm overwhelmed.

668
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:23,758
Oh, it's amazing what one will
do for a little attention.

669
00:57:24,981 --> 00:57:28,678
What was it like, sir?
Do you remember anything?

670
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:34,815
I heard a voice whisper,
"Alexander..."

671
00:57:35,508 --> 00:57:38,272
I turned and there was this man.

672
00:57:39,412 --> 00:57:43,746
"I am Alexander the Great,"
I heard him say.

673
00:57:43,603 --> 00:57:47,903
Gentlemen, what I will tell you
goes no further than this room.

674
00:57:47,763 --> 00:57:48,752
Understood?

675
00:57:50,002 --> 00:57:51,697
Then the great general,
he said to me,

676
00:57:51,666 --> 00:57:54,794
"In my time on earth,
I conquered the entire world,

677
00:57:54,707 --> 00:57:56,607
"but after a near short life,

678
00:57:56,562 --> 00:58:00,828
"I find myself here
in a different world,

679
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:03,853
"and weary of war,
I decided to stay...

680
00:58:03,762 --> 00:58:06,230
"rather than go back
and solidify my kingdom,

681
00:58:06,162 --> 00:58:10,223
but you," he said,
"You, you must go back.

682
00:58:10,097 --> 00:58:14,864
"For the sake of evolution,
be the Alexander I was not.

683
00:58:14,705 --> 00:58:17,037
Unite the world."

684
00:58:17,648 --> 00:58:19,582
Stone Alexander
has just been appointed...

685
00:58:19,536 --> 00:58:22,699
the first ever
Chancellor of the United World.

686
00:58:22,607 --> 00:58:25,770
At one point, tensions flared,
and three members stormed out.

687
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:28,239
The majority, however,
remained resolute.

688
00:58:28,176 --> 00:58:30,269
Official inauguration
is said to coincide...

689
00:58:30,223 --> 00:58:33,090
with the dedication ceremonies
for Solomon's Temple...

690
00:58:33,006 --> 00:58:36,271
on the Jewish holiday of Purim,
one week from today.

691
00:58:36,175 --> 00:58:39,576
Here comes Sir Percival Lloyd.
Let's see if we can talk to him.

692
00:58:41,229 --> 00:58:45,325
Chairman Alexander rejected
our pleas three times,

693
00:58:45,197 --> 00:58:48,325
but we finally managed
to convince him that...

694
00:58:48,238 --> 00:58:51,298
who better to heal
our wounded world...

695
00:58:51,213 --> 00:58:54,239
than a man who has himself
been mortally wounded...

696
00:58:54,157 --> 00:58:58,059
and yet has miraculously
risen again.

697
00:58:57,933 --> 00:59:00,629
At such moments of trial
in our history,

698
00:59:00,556 --> 00:59:03,684
certain famous words
have been spoken,

699
00:59:03,596 --> 00:59:07,191
but never, never have
they rung more true.

700
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:11,007
The king is dead.

701
00:59:10,924 --> 00:59:12,949
Long live the king!

702
00:59:12,907 --> 00:59:13,896
Thank you.

703
00:59:14,635 --> 00:59:15,829
No more comment, thank you.

704
00:59:15,818 --> 00:59:21,222
"The dragon gave the beast
his power and his throne,

705
00:59:21,035 --> 00:59:22,502
and great authority."

706
00:59:24,458 --> 00:59:29,657
One of the heads of the beasts
seemed to have a fatal wound,

707
00:59:29,481 --> 00:59:32,211
but the fatal wound
had been healed.

708
00:59:33,065 --> 00:59:37,399
The whole world was astonished
and followed the beast.

709
00:59:37,258 --> 00:59:39,089
A near death experience
doesn't make someone...

710
00:59:39,049 --> 00:59:44,612
It is written in the last days,
a world leader will rise up,

711
00:59:44,487 --> 00:59:47,115
rebuild Solomon's Temple,

712
00:59:47,048 --> 00:59:50,245
and usher in three and a half
years of world peace...

713
00:59:50,152 --> 00:59:52,780
under a new Roman Empire.

714
00:59:52,712 --> 00:59:57,649
Then possessed by Satan,
he'll declare himself God...

715
00:59:57,479 --> 01:00:00,778
and embark on
a reign of terror...

716
01:00:00,679 --> 01:00:04,171
until the Lord comes
and destroys him.

717
01:00:04,679 --> 01:00:08,376
The final battle between
heaven and hell approaches.

718
01:00:08,262 --> 01:00:11,322
Look, all I care about
is clearing my name.

719
01:00:12,166 --> 01:00:13,497
How do I get the final code?

720
01:00:13,477 --> 01:00:18,710
There is a war going on between
angels of light and dark...

721
01:00:18,533 --> 01:00:20,558
over your soul, Dr. Lane.

722
01:00:20,516 --> 01:00:22,177
What are you talking about?

723
01:00:22,148 --> 01:00:25,709
The four horses of
the apocalypse.

724
01:00:25,604 --> 01:00:28,471
- The other visions.
- No.

725
01:00:28,388 --> 01:00:31,084
They're not real.
They're in here.

726
01:00:31,588 --> 01:00:35,285
- Maybe you are, too.
- The proof is staring at you.

727
01:00:35,172 --> 01:00:38,630
All you need is the faith
of a child to accept it.

728
01:00:38,531 --> 01:00:41,364
My childhood was
ripped away from me,

729
01:00:41,283 --> 01:00:43,376
so I don't know exactly
what that is.

730
01:00:43,331 --> 01:00:46,858
You keep looking for something
To fill a void in your soul...

731
01:00:46,754 --> 01:00:48,483
that only god can fill.

732
01:00:50,338 --> 01:00:51,532
This is ridiculous!

733
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:05,093
- Jennifer, it's Gillen.
- Gillen, are you all right?

734
01:01:05,024 --> 01:01:07,618
I need your help,
I've got proof of everything.

735
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,696
I've been e-mailing it to
the World Union leaders,

736
01:01:14,624 --> 01:01:17,149
but I think Alexander's
intercepting them.

737
01:01:18,623 --> 01:01:21,251
I want to e-mail you
the program,

738
01:01:21,182 --> 01:01:24,174
and maybe you can run it by that
law school friend in the NSA.

739
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,325
Anything, Gillen.

740
01:01:26,303 --> 01:01:28,828
Thanks, Jen,
I knew I could count on you.

741
01:02:57,557 --> 01:02:59,582
- Gillen, what happened?
- They found us!

742
01:03:09,078 --> 01:03:10,409
Who are you calling?

743
01:03:11,956 --> 01:03:14,481
I can't get a good reception.

744
01:03:14,421 --> 01:03:16,048
- Pull over.
- What? Why?

745
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:17,009
Just do it!

746
01:03:22,708 --> 01:03:23,800
Hello?

747
01:03:24,724 --> 01:03:26,817
Hey, it's me.
Have you found anything?

748
01:03:26,771 --> 01:03:28,762
You must think
I'm a fool, Gillen.

749
01:03:31,091 --> 01:03:34,288
I checked out the program.
You don't have anything.

750
01:03:34,195 --> 01:03:38,256
Alexander is a good man.
He's done a lot for the world.

751
01:03:38,609 --> 01:03:41,703
I think you need
some psychological help, Gillen.

752
01:03:41,618 --> 01:03:43,381
They've gotten to you, right?

753
01:03:43,346 --> 01:03:45,576
I want you
to leave us alone, Gillen.

754
01:03:46,193 --> 01:03:47,751
Don't call here again.

755
01:03:50,673 --> 01:03:52,197
We gotta get to L.A.

756
01:03:52,561 --> 01:03:53,994
Are you insane?

757
01:03:53,968 --> 01:03:55,959
- Dominic's men are all over...
- I don't care.

758
01:03:56,976 --> 01:03:59,001
It' my fault
that they're in this mess.

759
01:03:59,632 --> 01:04:00,929
I gotta do something.

760
01:04:02,544 --> 01:04:04,034
It's my child.

761
01:04:07,503 --> 01:04:08,993
Program's stopped running.

762
01:04:09,967 --> 01:04:11,491
It's as far as we can go.

763
01:04:13,518 --> 01:04:14,746
Never mind.

764
01:04:14,734 --> 01:04:17,931
We'll proceed with
my coronation at the temple.

765
01:04:17,838 --> 01:04:18,964
Coronation?

766
01:04:19,022 --> 01:04:21,149
Without the final code,
we're backed into a corner.

767
01:04:21,103 --> 01:04:22,434
There's no way out.

768
01:04:23,469 --> 01:04:26,461
Oh, I always leave myself
a way out.

769
01:04:53,387 --> 01:04:54,877
How'd he get to Los Angeles?

770
01:04:54,859 --> 01:04:56,690
Who's helping him and why
isn't that house surrounded?

771
01:04:56,651 --> 01:04:57,982
They're on their way.

772
01:04:57,963 --> 01:05:00,227
No one thought he'd
actually turn up there.

773
01:05:00,778 --> 01:05:02,473
Why isn't he
taking the shot?

774
01:05:02,986 --> 01:05:05,011
- Take the shot!
- I don't have it.

775
01:05:04,970 --> 01:05:06,369
Take the shot!

776
01:05:07,402 --> 01:05:09,199
I don't have it.

777
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:23,602
- Daddy!
- Sweetie! No, no, no!

778
01:05:23,496 --> 01:05:26,590
You just had another dream
about daddy, that's all, OK?

779
01:05:27,943 --> 01:05:29,274
What is going on?

780
01:05:29,863 --> 01:05:34,732
Gillen, I told you,
leave us alone.

781
01:05:34,568 --> 01:05:35,967
Get out!

782
01:05:47,366 --> 01:05:48,594
I'm so scared.

783
01:05:50,213 --> 01:05:52,841
I don't want him to hurt us.

784
01:05:53,286 --> 01:05:56,619
Gillen, we don't have much time.

785
01:05:56,677 --> 01:05:59,202
All right, Jen, call your mom.

786
01:05:59,141 --> 01:06:02,110
Tell her you and Maddie are
coming to visit for a few days.

787
01:06:02,021 --> 01:06:05,513
But the phone's bugged.
They'll be listening.

788
01:06:05,413 --> 01:06:06,971
Exactly what we want...

789
01:06:06,948 --> 01:06:10,645
because then we'll all get in
the minivan and go to Mexico.

790
01:06:10,532 --> 01:06:12,557
That should throw them off
and buy some time.

791
01:06:13,315 --> 01:06:14,475
They're rolling.

792
01:06:15,748 --> 01:06:19,240
- Where are the troops?
- They're seconds away.

793
01:07:24,348 --> 01:07:27,977
Gillen? What are you doing here?
What's going on?

794
01:07:27,868 --> 01:07:29,665
Sorry, Jack,
we had no place else to turn.

795
01:07:29,629 --> 01:07:32,120
Jack, what's the matter?
What is it?

796
01:07:33,052 --> 01:07:34,917
Maddie! Honey!

797
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:46,430
We got a full force searching,
but it looks like we lost them.

798
01:07:55,257 --> 01:07:58,385
- Why can't you come with us?
- Listen to me, sweetheart,

799
01:07:58,298 --> 01:08:00,459
Dorothy's gonna take you
up to their cabin for a while.

800
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:02,639
Remember the fun
we used to have up there?

801
01:08:02,585 --> 01:08:04,678
Uncle Jack's gonna call
some government friends...

802
01:08:04,634 --> 01:08:07,034
and help me straighten this out.

803
01:08:06,969 --> 01:08:09,199
- I'll join you in no time.
- Promise?

804
01:08:10,809 --> 01:08:11,935
Promise.

805
01:08:11,928 --> 01:08:14,158
Take care of yourself, OK?

806
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:16,354
You, too.

807
01:08:17,336 --> 01:08:18,667
Don't go, daddy.

808
01:08:29,718 --> 01:08:32,243
Let me make those calls
and get you a drink.

809
01:08:50,805 --> 01:08:54,138
I put some whiskey in it
to settle the nerves.

810
01:08:56,851 --> 01:09:00,582
Jack, I'm seeing demons.

811
01:09:02,195 --> 01:09:04,823
Demons? God!
You really do need help.

812
01:09:04,755 --> 01:09:06,279
They're real.

813
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:07,557
They're real!

814
01:09:08,372 --> 01:09:11,500
Look, I don't know what to say.

815
01:09:11,891 --> 01:09:15,327
Uh, excuse me a minute.
I'll be right back.

816
01:09:15,219 --> 01:09:16,413
Weak bladder.

817
01:09:38,672 --> 01:09:40,663
I just received your message.
Keep Lane there...

818
01:09:40,624 --> 01:09:42,023
My men are moments away.

819
01:09:44,912 --> 01:09:45,901
Jack?

820
01:09:47,695 --> 01:09:49,287
Jack?

821
01:09:53,199 --> 01:09:54,598
Gillen...

822
01:09:59,086 --> 01:10:00,110
Are you OK?

823
01:10:07,245 --> 01:10:09,509
I'm sorry!
It was for your own good.

824
01:10:09,453 --> 01:10:11,887
I did it for you!
I did it for your family!

825
01:10:11,821 --> 01:10:12,913
He's in the bathroom!

826
01:10:14,573 --> 01:10:16,768
Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?

827
01:10:16,716 --> 01:10:19,082
Nobody said anything
about shooting him!

828
01:10:30,731 --> 01:10:33,131
All units,
suspect has fled on foot.

829
01:10:33,067 --> 01:10:35,228
Believed to be leaving
Hancock Park area.

830
01:10:35,179 --> 01:10:36,339
Destination uncertain.

831
01:12:37,792 --> 01:12:39,191
It's OK.

832
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:40,691
It's just a bad dream.

833
01:12:41,504 --> 01:12:44,837
You were having them
the whole flight back.

834
01:12:47,295 --> 01:12:49,490
- Where are we?
- Safe.

835
01:12:49,437 --> 01:12:52,270
- Back in Israel.
- What?

836
01:12:52,191 --> 01:12:54,455
I found you passed out
in the street.

837
01:13:15,740 --> 01:13:16,968
You have awaken.

838
01:13:20,731 --> 01:13:22,392
He's won, hasn't he?

839
01:13:22,363 --> 01:13:25,992
Whatever happens,
you must not give up hope.

840
01:13:29,402 --> 01:13:30,892
The final code.

841
01:13:32,602 --> 01:13:38,700
Good-bye, and remember:
The faith of a child.

842
01:13:38,490 --> 01:13:39,787
Where are you going?

843
01:13:39,769 --> 01:13:42,932
It has been foretold in
the "Book of Revelation."

844
01:13:42,841 --> 01:13:45,503
It is time for us
to meet our destiny.

845
01:13:47,001 --> 01:13:48,468
Gillen!

846
01:13:49,112 --> 01:13:50,101
Gillen.

847
01:13:55,064 --> 01:13:57,157
- They gave you the final code.
- Yeah.

848
01:13:58,359 --> 01:14:01,351
- Yeah, they did.
- I knew they would.

849
01:14:02,231 --> 01:14:03,664
Hand it over.

850
01:14:08,599 --> 01:14:11,067
You should know by now, Gillen,

851
01:14:10,999 --> 01:14:14,799
even Satan comes
as an angel of light.

852
01:14:29,172 --> 01:14:31,936
The massive temple has been
meticulously reconstructed...

853
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:35,489
based on Old Testament accounts
and detailed historic records.

854
01:14:35,379 --> 01:14:39,645
Despite this detail,
many Orthodox Jews are angry...

855
01:14:39,508 --> 01:14:43,467
over Chancellor Alexander's
change of the sacred place.

856
01:14:44,339 --> 01:14:45,897
Sir...

857
01:14:45,875 --> 01:14:46,967
she just signaled.

858
01:14:46,964 --> 01:14:49,023
We have Lane and the final code.

859
01:14:50,003 --> 01:14:55,202
And there's my way out.
I told you I always leave one.

860
01:14:55,986 --> 01:14:57,317
Yes, sir.

861
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:12,721
You have built
a magnificent house for me.

862
01:15:12,561 --> 01:15:16,759
My soul leaps to see
all that has been accomplished.

863
01:15:16,624 --> 01:15:21,823
For I have said in my heart,
I will ascend to heaven,

864
01:15:21,648 --> 01:15:24,378
and it has come to pass.

865
01:15:24,751 --> 01:15:28,983
I will raise my throne
above the stars of God,

866
01:15:28,847 --> 01:15:31,338
and it has come to pass.

867
01:15:32,239 --> 01:15:38,644
I will sit enthroned on
this mount of assembly...

868
01:15:38,414 --> 01:15:41,247
on the utmost heights
of the sacred mountain,

869
01:15:41,165 --> 01:15:44,134
and it has come to pass.

870
01:16:09,739 --> 01:16:12,674
I alone have done what
no man has been able to do.

871
01:16:12,586 --> 01:16:15,919
I have taken the next step
in our evolution.

872
01:16:15,818 --> 01:16:20,448
I have become king and God!

873
01:16:29,514 --> 01:16:31,038
Blasphemy!

874
01:16:31,018 --> 01:16:33,851
That is blasphemy!

875
01:16:36,744 --> 01:16:41,078
That man! Blaspheme!
Blasphemer!

876
01:16:43,912 --> 01:16:47,814
Can you see
the abomination of desolation...

877
01:16:47,752 --> 01:16:49,344
spoken of by Daniel...

878
01:16:49,319 --> 01:16:51,810
standing in the holy place?

879
01:16:51,752 --> 01:16:54,482
Let those in Judea free,

880
01:16:54,470 --> 01:16:57,769
or death has come up
into our houses...

881
01:16:57,671 --> 01:17:00,731
to cut off
the children from without...

882
01:17:00,645 --> 01:17:03,580
and a young man from within.

883
01:17:03,495 --> 01:17:06,521
How you have fallen
from heaven, Lucifer,

884
01:17:06,439 --> 01:17:08,134
son of the morning.

885
01:17:08,102 --> 01:17:10,332
How you are cut from the ground.

886
01:17:10,278 --> 01:17:15,181
The day has come when people
will stare at you and say,

887
01:17:15,013 --> 01:17:19,416
"Is this the man who made
the nations tremble?"

888
01:17:19,908 --> 01:17:23,435
You have all bowed
to the man of sin.

889
01:17:23,909 --> 01:17:26,139
But on the house of David,

890
01:17:26,147 --> 01:17:28,547
- The Lord...
- The Lord?

891
01:17:28,484 --> 01:17:32,420
Yes! The lord will pour out
his spirit of grace.

892
01:17:32,292 --> 01:17:34,283
They will look on the Lord,

893
01:17:34,243 --> 01:17:36,302
and they have peace.

894
01:17:36,259 --> 01:17:39,956
And mourn, as one mourns
for his only son.

895
01:17:40,419 --> 01:17:42,580
The lord?

896
01:17:42,530 --> 01:17:45,021
I alone am
the Prince of Peace.

897
01:17:44,962 --> 01:17:47,692
If there is any other,
then show us all a sign!

898
01:17:47,618 --> 01:17:49,586
Right here, right now.

899
01:17:49,538 --> 01:17:53,634
It is a wicked and
perverse generation...

900
01:17:53,505 --> 01:17:55,405
who asks for a sign.

901
01:17:55,361 --> 01:18:00,697
But like Christ,
your only sign will be this.

902
01:18:00,512 --> 01:18:05,882
Destroy these temples
of his holy prophets,

903
01:18:05,697 --> 01:18:10,498
and the Lord will rebuild them
in 3 days!

904
01:18:10,337 --> 01:18:11,998
It will be my pleasure.

905
01:18:46,844 --> 01:18:51,372
I want these reprobates
put on display and guarded.

906
01:18:51,899 --> 01:18:54,561
Let the world see what happens
to those who oppose me.

907
01:18:54,492 --> 01:18:55,925
Get me out of here.

908
01:19:18,137 --> 01:19:21,004
The Israelis and several
others are seceding.

909
01:19:21,337 --> 01:19:23,771
Then I'll make them an example
To the rest of the world...

910
01:19:23,706 --> 01:19:25,230
for treating me this way.

911
01:19:25,401 --> 01:19:27,562
Have my generals
waiting for me in Rome.

912
01:19:27,512 --> 01:19:30,811
- Others may follow, sir.
- Then I'll crush them, too.

913
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:34,325
Don't forget,
I have the final code.

914
01:20:02,101 --> 01:20:06,037
So if I give the signal,
I want a quick ground strike...

915
01:20:05,909 --> 01:20:08,070
to allow our envoys
out of the region...

916
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:10,488
followed by a strategic
nuclear strike.

917
01:20:11,253 --> 01:20:14,245
Oh, yes, they'll pay the price
for their insolence.

918
01:20:14,164 --> 01:20:16,029
And let me know
when Ms. Barashe arrives.

919
01:20:16,051 --> 01:20:17,143
Yes, sir.

920
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:20,337
Chairman, you may want to
have a look at this.

921
01:20:20,243 --> 01:20:22,609
What can possibly be
so pressing?

922
01:20:24,275 --> 01:20:26,106
Take your pick.

923
01:20:26,066 --> 01:20:29,035
Over three million are dead and
thousands are seeking refuge...

924
01:20:28,947 --> 01:20:31,973
after a freak meteor shower
hit Eastern Europe.

925
01:20:31,891 --> 01:20:34,052
The Hong Kong plant
has ground to a halt...

926
01:20:34,002 --> 01:20:35,765
as tests are confirming...

927
01:20:35,731 --> 01:20:39,132
that the ocean's molecular
structure has somehow mutated.

928
01:20:39,090 --> 01:20:40,785
The entire fishing industry
has shut down...

929
01:20:40,753 --> 01:20:42,846
I just received this
from Gillen Lane.

930
01:20:42,801 --> 01:20:44,792
It's true, isn't it?

931
01:20:44,752 --> 01:20:47,915
- Well, what do you think?
- We will not stand for this.

932
01:20:47,824 --> 01:20:50,520
Oh, I'm sorry,
but you don't have the choice.

933
01:20:50,449 --> 01:20:52,610
Yes, we do.
The world shall hear of this.

934
01:20:52,561 --> 01:20:56,395
Gentlemen, gentlemen, please.

935
01:20:56,273 --> 01:20:59,265
Let us continue to work together
as we have in the past.

936
01:20:59,248 --> 01:21:01,546
Allow me to finish here,
and I will join you.

937
01:21:06,544 --> 01:21:08,705
Ah, Cassandra.

938
01:21:09,807 --> 01:21:11,536
My Jezebel.

939
01:21:12,046 --> 01:21:13,707
My... Salome?

940
01:21:20,461 --> 01:21:22,827
- Well done.
- He never suspected a thing.

941
01:21:22,766 --> 01:21:26,532
Oh, I'm sure he didn't,
but me, I, uh...

942
01:21:26,414 --> 01:21:28,382
I just hope it wasn't
difficult for you,

943
01:21:28,334 --> 01:21:30,894
knowing how attached
you've become.

944
01:21:31,436 --> 01:21:34,405
Attached? I don't know
what you mean.

945
01:21:34,316 --> 01:21:36,511
I mean, I just wonder
if you'd ever have...

946
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:38,325
the courage to pull the trigger.

947
01:21:41,035 --> 01:21:42,502
Never mind.

948
01:21:55,339 --> 01:21:58,035
What are you two playing at?
He's tricked you!

949
01:21:57,962 --> 01:22:01,489
- It's impossible! He couldn't!
- Oh, so now you defend him.

950
01:22:01,385 --> 01:22:02,511
No!

951
01:22:02,505 --> 01:22:06,635
I think that you and I had
better go and talk with him.

952
01:22:11,817 --> 01:22:15,014
We can't have the last prophecy
without the final code.

953
01:22:16,361 --> 01:22:17,658
What is it?

954
01:22:25,735 --> 01:22:30,138
We're gonna keep asking
until you tell us.

955
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:33,177
I don't know.

956
01:22:39,462 --> 01:22:44,058
You realize I may not have to
destroy the Middle East...

957
01:22:43,910 --> 01:22:48,074
if I have the security the final
prophecy would give me.

958
01:22:49,861 --> 01:22:55,060
I had to die to initiate
its second phase, so...

959
01:22:57,477 --> 01:23:01,743
who will die to kick it
into its final phase, hmm?

960
01:24:50,042 --> 01:24:51,202
God.

961
01:24:53,082 --> 01:24:54,743
Jesus, save me.

962
01:26:23,921 --> 01:26:25,912
Everything's forward motion.

963
01:26:27,986 --> 01:26:30,580
How about I help you to
the next level of evolution?

964
01:26:30,512 --> 01:26:31,570
Let him go.

965
01:27:12,396 --> 01:27:15,832
The truth has set you free.

966
01:27:39,146 --> 01:27:42,240
In light of the resurrection
of God's holy prophets,

967
01:27:42,153 --> 01:27:46,920
we are recanting our support
and declaring you a heretic!

968
01:27:51,048 --> 01:27:52,037
Gillen.

969
01:27:53,992 --> 01:27:55,823
Call off the attack.

970
01:27:55,848 --> 01:27:57,713
Dr. Lane.

971
01:27:57,672 --> 01:27:59,299
What an unexpected pleasure.

972
01:27:59,272 --> 01:28:02,935
- Call it off, or you're dead.
- Oh, I've already been dead.

973
01:28:02,824 --> 01:28:04,121
Call it off.
So help me God, I'll...

974
01:28:04,103 --> 01:28:06,936
God? I'm the God of this world!

975
01:28:06,856 --> 01:28:09,654
And you could've been with me,
couldn't he, my love?

976
01:28:09,575 --> 01:28:12,100
Yes! My Trinity!

977
01:28:13,383 --> 01:28:15,180
You've spent too much time
in your codes.

978
01:28:15,592 --> 01:28:20,325
The beast and his false prophet
get cast into the lake of fire.

979
01:28:21,126 --> 01:28:22,457
Fairy tales.

980
01:28:22,981 --> 01:28:26,212
I am the one who controls
the outcome of history.

981
01:28:26,117 --> 01:28:27,607
I'm the one who calls the shots.

982
01:28:27,590 --> 01:28:30,184
I'm the one who tells people
what to think and believe.

983
01:28:30,117 --> 01:28:32,847
I was Judas, betraying
Christ to be crucified.

984
01:28:32,774 --> 01:28:34,867
I was Hitler leading
millions to the slaughter,

985
01:28:34,820 --> 01:28:38,415
and I was the drunken driver
who killed your mother.

986
01:28:39,653 --> 01:28:43,487
But I was also the one who
stopped a bullet for you.

987
01:28:43,364 --> 01:28:44,854
Yes.

988
01:28:45,284 --> 01:28:48,378
I died so that you might live.

989
01:28:49,828 --> 01:28:52,695
- Can't you see what he is?
- Oh, she sees.

990
01:28:52,611 --> 01:28:57,776
She sees who raised her out
of the gutter, empowered her,

991
01:28:57,603 --> 01:29:01,039
and who turned her
into someone desirable.

992
01:29:06,786 --> 01:29:09,914
- Just like I did to you.
- I'm sorry, Gillen.

993
01:29:11,457 --> 01:29:14,051
Is there anything else
you'd like to add,

994
01:29:13,985 --> 01:29:15,577
like, uh, the final code?

995
01:29:16,353 --> 01:29:18,651
There's still time to
call off the troops.

996
01:29:30,752 --> 01:29:33,186
Very well.
Prepare the attack.

997
01:29:33,119 --> 01:29:34,108
Wait!

998
01:29:36,095 --> 01:29:38,222
I'll give it to you.

999
01:29:41,438 --> 01:29:43,633
Yes, I knew you'd be reasonable.

1000
01:29:47,294 --> 01:29:48,784
Forgive me.

1001
01:30:01,693 --> 01:30:03,388
Thank you.

1002
01:30:03,357 --> 01:30:06,190
- Commence the attack on my mark.
- What?

1003
01:30:06,109 --> 01:30:08,669
They're already in position.
Why waste the trip?

1004
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:14,403
On my mark.
Three... two... and...
