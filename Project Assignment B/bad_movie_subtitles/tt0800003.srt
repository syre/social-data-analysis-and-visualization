1
00:00:50,028 --> 00:00:51,052
Ten hut!

2
00:01:01,273 --> 00:01:02,570
At ease.

3
00:01:03,676 --> 00:01:06,645
I'm often asked, "What makes a hero?"

4
00:01:07,413 --> 00:01:09,973
Courage, selflessness, sacrifice.

5
00:01:11,483 --> 00:01:13,280
From Bunker Hill to the Alamo,

6
00:01:13,385 --> 00:01:14,818
Gettysburg to Normandy,

7
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,651
Korea to Khe Sanh,
the American fighting man

8
00:01:18,224 --> 00:01:20,715
has always answered the call of duty.

9
00:01:21,428 --> 00:01:23,919
These are dangerous times, gentlemen.

10
00:01:24,197 --> 00:01:27,724
Once more, America is in need
of its best and brightest.

11
00:01:28,435 --> 00:01:31,131
One wonders if there are still heroes.

12
00:01:31,905 --> 00:01:33,532
Somebody say "hero"?

13
00:01:34,941 --> 00:01:35,931
Hi.

14
00:01:36,043 --> 00:01:38,170
Two Deadwood meatball subs

15
00:01:38,279 --> 00:01:39,644
with extra tumbleweeds.

16
00:01:41,215 --> 00:01:44,048
Ah, don't worry about that hair,
I'm using a new conditioner.

17
00:01:46,187 --> 00:01:47,654
Sugar britches!

18
00:01:48,723 --> 00:01:51,692
-Larry, we need to talk.
-Talk?

19
00:01:51,792 --> 00:01:54,193
What is that, some kind of code
for a lunchtime quickie?

20
00:01:54,429 --> 00:01:56,920
-Diaper table, ladies room.
-No, Larry...

21
00:01:57,032 --> 00:01:58,465
I'm pregnant.

22
00:01:59,868 --> 00:02:02,234
Pregnant. That's great news!

23
00:02:02,504 --> 00:02:05,530
I just got promoted!
Now we can move in together!

24
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,699
-I got an idea, come here!
-No, Larry!

25
00:02:07,809 --> 00:02:09,299
-Just a second...
-Let me...

26
00:02:09,411 --> 00:02:11,072
I gotta do this.

27
00:02:11,179 --> 00:02:13,080
Hey, everybody? Folks,

28
00:02:13,182 --> 00:02:15,514
my name's Larry, and I'm your server.

29
00:02:15,818 --> 00:02:19,754
And this precious little lady right here
is my girlfriend, Karen.

30
00:02:19,856 --> 00:02:20,823
Hi.

31
00:02:20,923 --> 00:02:24,051
And I'm happy to say
she's having my baby.

32
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,593
Oh!

33
00:02:27,029 --> 00:02:29,520
So, on this special occasion just for today,

34
00:02:29,632 --> 00:02:33,626
the salad bar will be free for an hour
with all the fixings you can handle.

35
00:02:34,772 --> 00:02:36,239
Hold on. Before you all get up there

36
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,331
to get your bacon bits and your chick peas,

37
00:02:38,475 --> 00:02:40,443
there's one more thing I need to do.

38
00:02:40,544 --> 00:02:42,205
No, Larry. Larry, please.

39
00:02:42,312 --> 00:02:45,179
No, honey, I want to say this
in front of God and everybody.

40
00:02:45,282 --> 00:02:47,273
Larry, please! Larry, I...

41
00:02:47,384 --> 00:02:48,579
Karen,

42
00:02:49,988 --> 00:02:51,979
I love you with all my heart,

43
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,151
and you would make me
the happiest man in the world if

44
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:58,353
you'd be my wife.

45
00:02:59,264 --> 00:03:00,458
Oh!

46
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,322
I...

47
00:03:03,435 --> 00:03:07,736
No, say it in here. I want the whole world
to share in this special moment.

48
00:03:13,412 --> 00:03:15,107
It's not your baby.

49
00:03:23,055 --> 00:03:24,114
I don't understand.

50
00:03:24,224 --> 00:03:27,591
It means she's got a bun in her oven
that ain't your recipe.

51
00:03:27,694 --> 00:03:30,356
Now, is the salad bar still free, though?

52
00:03:30,464 --> 00:03:31,795
Why would you care?

53
00:03:31,898 --> 00:03:35,425
Doesn't look like you've had a salad
in your whole life.

54
00:03:42,944 --> 00:03:45,970
I'm not telling you again. Now, get in here!

55
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,442
-Die, paleface!
-You little bastards!

56
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,851
Hey! Hey, now! Hey, now! Hey!

57
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:59,426
Hey! Knock that shit off!

58
00:03:59,827 --> 00:04:01,796
Those are my good golf clubs!

59
00:04:01,897 --> 00:04:04,195
My little Rusty. He's a dickens, isn't he?

60
00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:06,392
He's got a nice backswing.

61
00:04:09,471 --> 00:04:11,564
-So, how's Connie?
-Oh, she's great.

62
00:04:11,673 --> 00:04:14,073
Damn it, Bill!
You better control these kids of yours!

63
00:04:14,176 --> 00:04:16,235
They tore up the backyard!

64
00:04:16,445 --> 00:04:18,676
Well, what do you want me to do about it?

65
00:04:18,781 --> 00:04:21,909
Turn the garden hose on them!
I'm busy out here.

66
00:04:23,386 --> 00:04:25,445
I guess this is the kind
of marital bliss I'm missing out on.

67
00:04:25,555 --> 00:04:28,319
Oh, marriage is a wonderful institution.

68
00:04:29,559 --> 00:04:33,188
Of course, 50% of all marriages
end in divorce.

69
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,865
That is, if you're lucky enough
to get a divorce.

70
00:04:38,202 --> 00:04:42,662
That becomes impossible when your wife's
got incriminating photos of you

71
00:04:42,773 --> 00:04:47,233
simply having coffee with a young dancer
'cause she was a great listener.

72
00:04:47,611 --> 00:04:51,513
Now, your life is just one series
of endless humiliations.

73
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:55,908
You lie awake and dream
of the sweet release

74
00:04:56,021 --> 00:04:58,353
a murder/suicide could bring.

75
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,089
But it's good, though. Really good.

76
00:05:02,193 --> 00:05:03,524
Nice move by Orton!

77
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:07,356
Well, normally, I don't gotta pay for it,
but life is full of sad stories.

78
00:05:12,537 --> 00:05:14,699
Oh, my God.

79
00:05:15,241 --> 00:05:16,674
Hey, Victor.

80
00:05:18,344 --> 00:05:19,811
What is this?

81
00:05:19,946 --> 00:05:22,380
When I hired you as a security guard,

82
00:05:22,481 --> 00:05:25,541
I didn't think you was going
to be living here.

83
00:05:25,651 --> 00:05:28,643
This is a storage unit, not an apartment.

84
00:05:28,821 --> 00:05:30,948
As a former law enforcement officer, it...

85
00:05:31,058 --> 00:05:32,855
Law enforcement?

86
00:05:33,093 --> 00:05:35,926
You were a cop for, what, only four days

87
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:38,725
before you drive your car
right through the beauty parlor?

88
00:05:38,832 --> 00:05:41,665
-lt was a nail salon.
-What the hell's the difference?

89
00:05:41,768 --> 00:05:42,928
Just...

90
00:05:43,036 --> 00:05:44,867
Clean this shit up!

91
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:46,897
Oh,

92
00:05:47,074 --> 00:05:48,564
and keep your eyes open.

93
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,975
Some drunk has been exposing himself

94
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:54,173
to the waitresses
at the Denny's across the street.

95
00:05:54,315 --> 00:05:58,149
The last time, the crazy bastard
was carrying a samurai sword.

96
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,522
There's a lot of deviants out there,
ain't they, Victor?

97
00:06:04,626 --> 00:06:05,615
But don't you worry.

98
00:06:05,727 --> 00:06:08,356
I'm gonna keep a eye out
when I'm on my next patrol.

99
00:06:08,464 --> 00:06:11,592
I gotta get going.
I've got a big weekend planned.

100
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,669
Look, man, you're better off
without Karen or that crummy job.

101
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:15,896
Am l?

102
00:06:16,338 --> 00:06:20,331
Larry, listen to me, it's always darkest
right before the dawn, all right?

103
00:06:20,442 --> 00:06:22,535
Now, you remember when I had shingles?

104
00:06:22,778 --> 00:06:24,905
Did I give up? Nope.

105
00:06:25,014 --> 00:06:27,711
I put my nose to the grindstone.
All my hard work paid off.

106
00:06:27,817 --> 00:06:29,114
Hard work?

107
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:31,014
Are you kidding me?

108
00:06:31,154 --> 00:06:32,917
You tripped at the Wal-Mart!

109
00:06:33,023 --> 00:06:35,685
And every day I thank God
for that spill on aisle 6.

110
00:06:36,292 --> 00:06:40,353
Because of that settlement,
I don't gotta work for another 11 months.

111
00:06:40,463 --> 00:06:41,953
All right, look. Here's Everett.

112
00:06:42,065 --> 00:06:44,227
Now, come on. It's our Reserve weekend.

113
00:06:44,335 --> 00:06:47,236
We're gonna have a great time.
We always do.

114
00:06:48,105 --> 00:06:51,199
Thanks for showing up, Everett.
We've only been waiting an hour.

115
00:06:51,308 --> 00:06:54,072
Anybody ever tell you that loitering
is a class D misdemeanor

116
00:06:54,178 --> 00:06:57,238
punishable by a $50 fine
and 10 hours of community service?

117
00:06:57,348 --> 00:07:00,647
Hey, what's the penalty
for vehicular homicide of a beauty parlor?

118
00:07:00,751 --> 00:07:02,481
It was a nail salon.

119
00:07:04,523 --> 00:07:07,583
Well, what a great way
to chase away the break-up blues,

120
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,718
spending the weekend with two retards.

121
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:17,931
Nice shooting! Man.

122
00:07:18,036 --> 00:07:19,060
What's next?

123
00:07:19,171 --> 00:07:20,605
That bathroom scale.

124
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:23,699
I'm gonna blow up every nice thing
I ever got that woman.

125
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:27,302
I got her that on Valentine's Day.

126
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,370
I'm a romantic.

127
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:30,744
Pull!

128
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,047
Everett!

129
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,615
What are y'all doing?

130
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:41,719
-Shooting shit.
-Grief counseling.

131
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:43,658
Copy that. Going on a beer run.

132
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,967
Nice!

133
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:53,403
-I know. I feel better already.
-Good.

134
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:55,805
Kind of hungry though.
What do you say we hit the mess hall?

135
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,571
Hooters?

136
00:07:58,146 --> 00:07:58,913
Left! Left!

137
00:07:58,913 --> 00:07:59,470
Left! Left!

138
00:07:59,581 --> 00:08:01,606
Left, right, left.

139
00:08:03,885 --> 00:08:06,877
Sir, we just received another
manpower request from Washington.

140
00:08:06,988 --> 00:08:08,785
There's increased fighting
outside of Fallujah.

141
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:09,914
What?

142
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:13,221
Don't those Pentagon pencil-pushers know
we're stretched to the limit down here?

143
00:08:13,328 --> 00:08:14,660
What about those men down
at Chattahoochee?

144
00:08:14,764 --> 00:08:17,392
I don't think they all reported in.

145
00:08:21,637 --> 00:08:24,572
They drill at the Reserve Center
down on Highway 8.

146
00:08:24,673 --> 00:08:28,040
Perhaps you should send Sergeant Kilgore
down there to see what we have.

147
00:08:28,144 --> 00:08:29,338
Kilgore?

148
00:08:31,147 --> 00:08:33,309
He scares the shit out of me.

149
00:08:34,217 --> 00:08:38,051
All I'm saying is some of them girls hadn't
ought to be wearing little shorty-shorts.

150
00:08:38,155 --> 00:08:39,122
That's all I'm saying.

151
00:08:39,222 --> 00:08:40,484
Well, what's Crystal supposed to do?

152
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:43,388
You know Hooters
don't got a maternity leave.

153
00:08:43,493 --> 00:08:45,825
Hey. Who's the new guy?

154
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:48,625
How you doing, Gl Joe? Can I help you?

155
00:08:53,004 --> 00:08:54,801
Sergeant Kilgore.

156
00:08:55,106 --> 00:08:58,564
I'm looking for the men
that didn't mobilize with this unit.

157
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:02,208
-I ain't seen them.
-I think they went over to...

158
00:09:02,313 --> 00:09:03,610
Who's in charge here, soldier?

159
00:09:03,714 --> 00:09:05,272
-I am.
-I am.

160
00:09:06,818 --> 00:09:08,012
This is

161
00:09:09,521 --> 00:09:10,647
quite a setup you got here.

162
00:09:10,756 --> 00:09:11,745
Oh, yeah, it's nice.

163
00:09:11,857 --> 00:09:13,586
We're like a water-head
at the theme park in here.

164
00:09:13,692 --> 00:09:14,716
It's real comfortable.

165
00:09:14,827 --> 00:09:17,625
We're about to watch the game.
You can join us if you want. Grab a chair.

166
00:09:18,697 --> 00:09:21,825
I tell you what, son. You know, I like you.

167
00:09:22,501 --> 00:09:24,696
Why don't I grab a chair,

168
00:09:25,737 --> 00:09:27,763
and shove it up your ass!

169
00:09:28,174 --> 00:09:30,836
Now, stand at attention,
you miserable pissants!

170
00:09:30,944 --> 00:09:34,710
From now on,
you will address me as Sergeant Kilgore!

171
00:09:34,814 --> 00:09:36,782
The honeymoon's over, numb nuts!

172
00:09:36,883 --> 00:09:38,475
I am a warrior,

173
00:09:38,585 --> 00:09:40,212
a killing machine,

174
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,321
and your mama's not
here to wet-nurse you.

175
00:09:44,424 --> 00:09:47,451
Larry's mom passed away
about four years ago.

176
00:09:47,561 --> 00:09:48,550
Yeah, that's true.

177
00:09:48,662 --> 00:09:49,993
She went squirrel hunting
with my Uncle Lester...

178
00:09:50,097 --> 00:09:51,291
Shut up!

179
00:09:52,233 --> 00:09:54,201
I don't know what kind
of horseshit monkey business

180
00:09:54,301 --> 00:09:57,737
has been going on down here,
but that's all about to end, ladies.

181
00:09:57,838 --> 00:09:59,430
This is the Army.

182
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,734
We're just state military reserves.

183
00:10:03,178 --> 00:10:04,475
Yeah. Smurfs.

184
00:10:04,579 --> 00:10:06,444
And I'm a leprechaun.

185
00:10:07,048 --> 00:10:08,777
Now, pack your gear.

186
00:10:09,451 --> 00:10:11,783
But we're just weekend warriors.

187
00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:16,716
Well, I'll tell you what, fat body,

188
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,122
this weekend,

189
00:10:18,226 --> 00:10:19,716
I own your ass!

190
00:10:21,063 --> 00:10:22,553
Son of a bitch.

191
00:10:25,101 --> 00:10:28,195
If there was ever a worse
excuse for a soldier,

192
00:10:28,304 --> 00:10:30,101
I'd like to meet him.

193
00:10:30,206 --> 00:10:31,537
Hey, y'all.

194
00:10:31,707 --> 00:10:35,336
I got Funyuns, beer, and Barely Legal.
Who wants what?

195
00:10:36,112 --> 00:10:39,082
Well, hey, there, Sarge.
Snap into a Slim Jim.

196
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:44,144
Well, this looks like a little slice of heaven.
Can they do this to us?

197
00:10:44,354 --> 00:10:46,618
It's the army, man.
They can do whatever they want.

198
00:10:46,723 --> 00:10:49,157
Welcome to Fort Davis, ladies.

199
00:10:52,462 --> 00:10:55,226
I want another one! Come on! One more!

200
00:10:55,332 --> 00:10:57,392
Up, up, up! Down, up!

201
00:10:57,502 --> 00:10:59,993
All right, you're all mine now.
You ready, Freddy?

202
00:11:00,104 --> 00:11:01,298
Oh, there you go. How about that? Huh?

203
00:11:01,406 --> 00:11:02,873
You like that?

204
00:11:15,219 --> 00:11:18,189
-Get back here!
-What are you doing?

205
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,253
Watch out! Watch out!

206
00:11:20,993 --> 00:11:22,620
Get up there!

207
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,265
Take it like a man!

208
00:11:46,286 --> 00:11:47,776
Get out of here!

209
00:11:49,456 --> 00:11:51,549
You gotta stay clear...

210
00:11:51,859 --> 00:11:54,089
-Come on, Everett. Let me hold it.
-No, no. It's mine.

211
00:11:54,962 --> 00:11:56,862
Look out!

212
00:11:58,499 --> 00:11:59,557
Yeah!

213
00:12:06,841 --> 00:12:09,105
This is a little harder than I thought.

214
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:12,908
But I guess it's the price you pay
to be a trained government killer.

215
00:12:14,516 --> 00:12:17,349
I didn't think they could activate us.

216
00:12:17,452 --> 00:12:20,615
I mean, if I wanted to get my ass kicked,
I'd have stayed home with Connie.

217
00:12:20,722 --> 00:12:24,488
I guess it easier for
a samurai-type like myself.

218
00:12:24,593 --> 00:12:26,151
Accept the pain.

219
00:12:26,395 --> 00:12:28,330
It's cleansing.

220
00:12:28,865 --> 00:12:33,063
Plus, the weekend's almost over.
One more day and we're gone.

221
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:41,301
Besides, how much worse could it get?

222
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:48,075
Rise and shine, ladies!

223
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,054
Where the hell is that other fat turd?

224
00:12:52,156 --> 00:12:53,384
Hey, speaking of turds,

225
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,958
I just left one in there
for the Guinness Book.

226
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,392
Stand at attention, soldier!

227
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:01,854
Congratulations, gentlemen.

228
00:13:02,066 --> 00:13:04,000
We just got our orders.

229
00:13:04,102 --> 00:13:06,036
We're going to paradise,

230
00:13:06,304 --> 00:13:08,738
the land of sand and sun.

231
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,775
-Daytona Beach?
-Fallujah, lraq, numb nuts!

232
00:13:12,377 --> 00:13:14,743
Sarge, excuse me.

233
00:13:15,914 --> 00:13:19,077
Far be it for me to stand in the way
of the war on terror,

234
00:13:19,184 --> 00:13:21,778
but we're supposed to go home tomorrow.

235
00:13:22,221 --> 00:13:25,315
I mean, seriously, we only do this
one weekend a month.

236
00:13:25,424 --> 00:13:28,655
-Yeah, and on Mondays, I cut the grass.
-Wrong, sunshine!

237
00:13:28,761 --> 00:13:30,353
You will be the tip of the spear

238
00:13:30,463 --> 00:13:33,728
Uncle Sam uses to shove
up some insurgent's ass!

239
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,529
Sarge, now that's downright unsanitary.

240
00:13:36,635 --> 00:13:39,661
You know, I read somewhere that them
carpet-fliers don't even use toilet paper.

241
00:13:39,772 --> 00:13:41,331
Can it, dipshit!

242
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:45,605
And don't worry,
you won't be in the rear with the gear.

243
00:13:45,712 --> 00:13:50,149
I plan on volunteering us
for every dangerous assignment there is!

244
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:53,647
Now, I want every one of you
to look to the man on your right!

245
00:13:53,753 --> 00:13:56,221
Now, look to the man on your left,

246
00:13:56,656 --> 00:13:59,455
'cause your life is in his hands.

247
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:03,788
Shit!

248
00:14:04,132 --> 00:14:07,260
Fallujah. No, it's not in Louisiana.

249
00:14:07,768 --> 00:14:09,895
-It's in lraq.
-Why are they sending you to Iraq?

250
00:14:10,004 --> 00:14:12,370
-'Cause I'm going to war!
-War?

251
00:14:12,473 --> 00:14:14,532
-Well, I can't help it.
-Who's gonna mow the grass?

252
00:14:14,642 --> 00:14:16,303
Well, I don't know who's
gonna mow the grass.

253
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,435
God damn it, Bill!

254
00:14:17,546 --> 00:14:19,343
Five hundred dollars?

255
00:14:19,481 --> 00:14:21,745
Damn. Does she have four tits?

256
00:14:22,718 --> 00:14:25,380
Well, how about a military discount?

257
00:14:25,487 --> 00:14:27,114
Hello? Hello?

258
00:14:32,394 --> 00:14:34,624
-Hey, what unit you with?
-101st Airborne.

259
00:14:34,731 --> 00:14:36,699
Screaming Eagles. You?

260
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,399
37th Georgia. The Sleeping Marmots.

261
00:14:41,004 --> 00:14:43,632
What's up, y'all? How'd Connie take it?

262
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,004
Let me just put it this way.
I'll be safer in lraq.

263
00:14:46,109 --> 00:14:47,406
Ten hut!

264
00:14:48,845 --> 00:14:50,972
All right, you maggots,

265
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:53,350
we got a long road ahead of us,

266
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,213
and it won't be easy.

267
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,855
But it's my job as your
sergeant to lead the way.

268
00:14:58,956 --> 00:14:59,923
Gee, thanks, Sarge.

269
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,992
I know I'll feel safer standing
directly behind you

270
00:15:02,092 --> 00:15:03,753
when the bullets start flying.

271
00:15:17,676 --> 00:15:19,405
Can that shit!

272
00:15:21,746 --> 00:15:24,738
Now, Larry,
I'm appointing you acting squad leader.

273
00:15:24,849 --> 00:15:26,578
Don't get too excited.

274
00:15:26,685 --> 00:15:28,949
You beat out a mongoloid and a candy-ass.

275
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:30,784
He called you a candy-ass.

276
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,882
Gee, thanks, Sarge.
You know, I learned a lot about leadership

277
00:15:33,993 --> 00:15:37,087
when I was secretary
of the Midgeville Gun Club.

278
00:15:37,964 --> 00:15:39,192
And don't you worry about it.

279
00:15:39,298 --> 00:15:41,323
Both those shootings
were ruled accidental.

280
00:15:41,434 --> 00:15:43,129
Keep your hands to yourself!

281
00:15:43,236 --> 00:15:45,534
It's don't ask and don't tell
in this man's army.

282
00:15:45,638 --> 00:15:48,335
Now, get your candy-asses on that plane.

283
00:15:52,145 --> 00:15:55,046
Did you hear what I said?
I gave you an order.

284
00:15:55,148 --> 00:15:58,242
You said candy-asses. I'm a mongoloid, sir!

285
00:15:58,352 --> 00:16:00,479
Get your ass on that plane!

286
00:16:01,188 --> 00:16:02,485
Candy-ass.

287
00:16:10,965 --> 00:16:11,954
Oh, sure.

288
00:16:12,066 --> 00:16:14,296
Killing a man
with your bare hands is real easy.

289
00:16:14,402 --> 00:16:16,893
Aside from the assorted
choke holds and head yanks,

290
00:16:17,005 --> 00:16:19,303
you deliver a hand-spear to a man's temple,

291
00:16:19,407 --> 00:16:23,538
Adam's apple, kidneys, armpits,
solar plexus, testicles,

292
00:16:23,646 --> 00:16:26,376
or coccyx, that's the little
bone down by your back...

293
00:16:26,482 --> 00:16:28,074
That's real informative, Everett,

294
00:16:28,183 --> 00:16:30,481
but come on, I'm trying
to get some sleep here.

295
00:16:30,586 --> 00:16:33,612
Of course, all that pales in comparison
to the heart-punch.

296
00:16:33,756 --> 00:16:38,352
It's a strong man's attack,
a sharp blow delivered right to the heart.

297
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,985
Chuck Norris used it once
on the set of Walker, Texas Ranger

298
00:16:41,096 --> 00:16:43,395
to kill some smart-ass intern.

299
00:16:44,834 --> 00:16:46,961
Talk about your hush-money.

300
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,162
All right.

301
00:16:48,271 --> 00:16:50,364
All right. That's it.

302
00:16:54,511 --> 00:16:56,172
Let's hit it.

303
00:17:04,755 --> 00:17:07,519
I don't think the flight attendant
turned off the fasten seatbelt sign.

304
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:10,958
Look, y'all, if I'm gonna die tomorrow,
I want to get a good night's sleep.

305
00:17:11,062 --> 00:17:14,691
My Uncle Dave died in his sleep.
That's a peaceful way to go.

306
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,495
Of course, all his friends died
screaming from the back seat

307
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:19,433
trying to wake him up.

308
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,005
It was a mess.

309
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:22,797
Good night, Everett!

310
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:25,638
-Good night, Larry.
-Good night, Larry.

311
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:33,412
Who farted?

312
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,314
Severe weather alert until 0600 hours.

313
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:40,790
With a possible...

314
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,330
I'm losing all pressure
in engines three and four!

315
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:48,491
Hydraulic pressure down
in the rear stabilizer.

316
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:54,865
Damn it!

317
00:18:13,862 --> 00:18:15,921
-Oh, this is bad.
-Losing altitude.

318
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,999
We're overloaded.
Get ready to dump the gear.

319
00:18:20,935 --> 00:18:22,630
What the...

320
00:18:33,382 --> 00:18:35,942
Hey! Wait a minute!

321
00:18:38,387 --> 00:18:39,820
Come on!

322
00:18:40,656 --> 00:18:42,920
Hey! Wait a minute!

323
00:18:47,229 --> 00:18:48,218
No!

324
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:03,409
I'm gonna kill you miserable pissants!

325
00:19:04,948 --> 00:19:07,008
Did you hear something?

326
00:19:07,718 --> 00:19:08,878
That was weird.

327
00:19:08,986 --> 00:19:10,886
For a minute there,
I thought we were goners.

328
00:19:10,988 --> 00:19:12,649
What are we gonna do
about the gear we dumped?

329
00:19:12,757 --> 00:19:15,817
You fill out the paperwork,
and then it's the Army's problem.

330
00:19:15,927 --> 00:19:19,556
Hey, you like meatloaf?
They got a killer meatloaf in Ramstein.

331
00:19:19,664 --> 00:19:21,131
-Yeah?
-Oh, yeah.

332
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,541
Where the hell?

333
00:19:37,816 --> 00:19:39,511
Oh, son of a bitch.

334
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,785
So, this is it, lraq,

335
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:48,022
jewel of the Middle East,

336
00:19:48,127 --> 00:19:49,992
Iand of the Hammurabis.

337
00:19:50,497 --> 00:19:52,294
Iraq? Oh, damn!

338
00:19:52,732 --> 00:19:55,428
Damn! Hey, we're in... Hey!

339
00:19:55,535 --> 00:19:57,765
We're in lraq! Damn!

340
00:19:57,871 --> 00:19:59,236
Get up! Hey!

341
00:20:00,807 --> 00:20:02,435
Bill, we're in...

342
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,574
What in the name of Siegfried and Roy
are you fellas doing?

343
00:20:07,681 --> 00:20:09,148
Don't ask.

344
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,581
Don't tell.

345
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:12,916
We're in lraq!

346
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,487
We're in lraq!

347
00:20:15,022 --> 00:20:17,582
-All right, now, Larry, calm down.
-Be careful, Everett.

348
00:20:17,691 --> 00:20:19,159
There's a lot of gear scattered around.

349
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:22,458
Now, listen to me, Larry.
Pull yourself together.

350
00:20:22,797 --> 00:20:24,765
Now, we're in a hot zone.

351
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,164
It's time to take it up a notch.

352
00:20:38,648 --> 00:20:39,945
Shot.

353
00:20:41,183 --> 00:20:45,085
Leave it to Everett
to break the only working radio we got.

354
00:20:45,922 --> 00:20:48,220
They drop us in lraq,
they don't even wake us up.

355
00:20:48,324 --> 00:20:51,782
What the hell are we supposed to do now?
I guarantee you this was Kilgore's idea.

356
00:20:51,894 --> 00:20:54,089
All right, let's calm down.

357
00:20:54,497 --> 00:20:58,696
Let's just regroup while we're here.
Last thing we need to do is panic.

358
00:20:58,835 --> 00:21:00,996
Man down! Man down!

359
00:21:01,104 --> 00:21:03,504
Man down! There's a man down!

360
00:21:14,552 --> 00:21:15,678
Sarge?

361
00:21:17,922 --> 00:21:19,822
I think he's dead, y'all.

362
00:21:19,924 --> 00:21:22,085
K.I.A., man! K.I.A.!

363
00:21:23,695 --> 00:21:24,889
Oh, man.

364
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,223
This is gonna be a lawsuit.

365
00:21:35,641 --> 00:21:37,165
Well,

366
00:21:37,276 --> 00:21:39,642
I guess we ought to say a few words.

367
00:21:39,745 --> 00:21:40,803
Bill?

368
00:21:40,913 --> 00:21:43,507
Me? You were closer to him than I was.

369
00:21:43,949 --> 00:21:45,109
Well,

370
00:21:45,517 --> 00:21:46,984
all right.

371
00:21:50,056 --> 00:21:51,216
Lord,

372
00:21:51,825 --> 00:21:55,056
we ask that you be with Sergeant Kilgore.

373
00:21:55,895 --> 00:22:00,161
Sure, he was a mean bastard, incapable
of establishing normal relationships

374
00:22:00,266 --> 00:22:02,131
with any other human being, and...

375
00:22:02,235 --> 00:22:03,702
Larry.

376
00:22:06,072 --> 00:22:07,232
But, Lord...

377
00:22:09,777 --> 00:22:11,711
-Everett!
-Everett!

378
00:22:11,812 --> 00:22:12,779
What the hell are you doing?

379
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,542
When we run out of water,
we're gonna have to drink our own urine.

380
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:18,278
Desert warfare 101, man!

381
00:22:18,386 --> 00:22:21,753
Everett, now's not the time
to be talking about bodily functions.

382
00:22:21,856 --> 00:22:24,723
We're talking to the Lord here!

383
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,994
-You want to say a few words?
-Yeah.

384
00:22:30,132 --> 00:22:31,622
Dear Lord,

385
00:22:31,733 --> 00:22:33,963
I ask you to take this man,

386
00:22:34,069 --> 00:22:35,798
for richer or for poorer,

387
00:22:35,904 --> 00:22:39,533
as he walks through the valley
of the shadow of death.

388
00:22:39,641 --> 00:22:41,233
And also, dear Lord,

389
00:22:41,343 --> 00:22:43,470
the Powerball's up to 90 million.

390
00:22:43,578 --> 00:22:46,241
So, if you could help me out,
I sure would appreciate it.

391
00:22:46,349 --> 00:22:47,680
Amen!

392
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:51,408
-That was just great, Everett.
-Yeah, real touching.

393
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,685
Powerball!

394
00:23:35,533 --> 00:23:37,558
Come on! Get some!

395
00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:38,898
Get some!

396
00:23:43,209 --> 00:23:44,938
All right, ladies,

397
00:23:46,078 --> 00:23:48,137
Iet's git-r-done.

398
00:23:50,316 --> 00:23:53,114
Operation shock and awe!

399
00:23:53,219 --> 00:23:54,777
Here we go!

400
00:23:54,887 --> 00:23:56,651
Kill, kill, kill!

401
00:24:34,096 --> 00:24:36,656
All right, y'all, let's fan out.

402
00:24:38,433 --> 00:24:42,836
I'll secure the perimeter.
That Charlie's a real sneaky bastard!

403
00:24:42,938 --> 00:24:43,927
Charlie?

404
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:46,064
You think Everett's mom drank
during pregnancy?

405
00:24:46,175 --> 00:24:49,042
Yeah, and I'm guessing
she sniffed paint thinner, too.

406
00:24:59,022 --> 00:25:01,456
Well, what do we have here?

407
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,726
Damn!

408
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:08,097
You know who that is?
That's the Butcher of Baghdad, buddy.

409
00:25:08,198 --> 00:25:10,167
That's Saddam Hussein.

410
00:25:10,267 --> 00:25:11,928
He's an ugly son of a bitch, isn't he?

411
00:25:12,036 --> 00:25:14,197
Kind of looks like that fellow
that works the register

412
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:15,772
down there at the Circle K.

413
00:25:15,873 --> 00:25:17,738
You know, Rugburn.

414
00:25:17,842 --> 00:25:19,309
You mean Raji?

415
00:25:20,211 --> 00:25:22,475
Yeah, that little lndian fella.

416
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:25,310
He's a red-dot lndian though,
not a tomahawk lndian.

417
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:27,885
You're crazy.
That don't look nothing like him.

418
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:30,284
Only an idiot would think that.

419
00:25:31,323 --> 00:25:34,190
Oh, look! It's Raji from Circle K!

420
00:25:34,292 --> 00:25:35,725
Y'all hungry?

421
00:25:40,899 --> 00:25:42,526
What's wrong with it?
Why aren't you eating?

422
00:25:42,634 --> 00:25:44,625
I got spaghetti and meat sauce.

423
00:25:44,736 --> 00:25:45,726
So?

424
00:25:46,305 --> 00:25:48,466
It gives me bad gas.

425
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:51,969
Fine. Take my beef stew.

426
00:25:53,746 --> 00:25:55,737
Larry, what the hell is that?

427
00:25:55,848 --> 00:25:57,645
I needed a spit cup.

428
00:25:59,852 --> 00:26:01,479
Just eat around it.

429
00:26:01,587 --> 00:26:04,580
That's gross. Come on.
We gotta get on the road.

430
00:26:26,547 --> 00:26:29,744
Why don't you just admit it? We're lost!

431
00:26:29,851 --> 00:26:31,409
He thinks you're lost!

432
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:34,283
There's a town right over this next ridge!

433
00:26:37,392 --> 00:26:38,359
Wait a minute.

434
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,019
Nope.

435
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:42,461
We're lost.

436
00:26:43,065 --> 00:26:45,260
Nothing to report from my patrols.

437
00:26:45,367 --> 00:26:48,029
Damn it, I thought
we was gonna be in the shit.

438
00:26:48,137 --> 00:26:49,604
When am I gonna get to shoot somebody?

439
00:26:49,705 --> 00:26:52,265
Everett, there are specific
rules of engagement.

440
00:26:52,374 --> 00:26:53,932
There are friendlies around.

441
00:26:54,043 --> 00:26:56,273
You can't just run around shooting people.

442
00:26:56,378 --> 00:26:58,404
You got your Geneva Convention
to think about.

443
00:26:58,515 --> 00:27:01,143
Rule is you don't fire
unless you're fired upon.

444
00:27:01,251 --> 00:27:03,242
-You understand?
-Yep.

445
00:27:13,063 --> 00:27:16,522
One shot, one kill! Get some!

446
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:19,660
Damn it, Everett!
What the hell are you doing?

447
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,032
Nice shooting!

448
00:27:21,138 --> 00:27:24,164
Down on your knees,
hands behind your head!

449
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:31,373
Easy, man! This ain't Cops.

450
00:27:31,482 --> 00:27:34,646
-I was on Cops once. Remember?
-Who could forget?

451
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:38,189
High speed pursuit
followed by indecent exposure.

452
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,952
That was the best Thanksgiving ever.

453
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:44,395
All right, assume the position.

454
00:27:46,932 --> 00:27:49,332
Well, congratulations, Everett!

455
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:51,800
You just killed yourself a donkey.

456
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,562
We don't even know
if they have a donkey season.

457
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:55,766
What do we do now?

458
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:08,018
-Come on. Let me blow them both away.
-Calm down, Everett.

459
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:11,355
I guess since I'm squad leader,
I ought to do the interrogating.

460
00:28:11,558 --> 00:28:14,118
Besides that, everybody knows
I'm a skilled communicator.

461
00:28:16,463 --> 00:28:18,294
Who are you?

462
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,734
Are you Republican Guard?

463
00:28:23,604 --> 00:28:25,629
Larry,

464
00:28:25,739 --> 00:28:28,105
they're not deaf, they're lraqi.

465
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:32,640
What we need to do is find out
whether they're Turds or Shitites.

466
00:28:33,782 --> 00:28:35,773
I think you mean Kurds or Shiites.

467
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:48,888
Hi.

468
00:28:48,998 --> 00:28:50,829
My name's Larry.

469
00:28:51,934 --> 00:28:54,334
We're here to liberate your people.

470
00:28:55,604 --> 00:28:58,266
We bring gifts of freedom and democracy.

471
00:29:00,076 --> 00:29:02,135
Oh, sorry about your donkey.

472
00:29:11,755 --> 00:29:13,655
Freedoms?

473
00:29:13,857 --> 00:29:17,315
Freedom. Yeah, right.
We're here to liberate you.

474
00:29:17,961 --> 00:29:19,929
-Freedoms!
-Freedoms!

475
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,429
-Freedoms!
-Freedoms!

476
00:29:21,531 --> 00:29:22,931
Freedom, yeah!

477
00:29:23,034 --> 00:29:24,501
-Freedoms.
-Freedoms.

478
00:29:24,602 --> 00:29:26,399
Freedoms! Freedoms!

479
00:29:26,504 --> 00:29:27,698
Shut up!

480
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,308
Your village?
Is your village named Baslamabad?

481
00:29:36,314 --> 00:29:37,804
Freedoms!

482
00:29:37,915 --> 00:29:41,647
-Yeah, freedoms.
-This is it, fellas. This is our objective.

483
00:29:41,854 --> 00:29:43,845
Get ready to be heroes.

484
00:29:44,056 --> 00:29:48,117
I wish Sarge was here right now.
He'd be so dag-gum proud of us.

485
00:29:50,262 --> 00:29:51,729
It's alive!

486
00:29:58,137 --> 00:29:59,298
Iraq,

487
00:30:00,206 --> 00:30:02,140
it's a land of miracles.

488
00:30:16,656 --> 00:30:18,420
Where the hell am l?

489
00:30:21,962 --> 00:30:23,930
You gotta be shitting me!

490
00:30:40,182 --> 00:30:43,879
Son of a bitch!
I'm gonna kill those miserable pissants!

491
00:30:51,493 --> 00:30:53,188
What do you see?

492
00:30:54,363 --> 00:30:57,423
Not much. I forgot to take off the lens caps.

493
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,767
-And he's in charge.
-I know.

494
00:31:04,774 --> 00:31:05,832
Well?

495
00:31:06,275 --> 00:31:07,640
Iraqi insurgents. Four of them.

496
00:31:08,277 --> 00:31:09,574
Freedoms. Freedoms.

497
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,240
Just hold on, Saddam.

498
00:31:13,283 --> 00:31:16,309
Look, this is what I think we should do.

499
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,684
We just sit tight
until reinforcements get here.

500
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:20,552
The 101st Airborne is
gonna be here any minute.

501
00:31:20,657 --> 00:31:23,455
These people are in trouble.
I think we're dealing with Fedayin.

502
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,822
Damn right they're in trouble.

503
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:28,091
I had some of that Fedayin
at the Parthenon Cafe.

504
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,394
Greek food goes right through me.

505
00:31:32,503 --> 00:31:34,494
Irritable bowel syndrome.

506
00:31:40,378 --> 00:31:42,369
It looks like she needs our help.

507
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,504
She?

508
00:31:44,682 --> 00:31:46,149
I mean "they."

509
00:31:48,687 --> 00:31:51,281
They appear to be C-cups.

510
00:31:52,591 --> 00:31:55,025
All right, listen. Our orders are clear.

511
00:31:55,127 --> 00:31:56,754
We have to engage the enemy.

512
00:31:56,862 --> 00:31:58,159
Gentlemen,

513
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,898
you know what they say
in the Army, Semper fi.

514
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,432
That would be the Marines.

515
00:32:05,671 --> 00:32:07,230
Stay here.

516
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,706
Don't worry about anything.
The cavalry is on the way.

517
00:32:09,809 --> 00:32:11,834
They are? Oh, thank God.

518
00:32:12,646 --> 00:32:16,946
I thought for a second you wanted us
to go down there by ourselves.

519
00:32:20,787 --> 00:32:23,585
When this is over, I am so gonna sue you.

520
00:32:27,728 --> 00:32:30,663
What we need is some fighting music.

521
00:32:34,602 --> 00:32:36,502
What the hell's that?

522
00:32:37,738 --> 00:32:38,932
Hold on.

523
00:32:46,114 --> 00:32:47,672
Here we go.

524
00:32:47,783 --> 00:32:49,410
God bless America!

525
00:33:01,464 --> 00:33:03,398
-Should I shoot?
-Hold your fire!

526
00:33:03,499 --> 00:33:05,626
-Did you say fire?
-I said hold your fire!

527
00:33:05,735 --> 00:33:07,726
All right, I'm gonna fire!

528
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:10,436
It's Rambo! Let's get out of here!

529
00:33:12,542 --> 00:33:13,975
I'm going in!

530
00:33:41,639 --> 00:33:43,539
On the ground, now!

531
00:33:43,641 --> 00:33:45,609
I'm a trained killing machine!

532
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:47,177
Everett!

533
00:33:48,113 --> 00:33:50,377
I think you got her, Everett!

534
00:33:52,851 --> 00:33:53,840
Oh.

535
00:33:56,789 --> 00:33:58,620
Where the hell's Larry?

536
00:33:59,225 --> 00:34:01,625
I guess that coward run off, huh?

537
00:34:01,727 --> 00:34:04,525
Not everybody's cut out
for the rigors of combat.

538
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,492
The other three got away,
but I got this guy.

539
00:34:08,601 --> 00:34:10,364
Oh, hey there, Larry.

540
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:12,064
Thank you for the help, Everett.

541
00:34:12,171 --> 00:34:15,369
I was just telling Bill here,
what a good job you done.

542
00:34:20,013 --> 00:34:22,481
That lraqi is a pretty language, ain't it?

543
00:34:22,582 --> 00:34:24,675
Think they're friendly?

544
00:34:24,785 --> 00:34:26,548
It's a very delicate situation

545
00:34:26,653 --> 00:34:29,645
that calls for the soft touch
of a diplomat, so...

546
00:34:29,756 --> 00:34:31,748
I am your king!

547
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:33,554
Bow down before me!

548
00:34:38,966 --> 00:34:41,059
Everett, get down from there!

549
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:49,143
Not just a job, it's an adventure.

550
00:34:49,244 --> 00:34:52,577
Yeah. That's the Navy,
but I know what you're saying.

551
00:35:06,128 --> 00:35:08,029
Wish the Sarge was here to see this.

552
00:35:21,444 --> 00:35:24,470
At least those idiots left me
something to eat.

553
00:35:32,723 --> 00:35:34,054
Oh, Christ!

554
00:35:39,497 --> 00:35:41,795
Oh, I'll be damned! Hey! Hey!

555
00:35:43,133 --> 00:35:44,965
Hey, am I glad to see you!

556
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,367
Hey...

557
00:35:46,972 --> 00:35:49,338
I don't parla any Espanola,

558
00:35:49,441 --> 00:35:51,432
but either of you two amigos
habla Inglese?

559
00:35:57,749 --> 00:35:59,614
I need a ride to the next town.

560
00:36:00,485 --> 00:36:04,081
El ride-o in el car-o to el town-o.

561
00:36:06,893 --> 00:36:08,053
Hey, tequila, eh?

562
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,094
Si. Tequila!

563
00:36:10,196 --> 00:36:12,061
Hey, hey. All right. Okay.

564
00:36:16,469 --> 00:36:17,436
Yeah, well...

565
00:36:17,537 --> 00:36:19,528
You two pissants gonna give me a ride
to the next town?

566
00:36:32,219 --> 00:36:33,277
Oh, good!

567
00:36:35,055 --> 00:36:36,113
Yeah!

568
00:36:36,957 --> 00:36:38,619
You're all right, amigo!

569
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,186
Right on!

570
00:36:42,163 --> 00:36:43,391
Right on!

571
00:36:50,238 --> 00:36:53,332
Hey, Everett, why don't you
go guard the prisoner?

572
00:36:53,441 --> 00:36:54,931
Oh, hell, yeah!

573
00:36:59,248 --> 00:37:01,978
Should we be worried
he's too excited about this?

574
00:37:02,084 --> 00:37:03,244
Probably.

575
00:37:04,453 --> 00:37:05,852
Hey, man,

576
00:37:05,955 --> 00:37:07,445
radio's had it.

577
00:37:07,723 --> 00:37:10,783
And I did a house to house search,
and there ain't nothing close to a phone

578
00:37:10,893 --> 00:37:12,793
in this little podunk town.

579
00:37:12,895 --> 00:37:14,989
-So, what now?
-Well,

580
00:37:16,132 --> 00:37:18,293
reckon we ought to maintain
a defensive posture,

581
00:37:18,401 --> 00:37:20,926
and then hold our position here
in case there's a counterattack.

582
00:37:21,037 --> 00:37:24,404
And then, we'll link up with
some reinforcements.

583
00:37:24,841 --> 00:37:26,172
I don't even know what that means.

584
00:37:26,276 --> 00:37:27,368
I bought it.

585
00:37:27,477 --> 00:37:29,468
You know, I gotta say,

586
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:30,910
feeling pretty good.

587
00:37:31,081 --> 00:37:32,549
A couple days ago,

588
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,118
I had more problems
than a Cub Scout at the Neverland Ranch,

589
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:37,210
but now I think I've found my true calling.

590
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:39,016
Yeah? And what might that be?

591
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:40,112
Well, think about it.

592
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,555
We're in lraq,

593
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:44,025
the most dangerous place in the world,

594
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:46,995
well, except for maybe Detroit,

595
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:50,124
but the point is, I've been tested
in the crucible of battle,

596
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:54,467
and my troops seized their objective
and didn't even get a scratch.

597
00:37:56,408 --> 00:38:00,105
I think I'm cut out
for this military stuff after all.

598
00:38:03,382 --> 00:38:06,715
All right, Akmed.
Don't get your burka in a wad.

599
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:07,910
Jesus.

600
00:38:08,688 --> 00:38:10,622
I thought maybe we'd see
more turbans around here.

601
00:38:10,723 --> 00:38:11,781
Yeah.

602
00:38:15,128 --> 00:38:16,152
Hey!

603
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,235
Boy, them lraqis really know
how to throw a good party.

604
00:38:24,337 --> 00:38:25,304
How are you?

605
00:38:25,405 --> 00:38:27,135
Thank you for saving our village.

606
00:38:27,241 --> 00:38:28,833
Hold on, Abdul! You speak English?

607
00:38:28,942 --> 00:38:32,036
Of course! Many of us do!
You're country is very close to ours.

608
00:38:32,146 --> 00:38:33,875
That's right! Our people are friends

609
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:35,846
in freedom and democracy.

610
00:38:35,949 --> 00:38:39,908
Oh, right.
We're also very close together literally.

611
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:43,881
-Somebody ought to get this guy a map.
-Yeah.

612
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:45,584
Hey, how are you?

613
00:38:51,933 --> 00:38:53,924
Man, that smells delicious!

614
00:38:54,402 --> 00:38:56,700
What do you call this local delicacy?

615
00:38:56,805 --> 00:38:58,932
-Tacos.
-Tacos?

616
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,065
-Si, si. Tacos.
-You got tacos here?

617
00:39:01,176 --> 00:39:02,473
This is...

618
00:39:02,577 --> 00:39:03,909
Who would have thought
they'd have tacos here?

619
00:39:04,046 --> 00:39:07,777
Tell you what, if they got pork rinds,
I'm never leaving.

620
00:39:10,386 --> 00:39:11,353
That's delicious!

621
00:39:11,454 --> 00:39:13,820
You do realize
that's probably a camel ass taco.

622
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:18,357
I wish my wife could
cook camel ass this good.

623
00:39:25,802 --> 00:39:28,430
Gentlemen, allow me to introduce myself.

624
00:39:28,538 --> 00:39:30,267
My name is Maria Garcia,

625
00:39:30,373 --> 00:39:34,400
and this is my father, Antonio Garcia,
the mayor of La Miranda.

626
00:39:34,878 --> 00:39:36,505
We owe you our lives.

627
00:39:36,613 --> 00:39:39,378
Thank you for freeing us
from under the thumb of these bandits.

628
00:39:39,484 --> 00:39:40,781
It's been far too long.

629
00:39:40,885 --> 00:39:42,409
Oh, it's our pleasure, Mayor.

630
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,249
Bill Little, U.S. Army.

631
00:39:45,423 --> 00:39:48,859
It's my honor to introduce you
to General Eisenhower.

632
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:52,286
He's currently the ranking officer
in this theater of operations.

633
00:39:54,699 --> 00:39:56,690
You can just call me Larry.

634
00:39:57,936 --> 00:40:02,396
You answered our prayers today, General,
and you were very brave.

635
00:40:02,508 --> 00:40:05,272
Oh, shoot. It's just part of the job.

636
00:40:05,377 --> 00:40:08,175
This evening is yours.
Our town is your town.

637
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,680
Please, please, enjoy yourselves.

638
00:40:20,226 --> 00:40:22,456
A general?
What the hell did you say that for?

639
00:40:22,562 --> 00:40:26,020
Well, what did you want me to say?
Hey, Maria, meet my buddy, Larry.

640
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,690
He just got fired from Cowboy Franks,

641
00:40:27,801 --> 00:40:30,133
and his girlfriend is carrying
a parolee's baby.

642
00:40:30,236 --> 00:40:31,635
Funny.

643
00:40:33,006 --> 00:40:35,237
I tell you what, though, she is a looker.

644
00:40:35,342 --> 00:40:38,505
You play your cards right,
and you could end up with a war bride.

645
00:40:38,612 --> 00:40:40,807
-War bride?
-Yeah.

646
00:40:41,182 --> 00:40:45,209
It's the right of every American fighting
man to take a wife in a combat zone.

647
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:48,447
My Uncle Charlie came home
from Korea with one.

648
00:40:48,556 --> 00:40:50,456
Boy, Aunt Rose was pissed.

649
00:40:51,025 --> 00:40:52,687
-Hey, let's have a toast.
-A toast.

650
00:40:52,794 --> 00:40:54,125
The Army...

651
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:58,165
-Leave the driving to us.
-Good God, man.

652
00:40:58,266 --> 00:40:59,858
That's Greyhound.

653
00:41:01,636 --> 00:41:04,332
Might as well fess up, Haji,

654
00:41:04,439 --> 00:41:09,274
'cause I'm gonna break you down
till I get the truth out of your ass.

655
00:41:09,644 --> 00:41:11,909
I don't know what you want.

656
00:41:12,014 --> 00:41:13,811
I'm just a poor Mexican.

657
00:41:13,916 --> 00:41:16,646
Oh. A foreign fighter, huh?

658
00:41:16,752 --> 00:41:19,277
Well, that's even worse in my book.

659
00:41:19,388 --> 00:41:22,983
I should just ship you off
to Guantanamera Bay right now.

660
00:41:24,727 --> 00:41:26,718
Don't you mean Guantanamo Bay?

661
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:33,895
Guantanamo, Gorgonzola!
They're all hell-holes, man!

662
00:41:34,004 --> 00:41:36,598
Hey, Everett, I think we ought to...

663
00:41:36,707 --> 00:41:38,470
What the hell are you wearing?

664
00:41:38,575 --> 00:41:39,974
This is my sniper suit.

665
00:41:40,077 --> 00:41:42,409
I'm doing some serious Psyop
shit here, man.

666
00:41:42,512 --> 00:41:45,811
-We weren't issued any sniper gear.
-I brought it from home.

667
00:41:45,917 --> 00:41:48,511
Well, you look like a retard Chewbacca.

668
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,917
How's it going with this guy?

669
00:41:50,021 --> 00:41:52,387
Oh, he's a tough nut to crack,
but I'm gonna bust...

670
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:53,650
Let me handle it!

671
00:41:53,758 --> 00:41:55,726
I don't know nothing.

672
00:41:55,827 --> 00:41:58,523
Where are the weapons
of mass destruction?

673
00:42:01,065 --> 00:42:04,558
Are you Republican Guard or Al-Qaeda?

674
00:42:06,038 --> 00:42:08,302
Are you a Turd or a Shitite?

675
00:42:08,407 --> 00:42:10,568
Wait a minute. What...

676
00:42:10,676 --> 00:42:13,042
Weapons of mass destruction?

677
00:42:16,181 --> 00:42:19,173
You guys actually think that you're in...

678
00:42:23,556 --> 00:42:25,251
Hey, what's so funny?

679
00:42:25,392 --> 00:42:27,826
You're not in lraq, gringo.

680
00:42:30,397 --> 00:42:31,557
Gringo.

681
00:42:32,399 --> 00:42:34,390
That's what you say in...

682
00:42:35,502 --> 00:42:36,833
Oh, my God!

683
00:42:37,003 --> 00:42:38,129
What?

684
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:41,964
Are we in France?

685
00:42:53,554 --> 00:42:54,885
Hey, buddy!

686
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:59,392
This is gonna sound crazy,
but we might be in Mexico!

687
00:43:06,902 --> 00:43:07,891
Oh.

688
00:43:08,704 --> 00:43:10,331
Well, this is bad.

689
00:43:10,706 --> 00:43:12,367
Really bad.

690
00:43:12,474 --> 00:43:15,102
Slow down. It's not that big a deal.

691
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:17,611
We invaded Mexico.

692
00:43:17,814 --> 00:43:19,042
And we're AWOL.

693
00:43:19,148 --> 00:43:22,345
I mean, that alone is 10 years
in Leavenworth.

694
00:43:22,785 --> 00:43:24,343
I can't do time.

695
00:43:25,088 --> 00:43:26,715
Prison's full of chubby-chasers.

696
00:43:26,823 --> 00:43:30,054
Hope you got smokes.
Cigarettes is currency in the joint, man.

697
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:33,185
You can't buy a prison bitch or a shank
for anything less than a carton of Kools.

698
00:43:33,296 --> 00:43:36,664
Everett, don't you have something else
to be doing?

699
00:43:36,767 --> 00:43:39,258
Yep. I'll go question the villagers.

700
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:42,066
See if there's been
any bin Laden sightings.

701
00:43:42,172 --> 00:43:43,935
We're in Mexico!

702
00:43:44,041 --> 00:43:45,372
Roger that.

703
00:43:46,677 --> 00:43:48,304
I'm a screw-up.

704
00:43:48,412 --> 00:43:53,441
I finally found something I was good at,
and what I do, invade a friendly nation.

705
00:43:53,551 --> 00:43:56,111
We were asleep during the drop.

706
00:43:56,221 --> 00:43:58,416
Who's to say the Army
doesn't want us to be here?

707
00:43:58,523 --> 00:44:01,549
Why would they want us here?
This is Mexico.

708
00:44:01,893 --> 00:44:05,829
We committed an act of war
inside a sovereign nation.

709
00:44:06,331 --> 00:44:09,164
This is an international incident
just waiting to happen.

710
00:44:09,267 --> 00:44:11,896
One man's international incident
is another man's preemptive strike

711
00:44:12,004 --> 00:44:13,437
in the war on terror.

712
00:44:13,539 --> 00:44:15,905
Those men weren't terrorists.

713
00:44:16,642 --> 00:44:18,507
Hang on. Tell him, Everett.

714
00:44:19,311 --> 00:44:23,213
The U.S. Government defines terrorism
as the unlawful use or threatened use

715
00:44:23,315 --> 00:44:27,217
of force or violence to intimidate
or coerce governments or societies,

716
00:44:27,319 --> 00:44:30,380
often for ideological or political reasons.

717
00:44:32,125 --> 00:44:34,616
Now, I don't know about you,

718
00:44:35,595 --> 00:44:37,495
but those fellows sound
like terrorists to me.

719
00:44:37,597 --> 00:44:39,428
Hell, my wife could be a terrorist.

720
00:44:39,533 --> 00:44:42,331
Look, man, these people
think we're heroes,

721
00:44:42,436 --> 00:44:44,404
and there's nothing we can do
about it right now.

722
00:44:44,504 --> 00:44:46,563
Eventually, somebody's gonna
come get us.

723
00:44:46,673 --> 00:44:48,539
So, I say we just enjoy ourselves.

724
00:44:48,643 --> 00:44:50,133
Señor Bill?

725
00:44:50,244 --> 00:44:52,974
We have more tacos and cervezas for you.

726
00:44:53,347 --> 00:44:56,373
You see?
If we leave now, the terrorists win.

727
00:45:02,323 --> 00:45:04,154
Everett, where did you get that cannon?

728
00:45:04,258 --> 00:45:07,251
This is an 1875 Napoleon 12-pounder.

729
00:45:07,362 --> 00:45:10,126
Only an amateur like yourself
would call it a cannon.

730
00:45:10,232 --> 00:45:12,757
I found it out behind a barn.

731
00:45:12,868 --> 00:45:15,564
I thought that court order said you
wasn't supposed to be around cannons.

732
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:16,797
Only in the state of Georgia.

733
00:45:16,905 --> 00:45:18,805
General Eisenhower,

734
00:45:18,907 --> 00:45:20,898
how come you're not at the party?

735
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:25,739
Oh, I'm just strategizing my next
counteroffensive against the insurgents.

736
00:45:26,516 --> 00:45:28,381
Or something like that.

737
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:31,553
So, you thought this was lraq.

738
00:45:32,122 --> 00:45:34,716
How can that happen? This is Mexico.

739
00:45:34,824 --> 00:45:38,487
Well, we kind of confused our latitudes
with our longitudes,

740
00:45:38,595 --> 00:45:41,565
and our stalagmites with our stalactites.

741
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:44,667
-It's a long story.
-Well, I don't care.

742
00:45:44,768 --> 00:45:46,861
You saved our village from those animals.

743
00:45:46,971 --> 00:45:49,166
Yeah, who were those guys?

744
00:45:49,306 --> 00:45:51,206
They are vicious bandidos.

745
00:45:51,642 --> 00:45:55,976
Their leader is a cruel man,
nothing more than a common criminal.

746
00:45:56,213 --> 00:45:58,704
He's preyed upon our village for years,

747
00:45:58,816 --> 00:46:01,809
stealing our crops
and what little else we have.

748
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,547
You think they might be back?

749
00:46:03,755 --> 00:46:06,622
No. They are cowards.

750
00:46:07,225 --> 00:46:11,093
And now we have a brave general here
to protect us.

751
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:13,764
Well, about that, I'm...

752
00:46:13,999 --> 00:46:16,467
I'm not actually a general.

753
00:46:16,568 --> 00:46:20,562
I am a squad leader though,
and that's pretty high up there.

754
00:46:21,307 --> 00:46:24,868
One day, I hope to travel
across those mountains to the ocean.

755
00:46:25,011 --> 00:46:29,004
And I will open a cantina
on a beautiful beach far away from here.

756
00:46:29,615 --> 00:46:32,880
Well, if you need an assistant manager,
I got some experience.

757
00:46:34,587 --> 00:46:36,078
Maria!

758
00:46:36,924 --> 00:46:39,051
That's my father. I must go.

759
00:46:39,693 --> 00:46:43,356
But perhaps you will allow me the honor
to cook dinner for you some night?

760
00:46:44,598 --> 00:46:47,032
The honor would be all mine.

761
00:46:47,634 --> 00:46:49,693
-Good night.
-Good night.

762
00:46:50,037 --> 00:46:51,265
Oh...

763
00:46:51,939 --> 00:46:53,270
What was the name of that bandit leader?

764
00:46:55,643 --> 00:46:58,612
His name is one that strikes fear

765
00:46:58,713 --> 00:47:01,375
into the hearts
of decent people everywhere.

766
00:47:01,683 --> 00:47:05,449
The bastard's name is Carlos Santana.

767
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:19,697
Let's get this party started!

768
00:47:19,802 --> 00:47:22,168
Okay, so where's the entertainment?

769
00:47:22,605 --> 00:47:24,368
Bring out the gringo!

770
00:47:25,407 --> 00:47:28,535
El Jefe, I think you're really
going to like this act, Jefe.

771
00:47:28,744 --> 00:47:31,077
We kidnapped him from a hotel in Cancún.

772
00:47:32,082 --> 00:47:35,279
So, without further ado,
por favor, please welcome

773
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:38,047
the Amazing Ken and Rufus!

774
00:47:40,523 --> 00:47:44,220
Thank you. Quite a crowd.
What do you think, Rufus?

775
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:46,789
Lots of Mexicans tonight.

776
00:47:46,896 --> 00:47:50,856
Feels like I'm standing
in front of the Home Depot.

777
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:55,303
Be nice, Rufus. How about a joke?

778
00:47:55,406 --> 00:47:56,395
Okay.

779
00:47:56,507 --> 00:48:02,104
Do you know why there were only
3,000 Mexicans at the Battle of the Alamo?

780
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:05,205
-No. Why?
-They only had four trucks.

781
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:07,378
Boo! Boo!

782
00:48:07,486 --> 00:48:08,646
That's not funny!

783
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:12,950
Relax, sweetheart.
I did not know this was a gay bar.

784
00:48:14,526 --> 00:48:16,460
He's just kidding.

785
00:48:17,195 --> 00:48:19,425
What is your name, sir?

786
00:48:19,531 --> 00:48:21,294
I am Carlos Santana.

787
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,800
Holy shit! The singer?

788
00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:27,801
No, not the singer!
I'm the real Carlos Santana!

789
00:48:27,907 --> 00:48:31,468
Man of courage, honor. The leader of men!

790
00:48:31,978 --> 00:48:34,776
That other guy, he is just a guitar player.

791
00:48:34,881 --> 00:48:37,247
Yeah, well, I think you both suck.

792
00:48:40,586 --> 00:48:42,247
You shot Rufus!

793
00:48:43,691 --> 00:48:46,251
I was aiming for the Amazing Ken.

794
00:48:54,268 --> 00:48:57,499
Luis, you are back.
How did the pillaging go?

795
00:48:59,373 --> 00:49:01,001
Not so good, Jefe.

796
00:49:01,142 --> 00:49:02,871
What do you mean, not so good?

797
00:49:02,977 --> 00:49:04,569
There was a problem.

798
00:49:04,679 --> 00:49:06,112
And we could not get your tribute.

799
00:49:06,214 --> 00:49:07,181
What?

800
00:49:07,282 --> 00:49:10,683
Jefe, you don't understand!
There's nothing we could do.

801
00:49:11,319 --> 00:49:13,014
The American Army show up.

802
00:49:14,522 --> 00:49:16,888
There were hundreds of them.

803
00:49:16,991 --> 00:49:20,894
They captured Ricardo.
Jefe, we barely escaped with our lives.

804
00:49:21,764 --> 00:49:24,255
Gringo soldiers in La Miranda.

805
00:49:24,567 --> 00:49:26,159
It was good you brought me this news.

806
00:49:26,268 --> 00:49:29,362
Since they shut off the cable,
I can't get CNN.

807
00:49:29,472 --> 00:49:30,666
Hard to stay current.

808
00:49:32,141 --> 00:49:34,974
I thought you were going to kill me.

809
00:49:35,277 --> 00:49:37,405
Kill you?

810
00:49:37,514 --> 00:49:40,039
We have shared
many a great adventure together.

811
00:49:42,452 --> 00:49:45,580
I would never kill you.

812
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:51,584
Paco and Hector are going to kill you.

813
00:49:53,363 --> 00:49:55,559
Jefe, please don't kill me! Jefe! Jefe, no!

814
00:49:55,666 --> 00:49:58,328
Jefe! Are we going to destroy La Miranda?

815
00:50:00,004 --> 00:50:02,495
No, I don't like to work on the weekends.

816
00:50:02,607 --> 00:50:05,235
Tonight, it's karaoke!

817
00:50:31,871 --> 00:50:34,339
What did you guys do last night?

818
00:50:34,441 --> 00:50:36,739
You missed a hell of a party.

819
00:50:36,843 --> 00:50:38,140
You were partying?

820
00:50:38,244 --> 00:50:40,269
It's part of the hero business, man.

821
00:50:40,947 --> 00:50:43,780
For us not to partake in the celebration
would have just been rude.

822
00:50:43,883 --> 00:50:44,850
Relax.

823
00:50:45,151 --> 00:50:48,484
We're goodwill ambassadors
winning over hearts and minds.

824
00:50:48,588 --> 00:50:52,081
Everett, that's exactly why
you shouldn't drink tequila.

825
00:50:52,193 --> 00:50:53,251
Damn.

826
00:50:54,028 --> 00:50:56,963
This always happens when I eat the worm.

827
00:50:57,064 --> 00:50:58,554
Where were you?

828
00:51:00,234 --> 00:51:03,169
You went and saw
that little girl, didn't you?

829
00:51:04,138 --> 00:51:05,469
Did y'all do the chimichanga?

830
00:51:05,573 --> 00:51:08,008
Oh, come on, Bill. Don't be crude, man.

831
00:51:08,109 --> 00:51:10,577
Larry's a gentleman, and Maria's a lady.

832
00:51:10,679 --> 00:51:12,271
Did you bang her?

833
00:51:12,414 --> 00:51:17,078
All right, listen, I was up all night thinking
about our situation.

834
00:51:17,185 --> 00:51:20,677
We just can't be running around
a country we're not supposed to be in.

835
00:51:20,789 --> 00:51:24,190
So, I think we ought to just stay right here
and wait for the Army to pick us up.

836
00:51:24,292 --> 00:51:26,090
-So, we're staying?
-Relax.

837
00:51:26,195 --> 00:51:28,060
This ain't the infield at Talladega.

838
00:51:28,164 --> 00:51:29,722
Since we're stuck here,

839
00:51:29,832 --> 00:51:32,562
I figure we ought to do
what we're supposed to do.

840
00:51:32,668 --> 00:51:34,636
And these folks have
been pretty hospitable.

841
00:51:35,505 --> 00:51:39,703
I think it's time we return the favor.
So, come on, let's get to it.

842
00:51:42,345 --> 00:51:46,715
-You want to change there, señorita?
-Oh, I forgot I had this on.

843
00:51:46,817 --> 00:51:48,375
It really breathes.

844
00:51:49,286 --> 00:51:52,619
Iraq? You guys may want to buy a map, eh?

845
00:51:52,723 --> 00:51:55,123
But what my father means to say

846
00:51:55,225 --> 00:51:56,988
is that we are really appreciative

847
00:51:57,094 --> 00:51:59,221
for what you have done
for our poor village.

848
00:51:59,329 --> 00:52:01,058
We know we messed up,

849
00:52:01,965 --> 00:52:04,491
and kind of hoping
we can keep this our little secret.

850
00:52:04,702 --> 00:52:06,829
We'd like to stick around
and provide perimeter security

851
00:52:06,938 --> 00:52:08,200
and help restore your infrastructure.

852
00:52:08,306 --> 00:52:10,536
Infrastructure? Okay!

853
00:52:10,642 --> 00:52:13,008
First place you can start is this well.

854
00:52:13,111 --> 00:52:14,738
It's been dry for years.

855
00:52:14,846 --> 00:52:17,940
We're forced to carry water from the river.

856
00:52:18,049 --> 00:52:19,607
Yeah. No problem.

857
00:52:19,717 --> 00:52:21,982
Thank you for your generosity.

858
00:52:23,088 --> 00:52:24,715
My pleasure, ma'am.

859
00:52:24,823 --> 00:52:27,348
Here's the problem with the well.

860
00:52:28,894 --> 00:52:30,122
It's dry.

861
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:57,747
That's right, boys! Can't hate number 8!

862
00:53:14,175 --> 00:53:15,609
They love it!

863
00:53:29,758 --> 00:53:31,089
Hey, where'd you get all those extra nails?

864
00:53:31,193 --> 00:53:33,856
I just pulled them out of that old shed.

865
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:39,094
Everett!

866
00:53:51,482 --> 00:53:53,450
You know, we're doing a lot of good.

867
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:55,609
They could really use
these medical supplies.

868
00:53:55,719 --> 00:53:57,152
Copy that.

869
00:54:00,357 --> 00:54:03,326
Oh, man. Guys, you gotta see this.

870
00:54:08,866 --> 00:54:10,801
What do you think happened?

871
00:54:10,902 --> 00:54:12,335
I don't know.

872
00:54:12,871 --> 00:54:14,896
Maybe some wild critters dug him up.

873
00:54:15,006 --> 00:54:17,497
I think it's a more logical explanation.

874
00:54:18,643 --> 00:54:19,940
The Chupacabra.

875
00:54:20,111 --> 00:54:21,874
-What?
-The Chupacabra.

876
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:23,845
It's a mythical hairless dog-like creature

877
00:54:24,015 --> 00:54:26,347
that sucks the blood out
of both man and beast.

878
00:54:26,451 --> 00:54:29,012
It's been terrorizing these parts for years.

879
00:54:29,121 --> 00:54:30,349
Either that, or it's grave robbers.

880
00:54:30,456 --> 00:54:33,687
I mean, you can get top dollar
for a testicle on eBay these days.

881
00:54:35,628 --> 00:54:38,358
Poor bastard. Couldn't even rest in peace.

882
00:54:55,849 --> 00:54:58,340
I am gonna kill you deviant bastards!

883
00:55:22,745 --> 00:55:25,270
What are you doing, Señor Bill?

884
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:29,783
Trying to get this dang radio working.
I need to talk to my superior.

885
00:55:29,885 --> 00:55:32,752
Well, why don't you just use a telephone?

886
00:55:33,388 --> 00:55:34,946
You got a phone?

887
00:55:35,057 --> 00:55:39,050
Well, not here in town,
but I can show you where.

888
00:55:42,098 --> 00:55:43,998
Now, we need to keep this
between you and l.

889
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:47,194
See, it's a covert op, and we don't want
General Larry interfering.

890
00:55:47,303 --> 00:55:50,704
Why wouldn't you want him to know?
I thought you had to call your superior.

891
00:55:50,807 --> 00:55:53,002
I do. My wife.

892
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:54,943
Oh, si, Señor Bill.

893
00:55:55,578 --> 00:55:57,170
It will be our secret.

894
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,680
Good. Now, where the hell is this phone?

895
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:04,951
Shut up in there! Hello?

896
00:56:05,055 --> 00:56:06,716
Hey, sweetie! It's me!

897
00:56:06,824 --> 00:56:09,258
Why haven't you called? Are you in Iraq?

898
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:12,056
No. No, we had a little change of plans.

899
00:56:12,163 --> 00:56:13,187
This better be good.

900
00:56:13,297 --> 00:56:15,492
Yeah, it's actually a pretty funny story.

901
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:17,090
Quiet in there! I'm talking to your dad!

902
00:56:17,202 --> 00:56:18,760
We're in Mexico.

903
00:56:19,037 --> 00:56:21,198
Mexico? You better get
your ass right back here...

904
00:56:21,306 --> 00:56:23,297
-Señor Bill?
-Hang on a second.

905
00:56:23,408 --> 00:56:24,841
A two-way whore in a rowdy...

906
00:56:24,943 --> 00:56:27,673
No, no, no, no.
Now, you hold on a second, honey.

907
00:56:27,779 --> 00:56:30,714
It's not like that at all.
I'm not on vacation down here.

908
00:56:30,816 --> 00:56:33,080
Damn right you're not on vacation.
What are you doing down there?

909
00:56:33,185 --> 00:56:34,483
I'm working!

910
00:56:34,587 --> 00:56:37,317
Hey, this is part
of a government sanctioned incursion

911
00:56:37,423 --> 00:56:40,051
into a sovereign nation
as part of Operation Sombrero.

912
00:56:40,159 --> 00:56:41,183
You're a part of a government operation?

913
00:56:41,294 --> 00:56:43,888
Yeah. Yeah, so, tell the boys,
their daddy is a hero.

914
00:56:43,996 --> 00:56:45,623
Señor Bill?

915
00:56:45,731 --> 00:56:46,789
Hang on a second!

916
00:56:46,899 --> 00:56:48,093
Are you coming home or not?

917
00:56:48,201 --> 00:56:50,795
No. I don't know when I'm gonna be home.

918
00:56:50,903 --> 00:56:52,462
Well, I don't know. Hell.

919
00:56:52,573 --> 00:56:54,268
-Wrong!
-Hello?

920
00:56:54,374 --> 00:56:55,705
Connie?

921
00:56:55,809 --> 00:56:56,867
Hello.

922
00:56:58,078 --> 00:57:01,138
-Hey, what is...
-Oh, I'm sorry, señor.

923
00:57:01,248 --> 00:57:03,011
Did I cut you off?

924
00:57:10,892 --> 00:57:12,086
Shit.

925
00:57:12,193 --> 00:57:13,660
Okay, gringo,

926
00:57:13,761 --> 00:57:16,229
how many more men you
got back in La Miranda?

927
00:57:16,331 --> 00:57:19,823
All I gotta tell you
is my name, rank, and favorite cereal.

928
00:57:19,934 --> 00:57:22,300
And that's all you're getting.

929
00:57:24,505 --> 00:57:26,803
I think Ruben likes you.

930
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:31,709
It just seems odd that a man of your stature

931
00:57:31,814 --> 00:57:34,977
would embrace alternative lifestyles
amongst his men.

932
00:57:35,084 --> 00:57:37,575
You can't fire someone
because they're gay!

933
00:57:37,686 --> 00:57:39,654
That's discrimination!

934
00:57:39,755 --> 00:57:41,382
You can get sued for that, eh?

935
00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:43,617
Besides, he's my nephew.

936
00:57:43,726 --> 00:57:45,990
You can't choose your familia.

937
00:57:46,596 --> 00:57:49,565
So, he's here, he's queer. Get used to it.

938
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:52,760
I'm still not telling you anything.

939
00:57:52,869 --> 00:57:56,236
Start talking or I'll tell Ruben
he can marry you.

940
00:57:56,339 --> 00:57:57,897
He wants a wife.

941
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:01,700
Well, there's just three of us.

942
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:04,075
We don't have an idea what we're doing.
We thought this was lraq.

943
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:05,341
Can you believe that? Iraq.

944
00:58:05,449 --> 00:58:07,974
Who would make that stupid mistake?

945
00:58:08,786 --> 00:58:10,981
You and you men
have really done some good here.

946
00:58:11,122 --> 00:58:14,421
Oh, well, just goes to show you
what a little hard work

947
00:58:14,525 --> 00:58:16,254
and ingenuity can do.

948
00:58:16,494 --> 00:58:18,621
You must have learned
so much in the Army.

949
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:22,591
Oh, shoot, yeah.
We're all highly-trained individuals.

950
00:58:22,868 --> 00:58:26,565
Hey, Larry! Help me out with this thing!

951
00:58:26,672 --> 00:58:28,606
Well, most of us, anyway.

952
00:58:28,707 --> 00:58:31,505
-I better handle this. I'll see you later.
-Okay.

953
00:58:40,686 --> 00:58:42,587
I think I got it now.

954
00:58:47,894 --> 00:58:49,862
Look out, you idiot! Not at the village!

955
00:58:49,963 --> 00:58:52,158
-Oh, yeah.
-Turn it!

956
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:55,931
Stand back!

957
00:58:58,571 --> 00:59:01,302
Damn it! That's been happening all day!

958
00:59:01,408 --> 00:59:03,103
I don't get it.

959
00:59:04,845 --> 00:59:07,905
I'm gonna get this thing working
if it kills me.

960
00:59:10,517 --> 00:59:14,044
-Damn it. Come on, Everett!
-I'm right behind you, buddy!

961
00:59:15,055 --> 00:59:16,249
Damn!

962
00:59:25,233 --> 00:59:26,996
People of La Miranda,

963
00:59:27,602 --> 00:59:31,333
you have disobeyed your Jefe
by not paying my tribute.

964
00:59:31,439 --> 00:59:34,340
Now, come out and take your punishment!

965
00:59:34,909 --> 00:59:36,775
Hold it right there!

966
00:59:36,879 --> 00:59:39,939
You're in a lot of trouble, gringo!
This is not lraq!

967
00:59:40,049 --> 00:59:41,380
I am the law here!

968
00:59:41,484 --> 00:59:43,577
I am Carlos Santana!

969
00:59:45,321 --> 00:59:46,652
The singer?

970
00:59:46,756 --> 00:59:49,122
Definitely not the singer.

971
00:59:51,027 --> 00:59:53,553
We caught your friend here
trying to call his wife.

972
00:59:53,663 --> 00:59:54,994
What?

973
00:59:55,098 --> 00:59:57,566
You found a phone,
and the one person you call is your wife?

974
00:59:57,667 --> 00:59:59,692
She gets moody if I don't check in.

975
00:59:59,803 --> 01:00:01,862
She sounds like a real bitch, señor.

976
01:00:01,972 --> 01:00:04,338
You have to set some boundaries.

977
01:00:06,343 --> 01:00:07,401
All right, turn him loose!

978
01:00:07,511 --> 01:00:10,241
Turn him loose?
We have you outnumbered.

979
01:00:10,347 --> 01:00:14,045
What are you gonna do,
kill us all by yourself?

980
01:00:15,186 --> 01:00:16,244
Nope.

981
01:00:18,256 --> 01:00:20,554
I'm just gonna kill you.

982
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:23,482
Oh.

983
01:00:24,062 --> 01:00:25,859
I hadn't thought of that.

984
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:30,165
Well, looks like we got ourselves
a Mexican standoff.

985
01:00:31,837 --> 01:00:35,000
Actually, señor,
down here, we just call it a standoff.

986
01:00:35,107 --> 01:00:36,335
Yeah, okay.

987
01:00:36,942 --> 01:00:38,466
Tell your people to stand back.

988
01:00:38,577 --> 01:00:39,669
This is my town!

989
01:00:39,778 --> 01:00:42,042
You don't give the orders here, I do!

990
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:47,777
In just a few minutes,
the entire 101st Airborne

991
01:00:47,887 --> 01:00:49,354
is gonna come down that road.

992
01:00:50,023 --> 01:00:51,251
They are?

993
01:00:51,891 --> 01:00:53,882
Just go with me on this.

994
01:00:54,761 --> 01:00:56,956
Señor, I think you're bluffing!

995
01:01:09,343 --> 01:01:11,573
Iraq, it's a land of miracles.

996
01:01:12,413 --> 01:01:13,573
Sarge? You're alive?

997
01:01:13,681 --> 01:01:15,581
Shut up, numb nuts.

998
01:01:17,618 --> 01:01:19,950
Surprised to see me, maggots?

999
01:01:20,221 --> 01:01:23,088
Can we sort this out later, Sarge?

1000
01:01:23,357 --> 01:01:27,055
-Little bit of a situation on our hands.
-You bet your ass we got a situation.

1001
01:01:27,162 --> 01:01:29,426
You assholes are A-W-O-L!

1002
01:01:31,766 --> 01:01:32,824
What?

1003
01:01:32,934 --> 01:01:36,495
I was just telling these armed men,
the rest of our highly-trained

1004
01:01:36,605 --> 01:01:40,439
firepower-out-the-ass 101st Airborne
was coming up right behind you.

1005
01:01:40,542 --> 01:01:42,009
Are you nuts?

1006
01:01:42,678 --> 01:01:43,906
We're not even in lraq.

1007
01:01:44,213 --> 01:01:46,511
There's no one here! We're alone.

1008
01:01:46,616 --> 01:01:48,516
Now give me that weapon.

1009
01:01:50,553 --> 01:01:52,180
This shit-hole of a country is Mexico.

1010
01:01:52,288 --> 01:01:53,277
Hey!

1011
01:01:53,389 --> 01:01:56,790
You're not exactly a box of chocolates,
eh, sweetheart?

1012
01:01:56,893 --> 01:01:58,622
Mind your own business, Pedro.

1013
01:01:58,728 --> 01:02:02,062
Actually, señor, this is my business.

1014
01:02:05,936 --> 01:02:07,164
Oh, shit.

1015
01:02:15,279 --> 01:02:17,213
Put your hands in the air now!

1016
01:02:17,314 --> 01:02:18,805
You have the right to remain silent!

1017
01:02:18,917 --> 01:02:20,214
You have the right to an attorney!

1018
01:02:20,318 --> 01:02:21,945
What the hell is that?

1019
01:02:22,053 --> 01:02:26,012
This is a Mark 153 shoulder-launch
multipurpose assault weapon.

1020
01:02:28,059 --> 01:02:30,118
Who wants to ride the pain train?

1021
01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:36,893
Well, boys, looks like we got ourselves
a Mexican standoff.

1022
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:42,232
Hey, Sarge. You still got your testicles?

1023
01:02:42,341 --> 01:02:44,070
Everett? Everett, hand that thing over.

1024
01:02:44,176 --> 01:02:45,143
-No, I can do it.
-Hand it over.

1025
01:02:45,244 --> 01:02:46,233
I'm a trained law enforcement officer.

1026
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:47,369
You're gonna hurt somebody.

1027
01:02:47,479 --> 01:02:48,639
Watch and learn!

1028
01:02:48,747 --> 01:02:50,112
Everett, no!

1029
01:02:54,587 --> 01:02:55,816
Incoming!

1030
01:03:27,355 --> 01:03:28,686
Hell, yeah!

1031
01:03:42,104 --> 01:03:44,265
That's what I'm talking about!

1032
01:03:50,179 --> 01:03:54,741
Not only have you saved us again,
but you've given us the miracle of water.

1033
01:03:56,152 --> 01:03:58,746
-Nice shooting, Everett.
-I know.

1034
01:03:58,855 --> 01:04:02,951
You know what they say?
The Army, toughest job you'll ever love.

1035
01:04:03,126 --> 01:04:05,356
No, that's the Peace Corps.

1036
01:04:06,562 --> 01:04:07,825
Hey!

1037
01:04:07,931 --> 01:04:08,693
Where's Sarge?

1038
01:04:09,266 --> 01:04:10,665
God damn it, Everett!

1039
01:04:10,768 --> 01:04:13,430
I'm gonna tear off your head
and shit down your...

1040
01:04:13,537 --> 01:04:16,370
Say hello to my nephew Ruben.

1041
01:04:20,544 --> 01:04:21,602
Shit.

1042
01:04:24,548 --> 01:04:27,416
Do you really think this is a good idea?

1043
01:04:27,519 --> 01:04:29,680
I mean, we've already buried Sarge once,

1044
01:04:30,021 --> 01:04:33,320
and I don't know
if I can go through this again,

1045
01:04:33,458 --> 01:04:35,187
emotionally speaking.

1046
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:38,819
Look, he may be an asshole,
but he's our asshole.

1047
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:43,333
Everett, what are you doing?

1048
01:04:43,669 --> 01:04:47,196
I'm changing the terror level
from orange to red piñata.

1049
01:04:47,306 --> 01:04:48,933
Everett, get down!

1050
01:04:51,177 --> 01:04:54,772
Are you sure you must do this?
This is not your fight.

1051
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:58,338
Look, once they messed with Sarge,
it became our fight.

1052
01:05:06,026 --> 01:05:07,653
Bin Laden, here we come!

1053
01:05:07,761 --> 01:05:10,059
Shut up, Everett.

1054
01:05:13,467 --> 01:05:14,593
Lock up the prisoner!

1055
01:05:14,701 --> 01:05:16,066
Jefe, are we going
to burn down La Miranda?

1056
01:05:17,671 --> 01:05:19,867
Tonight it's wrestling!

1057
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:23,568
Yeah!

1058
01:05:24,779 --> 01:05:26,076
El Javalina!

1059
01:05:27,782 --> 01:05:29,477
Who's he fighting, Jefe?

1060
01:05:29,584 --> 01:05:31,575
You and Hector.

1061
01:05:31,686 --> 01:05:33,347
But, Jefe...

1062
01:05:34,522 --> 01:05:36,251
I would love to.

1063
01:05:41,663 --> 01:05:43,824
All right. Does everybody know the plan?

1064
01:05:43,932 --> 01:05:44,990
Yeah.

1065
01:05:45,467 --> 01:05:46,593
Affirmative.

1066
01:05:46,702 --> 01:05:48,897
Crack skulls and kick ass!

1067
01:05:53,542 --> 01:05:57,001
Well, we may never see him again.

1068
01:05:57,113 --> 01:06:00,014
I'm gonna miss that little mongoloid.

1069
01:06:00,116 --> 01:06:03,643
You disable the vehicles.
I'm gonna get Sarge.

1070
01:06:07,490 --> 01:06:09,424
Boy, am I glad to see a friendly face.

1071
01:06:11,127 --> 01:06:14,529
I have had the darnedest time
ever since I left the interstate.

1072
01:06:14,632 --> 01:06:17,931
I think we took a wrong
turn at buenas noches.

1073
01:06:19,136 --> 01:06:20,660
What you have to do is...

1074
01:06:20,771 --> 01:06:23,433
That's what I need to do right there.

1075
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:44,026
I'm getting too fat for this shit.

1076
01:07:09,256 --> 01:07:10,985
Electric shock, huh?

1077
01:07:11,592 --> 01:07:13,560
Well, in the Mekong Delta,

1078
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:17,289
the Vietcong stuck bamboo shoots
under my fingernails.

1079
01:07:17,431 --> 01:07:20,332
It'll take a lot more than that to break me.

1080
01:07:21,268 --> 01:07:23,031
What the hell is this?

1081
01:07:29,043 --> 01:07:30,408
It's a duet!

1082
01:08:02,311 --> 01:08:04,246
Hey, hey, hey!

1083
01:08:34,111 --> 01:08:37,239
Who else is man enough
to step into the ring?

1084
01:08:37,481 --> 01:08:39,245
Right here, amigo!

1085
01:08:39,484 --> 01:08:40,974
Who is this maricón?

1086
01:08:41,086 --> 01:08:42,485
I don't know,

1087
01:08:42,754 --> 01:08:44,244
but I like him.

1088
01:08:53,832 --> 01:08:55,459
He's got style!

1089
01:08:56,134 --> 01:09:00,162
Muchachos, a masked challenger
is gonna take on El Javalina.

1090
01:09:08,014 --> 01:09:10,744
Hold on, Sarge. I'm coming.

1091
01:09:15,856 --> 01:09:18,552
Come on, Tijuana! You want some?

1092
01:09:18,659 --> 01:09:20,092
You gonna get some!

1093
01:09:20,194 --> 01:09:22,253
Hey, don't you worry about anything, man.
I'm a pro.

1094
01:09:22,363 --> 01:09:23,523
I'm a card-carrying member

1095
01:09:23,631 --> 01:09:26,122
of the Georgia
lndependent Wrestling Alliance.

1096
01:09:26,233 --> 01:09:28,793
Just take a lookout for my trick knee.

1097
01:09:51,292 --> 01:09:53,784
Man, look at the size of that son of a bitch.

1098
01:09:53,896 --> 01:09:56,694
-He'd have ripped you a...
-Get me loose!

1099
01:09:59,402 --> 01:10:00,869
I hate Sonny and Cher.

1100
01:10:00,970 --> 01:10:03,200
Hey, Bill's down by the gate.
I'm gonna go get Everett.

1101
01:10:03,439 --> 01:10:04,428
Okay.

1102
01:10:09,545 --> 01:10:10,979
What are you doing?

1103
01:10:11,081 --> 01:10:12,412
Hey, Sarge.

1104
01:10:13,116 --> 01:10:16,813
You're wearing the enemy's uniform.
I should have known you'd be a traitor.

1105
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:18,444
No, I'm undercover.

1106
01:10:19,056 --> 01:10:22,048
I'm wrecking the vehicles. Here's the plan.

1107
01:10:22,292 --> 01:10:24,783
I'm putting sugar in their gas tanks.

1108
01:10:26,697 --> 01:10:28,529
I got a better idea.

1109
01:10:29,167 --> 01:10:30,259
Okay.

1110
01:10:53,325 --> 01:10:54,314
Oh!

1111
01:10:54,493 --> 01:10:57,519
I see we're playing
by Panamanian prison rules.

1112
01:11:05,772 --> 01:11:08,707
Yeah, take some of this, amigo!

1113
01:11:22,656 --> 01:11:25,591
You just bought yourself
a six pack of pain, buddy!

1114
01:11:25,726 --> 01:11:27,591
Come get some!

1115
01:11:34,368 --> 01:11:37,064
I'm the king! I'm the king!

1116
01:11:46,281 --> 01:11:49,546
Get set for the full force of the U.S. Military!

1117
01:11:49,651 --> 01:11:51,414
Get them, guys!

1118
01:11:53,755 --> 01:11:54,813
Guys?

1119
01:11:55,090 --> 01:11:56,421
I know you!

1120
01:11:56,591 --> 01:11:59,459
You're that retarded guy with the bazooka!

1121
01:11:59,562 --> 01:12:00,961
It was a rocket-launcher.

1122
01:12:01,063 --> 01:12:02,655
Kill this cabrón!

1123
01:12:05,067 --> 01:12:06,694
Hold it right there!

1124
01:12:06,803 --> 01:12:09,067
You gotta be kidding me!

1125
01:12:09,372 --> 01:12:12,205
You gringos are like
a bad case of the crabs.

1126
01:12:12,308 --> 01:12:13,673
I can't get rid of you!

1127
01:12:13,776 --> 01:12:15,767
Everett, get over here.

1128
01:12:18,115 --> 01:12:22,609
You, señor, are either very brave
or very stupid.

1129
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:25,210
Either way, you can't kill all of us.

1130
01:12:25,823 --> 01:12:27,256
Probably not.

1131
01:12:28,091 --> 01:12:30,184
I'll just kill you.

1132
01:12:30,427 --> 01:12:32,918
Damn! I keep doing that.

1133
01:12:33,030 --> 01:12:34,896
Good job, Larry.

1134
01:12:34,999 --> 01:12:37,092
I'm out of here. You disarm them,

1135
01:12:37,202 --> 01:12:38,897
and I'll meet you back
at Checkpoint Charlie.

1136
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,205
All right, come on! Let's get out of here!

1137
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,020
Let's go! Shotgun!

1138
01:12:57,122 --> 01:12:58,953
Damn you, Everett!

1139
01:13:09,768 --> 01:13:11,464
They're over there!

1140
01:13:16,643 --> 01:13:19,134
Look at our cars, Jefe.

1141
01:13:19,246 --> 01:13:21,146
Who would do such a thing?

1142
01:13:21,281 --> 01:13:22,976
That's vandalism!

1143
01:13:23,083 --> 01:13:25,415
Saddle up the horses
and bring out Big Bertha!

1144
01:13:25,619 --> 01:13:27,519
Come on! Move, move, move!

1145
01:13:27,621 --> 01:13:28,747
Come on! Let's go!

1146
01:13:28,855 --> 01:13:30,016
Go! Go!

1147
01:13:30,124 --> 01:13:32,718
This is the end of La Miranda.

1148
01:13:42,670 --> 01:13:43,762
You made it back.

1149
01:13:43,871 --> 01:13:45,771
I'm so glad. I was very worried.

1150
01:13:45,873 --> 01:13:48,604
There's still a certain señorita
I gotta take out on the town.

1151
01:13:48,710 --> 01:13:51,406
Or make sweet, sweet love to her
under the stars

1152
01:13:51,513 --> 01:13:56,473
as a mariachi bands serenades you
with a song of romance and desire.

1153
01:13:56,585 --> 01:13:59,349
You saved our village
by killing Carlos Santana.

1154
01:13:59,454 --> 01:14:01,615
Well, not quite.

1155
01:14:01,723 --> 01:14:03,623
Son, make it quick. We gotta get going.

1156
01:14:03,725 --> 01:14:06,217
What? We can't leave.

1157
01:14:06,663 --> 01:14:08,995
Santana might be
on his way down here right now,

1158
01:14:09,098 --> 01:14:10,963
and this village is defenseless.

1159
01:14:11,067 --> 01:14:15,333
Son, you showed me something
by coming to save me, you really did.

1160
01:14:15,505 --> 01:14:18,167
But this is out of my hands.
We have to leave.

1161
01:14:18,841 --> 01:14:20,832
-Bill?
-This isn't lraq.

1162
01:14:20,944 --> 01:14:22,411
It's Mexico.

1163
01:14:22,512 --> 01:14:25,346
We did what we could do,
but this isn't our fight.

1164
01:14:25,449 --> 01:14:26,746
Sorry, son.

1165
01:14:27,351 --> 01:14:28,318
I'm not leaving.

1166
01:14:28,419 --> 01:14:29,511
Oh, Larry, come on!

1167
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:31,986
Private, I'm giving you an order.

1168
01:14:32,456 --> 01:14:35,425
I think you guys forgot what our orders are.

1169
01:14:35,526 --> 01:14:37,323
We're supposed to bring
freedom and democracy

1170
01:14:37,428 --> 01:14:39,293
to people that need it.

1171
01:14:39,763 --> 01:14:42,289
I think these people need it.

1172
01:14:43,001 --> 01:14:44,366
I'm staying.

1173
01:14:44,903 --> 01:14:48,669
I'm staying to finish the job.
I'm staying to do what's right.

1174
01:14:53,345 --> 01:14:57,372
Anybody that's with me can cross this line.

1175
01:14:58,883 --> 01:15:00,943
Oh, come on, guys!

1176
01:15:02,021 --> 01:15:06,287
Sarge, look at these people.
They're honest, hardworking.

1177
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:09,960
They got hopes, dreams.

1178
01:15:10,963 --> 01:15:13,158
Ain't you ever had a dream?

1179
01:15:13,265 --> 01:15:14,493
Shit.

1180
01:15:15,301 --> 01:15:16,893
Hell, you got me.

1181
01:15:19,506 --> 01:15:22,407
I always wanted to be
an aerobics instructor.

1182
01:15:22,843 --> 01:15:23,832
Okay.

1183
01:15:27,547 --> 01:15:30,914
Don't look at me, man.
I got a wife and kids to think about.

1184
01:15:31,018 --> 01:15:34,454
And what would you do if Connie
and the boys lived in a town like this?

1185
01:15:34,554 --> 01:15:36,523
Would you leave them then?

1186
01:15:38,259 --> 01:15:39,248
No.

1187
01:15:40,228 --> 01:15:41,422
Damn it.

1188
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:44,528
All right.

1189
01:15:44,899 --> 01:15:48,699
Like they say in the Army,
be all you can be.

1190
01:15:49,604 --> 01:15:51,401
You got it right!

1191
01:15:53,608 --> 01:15:55,702
Who am I kidding?
I live in a storage locker.

1192
01:15:55,811 --> 01:15:57,574
I'm not going anywhere.

1193
01:15:57,679 --> 01:16:01,115
All right, then.
We got all day to figure out a plan.

1194
01:16:01,216 --> 01:16:03,582
Come on, we're the Sleeping Marmots!

1195
01:16:03,685 --> 01:16:05,949
What else can Santana do to us?

1196
01:16:06,755 --> 01:16:10,122
Señor! Señor!
I think you better take a look at this.

1197
01:16:24,107 --> 01:16:25,665
A tank?

1198
01:16:25,775 --> 01:16:26,969
Where'd they get that?

1199
01:16:28,478 --> 01:16:31,175
That's a Sherman tank, U.S. Army surplus!

1200
01:16:31,749 --> 01:16:35,412
Back in the '80s, the Mexicans traded
15,000 cases of Chiclets for them.

1201
01:16:35,519 --> 01:16:37,043
You're kidding!

1202
01:16:37,288 --> 01:16:38,516
Incoming!

1203
01:16:41,559 --> 01:16:42,617
Down!

1204
01:16:51,336 --> 01:16:52,303
Get everybody in the church!

1205
01:16:52,404 --> 01:16:54,235
-But what about...
-Now!

1206
01:17:03,248 --> 01:17:04,510
We gotta take that tank out.

1207
01:17:04,616 --> 01:17:05,913
Get the rocket-launcher!

1208
01:17:06,017 --> 01:17:08,680
I got it, Sarge! It's in the bunkhouse!

1209
01:17:09,088 --> 01:17:10,555
Cover him.

1210
01:17:21,767 --> 01:17:24,065
If I die, Connie's gonna kill me!

1211
01:17:24,170 --> 01:17:26,105
We gotta take that tank out!

1212
01:17:26,206 --> 01:17:29,232
Don't we have anything
in this town we can use?

1213
01:17:30,544 --> 01:17:32,136
Cover me!

1214
01:17:33,247 --> 01:17:34,339
Cover me!

1215
01:17:34,448 --> 01:17:36,848
You heard the man! Cover him!

1216
01:17:39,486 --> 01:17:41,044
I said cover me!

1217
01:17:43,424 --> 01:17:45,016
Bitch!

1218
01:18:06,248 --> 01:18:07,442
Come on!

1219
01:18:09,318 --> 01:18:10,546
Come on!

1220
01:18:12,154 --> 01:18:14,384
Damn it! Come on!

1221
01:18:22,432 --> 01:18:24,992
Shit. That'll work.

1222
01:18:35,378 --> 01:18:39,475
It is time for us to stand up to Santana
once and for all!

1223
01:18:47,758 --> 01:18:49,623
Come on! Let's get them!

1224
01:18:50,061 --> 01:18:52,052
Remember the Alamo!

1225
01:18:52,163 --> 01:18:54,563
That is a sore subject around here, señor.

1226
01:19:18,024 --> 01:19:20,219
We did it. We ran them off!

1227
01:19:20,693 --> 01:19:24,527
-Where's Maria?
-Oh, General, Santana has taken her.

1228
01:19:26,432 --> 01:19:28,662
You have any more daughters?

1229
01:19:29,335 --> 01:19:30,495
Lupita.

1230
01:19:31,972 --> 01:19:33,667
I'll go find Maria.

1231
01:19:35,009 --> 01:19:36,499
Stupid gringos.

1232
01:19:36,877 --> 01:19:38,504
They may have won this battle,

1233
01:19:38,612 --> 01:19:42,070
but as usual,
Carlos Santana will win the war.

1234
01:19:42,182 --> 01:19:43,513
Far enough!

1235
01:19:43,984 --> 01:19:45,474
Now let her go!

1236
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:49,081
What do you see in this fat redneck?

1237
01:19:49,189 --> 01:19:51,158
Fat redneck?

1238
01:19:51,259 --> 01:19:54,422
I swear, on Monday,
I'm starting a low-carb diet.

1239
01:19:55,664 --> 01:19:58,428
Now I'll have to kill both of you.

1240
01:20:02,137 --> 01:20:06,938
It will take more than one helicopter
to defeat Carlos Santana!

1241
01:20:09,645 --> 01:20:11,408
This is not good.

1242
01:20:42,279 --> 01:20:43,246
Thank you.

1243
01:20:44,716 --> 01:20:46,877
Papa! Oh, thank God!

1244
01:20:47,251 --> 01:20:49,116
Look forward and come this way, please!

1245
01:20:49,287 --> 01:20:50,481
Hey, everybody okay?

1246
01:20:50,655 --> 01:20:52,122
Oh, sure. Everybody's fine.

1247
01:20:52,323 --> 01:20:53,688
Couldn't be better.

1248
01:20:53,791 --> 01:20:54,780
Bill got shot.

1249
01:20:54,892 --> 01:20:56,723
Bill got... What?

1250
01:20:59,697 --> 01:21:01,927
Bill! You all right?

1251
01:21:02,401 --> 01:21:06,030
They got me!
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

1252
01:21:06,271 --> 01:21:07,465
Larry...

1253
01:21:08,607 --> 01:21:10,768
You tell them my story.

1254
01:21:14,413 --> 01:21:17,075
He was shot in the ass. He'll be fine.

1255
01:21:18,951 --> 01:21:20,977
-Sir.
-Colonel Dalton, Delta Force.

1256
01:21:21,087 --> 01:21:23,055
Is there a Bill Little here?

1257
01:21:23,156 --> 01:21:24,316
Yeah. That's me.

1258
01:21:24,424 --> 01:21:26,255
Your wife's a real pain in the ass.

1259
01:21:26,359 --> 01:21:29,226
When she found out you were in Mexico,
she started calling the Pentagon.

1260
01:21:29,429 --> 01:21:32,125
Wouldn't stop till the Joint Chiefs
sent us down here to get you.

1261
01:21:32,232 --> 01:21:33,597
God, I love that woman.

1262
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:37,636
Yeah. You better mow the lawn
when you get home.

1263
01:21:37,737 --> 01:21:39,171
Yes, sir.

1264
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:42,541
Hey, Larry, this guy wants to talk to you.
Says he's from the State Department.

1265
01:21:42,643 --> 01:21:46,511
Roger Grabowski,
undersecretary, Central American affairs.

1266
01:21:46,614 --> 01:21:50,072
You hear that? Poor bastard's a secretary.

1267
01:21:50,684 --> 01:21:52,914
Bit of a sticky situation we've got here.

1268
01:21:53,020 --> 01:21:55,488
We're in a lot of trouble, ain't we?

1269
01:21:55,589 --> 01:21:57,888
Maybe not. That is,

1270
01:21:57,993 --> 01:22:00,018
if you guys will cooperate.

1271
01:22:01,229 --> 01:22:03,060
We're all about cooperation.

1272
01:22:03,165 --> 01:22:05,565
Another victory in the war on terror

1273
01:22:05,667 --> 01:22:07,965
as the White House today
announced the success

1274
01:22:08,069 --> 01:22:09,866
of Operation Sombrero

1275
01:22:10,305 --> 01:22:13,468
with strikes against terror camps
located in northern Mexico

1276
01:22:13,575 --> 01:22:18,036
by U.S. personnel operating with
permission from the Mexican government.

1277
01:22:18,147 --> 01:22:21,776
In a shocking development,
among those captured in the attack

1278
01:22:21,884 --> 01:22:25,047
was Grammy-winning musician,
Carlos Santana,

1279
01:22:25,154 --> 01:22:27,645
known for such hits
as Black Magic Woman,

1280
01:22:27,757 --> 01:22:30,385
Evil Ways, and Oye Como Va.

1281
01:22:32,228 --> 01:22:36,962
Once more, America is in need
of its best and brightest.

1282
01:22:37,334 --> 01:22:42,465
One wonders if there are still heroes
willing to lead us

1283
01:22:42,573 --> 01:22:45,406
through the challenges we face as a nation.

1284
01:22:45,509 --> 01:22:47,443
I say the answer is yes.

1285
01:22:48,812 --> 01:22:51,941
And I am proud to be standing
here with them today

1286
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:53,779
as we honor their sacrifice.

1287
01:22:53,885 --> 01:22:55,182
Ten hut!

1288
01:23:07,732 --> 01:23:09,166
What's my name?

1289
01:23:09,268 --> 01:23:11,065
Sergeant Kilgore, sir!

1290
01:23:11,470 --> 01:23:14,166
You will be a mean, lean fighting machine.

1291
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:16,237
One, two, three!

1292
01:23:16,342 --> 01:23:17,775
Move it, fat buddy!

1293
01:23:17,877 --> 01:23:19,742
Oh, yeah! That's the way I like it!

1294
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:34,588
Get some!

1295
01:23:57,118 --> 01:23:58,244
Hey!

1296
01:23:58,619 --> 01:24:00,177
Stop it! Stop it!

1297
01:24:00,488 --> 01:24:04,289
I'm a government employee!
You can't do this!

1298
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:06,188
Here you go, honey.

1299
01:24:14,202 --> 01:24:17,171
Oh, I wish I had a thousand of them
just like you, son.

1300
01:24:17,973 --> 01:24:20,737
Any chance I can convince you
to come back to Washington?

1301
01:24:23,146 --> 01:24:25,546
Actually, General, I got other plans.

1302
01:24:51,241 --> 01:24:54,210
Mr. Chile, would you like to sing a song?

1303
01:24:54,311 --> 01:24:55,335
Yes!

1304
01:24:56,747 --> 01:25:00,149
Why don't you sing something
by Carlos Santana?

1305
01:25:00,418 --> 01:25:01,976
Okay.

1306
01:25:26,512 --> 01:25:29,003
-You sing very good.
-Thank you.

1307
01:25:29,615 --> 01:25:32,175
-What did you think of the last guy?
-I did not like the last guy.

1308
01:25:32,284 --> 01:25:33,376
-No?
-No.

1309
01:25:33,486 --> 01:25:35,045
He was squeezing my stick.

1310
01:25:35,155 --> 01:25:37,316
All right, you're gonna love this. Pull!

1311
01:25:37,424 --> 01:25:39,016
Lace thong.

1312
01:25:40,494 --> 01:25:42,826
Wait a second. Those are mine!

1313
01:25:42,929 --> 01:25:44,556
When you address me, you will address me

1314
01:25:44,665 --> 01:25:47,099
as Sergeant... What is my name? Kilgore!

1315
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:50,067
How you doing, Gl Joe. Can I help you?

1316
01:25:50,370 --> 01:25:51,860
What is my name?

1317
01:25:56,511 --> 01:25:58,706
My last movie was nominated
for two Academy Awards.

1318
01:25:58,813 --> 01:26:00,747
I would like to say that.

1319
01:26:16,098 --> 01:26:20,125
Man, who'd have thought
a woman that fat could move so quick?

1320
01:26:20,335 --> 01:26:22,166
Oh, my God, y'all!

1321
01:26:26,909 --> 01:26:28,137
Sergeant!

1322
01:26:28,243 --> 01:26:30,007
People of La Mirada...

1323
01:26:31,781 --> 01:26:33,715
People of La Miranda!

1324
01:26:33,950 --> 01:26:35,247
Tonight.

1325
01:26:35,418 --> 01:26:37,147
The end of La Mirada!

1326
01:26:37,420 --> 01:26:38,853
Shit!

1327
01:26:49,133 --> 01:26:50,464
Git-r-done!

1328
01:26:59,777 --> 01:27:02,871
Oye como va, bitches. I'm out.
