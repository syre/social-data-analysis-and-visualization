1
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,953
Hotel Sudamerica.

2
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,862
So how have you been?
Do you stiII, uh...

3
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:38,323
Shh! My wife would kill me.

4
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,658
l switched to birds.

5
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,952
- Birds?
- Birds.

6
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,954
Exotic-- import-export.

7
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,331
- l got my own plane.
- Mmm?

8
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,208
How about you?
StiII writing?

9
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,669
Si. l'm down here
doing a story on the rainforest.

10
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:54,840
Huh. Poor Santos,
he was in the middle of that shit.

11
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,929
They would stop at nothing.

12
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,931
They had the government
in their pocket.

13
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,933
All they wanted was land--

14
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:08,937
our land, our rainforest.

15
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,652
But Santos,
he could not stand for it.

16
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,905
He organized the people.

17
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,878
Oh no. Not again.

18
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,599
For the last time, Santos,
get the hell out.

19
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:04,243
RafaeI Santos--
leader of the rubber tappers,

20
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,912
staged a passive
resistance in Padre

21
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,122
against the cattle ranch company.

22
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,417
Santos-- a symbol today
for environmentaIists

23
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,628
and ecology groups
all over the world--

24
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,838
has been the target
of death threats.

25
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,674
Santos vehemently states,

26
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:21,760
"We will not allow this deliberate
destruction to continue."

27
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,436
Buenas noches.

28
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,315
Papi!

29
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,196
Papi!  Papi!

30
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,824
Mami, mami!

31
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,161
Papi!

32
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,831
Papi,  que te pasa?

33
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,168
Papi. Ma--  mami!

34
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,836
Mami!

35
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:41,506
-  Mami!  Mami!
-  Rafael!

36
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,009
To kill a man
in front of his daughter--

37
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,219
that is the work of a coward.

38
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,515
But it is an old story

39
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,934
lndians against rubber tappers,

40
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,354
tappers against lndians
for a piece of land,

41
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,522
cattle ranchers against both,

42
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,608
and buying everything
with big money.

43
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,526
- Yeah, l remember that.

44
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,529
Do you know where
l can pick up a cheap car?

45
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,365
You can take mine.
I don't use it.

46
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,116
- You're gonna give me your car?
- Yes.

47
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,849
Santos vive!
(Santos lives!)

48
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,018
La lucha continua!
(The struggle continues!)

49
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,023
La lucha continua!

50
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,071
Santos vive!

51
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,240
La lucha continua!

52
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,631
But Rafael Santos never stopped

53
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,758
believing in non-violence.

54
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,344
Although threatened many times...

55
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,222
he and his followers held fast

56
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,100
to the principIes of passive resistance,

57
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,603
teaching us
that to stop the bloodshed

58
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,565
and wanton rape of the land,

59
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:25,777
we must think not
of the differences that separate us,

60
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:29,114
but the common interests
that bind us together--

61
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:33,160
our love of the rainforest
and all the living things in it,

62
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:38,081
and our need to improve
the impoverished state

63
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,375
of men and women
of this country.

64
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,462
Rubber tappers, lndians,

65
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,798
farmers and environmentalists

66
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,885
must all work together
to help each other

67
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:54,890
so that our dear
departed friend-- ahem--

68
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:59,561
Rafael Santos,
leader of the Rubber Tappers' Union,

69
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:04,316
good father, husband
and friend to the rainforest,

70
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,318
you may rest in peace.

71
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,813
How are you doing?
Fine.

72
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:47,692
Holding up okay?
- l guess.

73
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,736
Do you want me
to do anything?

74
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:53,281
lt's okay.
You have done a lot already.

75
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:58,578
WeII then,
you must've been very close.

76
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,622
Did you see a man?

77
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,791
No, just a policeman.

78
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,460
Policeman?

79
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,379
What policeman?

80
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,092
Just a policeman.

81
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,805
Gloria, have you eaten
anything yet?

82
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,723
Alyssa's been looking for you.

83
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,059
She's in the kitchen. Go.

84
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,854
- Ahem. Hello.
- Hello.

85
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,565
l'm very sorry about your husband.

86
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,192
- You have my condolences, ma'am.
- Thank you.

87
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,654
Do you feel that you know
who killed your husband?

88
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:38,076
l feel that anybody
who didn't stop it did it.

89
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,752
- Are you okay?
- Yes, l am okay.

90
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,588
Do you want something to eat?
Are you hungry?

91
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,423
Yes.
Yes?

92
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,389
Hello.

93
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,308
l don't think we have met.

94
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:04,477
l don't think we have.
l'm R.J. O'Brien.

95
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,523
- Alyssa Rothman.
- Pleased to meet you.

96
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,985
So are you here for a visit?

97
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,154
Yeah.
What about you?

98
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,281
- l work here.
- Yeah?

99
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,159
l'm with the Rainforest
Preservation Society.

100
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,620
Oh yeah. What do you--
what do they do?

101
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:25,624
We're a privately-endowed foundation
that supports Santos's work.

102
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,334
Oh, so you're the good guys

103
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:30,670
in this whoIe
rainforest enchilada, huh?

104
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:34,257
lt's just a little bit more than
an enchilada to me, Mr. O'Brien.

105
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,676
Oh.

106
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,720
WeII, see,
as far as l'm concerned,

107
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,806
that's the probIem--
everybody takes this thing too seriously.

108
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,225
I mean, in America
you got the politicians,

109
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,519
you got the singers
and the Hollywood actors

110
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,647
all jumping on the bandwagon
doing speeches

111
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,775
about the poor birds and the bees
in the Amazon.

112
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:55,570
You know what l mean? lt's just like--
it's like the fucking fashion, you know?

113
00:10:55,738 --> 00:11:00,158
Well, l'm not in Hollywood,
as you can see here.

114
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,035
lt's been a long time
since l've known

115
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,788
that this cause is a lot more
than just the birds and the bees, okay?

116
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,748
- Mm.
- There're people out there with rights,

117
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,792
the right to live the way--
the way that they want.

118
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,252
And Santos and l have been
working to protect that right.

119
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,006
So yes, it is very serious, Mr. O'Brien,
and it's not an enchilada,

120
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:19,010
which by the way is a Mexican dish,
not a BoIivian.

121
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:25,266
Well, as l predicted, l offered Nacia
the check and she refused it.

122
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,726
- As you predicted.
- Yeah.

123
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,937
You're much too pure
for the rest of us, Alyssa.

124
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,689
- Oh yes.
- Lucavida wanted to help

125
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,607
and she had the right to say
yes or no.

126
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,193
- l know. You know l didn't mean to--
- l know,

127
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,237
- and that's why l keep you around.
- Yes.

128
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,947
Oh, we're going to be late
for the meeting.

129
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,324
- Do you need a ride?
- Um, no. No, l have my car.

130
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,952
- Okay. Don't be late.
- I won't. Bye.

131
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:06,725
Gentlemen, l wish to thank you
for your presence here today.

132
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:10,186
And of course l would like
to thank Mr. Lucavida,

133
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,897
who's been kind enough
to lend us his lovely house

134
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:16,818
in order that we may discuss
the unfortunate circumstances

135
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,904
surrounding the death
of our dear friend.

136
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:23,241
A house built with the money
he stole from the rubber tappers.

137
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,327
We're not to blame for the old rivalries

138
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,664
between you-- the tappers--
and the lndian tribes.

139
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:33,084
The big ranchers--
you destroy everything.

140
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,961
Please.

141
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:38,089
Our situation is
only going to get worse

142
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:42,719
unless we learn to coexist within
the economic realities of this country.

143
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:47,265
Gentlemen, this is our test.

144
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,101
lf we fail, we all lose.

145
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,353
No, l don't accept
as an economic reality

146
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:56,024
a group of cattIe ranchers
destroying all our rubber trees

147
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,859
so they can export
their meat to the gringos.

148
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,613
We want to know
who killed Rafael Santos first.

149
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,117
Se metio, senor.

150
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:11,956
Buenos dias.
Buenos dias.

151
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,834
And who are you?

152
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:18,421
Well, l'm R.J. O'Brien. l, uh--

153
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:22,258
l knocked on your door, but there was
nobody there to answer. And, uh--

154
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:25,762
well, l'm down here doing an article
for an American magazine and--

155
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,306
Shall l call the police?

156
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,601
- l'm sure Mr. O'Brien...
- Yes.

157
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:36,147
...didn't realize it was my home
into which he was intruding.

158
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,317
Now wait a minute.
You're not Mr. Lucavida?

159
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,862
- Please.
- lt's a pleasure to meet you.

160
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,240
This is not a good time
for an interview.

161
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:48,493
- No.
- Perhaps l can call you.

162
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,787
Santos vive!

163
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,872
La lucha continua!

164
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:59,254
-  La lucha continua!
-  Santos vive!

165
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:09,264
Rafael Santos.
Presente.

166
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:30,493
lt seems like he was
against progress for your country.

167
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,704
I mean,
he fought against bank loans

168
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,874
for the building of roads,
for the buiIding of dams.

169
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,127
- lt's no wonder he pissed people off.
- He was not against progress.

170
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:42,046
He was against
the destruction of the rainforest,

171
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:45,300
against development that
only benefits the big companies

172
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,218
and the powerful
who expIoit us.

173
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,679
He probably pissed off
some landowners, right?

174
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,307
Rafael made a lot of enemies
in his Iifetime.

175
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:55,059
He's not the first to die
over the rainforest.

176
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,811
He won't be the last.

177
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,606
Que pasa, Aringo.  Que tienes? (What happened?)
Que tienes, Aringo?  Que pasa? (Do you have it?)

178
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,024
Hey hey,  que pasa?

179
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,319
Dios.

180
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,119
No pictures!

181
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,622
- Give me the camera!

182
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,416
Un momento.

183
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,419
l'll give you the film.

184
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,008
Lo siento.
(Sorry)

185
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,427
Aqui aqui aqui.
(Right here.)

186
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,941
Muchas gracias.

187
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,079
The guy's got a bad temper.

188
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,915
The whoIe goddamned roII
of film-- can you believe that?

189
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,334
- We have to go now.
- Oh no, amigos--

190
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,628
no no no, no no no.

191
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,672
Amigos!

192
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,466
The interview is not over yet!

193
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:14,764
That's probabIy how
you stuck by Santos!

194
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:10,695
Excuse me, do you know
where Senor Pedrosa is?

195
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,944
lf l could ask you a few questions.
Who do you think kiIIed Santos?

196
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,572
I mean, given the fact
that he was asking for it.

197
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,408
You want to be more carefuI
choosing your words, Mr. O'Brien.

198
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,577
Well, let's face it.
The guy was a pain in the ass.

199
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:03,039
- He was giving everybody trouble.
- Mmm, not unlike yourself.

200
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,124
He got the wrong people angry.

201
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,001
What wrong peopIe
are you talking about?

202
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,753
Well, that's hard to tell--

203
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,589
cattle ranchers, authorities,

204
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,841
lndians.
Who knows?

205
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,384
And what about
the timber industry?

206
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,428
You guys weren't very happy
with him either, were you?

207
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,723
The timber industry is older
than the rubber business.

208
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:23,518
Yeah, but you cut down the forest,
you destroyed the trees.

209
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:26,854
Ah, no more than you destroy
your hair when you cut it.

210
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,524
Yes, but what are you gonna do
when your resources are depleted?

211
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,651
Ah, that will only happen
if we become greedy.

212
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,544
- Quieto. Quieto. (Be calm.)
-  No!

213
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,263
- Nobody's gonna hurt you.
- Step back!

214
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,973
Put down your weapons.

215
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,397
- Nobody's gonna hurt you.

216
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,941
l'll kill him.

217
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,403
Okay. Let's go.

218
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,990
Let's go.

219
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:38,634
No pictures.

220
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,846
Hey, stop it.

221
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,681
Alto!
You're gonna kill him!

222
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,183
Alto!

223
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,856
Take them.

224
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,749
What about
the fucking phone call?!

225
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,427
Do you wanna tell me
what that was all about?

226
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:25,598
Exc-- can you hear--
excuse me, can you fucking hear me?!

227
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,142
Huh?

228
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,646
You speak English?

229
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:34,565
Habla espanol?

230
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,277
Como estas?

231
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,238
Ah, bien. Bien.

232
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,365
Fuck me.

233
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,429
What?

234
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,200
What the fuck?

235
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:44,969
What the fuck is this?

236
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:02,403
Mr. O'Brien.

237
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:10,786
What do you know
about your friend in your cell?

238
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:12,705
My friend?

239
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,582
Mm-hmm.

240
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,002
Well, he's my long-lost lndian brother.
What do you think?

241
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,339
He attempted
to escape with you.

242
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,882
No.

243
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,218
No, he took me--
he fucking took me hostage.

244
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:35,853
What was your business, my friend,
with Senor Pedrosa?

245
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,605
- Hmm?

246
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,316
Look, do you have any charges
to bring against me

247
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:44,195
or are you just jerking my chain
to justify a day's pay?

248
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,405
Don't talk to me like that, all right,

249
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:48,366
Mr. Ponytail?
Don't talk to me like that!

250
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,786
The man who was arrested
with you yesterday, my friend,

251
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:55,414
is the murderer
of Rafael Santos.

252
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:59,377
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

253
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,879
No, l'm not kidding you.

254
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:05,341
l'm just as interested
in his capture as you are.

255
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,304
Mr.--

256
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:14,683
Mr. O'Brien, that's unlikely.

257
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:17,228
You're not cooperating too much.

258
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,398
- What the fuck do you want me to say?
- You know, you're gonna be my guest.

259
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,567
Guard, take him
back to his cell. Now!

260
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:27,780
You can't fucking do this, man.
l am an American reporter working here.

261
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:31,742
CaII AIyssa Rothman
with the Rainforest Society.

262
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,203
She's a very good friend of mine.

263
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,511
Djamori?

264
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:12,575
Somebody call
the American ambassador!

265
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:16,328
l am an innocent American
being heId against my wiII.

266
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:21,083
Someone caII
the goddamn ambassador!

267
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,877
Hello?!

268
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,587
That's him.

269
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:28,632
Somebody call the ambassador!

270
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:32,136
Look, you might as weII
let him go. He's harmless.

271
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,971
Yeah.

272
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:37,141
- HeIIo!
- Sanchez.

273
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,018
- Si, Mayor.
- Take him out.

274
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,651
Alyssa!

275
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,883
Reo.

276
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:36,283
Take a seat.
Asientos, senores.

277
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:41,622
Did the suspect
know Santos personally?

278
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,375
l cannot comment
on that question.

279
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:47,127
Which tribe is he from
and did he have any accomplices?

280
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:50,130
That wiII come out
of our legal investigation.

281
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,675
Then, what-- what kind of questions
are we supposed to ask?

282
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,802
Do you think
you know why he did it?

283
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:59,640
His reasons will be brought
to Iight at his triaI,

284
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:04,979
but in the meantime we have
his fuII signed confession.

285
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,567
Bullshit.

286
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:19,326
And solid evidence,
including witnesses,

287
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:22,454
and everything--
everything to convict him.

288
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,917
What if he was framed?

289
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,588
That's all.

290
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,301
Go.

291
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,428
- Yeah.

292
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,225
Do it! Whoo! Yeah!

293
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:27,728
Yeah.

294
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,980
Si! Oh, si.

295
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,982
Whoo!

296
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:45,329
Ay, mi amor!

297
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:55,422
Thank you.

298
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,138
Djamori gets
arrested for questioning

299
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:05,933
and two days later he's dead?
l don't believe this.

300
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,018
lt's true.

301
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,187
But you know exactly
what's gonna happen if--

302
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,897
lf they don't have a trial for this,

303
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:14,692
They're just gonna conveniently
Iet everything just bIow over.

304
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,903
You're probably right, Alyssa,
but the police seem convinced.

305
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,738
- Oh, the police?
- Mmm.

306
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:22,866
Since when did you start placing
so much faith in the authorities?

307
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,285
Since l have
a great deal of work to do.

308
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:26,995
Now why don't you run along

309
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:30,124
and go find another righteously
indignant souI to rant to?

310
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:33,585
Well, because l'm not done ranting
to this righteously indignant soul.

311
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,879
- All right.

312
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,674
Sometimes we have to--
we must work together.

313
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:42,970
We have to compromise in the interest
of getting something done.

314
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,975
RafaeI Santos
did not die in vain.

315
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,588
Ahem.

316
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,592
So are you here to see someone?

317
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,344
Uh, yeah.
Actually, l'm here to see you.

318
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:26,597
l wanna thank you

319
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,808
and, um, as you can see,
l'm unarmed and l'm not dangerous.

320
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:34,438
And I just thought maybe
we could talk like good boys and girls.

321
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,647
Okay then.

322
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:37,357
Let me ask you this.

323
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:39,985
Why did you follow me
to Lucavida's house?

324
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:42,738
- l followed you?
- Yes, you did.

325
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:46,200
And l didn't like it. Father Benacio
caIIed together that meeting

326
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:49,369
and he did it to bring together
the people at odds over Santos's death

327
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:51,538
and the people concerned
about the rainforest.

328
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:54,291
l'm all in favor of proper relations.

329
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,085
Mr. O'Brien,

330
00:29:57,253 --> 00:30:00,631
you have absolutely nothing to say
that holds any interest to me.

331
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,263
Well, l think l do.

332
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:12,976
I think the guy who's in jaiI
for killing Santos is innocent.

333
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,603
What makes you think that?

334
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:17,648
Well, it's a gut feeling,
but, uh...

335
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,483
l have some ideas.

336
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:27,324
Sandra, hi. This is R.J. O'Brien.
You remember meeting him--

337
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,493
l remember him
from Mr. Lucavida's house.

338
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,745
So what brings you here,
Mr. O'Brien?

339
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,331
- Well, actually l was--
- Well, actually-- l'm sorry.

340
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:37,209
Um, Mr. O'Brien was
in jail with Djamori

341
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:39,503
and he aIso beIieves
Djamori was framed.

342
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,589
And why do you say that?
Did the lndian say something to you?

343
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:46,009
WeII no.
He didn't say anything,

344
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,178
but l thought that perhaps
with your connections

345
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,639
that we could get
an interview through the police,

346
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,684
- maybe talk out of his own safety.
- I'm afraid that is not possibIe.

347
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,353
- Why?
- The lndian is dead.

348
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,855
He's dead?

349
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:01,358
He hanged himself last night
in his cell.

350
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,193
Unbelievable.

351
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:07,114
What did they do,
slip him a pre-knotted noose?

352
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:09,032
l agree with him 100%.

353
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,034
l mean, this whole thing
is just way too convenient.

354
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:14,997
That may very well be,
but who's gonna challenge the police?

355
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:17,833
l'll challenge the police,
but l've gotta have more information.

356
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,751
l don't know the first thing
about this guy.

357
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,130
Well, what l know is that
he's from the Zingari tribe

358
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:26,425
and their territory's way up
in the highlands.

359
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,302
WeII, then I guess
an excursion is in order.

360
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,721
l hate to burst your bubble,
Mr. O'Brien,

361
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,723
but you're gonna
be like a flea on a gorilla.

362
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,809
The rainforest is
no place for a gringo.

363
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:38,145
Well, thanks for the advice.

364
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:43,817
l guess Santos is gonna become
a worId martyr for this one.

365
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,777
He was a bit of a publicity hound,
wasn't he?

366
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,571
No, not really.

367
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,740
l mean, he just realized
that there was a connection

368
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,826
between the rubber tappers' struggle
to save their way of Iife

369
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,037
and the world's concern
for the ecoIogy.

370
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,747
So the pubIicity
that he generated

371
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,082
was basicaIIy just
to pull the two together.

372
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,501
Mmm, pure at heart.

373
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:03,921
- No!
- What?

374
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:06,423
No, they're not supposed
to be burning out here.

375
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:10,761
Alto!  Alto!

376
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,347
-  Alto!
- Watch out, watch out, watch out!

377
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,224
Ayudame!

378
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:18,268
- What's going on?
- Somebody set her house on fire

379
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,228
and her son's still inside.

380
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:32,282
Wait. Wait!

381
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,157
Shit.

382
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,159
-  Como se llama?
- Antonio.

383
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,286
Antonio.
Come on, Antonio. Come on, baby.

384
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:22,040
Come on, come on! Come on!
Come on, Antonio. Breathe! Come on!

385
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,923
- Come on.

386
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,300
Come on, come on, come on.

387
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:35,387
Come on, come on.
Come on, breathe. Come on.

388
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:48,734
Come on! Come on, breathe!
Do you hear me?! Come on.

389
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:52,154
- Come on, please! Oh God.

390
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:55,198
Come on, come on,
come on, please.

391
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,743
Please please please.

392
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,853
lt's all right.

393
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,982
lt's okay.

394
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,752
There he is right there. See?

395
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,379
Let's wait for the police to leave.

396
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:48,103
Adelante.

397
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:04,286
Ataninde,
un momento por favor.

398
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:07,330
My name is Alyssa Rothman.
We met at Lucavida's.

399
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:10,250
l'm with the Rainforest Society,
and we wouId very much Iike

400
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,711
- to speak to you about Djamori.
- I was the one

401
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:17,340
who was arrested with Djamori.
I don't think he kiIIed Santos.

402
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,266
Ahem. Um,

403
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,935
can l ask you a few questions?

404
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:31,938
Uh, excuse me.
l'm trying to help!

405
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:34,774
No--  no escuchas?

406
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:37,360
l'm trying to help.

407
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,198
Scratch that idea.

408
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,746
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

409
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,873
Come on,
we're following him.

410
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,541
We're-- no, we're not.

411
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,793
- This is no time to give up.
- l'm not giving up.

412
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:56,880
I just don't think it's right
that you go follow him-- hey!

413
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,967
- Sorry.
- Asshole.

414
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:57,315
Where in the hell is it?

415
00:37:57,483 --> 00:38:01,361
l have no idea.
Santos said he was there once,

416
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:04,656
but the only thing he said was
that it was a Iong trip.

417
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,879
Nos estan siguiendo?

418
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:22,549
Si. Ahi estan.

419
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:14,017
lt looks like we're up the creek
in more ways than one.

420
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,020
Son of a bitch!

421
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:25,528
- Shh. Shh-shh!

422
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:30,033
- What?
- Quiet. Be quiet.

423
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,086
l just heard something.

424
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:48,111
Shh. Shh.

425
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,997
What the hell.

426
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:01,166
Ow.

427
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,815
- God.

428
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:34,240
You're lucky it didn't go
through the bone.

429
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:37,994
l am really scared.

430
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,663
Look,

431
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:43,666
those lndians
didn't have any guns.

432
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:46,628
Whoever shot us
came from back there.

433
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:49,214
l'm sorry.
l'm sorry, l'm sorry, l'm sorry.

434
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,700
The Zingari territorial boundaries.

435
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,245
See?

436
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:28,211
Come on.

437
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:05,415
Shh.

438
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,300
Right.

439
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:30,565
l think we lost them.

440
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,942
All right, you wait here.

441
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,194
- l'm gonna see if l can find the river.
- No. No, l don't--

442
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:37,655
Just wait here one second!

443
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,834
God.

444
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:28,831
- Why are you following me?

445
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,833
Hmm?

446
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:33,586
This is my territory.

447
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:37,965
You could've saved me a trip if you'd
answered my questions about Djamori.

448
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:41,302
Djamori was killed
by a white man and l can kill you

449
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:45,014
whenever l fucking want to.

450
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:52,146
Camina!

451
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:57,754
Hold on.

452
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:59,922
Please, his shoulder
has been hurt.

453
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,341
Is there anything
that you can give him for it?

454
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:06,387
Si.

455
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:08,598
You know Djamori.

456
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,767
Do you think he killed Santos?

457
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:14,896
Yeah, he could have done it, maybe not.

458
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:16,689
But either way, he's dead.

459
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,733
Yeah, but if we don't
find out the truth,

460
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:21,486
more people are just gonna
keep getting kiIIed.

461
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:24,363
l don't believe
the white man's truth anymore.

462
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:29,577
Toma.

463
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:51,307
l can't believe
l've lost my fucking camera!

464
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,351
You didn't.

465
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:55,520
lt's right here.

466
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,816
You are quite the Girl Scout,
aren't you?

467
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:02,527
Brownie.

468
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,794
Bring the prisoner.

469
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:31,013
Two blows to the head,

470
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:34,100
covered up with false hair.

471
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:38,396
But what killed him was the blow
to the back.

472
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:41,190
He burst his kidneys.

473
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:45,194
White man's truth.

474
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:47,613
l'm sorry.

475
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:53,578
I'd Iike to take some pictures.
l'd like to prove he didn't kill himself.

476
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:45,463
Did you know Rafael?

477
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:49,926
l spent five years working
outside the reservation

478
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:52,303
for the government,
for the Zingari tribe.

479
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:54,013
That's when l met Santos.

480
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,307
You were his partner, right?

481
00:48:57,726 --> 00:49:00,102
He knew how to use the law
to protect the lndians

482
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,355
and the rubber tappers.

483
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:05,274
l know how to protect
the movement from outside threats.

484
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:07,109
And?

485
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:08,861
And he failed.

486
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,613
He died.

487
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,782
He failed before he died,

488
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:16,202
when he decided to fight
the exploiters with empathy--

489
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:19,121
passive resistance bullshit.

490
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:23,125
Well, it seemed to work
aII right for Gandhi.

491
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:34,053
You don't happen to know who
might've put this hole in me, do you?

492
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:37,640
There's a lot of fools
Iooking for goId.

493
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:49,225
You stole the blankets!

494
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:54,563
lt's the middle of the night.
Come back to bed.

495
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:04,365
We are so different.

496
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:07,910
You're here for a story

497
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:09,912
and l'm here because l care.

498
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:15,709
l bet if all the logging
and all the burning stopped tomorrow,

499
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:18,879
you'd find another cause.

500
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:21,924
And l guess you don't hold
anything sacred, huh?

501
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:24,760
l guess you've just seen
so much in this worId

502
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:27,096
that you've deveIoped
this profound philosophy

503
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:29,932
that there's nothing worth
caring about. Is that it?

504
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,142
No.

505
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:35,854
- l don't care about a lot.
- Mmm?

506
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,990
l care about you.

507
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:48,867
You don't know me.

508
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:51,287
No, but l want to.

509
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,481
Good morning.

510
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,567
Thank you for the ride back.

511
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:24,320
We probably wouldn't have found
our way by ourseIves.

512
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,161
- Morning.
- Come on.

513
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:57,603
Hey, you wanna have a little drink
before we part company?

514
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,480
l don't think so.

515
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:08,197
Ataninde, please, do you have
any idea who killed them?

516
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:12,701
Santos had many enemies.

517
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:15,204
lt could have been anyone.

518
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:21,585
Yeah. Well, the arrow indicates
that it was an Indian.

519
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:26,548
Appearances can be deceiving,
Mr. Magazine Writer.

520
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:29,510
You shouId know that.
You write the truth every day.

521
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:40,104
Where-- do you know
where we can get this film developed?

522
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:42,564
Yeah, we have a makeshift
Iab at the office

523
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:45,234
that we use for our newsletter.

524
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:48,195
Oh, God, you're so beautiful
when you say that.

525
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:53,033
Do women in New York
actually fall for these lines?

526
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:55,744
All the time.

527
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:59,790
Funny.
lt sounds pretty cliche to me.

528
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,934
Can l come in?

529
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:24,481
l've been trying to get ahold of Sandra,
but I can't find her anywhere.

530
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:27,818
So how is it going?

531
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:30,112
Really good.

532
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:39,746
These are beautiful!

533
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:45,002
Are you gonna use
all of these in your article?

534
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,962
You can bet
your sweet ass l am.

535
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,590
You are so charming.

536
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:53,010
That's great.

537
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:57,306
- l meant it affectionately.

538
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,141
Oh.

539
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:03,187
Alyssa: We have work to do.

540
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:32,216
- Perdon.
- Perdon.

541
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:36,261
Oh-oh-oh, shoot shoot,
I have to caII Sandra.

542
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:39,014
- Now?
- Yes, now. Just real fast.

543
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,892
- Shall l get horizontal or--
- Yes, you shouId.

544
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,061
- 213.

545
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:51,777
l cannot see

546
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:55,030
Why do you want me?

547
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:57,199
Yeah.

548
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:03,205
l cannot see

549
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:07,042
Why you look so...

550
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:09,002
Mmm.

551
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:11,046
Want me?

552
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:15,175
Don't move.

553
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:23,058
You should have left
after the funeral

554
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:25,477
like your friends.

555
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:30,524
This is none of your business.

556
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:34,945
Tie him up.

557
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,578
Listen, we can--

558
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:45,122
we can make a deal here.

559
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:48,917
Uh, you can have the pictures
as far as l'm concerned.

560
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:51,420
l'll get out of this fucking country
anyway. Your food sucks!

561
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,797
- HeIIo?

562
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:55,507
Hi. lt's me Alyssa.

563
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:59,219
We just got back and R.J. managed
to get ahoId of some information

564
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:01,513
that proves that Djamori
didn't kiII himseIf.

565
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:03,599
You know,

566
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:06,435
I was getting ready
to arrest you myself,

567
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:11,440
but apparentIy some fucking
drug dealer got you before l did.

568
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:15,902
l don't like you.

569
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:17,863
Listen, this isn't that important to me.

570
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:19,906
- l wanna get the fuck--
- l don't like you!

571
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:24,745
l never liked you.

572
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:28,373
l don't like this fucking ponytail!

573
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:29,708
l don't like it!

574
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:31,501
Fuck you.

575
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:35,797
Don't ever talk to me
like that, gringo maricon.

576
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:40,385
- Don't forget! Never.

577
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:47,392
Alyssa, where are you?

578
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,102
l'm calling from his hotel.

579
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:50,479
His hotel.

580
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,564
AIyssa, do me a favor
and come to the office.

581
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:54,816
You get to the office right away, okay?
I'II meet you there.

582
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:57,444
- l wanna hear more about this.
- But this is good news, isn't it?

583
01:00:57,612 --> 01:01:00,489
lt's great news. l just don't wanna
discuss it on the phone.

584
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:02,699
Now go to the office.

585
01:01:02,867 --> 01:01:05,452
Okay, l'll be right there.

586
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,162
Bye.

587
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,497
Shoot.

588
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:37,651
Good luck.

589
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:14,563
- R.J., come on, open up.

590
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:17,566
What are you doing?
Come on, open the door.

591
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:25,657
R.J., are you all right?

592
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:28,201
- Come on.

593
01:02:28,369 --> 01:02:30,245
R.J., are you all right?

594
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:33,373
- Jesus.

595
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,086
Oh my God.

596
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:41,298
- Move!
- l'm trying.

597
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:43,967
l'm trying.

598
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:45,802
Let me get this.

599
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:50,098
Come on!

600
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,578
Who would do--
who did this?

601
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:14,498
Valdez and a bunch
of fucking cops!

602
01:03:14,665 --> 01:03:15,999
Valdez?

603
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:24,341
And now what the fuck
are we gonna do?

604
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:27,135
All right. Let's go back to my office.
Sandra will know what to do.

605
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:30,138
Yeah? Well, we need somebody
who is not afraid of the cops.

606
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:31,973
Well, believe me, Sandra is not.

607
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:35,310
Fuck! Unbe-fucking-lievable!

608
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:46,822
- Oh my God, wait. Wait wait wait.
- What?

609
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:49,741
- Oh Jesus.
- What?

610
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:52,369
Sandra knew about the bomb
in your room.

611
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:54,996
- How do you know?
- I don't know.

612
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:58,625
lt's just the way that she was reacting
when l was talking to her on the phone.

613
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:02,170
Are you sure you're not reading
something into this

614
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:04,089
because this is our last chance?

615
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:06,758
l don't know.

616
01:04:35,454 --> 01:04:37,998
You were right.

617
01:04:38,165 --> 01:04:41,251
Lucavida is paying everybody,
incIuding your boss Sandra.

618
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:01,354
- Ataninde, please listen to me.
- Enough.

619
01:05:01,522 --> 01:05:03,565
No! Ataninde, no.
l will not shut up, okay?

620
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:06,526
Listen to me. Listen to me, okay?
There's no place else that we can turn.

621
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:08,904
- And we need your help, all right?
- AII right, Iisten.

622
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:12,407
They're aII in this together. Lucavida
is financing the whole forest operation.

623
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:17,162
What does that gotta do with me?

624
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:21,625
So you're saying that Santos'
death's got nothing to do with you

625
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:24,044
and that Djamori's death
got nothing to do with you?

626
01:05:24,211 --> 01:05:26,922
Look, you white people
mind your own business,

627
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:28,757
and I'II take care
of my people, okay?

628
01:05:33,512 --> 01:05:37,015
Don't you realize
we're on the same freaking side?

629
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:40,226
Can you hear me?

630
01:05:41,979 --> 01:05:44,940
You know, you're a fucking hypocrite,
you know that?

631
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:50,695
-  Concha su fucking madre!
- Stop it, okay?

632
01:05:50,863 --> 01:05:52,656
- Just take it easy.
- Shit!

633
01:05:52,823 --> 01:05:55,575
Calm down.
Calm down, all right?

634
01:05:57,453 --> 01:05:59,037
You guys are going too far.

635
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:02,415
You are both
responsible for this.

636
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:05,627
lt has cost us a lot of money.

637
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:07,629
I think I know
where they might be.

638
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:11,132

Senor VaIdez, wouId you mind

640
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:16,513
Why not?

01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:19,641
And you listen to me.

l've done my best for you,
but I cannot--

643
01:06:23,771 --> 01:06:25,981

Just do it, hmm?

645
01:06:36,867 --> 01:06:38,785
Tell him to bring more if he can.

646
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:42,288
Yes, as soon as possible. Okay.

647
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:46,835
Some of them already left.

648
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:48,712
A lot of good it's gonna do us.

649
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:51,506
- At Ieast they wiII protect you.
- What we need right now is a plane,

650
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:54,092
not a protest movement.

651
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:57,429
Holy fuck!

652
01:06:57,596 --> 01:07:00,140

Don't try anything.

01:08:34,735 --> 01:08:38,571
The American embassy knows everything.

Don't you understand?

708
01:10:28,515 --> 01:10:29,891
Alyssa, get out of the line.

709
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:31,601
What are you looking for?

710
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:33,311

Where are you going?

If you go back there,

What?

755
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:36,531
Write about what you feel,

756
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:39,033
not about what you've seen.

757
01:15:41,286 --> 01:15:43,287
Okay?

758
01:15:49,878 --> 01:15:51,879

With you, l understand

763
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:54,609
What words cannot explain

764
01:16:54,776 --> 01:16:57,737
Just the touch of your love

765

And l know it all

768
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:16,922
Take me to the place

769
01:17:17,090 --> 01:17:21,844
Where we collide as one

770
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:23,804
Where no one knows

771
01:17:23,972 --> 01:17:27,308
The look on my face

772
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:31,812
OnIy you see
the woman l've become

773
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:36,233
Take me to the star

774
01:17:36,401 --> 01:17:40,738
Where children can be free

775
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:42,990
Where l found you

776
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:46,035
And you found me

777
01:17:46,203 --> 01:17:49,914
ln a secret sanctuary

778
01:18:07,891 --> 01:18:10,476

And l'll be yours

784
