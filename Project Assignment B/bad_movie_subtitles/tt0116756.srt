7
00:03:48,141 --> 00:03:50,541
Hey, welcome back, Max.

8
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,511
<i>- Thought you'd get away from us, huh?
- Let go of me!</i>

9
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,571
Don't tell me this is
nothing about lunch money.

10
00:03:55,649 --> 00:03:59,278
<i>It's a math problem.
If we took all the dough...</i>

11
00:03:59,352 --> 00:04:01,252
<i>from a dork on the floor,
would it be enough?</i>

12
00:04:01,321 --> 00:04:04,848
Two dollars and seventy cents?
We're gonna be living large on this.

13
00:04:04,925 --> 00:04:07,917
<i>- If you guys want a
real score-- - Yeah?</i>

14
00:04:07,994 --> 00:04:11,361
It's the wholesale mart.
Fifth and Broadway.

15
00:04:11,431 --> 00:04:14,093
<i>Rolexes, gold chains,
who knows what.</i>

16
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:19,696
<i>Third aisle,
locker 882, upstairs.</i>

17
00:04:19,773 --> 00:04:23,209
And all you need is...
this.

18
00:04:27,948 --> 00:04:30,781
<i>- We'll be in touch.
- Later... loser.</i>

19
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:34,377
<i>- Come on, man. Come on, man.
- What a wuss!</i>

20
00:04:45,298 --> 00:04:48,290
Another alien abduction,
Maxwell?

21
00:04:49,803 --> 00:04:53,569
They wanted my optic lobes,
but they didn't get a thing.

22
00:04:55,642 --> 00:05:01,080
- The key to the supply closet, Maxwell.
- The key?

23
00:05:01,147 --> 00:05:03,138
To the supply closet.

24
00:05:03,216 --> 00:05:06,674
Oh, I left it in the door,
Mrs. Duke.

25
00:05:06,753 --> 00:05:10,245
And you also left us without enough
time to hear your little presentation.

26
00:05:10,323 --> 00:05:14,123
But I want to hear it anyway,
right here after school!

27
00:05:30,377 --> 00:05:32,709
<i>I'm home!
- Don't tell me.</i>

28
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:35,714
<i>- You were kidnapped by gypsies
and sold to the circus.</i>

29
00:05:35,782 --> 00:05:40,219
<i>Hey, can I help it if Mrs. Duke is really
a very angry man trapped in a woman's body?</i>

30
00:05:40,286 --> 00:05:42,550
Oh, I see. Another
homework malfunction.

31
00:05:42,622 --> 00:05:44,988
And, gosh,
what a surprise, detention.

32
00:05:45,058 --> 00:05:47,891
<i>But,you know,
the only good news is...</i>

33
00:05:47,961 --> 00:05:51,055
you weren't here...

34
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:53,497
when we were robbed.

35
00:05:53,566 --> 00:05:57,229
What kind of maniac would steal
the motor to our Hoover?

36
00:05:58,972 --> 00:06:02,408
You were supposed to come home
today and help me clean up, remember?

37
00:06:02,475 --> 00:06:05,410
- It's just Travis.
- What is that supposed to mean?

38
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:08,174
You told me, men are like buses.
There's always another one.

39
00:06:08,248 --> 00:06:11,684
I never said--

40
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:14,413
You know that this is the only day
that I don't work a double shift...

41
00:06:14,487 --> 00:06:16,978
and I really wanted the
house to look nice for Travis.

42
00:06:17,057 --> 00:06:19,582
Mom, it's not like
he lives here or anything.

43
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:21,752
Your feet?
What is this?

44
00:06:21,828 --> 00:06:25,195
What is this? Huh? What have
you got here, dreadlocks?

45
00:06:25,265 --> 00:06:29,099
No, wait, look.
It's a tiny, living creature.

46
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:32,730
- Who put a squirrel in your shorts?
- Max...

47
00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:37,709
<i>- try and look like this guy.
- I hate that picture.</i>

48
00:06:37,777 --> 00:06:40,109
Max, we have to talk.

49
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,674
<i>Hey, guys.
Oh, hey. We're in here.</i>

50
00:06:47,654 --> 00:06:50,214
Looking good, Max.

51
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:53,054
<i>You're not looking
so bad either.</i>

52
00:06:53,126 --> 00:06:56,061
<i>Max,you ever hear
of a guy named Buster Keaton?</i>

53
00:06:56,129 --> 00:06:59,064
- Isn't he some dead
black-and-white guy? - Apparently.

54
00:06:59,132 --> 00:07:03,091
- But he's a very funny dead guy.
You tell him?- Tell me what?

55
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,270
<i>Hello?</i>

56
00:07:07,907 --> 00:07:10,671
Max, um...

57
00:07:10,744 --> 00:07:14,976
Travis and I...
want to get engaged.

58
00:07:15,048 --> 00:07:18,484
I thought he was just
coming over for ribs.

59
00:07:18,551 --> 00:07:20,712
- We wanted to wait 'til all
of the papers were signed.

60
00:07:20,787 --> 00:07:23,847
- ''Papers''?
- The divorce papers.

61
00:07:23,923 --> 00:07:27,757
There were some things
left unsigned by your father.

62
00:07:27,827 --> 00:07:32,287
My father? But I thought
you didn't know where he was.

63
00:07:32,365 --> 00:07:34,356
- I didn't.
- Listen, Max...

64
00:07:34,434 --> 00:07:38,097
what matters now is you and your
mom can move on with your lives.

65
00:07:38,171 --> 00:07:42,267
<i>- That's why we want to get engaged.
- Wait, what about me?</i>

66
00:07:42,342 --> 00:07:44,742
- Why didn't you ask me?
- Max--

67
00:07:44,811 --> 00:07:47,507
<i>What about me?</i>

68
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,548
Max.

69
00:07:55,288 --> 00:07:58,382
Well...
now he knows.

70
00:08:04,898 --> 00:08:08,800
<i>Hey, I want to talk to you!</i>

71
00:08:08,868 --> 00:08:10,768
Get him! Come on, man! Come on!

72
00:08:10,837 --> 00:08:13,362
<i>Come on!
Get over here, man!</i>

73
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:15,304
<i>- Yeah, go get him!
- Watch it!</i>

74
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,366
<i>Hey, come here,
you little con artist!</i>

75
00:08:17,443 --> 00:08:21,174
There are no gold watches,
no gold necklaces!

76
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:24,808
We'll get ya!
We got him now!

77
00:08:24,884 --> 00:08:28,479
Understand... you're messing
with my little brother.

78
00:08:28,555 --> 00:08:30,955
Don't tell me. They couldn't
fit the key in the lock?

79
00:08:31,024 --> 00:08:33,219
- There were no lockers.
- And your map was crap.

80
00:08:33,293 --> 00:08:35,887
So there's only one place
this thing's gonna fit.

81
00:08:35,962 --> 00:08:39,329
<i>And it ain't Mrs. Duke's supply closet.</i>

82
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:42,300
<i>Come on!</i>

83
00:08:42,368 --> 00:08:45,030
<i>Where you going?</i>

84
00:08:45,104 --> 00:08:47,572
<i>Hey, what are you kids
doing in there?</i>

85
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,633
<i>Get outta there!</i>

86
00:08:55,248 --> 00:08:57,216
Where'd he go?

87
00:09:24,143 --> 00:09:27,237
Go!
- I'm going around!

88
00:09:31,784 --> 00:09:34,116
<i>Go around!
Let's go!</i>

89
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:03,911
<i>Let's get him, boys!</i>

90
00:10:03,983 --> 00:10:07,111
<i>Oh, no!</i>

91
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:14,783
I'm dead. I'm dead.

92
00:10:18,998 --> 00:10:21,626
<i>Come on.
We got him now.</i>

93
00:10:21,701 --> 00:10:25,467
How do I shut this thing off?

94
00:10:38,384 --> 00:10:40,682
- Hi.
- You little turd!

95
00:10:40,753 --> 00:10:43,017
You think
you got skills?

96
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:45,080
Can we just pretend
this never happened?

97
00:11:08,948 --> 00:11:11,940
Who... dare to wake me?

98
00:11:14,887 --> 00:11:17,355
Ain't gonna make this a mystery.

99
00:11:17,423 --> 00:11:20,790
Don't wanna do time
on your wishes three.

100
00:11:22,395 --> 00:11:25,330
Watch it, boy!
You don't want to dis me!

101
00:11:25,398 --> 00:11:27,730
<i>Or I'll dish out my misery.</i>

102
00:11:29,135 --> 00:11:34,072
Now, who's that sorry wanna-be
that disturbed my z's?

103
00:11:36,609 --> 00:11:38,804
<i>Let's get outta here!
Go on! Go, go!</i>

104
00:11:38,878 --> 00:11:41,142
Get out of my way!

105
00:11:44,984 --> 00:11:48,920
If you want to be number one,
I'm sorry, boy, that's been done!

106
00:11:48,988 --> 00:11:51,752
But if you got the itches
for a sack of riches...

107
00:11:51,824 --> 00:11:54,088
don't matter how avaricious...

108
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,492
I'm the man that
could grant your wishes!

109
00:11:57,997 --> 00:12:01,865
Hey, don't turn
your butt on me!

110
00:12:01,934 --> 00:12:05,529
I'm the man of the ages,
straight out of the pages!

111
00:12:05,605 --> 00:12:09,701
Hang on! I'm contagious,
outrageous, spontaneous!

112
00:12:09,776 --> 00:12:12,074
You can't contain this!

113
00:12:12,145 --> 00:12:14,511
I am Kazaam!

114
00:12:14,747 --> 00:12:18,183
- I'm really happy for you.
- Where do you think you're going?

115
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:22,051
<i>Make your three wishes, and I'm out of your
face, back in my box and out of this place.</i>

116
00:12:22,121 --> 00:12:24,055
Listen, Mr. Psychopathic
Dork in the Basement...

117
00:12:24,123 --> 00:12:26,182
I don't think
you're ordering anybody!

118
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:29,558
Do you realize who I am?
I'm your genie!

119
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:31,859
In that case, I wish I was as
big as you, but not so stupid.

120
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:35,594
That's not a wish!
That's an insult!

121
00:12:37,637 --> 00:12:40,470
Besides, I don't do those kind
of wishes. I do material wishes.

122
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,806
See? Things. Stuff.
You gotta want something, kid.

123
00:12:44,877 --> 00:12:50,713
Listen, you want to pull the wool over
someone's eyes? Go get a sheep, okay?

124
00:12:54,353 --> 00:12:57,220
Listen, it's only 'cause this world
really, really gives me tension...

125
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,224
that I'm gonna do something
I don't ordinarily do.

126
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:02,227
I'm going to beg.

127
00:13:02,295 --> 00:13:06,925
- Now, make a wish. Please?
Okay.

128
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:10,628
All right, okay.
Give me a car.

129
00:13:10,703 --> 00:13:12,671
BlackJaguar-XKE.

130
00:13:12,738 --> 00:13:17,198
Yes! Yes, yes!

131
00:13:17,276 --> 00:13:20,575
- Jaguar? Black?
- XKE.

132
00:13:20,646 --> 00:13:23,137
Jaguar, black.
Better stand back.

133
00:13:23,216 --> 00:13:26,845
I am Kazaam!

134
00:13:29,489 --> 00:13:31,980
<i>- Jaguar, black, right?
- Yeah.</i>

135
00:13:32,058 --> 00:13:34,083
Okay.
Kazaam!

136
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,254
Okay, well, you just stay
here. I'm gonna go now.

137
00:13:55,515 --> 00:13:58,951
<i>- Uh-oh.
Hey, Kazoo?</i>

138
00:13:59,018 --> 00:14:01,179
<i>Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.</i>

139
00:14:01,254 --> 00:14:03,119
<i>- Kazoo?
Oh, Kazoo.</i>

140
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:05,180
<i>- Say nighty-night.
Kazoo. Kazoo.</i>

141
00:14:10,863 --> 00:14:12,797
<i>- Come on, you gotta eat.
No, I'm not--</i>

142
00:14:12,865 --> 00:14:15,698
<i>- Please. Look, it's delicious.
- No, I'm really-- Travis, no.</i>

143
00:14:15,768 --> 00:14:18,828
<i>It's very easy.
Come on.</i>

144
00:14:18,905 --> 00:14:21,373
Please. Just hold them
between your fingers like this.

145
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,874
<i>- Travis, I know--
- Squeezea little.</i>

146
00:14:23,943 --> 00:14:27,674
<i>He's in the house.
- Max, honey, is that you? Max?</i>

147
00:14:27,747 --> 00:14:30,716
<i>Hey, hey-- Honey, what
happened to your face?</i>

148
00:14:30,783 --> 00:14:33,047
- I'm okay, all right?
Who did this to you?

149
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:35,053
- Max, what happened to
your-- - Just leave me alone!

150
00:14:35,121 --> 00:14:38,557
Max.

151
00:14:38,624 --> 00:14:40,558
- I'll handle it.
- No, I really think I should.

152
00:14:40,626 --> 00:14:42,560
Please.

153
00:14:45,298 --> 00:14:47,232
Max?

154
00:14:50,303 --> 00:14:52,271
Max, can I come in?

155
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:02,646
Wow. That's really
great. You finished it.

156
00:15:05,218 --> 00:15:09,518
Hey, you're not building a
neutron bomb over here, are you?

157
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:13,025
- That could be a little dangerous.
- Don't touch that.

158
00:15:15,261 --> 00:15:17,195
You okay?

159
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:23,558
You want to tell me
what happened?

160
00:15:27,073 --> 00:15:30,304
<i>You don't like me
very much, do you?</i>

161
00:15:32,178 --> 00:15:37,514
<i>Listen, Max, I don't intend to
take the place of your father.</i>

162
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,984
<i>It's just that I love your mom,
and I want to marry her.</i>

163
00:15:42,455 --> 00:15:45,856
<i>I'd like us to be friends.</i>

164
00:15:51,297 --> 00:15:57,133
Anytime you want to talk...
I'll be here.

165
00:16:58,631 --> 00:17:00,565
Mom?

166
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:15,172
''Tuna. Home at 3:00.''
Sure.

167
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:35,600
<i>''Nicholas Matteo. ''</i>

168
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:55,587
<i>#I'll make your dreams
come true #</i>

169
00:17:55,654 --> 00:17:58,145
<i># What you want
I will do #</i>

170
00:17:58,224 --> 00:18:01,057
<i>#I'll make your dreams
come true #</i>

171
00:18:01,127 --> 00:18:03,891
<i># Gonna make your dreams
come true #</i>

172
00:18:03,963 --> 00:18:05,988
<i>- #I'll make your dreams come true #
- #Hey #</i>

173
00:18:06,065 --> 00:18:09,899
<i>#Baby,just me and you I'll
make your dreams come true #</i>

174
00:18:09,969 --> 00:18:12,529
<i>- What the--
- #I'll make your dreams #</i>

175
00:18:12,605 --> 00:18:16,097
<i># Come true ##</i>

176
00:18:16,175 --> 00:18:18,370
What the--

177
00:18:18,444 --> 00:18:21,379
<i>- Don't you wish you had
one of these? - How did you--</i>

178
00:18:21,447 --> 00:18:25,508
What-- Are you like
really lonely or something?

179
00:18:31,824 --> 00:18:35,521
<i>Hey. Hey, hold your camels.</i>

180
00:18:35,594 --> 00:18:38,028
I've been doing this genie
stuff for about 5,000 years.

181
00:18:38,097 --> 00:18:40,190
- It's not all it's cracked up to be.
- I'm sure.

182
00:18:40,266 --> 00:18:42,860
But I'll tell you what. Why don't
we start off with something small...

183
00:18:42,935 --> 00:18:45,028
and work our way up
to something big?

184
00:18:45,104 --> 00:18:47,038
But let's just
get it done.

185
00:18:47,106 --> 00:18:50,371
- All right?- Why do I get the
feeling you'll never go away?

186
00:18:50,443 --> 00:18:53,037
Wow.
You live here?

187
00:18:53,112 --> 00:18:55,376
Yeah, I built it
myself too.

188
00:18:55,448 --> 00:18:57,882
Hey, kid!
We're closed!

189
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:01,977
What's the matter with you?
Can't you read the sign? Beat it!

190
00:19:02,054 --> 00:19:03,988
Beat it!

191
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:10,893
You want me to turn him into
a dog or a cat or something?

192
00:19:10,963 --> 00:19:12,897
Your wishes are just
so spectacular...

193
00:19:12,965 --> 00:19:14,563
<i>I don't know if I could
bear another one right now.</i>

194
00:19:14,564 --> 00:19:16,162
Oh, back there?

195
00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:19,329
Your first wish? That kind of
thing could happen to any genie.

196
00:19:19,405 --> 00:19:22,067
- I was just a little bit rusty.
- You know...

197
00:19:22,141 --> 00:19:24,575
I bet they really miss you and the
nice building with the padded walls.

198
00:19:27,913 --> 00:19:30,404
<i>Check, check. One.</i>

199
00:19:30,483 --> 00:19:33,350
<i>- This is red with check one, two.
Check one.</i>

200
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:38,686
<i>- Hey,Julie, I need
some more finishing nails!</i>

201
00:19:38,757 --> 00:19:41,521
<i>Yo,yo,yo. Check one, two.</i>

202
00:19:41,594 --> 00:19:43,528
<i>Bottom, bottom.</i>

203
00:19:47,266 --> 00:19:52,203
Oh, excuse me, sir.
I'd like to speak to Mr. Matteo.

204
00:19:52,271 --> 00:19:54,205
Who?

205
00:19:54,273 --> 00:19:56,537
Your mother.

206
00:20:04,116 --> 00:20:07,051
<i>I said I wanted the bar stocked
before the sound check!</i>

207
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:09,383
<i>How much?</i>

208
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:20,227
<i>- Hello.
Will you hurry up over there?</i>

209
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:22,563
<i>- Who am I talking to?
Paul Shea, line three.</i>

210
00:20:22,635 --> 00:20:26,833
<i>Mr. Shea, Nick Matteo.
How you doing?</i>

211
00:20:26,906 --> 00:20:29,204
Hey, you're gonna have
to help me out, Mr. Shea.

212
00:20:29,275 --> 00:20:33,678
Look, what I'm saying is
you're gonna have...

213
00:20:33,746 --> 00:20:36,180
<i>the best seat in the house set
aside especially for you tonight.</i>

214
00:20:36,248 --> 00:20:38,739
We'll take good care of you, Paul.
Uh-huh. Yeah, I'll see you tonight.

215
00:20:38,817 --> 00:20:42,309
Cindi, if I wanted pressed turkey,
I would have run over myself.

216
00:20:42,388 --> 00:20:44,720
<i>- Anybody got any gum?
- I do.</i>

217
00:20:47,459 --> 00:20:52,328
- Who are you?
- I'm... Max.

218
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,392
Theo, you call a messenger?

219
00:20:56,468 --> 00:20:59,995
<i>No, I didn't call anybody.
- Psst.</i>

220
00:21:00,072 --> 00:21:01,937
Try downstairs, kid.

221
00:21:02,007 --> 00:21:06,341
<i>Hey, hey, I like it! I'm serious! This
whole, you know, seen-the-street thing.</i>

222
00:21:06,412 --> 00:21:09,210
<i>Tell me,you booked in or you just
come here to scare the hell out of us?</i>

223
00:21:14,286 --> 00:21:17,016
Thank you.

224
00:21:18,657 --> 00:21:22,718
So, tough guy,
who was that loser?

225
00:21:22,795 --> 00:21:25,730
That was my father.

226
00:22:14,013 --> 00:22:17,847
Hey-dee, hi-dee-ho.

227
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:21,147
<i>Was that guy
really your father?</i>

228
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,654
Acted like he didn't
even know you.

229
00:22:25,624 --> 00:22:28,718
Look, he hasn't seen me
in a long time.

230
00:22:28,794 --> 00:22:31,058
I was two, okay?

231
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,598
<i>- Where did he go?
- Away.</i>

232
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:35,600
That's a long time away.

233
00:22:35,668 --> 00:22:39,104
I mean, it's not two or three
thousand years, but that's a long time.

234
00:22:39,171 --> 00:22:41,571
Well, he's back now,
all right?

235
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,108
<i>- And things are gonna be different.
- Cool.</i>

236
00:22:44,176 --> 00:22:46,144
So how come you didn't
tell him who you were?

237
00:22:46,211 --> 00:22:48,509
- What do you care?
- Who says I did?

238
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,310
- Why don't you just leave me alone?
- Is that a wish?

239
00:22:51,383 --> 00:22:53,351
Is that all you care about?

240
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:55,580
Look, you little fart...

241
00:22:55,654 --> 00:22:57,781
you called me
into this mess of a world.

242
00:22:57,856 --> 00:23:01,314
- I didn't call anybody.
- You popped the box, so make a wish!

243
00:23:01,393 --> 00:23:03,520
<i>Wish for a castle,
a fancy chariot!</i>

244
00:23:03,595 --> 00:23:06,029
<i>I don't care what you do.
I gotta obey the rules.</i>

245
00:23:06,098 --> 00:23:08,032
I can't show my magic
to anybody but you...

246
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,866
and I can't get back into my box
until you make your three wishes.

247
00:23:11,937 --> 00:23:14,201
Now, deal with it!

248
00:23:15,274 --> 00:23:17,572
- Deal with this!
- Hey!

249
00:23:21,947 --> 00:23:24,745
My turn.

250
00:23:24,817 --> 00:23:27,445
Whoa! Whoa!

251
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:36,052
What I gotta do, kid?

252
00:23:36,128 --> 00:23:38,187
Let's go!
You're on my turf now!

253
00:23:38,263 --> 00:23:40,788
You'll be sorry!

254
00:23:44,803 --> 00:23:47,237
<i>Come back here!</i>

255
00:23:51,243 --> 00:23:52,540
Oh, Max.

256
00:23:52,611 --> 00:23:54,670
- Oh, no!
- Remember me? Make your three wishes.

257
00:23:54,747 --> 00:23:59,184
I wish you'd go away!
Leave me alone!

258
00:23:59,251 --> 00:24:02,243
- I'm gonna kick your butt!
- Dream on, loser!

259
00:24:02,321 --> 00:24:04,551
No way I'm losing
this race, buddy.

260
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,671
<i>Kazaam!</i>

261
00:24:25,043 --> 00:24:28,774
I'm back! Take a break, kid.
You're gonna need it for this.

262
00:24:28,847 --> 00:24:31,281
<i>Whoo!
Don't get all hysterical.</i>

263
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,784
Say thank you
for your miracle.

264
00:24:33,852 --> 00:24:37,720
- You are a genie!
- What's the matter? Your tongue is broken?

265
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:40,418
At a time like this,
you should be stokin'.

266
00:24:40,492 --> 00:24:43,552
<i>You know the rules,
now comply.</i>

267
00:24:43,629 --> 00:24:48,726
Kazaam,
he got unlimited supply!

268
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:53,297
You'll give me anything?

269
00:25:04,817 --> 00:25:08,309
Come on, boy,
you're not gonna die.

270
00:25:08,387 --> 00:25:11,618
Open your eyes.
Don't ask why.

271
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:13,817
Just give it a try.

272
00:25:14,927 --> 00:25:17,691
Then, then,
I wish I had junk food...

273
00:25:17,763 --> 00:25:22,325
<i>- from here to the sky.
- Why not? Higher than high.</i>

274
00:25:22,401 --> 00:25:25,859
Then you got junk food
from here to the sky!

275
00:25:25,938 --> 00:25:29,339
I am Kazaam!

276
00:25:34,847 --> 00:25:38,374
That's it?
A happy meal?

277
00:25:47,392 --> 00:25:50,020
Oh, great.

278
00:26:26,431 --> 00:26:28,695
<i>I'm outta here!</i>

279
00:26:37,075 --> 00:26:39,509
Look out!

280
00:27:02,534 --> 00:27:04,502
Ow.

281
00:27:06,905 --> 00:27:09,806
So... where's
the hot chocolate?

282
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:15,840
<i>Two more. Make this a
night you'll never forget.</i>

283
00:27:15,914 --> 00:27:18,246
Wait a second.

284
00:27:18,317 --> 00:27:21,377
You're not telling me
that was a wish?

285
00:27:21,453 --> 00:27:23,153
Like the main man did
with the loaves and the fish.

286
00:27:23,154 --> 00:27:24,854
No, no, no. And stop rhyming!

287
00:27:28,593 --> 00:27:30,959
I wish--

288
00:27:32,264 --> 00:27:34,562
I just wish my mom and dad
would fall back in love.

289
00:27:34,633 --> 00:27:37,830
Love? Kid, I told you,
Kazaam don't do ethereal.

290
00:27:37,903 --> 00:27:42,033
- ''Ethereal''?- Yeah. Love, hope,
talking to God, raising the dead.

291
00:27:42,107 --> 00:27:46,373
Ethereal. But I am Mr. Material,
and my stuff ain't too shabby.

292
00:27:46,445 --> 00:27:49,505
Three-story mansion, a sack of gold,
a whole land of milk and honey...

293
00:27:49,581 --> 00:27:51,708
<i>if that's still in.</i>

294
00:27:51,783 --> 00:27:54,013
How long do I have
to come up with the wishes?

295
00:27:55,454 --> 00:27:57,888
Now would be highly advisable.

296
00:27:57,956 --> 00:28:00,823
- Come on, let's go.
- But I can wait, can't I?

297
00:28:00,892 --> 00:28:06,660
<i>So... until I make
those last two wishes...</i>

298
00:28:06,732 --> 00:28:10,964
I own you, don't I?

299
00:28:11,036 --> 00:28:13,334
Technically.

300
00:28:15,907 --> 00:28:18,774
Welcome to my life.
And here's a tip:

301
00:28:20,078 --> 00:28:22,774
Lose the pointy shoes.

302
00:28:26,385 --> 00:28:28,148
<i>- I'm hungry.
- I'm not.</i>

303
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:31,018
- It's lunchtime.
- Not according to my watch.

304
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,490
<i>Hey, my Fossil watch!</i>

305
00:28:37,562 --> 00:28:39,530
<i>How did that happen?</i>

306
00:28:52,444 --> 00:28:55,379
<i>Huh?</i>

307
00:28:55,447 --> 00:28:57,506
What?
Ew!

308
00:28:57,582 --> 00:29:00,380
<i>Look, Godzilla,
I wish you'd just--</i>

309
00:29:00,452 --> 00:29:03,319
- Wish I'd just what?
Is that a wish?

310
00:29:03,388 --> 00:29:06,084
Let me make this perfectly
clear. Next time you do that...

311
00:29:06,158 --> 00:29:09,889
I'm donating your brain
to science, okay?

312
00:29:09,961 --> 00:29:12,259
Look, all you gotta do...

313
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:15,561
is make your last
two wishes...

314
00:29:15,634 --> 00:29:18,364
Mr. Mohammed Ali...

315
00:29:18,437 --> 00:29:22,271
- and I'm outta here.
- Sure.

316
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:25,434
<i>All right! All right,
that's it! Let's go!</i>

317
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:28,843
Come on! Let's go right now! Come on!

318
00:29:28,914 --> 00:29:30,245
Your whole way of thinking
really gives me tension, kid.

319
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:35,518
The name isn't ''kid.''
It's Max.

320
00:29:35,587 --> 00:29:38,181
And another thing:
you're gonna do whatever I want.

321
00:29:38,256 --> 00:29:42,625
And then, only then, will I
make my wish. Do you understand?

322
00:29:43,862 --> 00:29:45,853
Good.

323
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:02,542
<i>- This whole ''I-gotta-get-
the-guts-to-talk-to-dad''...</i>

324
00:30:02,614 --> 00:30:05,913
- isn't gonna take years, is it?
- Bite me.

325
00:30:05,984 --> 00:30:08,043
I'm really serious about
this getting something to eat.

326
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,714
It feels like
I'm getting shorter.

327
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:12,882
Stay here and try not
to hurt yourself!.

328
00:30:16,161 --> 00:30:18,391
<i>- Now this puts
the boom in box.</i>

329
00:30:18,463 --> 00:30:20,397
<i>- B.J.!
Hey, B.J.! Line two!</i>

330
00:30:20,465 --> 00:30:22,399
All right.

331
00:30:50,162 --> 00:30:52,528
This isn't a toy store.

332
00:30:52,597 --> 00:30:55,532
<i>Unless...
you want to play...</i>

333
00:30:59,037 --> 00:31:03,633
- my game.
- Impressive.

334
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:11,207
- Ladies and gentlemen,
Da Brat!

335
00:31:14,953 --> 00:31:16,887
How are you?
What's up?

336
00:31:16,955 --> 00:31:19,822
We're gonna make the hottest live
recording anyone's ever heard!

337
00:31:19,891 --> 00:31:21,307
Yeah! How you doin'?

338
00:31:21,308 --> 00:31:22,724
Spanky, come over here.
I want you to meet someone.

339
00:31:22,794 --> 00:31:24,728
- I want you to meet my bodyguard, Spanky.
- Yeah, yeah. Bodyguard?

340
00:31:24,796 --> 00:31:26,263
What's up? He kind of
small, don't you think?

341
00:31:26,264 --> 00:31:27,731
I don't need much protection.

342
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:29,767
<i>- We'll see - Mr. Matteo?
About that. - Get off me!</i>

343
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:34,328
Mr. Matteo, I found this kid
wandering around backstage.

344
00:31:34,406 --> 00:31:37,375
You? What are you doing
here? What's your name?

345
00:31:37,442 --> 00:31:39,535
Max.

346
00:31:39,611 --> 00:31:44,207
- Who let this kid in here?
What's this, an amusement park?

347
00:31:44,282 --> 00:31:47,683
<i>Well, Mack,
the tour is over.</i>

348
00:31:47,752 --> 00:31:50,016
It's not Mack.
It's Max.

349
00:31:50,088 --> 00:31:52,079
<i>Maxwell.</i>

350
00:31:52,157 --> 00:31:54,853
- Okay, Maxwell.
- Connor.

351
00:31:59,164 --> 00:32:01,792
Maxwell Connor.

352
00:32:11,443 --> 00:32:13,411
You're my son.

353
00:32:18,483 --> 00:32:22,078
Hey, everybody, quiet down,
quiet down! Check this out!

354
00:32:22,153 --> 00:32:24,553
<i>- This is my boy,
Maxwell Matteo.</i>

355
00:32:24,623 --> 00:32:27,183
- I want you to meet everybody.
This is Cindi.- Hi, Max.

356
00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:29,727
- And this is Frankie over here.
- Hey.

357
00:32:29,794 --> 00:32:32,763
<i>And that's Theo over there.
And you know who this is.</i>

358
00:32:32,831 --> 00:32:35,356
- What's up, little Max?
- Come over here.

359
00:32:35,433 --> 00:32:38,891
And this amazing wonder
is Asia Moon. Son of a gun.

360
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:41,564
I can't believe it! Look how
big you got! This is my son.

361
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,733
- Champagne?
- What, are you stupid? He's a kid.

362
00:32:43,808 --> 00:32:46,242
Get that outta here. Hey,
don't we have some pizza comin'?

363
00:32:46,311 --> 00:32:49,246
You like pizza, kid? Come over here.
I want you to check something out.

364
00:32:49,314 --> 00:32:52,579
You like music? Come here. Sit
down, sit down. Listen to this.

365
00:32:56,955 --> 00:32:59,685
So what do you think?
Is this place smokin' or what?

366
00:32:59,758 --> 00:33:01,726
- How old are you?
- Twelve.

367
00:33:01,793 --> 00:33:04,557
<i>Where the hell's the pizza?</i>

368
00:33:04,629 --> 00:33:07,359
Three large, two medium. Pizza
'Zaam's here to bust the tedium.

369
00:33:15,874 --> 00:33:19,435
<i>You know him?</i>

370
00:33:19,511 --> 00:33:23,743
<i>- What?
- Maybe a football or a basketball?</i>

371
00:33:23,815 --> 00:33:24,844
I don't think rewarding him
is a very good idea right now.

372
00:33:24,845 --> 00:33:25,874
It's not to reward him.

373
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,884
<i>- Hi, guys.
- It's to straighten him out.</i>

374
00:33:27,952 --> 00:33:31,046
Where have you been, hmm? Not
at school. You are grounded!

375
00:33:31,122 --> 00:33:33,056
<i>- I've really had it this time, Max.
- Hold it, hold it.</i>

376
00:33:33,124 --> 00:33:35,058
- Two days you have not been-- -
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Alice.

377
00:33:35,126 --> 00:33:37,458
<i>- What?
- Why don't we sit down and talk?</i>

378
00:33:37,529 --> 00:33:39,724
- Because I am not finished.
- I'm a little busy.

379
00:33:39,798 --> 00:33:42,266
<i>Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
One second, Mr. Connor.</i>

380
00:33:42,334 --> 00:33:44,734
<i>You know, we are going to start
changing the way things work around here.</i>

381
00:33:44,803 --> 00:33:49,172
From now on, you're gonna come home from
school, and you're gonna start doing chores.

382
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,765
- ''Chores''?
- Yes, chores.

383
00:33:51,843 --> 00:33:54,403
What do you mean, chores? Milk the
cows, feed chickens? I don't get it.

384
00:33:54,479 --> 00:33:56,413
- Max, this is exactly the thing...
- All right, all right.

385
00:33:56,481 --> 00:33:58,915
- That is really putting me over the edge.
- Wait a minute. Forget chores.

386
00:33:58,983 --> 00:34:02,783
Forget chores. What we mean
is, we want to help you.

387
00:34:02,854 --> 00:34:06,847
<i>We're gonna get you a tutor, and I'd
like to start picking you up after school.</i>

388
00:34:06,925 --> 00:34:09,189
He's not picking me up after school. I
don't have to listen to you, all right?

389
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,854
<i>You're not my father. You
will never be my father!</i>

390
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:14,125
- You watch your mouth.
- Watch yours! You lied to me!

391
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:18,192
You told me my father wasn't
here, but he is! I've seen him!

392
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:23,205
Max.

393
00:34:23,274 --> 00:34:25,504
Please.
Wait.

394
00:34:31,416 --> 00:34:34,010
You're right.

395
00:34:34,085 --> 00:34:36,610
I did lie.

396
00:34:36,688 --> 00:34:41,716
Your father showed up a
couple of months ago and...

397
00:34:41,793 --> 00:34:44,023
I didn't know
what to do.

398
00:34:44,095 --> 00:34:47,189
Why did he leave?

399
00:34:51,302 --> 00:34:55,363
Sometimes things just don't
turn out the way you plan.

400
00:34:57,442 --> 00:35:01,139
I know that I'm not the best
mother in the world, Max...

401
00:35:01,212 --> 00:35:04,978
<i>but I want you
to have a real father...</i>

402
00:35:05,049 --> 00:35:09,349
one who's around,
who you can count on.

403
00:35:09,421 --> 00:35:12,390
<i>- Do you understand that?
- No.</i>

404
00:35:27,105 --> 00:35:31,041
<i>So, tough guy...</i>

405
00:35:31,109 --> 00:35:34,374
- what's ''grounded''?
- Something I'm not!

406
00:35:34,446 --> 00:35:37,381
<i>My dad says it's
the blood that counts.</i>

407
00:35:37,449 --> 00:35:39,508
I'll get a job!
I'll show them!

408
00:35:39,584 --> 00:35:43,782
<i>Maybe I'll even be a personal
assistant! I'll show them all!</i>

409
00:35:43,855 --> 00:35:47,416
<i>Once I know the business and stuff,
I can even have a band myself.</i>

410
00:35:47,492 --> 00:35:50,723
<i>- My dad will manage us.
- Pretty big dreams, kid.</i>

411
00:35:50,795 --> 00:35:54,458
What do you know?
You live in a box!

412
00:35:54,532 --> 00:35:58,969
<i>Boom box, that is. So what?</i>

413
00:35:59,037 --> 00:36:02,996
<i>Every once in awhile,
someone drags me out.</i>

414
00:36:03,074 --> 00:36:05,099
And I do see things.

415
00:36:05,176 --> 00:36:09,510
<i>Like a whole bunch of silly people,
counting on a whole bunch of silly wishes.</i>

416
00:36:09,581 --> 00:36:14,075
Let me be the first to tell you, the
future don't always follow the plan.

417
00:36:14,152 --> 00:36:17,144
Because the plan
sucks big time!

418
00:36:17,222 --> 00:36:20,020
See, I'm making
my future here, Kaz...

419
00:36:20,091 --> 00:36:24,551
and the next step is two all-access
passes to tonight's concert.

420
00:36:40,812 --> 00:36:44,441
# Ooh party people,
Come on make some noise #

421
00:36:44,516 --> 00:36:47,485
#And if you come to jam, baby
Throw up your hands #

422
00:36:47,552 --> 00:36:50,077
# I'm lookin' at 'em, sister
All Bill, Bobs and Janes #

423
00:36:50,154 --> 00:36:52,554
<i># That's all I see #</i>

424
00:36:52,624 --> 00:36:56,185
#There's nothing
Nothing there for me #

425
00:36:57,962 --> 00:37:00,055
Don't say I didn't
warn you, boys.

426
00:37:00,131 --> 00:37:02,156
I think I'm gonna
wait outside, Max.

427
00:37:02,233 --> 00:37:04,326
No way, man.
This is cool!

428
00:37:04,402 --> 00:37:06,836
Rocky, Bullwinkle,
shall we?

429
00:37:06,905 --> 00:37:09,465
Come on, Rocky.

430
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:13,773
<i># That's all I see There's
nothing Nothing there for me #</i>

431
00:37:13,845 --> 00:37:17,281
# Come on, do your thing
If you want it, Mr. Granite #

432
00:37:17,348 --> 00:37:20,283
#A lady on the side Get up,
get up If you can stand #

433
00:37:26,424 --> 00:37:30,952
# Ooh Who's the cutie over
there From another planet #

434
00:37:31,029 --> 00:37:35,523
# Don't just stare Come over here and
let me see you jiggy,jiggy jam it #

435
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:39,730
Buddy, it's like trying to hide
a tanker behind a sailboat.

436
00:37:39,804 --> 00:37:43,501
- What if they don't like me?
- They already don't like you.

437
00:37:43,575 --> 00:37:45,873
The question is,
what are you gonna do about it?

438
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,474
Get set for my
tete-a-tete-tete.

439
00:37:51,549 --> 00:37:54,746
<i>#Ha-ha,you see what I got So
let me see what you could get #</i>

440
00:37:54,819 --> 00:37:56,878
#The things I seen
Would make you sweat #

441
00:37:56,955 --> 00:38:00,391
<i>#Kings and fools
They're all fish in my net #</i>

442
00:38:00,458 --> 00:38:02,585
- # 'Cause I am Kazaam #
- # Ooh, man #

443
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:05,652
<i>#I'm more than I seem You all
are lookin' at your dream #</i>

444
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:08,824
# In your coffee, I'm the cream
One wish, I get extreme #

445
00:38:17,775 --> 00:38:19,834
Oh, Mr. Malik.

446
00:38:19,911 --> 00:38:23,005
<i>Your club--
What a place.</i>

447
00:38:23,081 --> 00:38:26,847
<i>- I knew it was gonna be hot.
- I always deliver...</i>

448
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:31,784
<i>more than I promise.</i>

449
00:38:31,856 --> 00:38:36,850
<i>Oh! So do I.</i>

450
00:38:36,928 --> 00:38:40,261
<i>I've got lots of clients--</i>

451
00:38:44,936 --> 00:38:48,463
<i>#As Romeo said beforeJuliet #</i>

452
00:38:48,539 --> 00:38:51,030
# Grab four of your friends
We'll have a sextet #

453
00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:53,270
# Hmm, I don't know
He's kind of making me sweat #

454
00:38:53,344 --> 00:38:56,074
# I got your sweat
But can this man slam it #

455
00:38:56,147 --> 00:38:58,615
- #And if your girls are
hungry # - # Uh-huh, and #

456
00:38:58,683 --> 00:39:01,413
# Let's green egg
and ham it #

457
00:39:10,728 --> 00:39:13,219
I'm looking for Mr. Matteo.

458
00:39:18,302 --> 00:39:20,566
All right.

459
00:39:39,757 --> 00:39:41,691
<i>You took this job,
no questions asked!</i>

460
00:39:41,759 --> 00:39:45,320
<i>No, I was hired to record a live
performance, not bootleg a legit album!</i>

461
00:39:45,396 --> 00:39:48,024
- I quit!
- Get over here!

462
00:39:48,099 --> 00:39:50,499
The last one of these tapes was
worth a million dollars to Malik.

463
00:39:50,568 --> 00:39:52,968
- 'Cause piracy's a felony, Nick. I
don't want to be involved. - Oh, r--

464
00:39:53,037 --> 00:39:55,505
What are you doing here? Get outta
here! Let me paint a picture for you, Ed.

465
00:39:55,573 --> 00:39:57,200
- Fine. Go ahead
- You are involved!

466
00:39:57,275 --> 00:39:58,799
- No, I'm not involved.
- I said get out of here!

467
00:39:58,876 --> 00:40:00,673
<i>I quit, Nick!
- Dad--</i>

468
00:40:00,745 --> 00:40:02,144
It's not my problem anymore!

469
00:40:02,145 --> 00:40:03,543
I got 50,000 blanks coming
in our little loading dock!

470
00:40:03,614 --> 00:40:05,775
- You better have that tape ready by 3:00!
- Dad!

471
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:07,283
- Forget about it, Nick.
- I told you to get out of here!

472
00:40:07,351 --> 00:40:10,013
- I'm tellin' ya, I'm outta here!
- Shut up!

473
00:40:11,622 --> 00:40:14,887
You stay there.

474
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:17,757
<i>What the hell are you doing
here? Are you looking for trouble?</i>

475
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:19,279
Dad, I thought it was
just gonna be you and I.

476
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,730
There is no ''you and I.''

477
00:40:20,798 --> 00:40:24,564
- Dad.
- Get out and stay out!

478
00:40:24,635 --> 00:40:27,229
But, Dad,
you don't understand.

479
00:40:42,153 --> 00:40:44,246
I told you Spinderella
would pack the house.

480
00:40:44,322 --> 00:40:48,588
You mean you've done
your job. Good boy.

481
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:54,063
But what I am really
interested in is this man.

482
00:40:54,132 --> 00:40:57,397
<i>- I don't know who he is.
Just some guy.</i>

483
00:40:57,468 --> 00:41:01,097
You gotta watch
for these things, Nick.

484
00:41:01,172 --> 00:41:05,040
You gotta keep your
eyes open for new talent.

485
00:41:05,109 --> 00:41:08,567
You gotta look
for the sparkle.

486
00:41:14,619 --> 00:41:18,316
Nick tells me
what a good man you are.

487
00:41:21,793 --> 00:41:24,227
I'm counting on it.

488
00:41:32,703 --> 00:41:34,637
Hey, what are you
doing here?

489
00:41:34,705 --> 00:41:37,401
I didn't know Spinderella opened
the show with a dwarf tossing.

490
00:41:37,475 --> 00:41:39,534
- Where'd you find this,
trash dumpster?

491
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:42,408
<i>- No, I was in there, all right?
- Yeah, I suppose you got...</i>

492
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,777
<i>a key to the studio.</i>

493
00:41:43,778 --> 00:41:45,074
Look, I was all over. I
was in the V.I.P. Section.

494
00:41:45,149 --> 00:41:47,083
I can go wherever I want.
I got pull.

495
00:41:47,151 --> 00:41:49,745
- Oh, he's got pull now. Pull this.
- Yeah.

496
00:41:49,821 --> 00:41:51,914
<i>I'm tellin'the truth. They're doin'a
live recording worth a million bucks.</i>

497
00:41:51,989 --> 00:41:54,958
They're taping it right now. If I wanted
to, I could go straight back in there...

498
00:41:55,026 --> 00:41:57,221
straight to the recording booth
and put the tape in your hands.

499
00:41:57,295 --> 00:42:00,389
Hey...
you mean that, homie?

500
00:42:04,769 --> 00:42:07,397
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.

501
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:17,709
<i>Something new on the plate?</i>

502
00:42:17,782 --> 00:42:21,616
Him? He's tall, Malik.

503
00:42:21,686 --> 00:42:23,620
Don't mistake that
for interesting.

504
00:42:23,688 --> 00:42:26,816
I was raised
to find everything interesting.

505
00:42:26,891 --> 00:42:30,520
He's got a secret
bigger than he is.

506
00:42:30,595 --> 00:42:35,862
Know a person's secret,
you own them.

507
00:42:35,933 --> 00:42:41,735
<i>Bring me his.</i>

508
00:42:46,611 --> 00:42:50,047
Kazaam! Hey, Kazaam!

509
00:42:50,114 --> 00:42:53,572
<i>- Malik would like you to join us tonight.
- Would you sign mine?</i>

510
00:42:53,651 --> 00:42:57,815
The thing is...
I'm looking for Max.

511
00:42:57,889 --> 00:43:01,290
He's with Nick. And I think
we'll just be in the way.

512
00:43:12,203 --> 00:43:15,229
Please, my favorite.

513
00:43:15,306 --> 00:43:19,402
- Nubian goat eyes?
- The food of kings!

514
00:43:19,477 --> 00:43:21,911
I haven't had these
in 3,000...

515
00:43:23,214 --> 00:43:25,648
days.

516
00:43:25,716 --> 00:43:28,310
You have old-fashioned taste.

517
00:43:28,386 --> 00:43:30,547
I don't get out much.

518
00:43:30,621 --> 00:43:33,852
<i>That we can change.</i>

519
00:43:56,647 --> 00:43:58,581
<i>No, go around
to the other side.</i>

520
00:43:58,649 --> 00:44:01,345
Shh!

521
00:44:05,423 --> 00:44:09,917
- You're late!
Come on!

522
00:44:17,835 --> 00:44:20,599
Hurry up!

523
00:44:25,109 --> 00:44:28,272
- What, are you crazy?
All right.

524
00:44:28,346 --> 00:44:30,280
Hey, Shep,
bring it down here!

525
00:44:30,348 --> 00:44:32,282
<i>- Traffic at 2:00 in the morning?
- Yeah.</i>

526
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:35,444
<i>Come on. It was supposed to already
be here. I told you five minutes ago.</i>

527
00:44:37,521 --> 00:44:40,046
<i>Mr. Matteo, I got the tape!
It's finished!</i>

528
00:44:40,124 --> 00:44:43,389
Wait right here. I'll be right
back down. Close the door.

529
00:44:43,461 --> 00:44:46,396
- What door?- The loading dock
door. Just press the button.

530
00:44:46,464 --> 00:44:49,228
<i>- What button?
- The button on the side!</i>

531
00:45:01,412 --> 00:45:03,505
Hey, wait!

532
00:45:16,761 --> 00:45:19,628
<i>- Downstairs!
Come on!</i>

533
00:45:19,697 --> 00:45:22,666
- Let's go!
- All right, you punks!

534
00:45:22,733 --> 00:45:25,759
All right, let's go!
Let's go!

535
00:45:27,071 --> 00:45:32,737
<i>Come back here, you guys!</i>

536
00:45:35,513 --> 00:45:39,711
Hey--
Hey, hold it right there!

537
00:45:39,784 --> 00:45:43,049
- Hey!
- Come on back here!

538
00:46:37,608 --> 00:46:39,542
Mom?

539
00:47:41,939 --> 00:47:44,066
# 'Cause I am Kazaam ##

540
00:47:45,809 --> 00:47:47,140
- # I'm more than I seem #
- Get off me!

541
00:47:47,211 --> 00:47:49,270
- #You are looking at the dream #
- Let me go! Ow!

542
00:47:49,346 --> 00:47:51,814
- # In your coffee I'm the cream ##
- Get off me, you pervert! Ow!

543
00:47:54,485 --> 00:47:56,953
Get out of my bed!

544
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:02,925
You know, you were right for me to get out
there last night. They totally loved me.

545
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:08,489
- What are you
doing here anyway?

546
00:48:13,437 --> 00:48:17,999
Look, Virgo.
That wasn't here yesterday.

547
00:48:18,075 --> 00:48:20,305
- Hey, what's this?
- What are you doing here anyway?

548
00:48:27,751 --> 00:48:31,847
<i>- What you looking for?
- Nothing! I'm looking for nothing!</i>

549
00:48:31,922 --> 00:48:35,187
Nothing is good.
What's this, science?

550
00:48:35,259 --> 00:48:38,387
''Polar covalent bonds have an
ionic-- '' You know this stuff?

551
00:48:38,462 --> 00:48:41,363
My mom wishes I did.

552
00:48:41,432 --> 00:48:43,366
<i>Hey!</i>

553
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:49,833
Wow. You're a genie too.

554
00:48:49,907 --> 00:48:52,899
You should've seen us last night
in Malik's limo,just chillin'.

555
00:48:52,976 --> 00:48:57,345
Having a good time,
eating goat eyes,just chillin'.

556
00:48:57,414 --> 00:49:01,214
What's that?

557
00:49:01,285 --> 00:49:05,984
You-You smell like
hippopotamus butt!

558
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:09,923
Damn.

559
00:49:30,047 --> 00:49:32,413
You know, your father
sure is lucky to work

560
00:49:32,414 --> 00:49:34,780
with Malik. He says I
got a future in the biz.

561
00:49:34,852 --> 00:49:38,447
<i>Is Asia gonna love me
or what?</i>

562
00:49:38,522 --> 00:49:42,253
Especially now. So, you and your
father have a nice night too?

563
00:49:42,326 --> 00:49:44,419
<i>- Nice night?
Max!</i>

564
00:49:44,495 --> 00:49:47,020
<i>- French toast!
- Ahh. Ooh.</i>

565
00:49:47,097 --> 00:49:49,156
Rotie francaise?

566
00:49:49,233 --> 00:49:52,100
<i>I love it beaucoup,
beaucoup, beaucoup!</i>

567
00:49:52,169 --> 00:49:56,629
<i>Mmm.</i>

568
00:49:56,707 --> 00:50:00,803
<i>Max. Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.</i>

569
00:50:00,878 --> 00:50:03,745
<i>That's right,
it's poison.</i>

570
00:50:03,814 --> 00:50:06,544
I figured if I ended your
suffering, mine would end too.

571
00:50:08,519 --> 00:50:13,354
Max. Last night--
don't do that again.

572
00:50:17,261 --> 00:50:20,424
I made your favorite, with
chocolate chips and peanut butter.

573
00:50:20,497 --> 00:50:26,060
- I'm not hungry. Do I have
to have this-- - Max! Please!

574
00:50:26,136 --> 00:50:29,902
For once in your life,
let me have the last word.

575
00:50:29,973 --> 00:50:31,998
Okay?

576
00:50:36,046 --> 00:50:39,482
So, so sorry.
Max insisted.

577
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:41,677
<i>He's told me so much
about you.</i>

578
00:50:41,752 --> 00:50:45,085
I- I'm sorry.
H- Have I met you before?

579
00:50:45,155 --> 00:50:49,319
No, ma'am, I haven't had the pleasure.
I am Jefferson Allensworth Lamb.

580
00:50:49,393 --> 00:50:52,362
<i>''Jefferson'' for he who
framed our fine constitution...</i>

581
00:50:52,429 --> 00:50:55,455
<i>''Allensworth'' for he who founded
a community of free blacks...</i>

582
00:50:55,532 --> 00:50:59,024
and ''Lamb'' because I like
to eat lamb chops.

583
00:51:03,273 --> 00:51:06,606
- And you're
a friend of Max 's?

584
00:51:06,677 --> 00:51:08,804
<i>How sweet of you
to call me a friend...</i>

585
00:51:08,879 --> 00:51:12,280
but the school district more
commonly refers to me as a tutor.

586
00:51:12,349 --> 00:51:16,718
<i>A tutor?
Oh, the school got you a tutor?</i>

587
00:51:16,787 --> 00:51:20,382
Oh, I-I'm sorry.
I- I didn't hear the door.

588
00:51:20,457 --> 00:51:22,391
Uh, you've
been studying?

589
00:51:23,927 --> 00:51:28,193
Y- Yeah, yeah, I have, inverse
ratios of height to intelligence.

590
00:51:28,265 --> 00:51:31,393
He gets that wit
from me.

591
00:51:31,468 --> 00:51:35,564
Uh, well, Mr. Lamb, would,
uh-- Have you had breakfast yet?

592
00:51:38,609 --> 00:51:42,409
Chocolate and peanut butter
French toast? Heavenly.

593
00:51:42,479 --> 00:51:47,439
Oh, please. Sit down.

594
00:51:50,053 --> 00:51:53,420
What are you doing here?
Get out of here. Get out.

595
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:56,789
- I'll make some more.
- Don't bother. I'm not hungry.

596
00:51:56,860 --> 00:52:00,159
- Breakfast wars. Yes, you are.
- Not even a little hungry?

597
00:52:40,337 --> 00:52:42,771
- Oh, Max?
- What?

598
00:52:48,345 --> 00:52:52,805
<i>Max, wait up!</i>

599
00:52:52,883 --> 00:52:56,842
So, what did you and
your father do last night?

600
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:58,854
Do?
Uh, lots of stuff.

601
00:52:58,922 --> 00:53:01,914
- ''Stuff'' is good. What kind of stuff?
- Stuff, okay?

602
00:53:01,992 --> 00:53:06,395
Oh. Hmm, I used to do
stuff a long time ago.

603
00:53:06,463 --> 00:53:09,159
Shouldn't you
be going to school?

604
00:53:09,232 --> 00:53:11,166
- I'm not going.
- Say what?

605
00:53:11,234 --> 00:53:14,465
No, I'm not going
to school!

606
00:53:14,538 --> 00:53:19,601
So, what do you think about this
shirt? Do I look cool or what?

607
00:53:19,676 --> 00:53:22,839
Hey...

608
00:53:22,913 --> 00:53:26,076
what's like the worst thing
you've ever seen in your life?

609
00:53:28,885 --> 00:53:30,819
The destruction of Pompeii.

610
00:53:30,887 --> 00:53:33,014
- That was a wish? That was you?
- Look, I didn't have a choice.

611
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:37,618
Besides, I did some hard time
under that ash. Try 342 years.

612
00:53:37,694 --> 00:53:40,185
So, like, I mean,
what about you?

613
00:53:40,263 --> 00:53:42,595
You ever take anything
you shouldn't have...

614
00:53:42,666 --> 00:53:45,260
<i>- or somethinglike that,you know?
- Me?</i>

615
00:53:45,335 --> 00:53:47,701
Yeah. Like, what's the
worst thing you've ever done?

616
00:53:47,771 --> 00:53:50,604
Look, can we talk about this later? I
got things I gotta do, people I gotta see.

617
00:53:50,674 --> 00:53:52,801
<i>- What?
- I gotta get ready.</i>

618
00:53:52,876 --> 00:53:54,639
- Ready for what?
- For tonight.

619
00:53:54,711 --> 00:53:58,272
- Tonight?
- I'm gonna perform.

620
00:53:58,348 --> 00:54:01,442
- You?
- Yeah, you said I was cool.

621
00:54:01,518 --> 00:54:04,453
Yeah, well, what are you
gonna rap about?

622
00:54:04,521 --> 00:54:08,082
You're right. The whole
thing is giving me tension.

623
00:54:08,158 --> 00:54:12,857
- I can't even decide what to wear.
- It doesn't matter what you wear.

624
00:54:12,929 --> 00:54:15,523
I mean, but you gotta have
something to rap about, your rhymes.

625
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:18,966
I mean, you gotta have
something to say.

626
00:54:19,035 --> 00:54:22,232
- Now what do you know about rapping?
- I know a few things.

627
00:54:22,305 --> 00:54:26,207
- Yeah, right.
- My name is Max, so get these facts.

628
00:54:26,276 --> 00:54:28,022
I'm on my heavy B.M.X.,
and I make some tracks.

629
00:54:28,023 --> 00:54:29,768
That's whack!

630
00:54:29,846 --> 00:54:33,373
- That's horrible! Oh, my God, that's awful.
- You do better.

631
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:37,853
# My name is Kazaam I got the
whole plan So listen to the man #

632
00:54:37,921 --> 00:54:39,912
- # 'Cause I'm the sultan

# Is that it
Is that the whole deal #

634
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:44,753
#You want to be a hit
You better get real #

635
00:54:44,828 --> 00:54:47,319
# I did have this friend

636
00:54:47,397 --> 00:54:50,195
<i># We discovered a bevy

That's all you gotta tell #

640
00:54:58,475 --> 00:55:01,103
#You got to listen to my rap

# So, it's me

00:55:20,664 --> 00:55:23,224
- # Praying to the gods #

649
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:26,269
<i>#A man with a halo

What are we, Max?

661
00:55:56,666 --> 00:55:59,294
#We genie #
- I can't hear you, Max!

662
00:55:59,369 --> 00:56:01,428
I cannot hear you!
What are we?

663
00:56:01,504 --> 00:56:05,031
#We genie ##

664
00:56:12,849 --> 00:56:16,546
Man, it must be great
to be a genie.

665
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:20,522
Sure, except
you're locked up.

666
00:56:20,590 --> 00:56:23,286
A couple of millennia later,
your lamp breaks.

667
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:25,954
Oh, you think you're free, but
you're sucked into a compass.

668
00:56:26,029 --> 00:56:29,123
You go down with the ship.
One day, you're salvaged.

669
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:33,693
You wind up in a radiator, a trombone.
You got it; a broken boom box.

670
00:56:33,770 --> 00:56:37,900
But you can just snap your
fingers and have anything.

671
00:56:37,974 --> 00:56:41,432
Yeah, but I can't
make myself free.

672
00:56:41,511 --> 00:56:43,638
Or make someone
fall in love.

673
00:56:43,713 --> 00:56:47,774
Or even make someone fall in love
with me. I can't even touch destiny.

674
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:56,452
Well, I just wish I could
change things, you know?

675
00:56:56,526 --> 00:56:59,393
Make things different.

676
00:56:59,462 --> 00:57:02,397
You're not talking about genies.
You're talking about djinn.

677
00:57:02,465 --> 00:57:04,524
Djinn?
What's a djinn?

678
00:57:04,601 --> 00:57:08,367
A djinn is free.
A djinn can do anything.

679
00:57:08,438 --> 00:57:12,374
Love, the future, fate.

680
00:57:12,442 --> 00:57:16,003
The problem is, djinn only
exist in fairy tales...

681
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:18,047
and I don't believe
in fairy tales.

682
00:57:19,416 --> 00:57:22,476
Yeah, well, I don't believe
in fairy tales either.

683
00:57:22,552 --> 00:57:26,079
- But then again, I don't believe in wishes.
- And look what you got.

684
00:57:26,156 --> 00:57:29,648
<i>- Doesn't your school
have a bell?</i>

685
00:57:29,726 --> 00:57:34,254
Yeah. All right.
I guess I better be going.

686
00:57:34,331 --> 00:57:37,926
<i>- See ya.
- See ya.</i>

687
00:57:55,919 --> 00:57:58,410
- Yo, the business man.
- Yo, what's up, man?

688
00:57:58,488 --> 00:58:01,980
How's it going?
Having fun, Max?

689
00:58:02,058 --> 00:58:04,026
<i>Some cajones, huh?</i>

690
00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:11,430
So, you gotta talk
to your dad.

691
00:58:11,501 --> 00:58:15,164
Tell him if he wants the tape
back, it's gonna cost him.

692
00:58:15,238 --> 00:58:19,902
<i>This is your big chance, man.
Do this, everything changes.</i>

693
00:58:19,976 --> 00:58:25,039
<i>You got money, everybody
looks at you differently.</i>

694
00:58:26,449 --> 00:58:31,216
You don't do this--
You don't want to say no.

695
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:42,598
Are you all right?

696
00:58:44,768 --> 00:58:46,895
Yeah.

697
00:59:16,032 --> 00:59:19,024
<i>Get up!</i>

698
00:59:19,102 --> 00:59:23,334
<i>Nick, please.</i>

699
00:59:30,046 --> 00:59:33,379
<i>Nick, Nick.</i>

700
00:59:33,450 --> 00:59:37,546
You knew the tape
was worth a million dollars.

701
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:40,145
<i>What was he thinking?</i>

702
00:59:40,223 --> 00:59:42,521
He was gonna work it off?

703
00:59:42,592 --> 00:59:45,561
I know how much it was worth.
I'll find it.

704
00:59:45,628 --> 00:59:49,189
But what will I find?
My loyal friend...

705
00:59:50,467 --> 00:59:54,028
or a man at the bottom
of the lake?

706
00:59:55,505 --> 00:59:57,496
I'll get it to you
by midnight tonight.

707
00:59:57,574 --> 01:00:00,338
But I still find it curious.

708
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:02,503
<i>On surveillance tapes...</i>

709
01:00:02,579 --> 01:00:07,073
<i>it looks like we were robbed
by a bunch of little boys.</i>

710
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:09,209
How could that be?

711
01:00:09,285 --> 01:00:12,186
I don't know.

712
01:00:12,255 --> 01:00:14,519
Neither do I.

713
01:00:23,233 --> 01:00:25,167
Kazaam! Kazaam!

714
01:00:25,235 --> 01:00:27,897
Revere is ready,
but he doesn't have a horse.

715
01:00:27,971 --> 01:00:30,235
<i>Kazaam!</i>

716
01:00:32,509 --> 01:00:34,739
So he wishes for the fastest
damn mare in creation.

717
01:00:34,811 --> 01:00:37,041
And what do you know;
a country is born.

718
01:00:37,113 --> 01:00:42,710
Where did you learn
all this, Harvard?

719
01:00:42,785 --> 01:00:45,583
Harvard? I'm way
too intelligent for Harvard.

720
01:00:45,655 --> 01:00:48,749
I experienced my academia
in Upper Mesopotamia.

721
01:00:48,825 --> 01:00:52,261
But nothing is more major
than my studies in Asia.

722
01:00:52,328 --> 01:00:55,661
<i>Kazaam!</i>

723
01:00:57,167 --> 01:00:59,897
So how'd you get to work
for a guy like Malik?

724
01:00:59,969 --> 01:01:02,699
- You don't want to know.
- Yes, I do. Try me.

725
01:01:02,772 --> 01:01:05,866
With a talent like yours, you'll
get to know him as well as I do.

726
01:01:05,942 --> 01:01:08,740
But will I get
to know you?

727
01:01:08,811 --> 01:01:10,802
I'll be right back.

728
01:01:14,717 --> 01:01:17,151
<i>Kazaam!</i>

729
01:01:17,887 --> 01:01:19,684
Kazaam!

730
01:01:22,025 --> 01:01:23,959
- What the--
- Get off the table.

731
01:01:24,027 --> 01:01:27,053
- Kazaam, I gotta make a wish!
- What are you doing? Get off the table.

732
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:29,291
- Kazaam, I need a wish, okay?
- Right now?

733
01:01:29,365 --> 01:01:34,359
<i>No, in 250 years, stupid! I need a
tape. No, no, I wish I had the tape.</i>

734
01:01:34,437 --> 01:01:37,668
- What kind of tape?
- The master tape of last night's show.

735
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:38,832
Can't your father
give it to you?

736
01:01:38,908 --> 01:01:41,502
No! Do you have
a problem with this wish?

737
01:01:41,578 --> 01:01:43,478
- No, it's just that it's your second wish.
- So?

738
01:01:43,546 --> 01:01:45,810
- So you want to waste it on a tape?
- I just do, okay?

739
01:01:45,882 --> 01:01:48,049
Just get me the tape!
I mean, come on, you

740
01:01:48,050 --> 01:01:50,216
know the drill. ''I am
Kazaam -- '' Let's go!

741
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:59,021
That we can do.

742
01:01:59,095 --> 01:02:01,825
Huh?

743
01:02:01,898 --> 01:02:06,028
No!

744
01:02:07,870 --> 01:02:10,464
<i>Why are we here?
- Just saving you a wish, my man.</i>

745
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:13,668
<i>- I-It's not here.
How do you know?</i>

746
01:02:13,743 --> 01:02:15,677
I just know, okay?

747
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:19,444
<i>Why isn't the tape
here, Max?</i>

748
01:02:19,515 --> 01:02:22,006
Why are you stalling? All you ever
wanted was to make my three wishes!

749
01:02:22,085 --> 01:02:24,280
'Cause you're blowing a
whole wish! Something's wrong.

750
01:02:24,354 --> 01:02:26,288
I got a nose
for this kind of stuff.

751
01:02:26,356 --> 01:02:28,551
<i>Talk to me, Max.
I'm your friend.</i>

752
01:02:28,625 --> 01:02:31,958
I don't need a friend, I need a genie!
Now, grant my second wish! I order you!

753
01:02:36,633 --> 01:02:39,466
Your wish is my command.

754
01:02:57,153 --> 01:03:01,055
- I'm outta here.
- Let me assist you.

755
01:03:01,124 --> 01:03:04,582
Four of the republics
of the former Soviet Union--

756
01:03:04,661 --> 01:03:07,425
Whoa!

757
01:03:11,134 --> 01:03:16,162
<i>Uh, Unocal?
Unistan?</i>

758
01:03:16,239 --> 01:03:18,901
Pakistan?
Stan the man?

759
01:03:18,975 --> 01:03:21,205
<i>Detention!</i>

760
01:03:25,715 --> 01:03:29,344
Tell me you
had a wonderful breakfast.

761
01:03:29,419 --> 01:03:34,948
Tell me that you couldn't have
another bite. Tell me everything.

762
01:03:35,024 --> 01:03:37,288
L.S.U. Grad...

763
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:41,956
professional performer
since he was eight.

764
01:03:42,031 --> 01:03:46,968
<i>Like I said, he's about as
interesting as his pituitary gland.</i>

765
01:03:47,036 --> 01:03:50,870
Come on, Asia.

766
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:54,933
Give Kazaam another shot,
won't you?

767
01:03:55,011 --> 01:04:00,210
I know there is something
about that boom box...

768
01:04:00,283 --> 01:04:02,877
and I am just dying
to find out.

769
01:04:10,493 --> 01:04:14,361
<i>- Yo,Jake.
- Two hours in detention. That sucks.</i>

770
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:16,523
Mrs. Duke sucks.

771
01:04:16,599 --> 01:04:18,931
We gotta talk.

772
01:04:21,170 --> 01:04:24,003
See you later, man.

773
01:04:24,073 --> 01:04:26,405
<i>Come on, in the car.</i>

774
01:04:32,014 --> 01:04:35,916
Wait. Max. Max.

775
01:04:35,985 --> 01:04:39,079
<i>Wait. Max. Max, honey,
get out of the car.</i>

776
01:04:39,155 --> 01:04:40,873
Nick, what the hell do
you think you're doing?

777
01:04:40,874 --> 01:04:42,591
This is between me and my boy.

778
01:04:42,658 --> 01:04:45,149
Your boy? You haven't seen him in
over a decade. You have no rights here.

779
01:04:45,228 --> 01:04:47,594
- This has nothing to do with you.
- You want me to call the cops?

780
01:04:47,663 --> 01:04:51,292
- Max, he's not what you think
he is. Get out of the car.- Let go.

781
01:04:51,367 --> 01:04:52,766
- Max.
- Go back to Travis!

782
01:04:52,835 --> 01:04:57,829
Max, no! Max, no!
No, stop!

783
01:04:57,907 --> 01:04:59,841
<i>Fifteen years.
Fifteen years!</i>

784
01:04:59,909 --> 01:05:01,934
Never in my life have I ever
seen something so stupid!

785
01:05:02,011 --> 01:05:04,536
- But Dad, I-I-- - I know what you
stole, you and your punk friends!

786
01:05:04,614 --> 01:05:07,777
Dad, please...

787
01:05:07,850 --> 01:05:12,844
<i>I told you--</i>

788
01:05:16,392 --> 01:05:18,326
Jesus.

789
01:05:19,862 --> 01:05:22,797
Why'd you have to come now?

790
01:05:22,865 --> 01:05:27,199
Mom was gonna marry Travis.

791
01:05:27,270 --> 01:05:29,204
I thought
I'd never see you again.

792
01:05:32,408 --> 01:05:34,968
You must have really
thought I was something.

793
01:05:35,044 --> 01:05:39,344
I never knew what to think.
You were gone.

794
01:05:39,415 --> 01:05:41,576
<i>Listen to me.</i>

795
01:05:41,651 --> 01:05:44,142
You don't want to be like me.

796
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:46,188
<i>You don't want
to live my life.</i>

797
01:05:46,255 --> 01:05:48,655
You got a choice. I don't.
You understand?

798
01:05:48,724 --> 01:05:50,919
<i>A guy like me,
you can't just walk away...</i>

799
01:05:50,993 --> 01:05:53,120
and pretend all this
didn't happen.

800
01:05:53,196 --> 01:05:55,664
Do you know how many cops
would love to lock me up?

801
01:05:58,534 --> 01:06:01,094
All right, look.
I want to tell you something.

802
01:06:02,271 --> 01:06:04,967
You get no second chances
in life.

803
01:06:05,041 --> 01:06:09,910
You get no second chances.
Remember that.

804
01:06:11,247 --> 01:06:13,647
Go on, get outta here.

805
01:06:15,785 --> 01:06:18,015
Go on, go!

806
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:14,999
<i>- Wow, look at that!
That's some boom box.</i>

807
01:07:15,077 --> 01:07:18,979
It has nothing to do
with the box.

808
01:07:22,552 --> 01:07:27,489
Well, if you're looking
for this, I found it.

809
01:07:27,557 --> 01:07:30,822
- Start production.
- You got it.

810
01:07:30,893 --> 01:07:34,989
<i>I want the first run packed
and shipped by sunrise.</i>

811
01:07:37,733 --> 01:07:42,500
<i>Nick... stick around.</i>

812
01:07:42,572 --> 01:07:46,440
I want to talk to you
about your son.

813
01:08:05,928 --> 01:08:08,192
<i>#Man of the ages #</i>

people out there, and they loved me!</i>

<i>You look terrific!
just great!</i>

Yes.
Whoo!

<i>- Kazaam! Kazaam! I got it, I got it!
- What is it?</i>

824
01:08:53,075 --> 01:08:55,009
Kazaam! I need
to make my last wish!

825
01:08:55,077 --> 01:08:58,911
- Say what?- My third wish! I wish
my dad had a second chance.

826
01:08:58,981 --> 01:09:01,040
<i>- Is the kid bothering you?
- Leave me alone. Leave me alone.</i>

827
01:09:01,117 --> 01:09:03,051
<i>- What is it?
Don't you want him back?</i>

828
01:09:03,119 --> 01:09:07,681
<i>- Let me hear you
make some noise!</i>

829
01:09:07,757 --> 01:09:09,816
I wish my dad
had a second chance.

830
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:15,260
- You know, like a different life.
- No can do, kid.

831
01:09:15,331 --> 01:09:18,027
- Kazaam, you gotta help me!
- We've been over this before.

832
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:21,536
- New lives, destiny. Kazaam
can't do ethereal-- - Kazaam!

833
01:09:21,604 --> 01:09:23,799
I need this more than anything
I've ever needed in my entire life!

834
01:09:23,873 --> 01:09:26,865
- I mean, can't you even try?
- Believe me, I've been trying all my life.

835
01:09:26,942 --> 01:09:29,103
- Just try harder!
- Look, I can't do it!

836
01:09:29,178 --> 01:09:31,026
Kazaam, I gotta make this wish!

837
01:09:31,027 --> 01:09:32,875
When you gonna learn? Life
ain't about wishin' and dreams.

838
01:09:32,948 --> 01:09:34,796
It's about what you got
and what you can do with it!

839
01:09:34,797 --> 01:09:36,645
Please! This is all my fault!

840
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:39,210
I'm not some djinn. I just can't
snap my fingers and make you happy.

841
01:09:39,288 --> 01:09:41,119
You just don't want to grant
my third wish, do you?

842
01:09:41,190 --> 01:09:44,284
You've got all this, and now you
don't want to go back in your box!

843
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:46,225
<i>- I thought
you were my friend!</i>

- Nothing!

What's wrong with Max?</i>

851

- He'll be all right.
- He was really upset.

852
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:12,513
I know, but listen to this
crowd. They love me. I own them.

853
01:10:12,588 --> 01:10:14,579
- You don't own them!
- Say what?

854
01:10:14,657 --> 01:10:18,252
<i>You don't get it, do you?</i>

855
01:10:21,497 --> 01:10:24,022
Look, look,
look what you have!

856
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:27,661
Do you know how jealous
you are making me? Huh? Huh?

857
01:10:27,737 --> 01:10:30,934
- I'm just telling my story.
- No, it's much more.

<i>You are--
You have a--</i>

859
01:10:35,010 --> 01:10:37,478
There is an ancient phrase.

01:10:37,546 --> 01:10:40,640
''Sultan's gold.''

861
01:10:40,716 --> 01:10:44,652
You speak!

862
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:47,314
Uh, you know--

863
01:10:47,389 --> 01:10:49,619
You are
the ''sultan's gold''!

864
01:10:49,692 --> 01:10:52,388
You got two minutes.

865
01:10:52,461 --> 01:10:54,725
<i>My box!</i>

866
01:10:54,797 --> 01:10:57,857

867
01:10:57,933 --> 01:11:01,369
<i>- Listen.
- We want more!</i>

868

Your public calls.
Trust me.

869
01:11:03,572 --> 01:11:05,540
This is my world.

870
01:11:05,608 --> 01:11:10,739
<i>Right now,you are
the biggest part of it.</i>

871
01:11:12,414 --> 01:11:16,680
My sultan's gold...

872
01:11:16,752 --> 01:11:20,313
lives in a genie's lamp.

873
01:11:26,595 --> 01:11:28,529
- Get outta here!
- Dad, what happened?

874
01:11:28,597 --> 01:11:32,192
<i>Go! Go!</i>

875
01:11:32,268 --> 01:11:37,706
<i>- At long last.
Look familiar?</i>

876
01:11:37,773 --> 01:11:40,708
Your father's been
very modest...

877
01:11:40,776 --> 01:11:43,370
about your
accomplishments, Max.

878
01:11:43,445 --> 01:11:48,610
That's right. I've got the box,
and you're on your last wish.

879
01:11:48,684 --> 01:11:50,652
Look, Malik, let's stop
playing these games.

880
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:53,187
I don't know what you're talking
about, and neither does he.

881
01:11:53,255 --> 01:11:56,281
You can't keep all
these secrets from me.

882
01:11:56,358 --> 01:11:59,020
<i>You got your tape.
He's just a boy!</i>

883
01:11:59,094 --> 01:12:01,153
Dad! What are you doing?
You can't--

884
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:04,961
Make the wish,
I get the genie.

885
01:12:05,034 --> 01:12:07,901
And everything
my heart desires!

886
01:12:07,970 --> 01:12:10,495
And if you
try anything clever...

887
01:12:13,509 --> 01:12:15,602
<i>Dearly beloved Nick...</i>

888
01:12:15,678 --> 01:12:19,637
will wake up...
dead.

889
01:12:19,715 --> 01:12:23,583
<i>Klass K! Klass K! Klass K!</i>

890
01:12:23,652 --> 01:12:25,950
Klass K! Klass K!

891
01:12:26,021 --> 01:12:28,251
<i>Your third wish
will be, quote:</i>

892
01:12:28,324 --> 01:12:31,623
''I want Malik to have all
the money in the world.''

893
01:12:31,694 --> 01:12:34,185
Don't you see, I wished for that, but you
can't do that. Because if you do that...

894
01:12:34,263 --> 01:12:36,697
the rest of the world goes broke
and money isn't worth anything!

895
01:12:36,765 --> 01:12:39,563
Then I'll take all the money

897
01:12:41,632 --> 01:12:43,628
I can't! I can't just say,
''Hey, Kazaam, I need your help,''

898
01:12:43,706 --> 01:12:46,300
and he'll appear
right in front of me.

899
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:48,969
I can't just say, ''Kazaam!''

Let's get busy, K!

901
01:12:54,717 --> 01:12:58,847
Make the wish...
or your father will die.

902
01:12:58,921 --> 01:13:02,914

you're the only friend
I've ever had.

992
01:20:38,647 --> 01:20:41,445
And when you

993
01:20:41,516 --> 01:20:45,145
I wasn't there.

994
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:49,316
And if I had to spend
another 5,000 years...

995
01:20:49,391 --> 01:20:53,327
in a lamp, a compass...

996
01:20:53,395 --> 01:20:56,660
or even that stupid boom box...

997
01:20:56,732 --> 01:20:58,791
I wouldn't care.

998
01:20:58,867 --> 01:21:01,335
I just wish...

999
01:21:01,403 --> 01:21:04,634
I could have granted
your wish.

1000
01:21:07,075 --> 01:21:10,841
I wish I could have
filled your heart.

1001
01:21:16,251 --> 01:21:20,654
You-- You are

Do you have to shine
that in my eyes?

1005
01:21:46,415 --> 01:21:50,715
You're alive!
You're alive!

1006

Put me down, put me down!

1007
01:21:54,055 --> 01:21:55,283
I made a wish,
and I granted it!

1008
01:21:55,357 --> 01:21:56,824
- Put me down!
- You're alive!

1009
01:21:59,728 --> 01:22:01,992
What was that?

1010
01:22:02,063 --> 01:22:03,644
<i>What's happening?</i>

1011
01:22:03,645 --> 01:22:05,226
I don't know. This has

1012
01:22:09,471 --> 01:22:12,133
You're leaving.

1013
01:22:12,207 --> 01:22:15,472
You can't. I haven't
made my third wish yet.

1014
01:22:15,544 --> 01:22:20,208
But you did. You wished for a
second chance for your father.

1015
01:22:20,282 --> 01:22:24,013
<i>- But wait, I-- - It was a perfect
wish. It was a wish from your heart.</i>

1016
01:22:24,085 --> 01:22:28,021
- And now it's done. - But--
No, you don't understand!

1017
01:22:28,089 --> 01:22:33,322
- What's happening to you?
- I don't know. I just feel--

1018
01:22:33,395 --> 01:22:35,761
<i>I feel...</i>

1019

01:22:57,719 --> 01:22:59,744
<i>- You--

1023
01:23:02,891 --> 01:23:04,859
No.

1024
01:23:04,926 --> 01:23:09,590
<i>- Kazaam... you can't.
- You don't need me anymore.</i>

1025
01:23:09,664 --> 01:23:13,464

- In our hearts, we're all djinn...

1026
01:23:13,535 --> 01:23:17,403
<i>- and we're all free.

1027
01:23:17,472 --> 01:23:20,839
<i>Don't leave me.
- The power...</i>

1028
01:23:20,909 --> 01:23:26,040
is in... your heart.

1029
01:24:04,052 --> 01:24:07,647
I make a grab like that and you
don't even say, ''nice save''?

1030
01:24:07,722 --> 01:24:11,317
- What happened?
- Let's go.

1031
01:24:23,204 --> 01:24:25,832
- Max? Is he okay?
- Yeah.

1032
01:24:25,907 --> 01:24:28,000
Is he all right?

1033
01:24:28,076 --> 01:24:30,874
Max, are you okay?
Max! Oh!

1034
01:24:34,916 --> 01:24:37,510
You're all right.
You did okay.

1035
01:24:37,586 --> 01:24:40,350
- Travis, get him a blanket?
- Sure.

1036
01:24:41,790 --> 01:24:43,849
I was in the building
and Kazaam...

1037
01:24:43,925 --> 01:24:45,790
- he was there and he took me...
- Okay, okay. Okay, Max.

1038
01:24:45,860 --> 01:24:47,953
- And he flew and then he-- -
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1039
01:24:48,029 --> 01:24:51,123
I got you now.
Okay? It's okay.

1040
01:25:11,086 --> 01:25:14,487
I don't know what happened.
All of a sudden, I was free.

1041
01:25:14,556 --> 01:25:16,524
<i>Your friend was there.</i>

1042
01:25:16,591 --> 01:25:19,424
He said something
about a second chance.

1043
01:25:24,566 --> 01:25:26,557
You're a good kid, Max.

1044
01:25:28,603 --> 01:25:30,833
You got a good heart.

1045
01:25:30,905 --> 01:25:34,170
Look, there's a few things
I gotta take care of.

1046
01:25:34,242 --> 01:25:37,177
<i>- Some people I owe.

1048
01:25:43,351 --> 01:25:45,615
That'd be me.

give me a minute?</i>

1050
01:25:52,527 --> 01:25:55,985
Look, when I come back,
I'd like to see you.

1051
01:25:57,365 --> 01:26:00,801
We can get together and,
I don't know...

1052
01:26:00,869 --> 01:26:03,030
get a couple rods
and go fishing.

1053
01:26:05,206 --> 01:26:07,697
Sounds like a plan to me.

1054
01:26:07,776 --> 01:26:11,371
If that's all right
with you.

1055

Thanks.

1056
01:26:27,562 --> 01:26:29,894
Are you okay
with this, Max?

1057
01:26:32,734 --> 01:26:34,998
- Hey, Mom.
- Yeah?

1058
01:26:35,070 --> 01:26:37,664
- Can we go home now?
- Sure we can.

1059
01:26:37,739 --> 01:26:40,401
- Come on.
- Hey!

1060
01:26:43,311 --> 01:26:45,336

1061

Okay.

1063
01:26:55,023 --> 01:26:57,958
- Are you sure you want to marry this guy?
- Well, that's the plan.

1064
01:26:58,026 --> 01:27:01,962
Let me tell you something. I've been dealing
with this woman for 12 straight years.

1065
01:27:02,030 --> 01:27:04,464
Now, we're talkin'
three baths a week...

1066
01:27:04,532 --> 01:27:06,466
- trash detail, cleaning your room.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1067
01:27:06,534 --> 01:27:08,798
- Three baths a week?
- Mm-hmm. With soap.

1068
01:27:08,870 --> 01:27:10,918
That's cold.

1069
01:27:10,919 --> 01:27:12,966
Speaking of which, I could sure
use a nice hot cup of chocolate.

1070
01:27:24,886 --> 01:27:26,820
<i>You don't understand.
I'm free!</i>

1071

- I got plans.</i>

1072
01:27:29,057 --> 01:27:32,322
<i>The only plans you got are
to grow old and die with me.</i>

1073
01:27:32,393 --> 01:27:34,827
<i>You must not realize who I am.
If you blink, I disappear.</i>

1074
01:27:34,896 --> 01:27:37,990
- Get real. You're getting a job.
- Ajob?

1075
01:27:41,736 --> 01:27:44,830
Hey, hey, hold on, hold on. Ajob?
I ain't worked in 5,000 years.

1076
01:27:44,906 --> 01:27:46,897
