1
00:00:33,811 --> 00:00:36,146
Release your presence in
the name of the Lord.

2
00:00:36,147 --> 00:00:38,682
Release your presence in
the name of the Lord.

3
00:00:38,683 --> 00:00:41,418
Release your presence in
the name of the Lord.

4
00:00:41,419 --> 00:00:43,621
Release your presence in
the name of the Lord.

5
00:01:01,006 --> 00:01:03,340
Release your presence in
the name of the Lord.

6
00:01:03,341 --> 00:01:05,643
Release your presence in
the name of the Lord.

7
00:01:05,644 --> 00:01:08,679
Release your presence in
the name of the Lord.

8
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,047
Release your presence in...

9
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:16,754
Shove that cross up your ass.

10
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:30,868
You're going to Hell, priest.

11
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,205
Release your presence in
the name of the Lord.

12
00:01:37,008 --> 00:01:39,243
Release your presence in
the name of the Lord.

13
00:01:39,244 --> 00:01:41,378
You're not welcome here.

14
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:43,180
Release your presence in
the name of the Lord.

15
00:01:43,882 --> 00:01:46,083
You're not welcome here!

16
00:01:57,027 --> 00:01:58,195
You're not welcome here.

17
00:01:58,196 --> 00:02:00,898
Release your presence in
the name of the Lord.

18
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:03,534
You're not welcome here!

19
00:02:03,535 --> 00:02:05,302
Release your presence in
the name of the Lord.

20
00:02:05,303 --> 00:02:09,106
She belongs to us, now.

21
00:02:09,107 --> 00:02:12,409
Release your presence in
the name of the Lord!

22
00:02:18,649 --> 00:02:20,717
Father, she is lost.

23
00:02:53,584 --> 00:02:56,953
Your God have no presence here.

24
00:04:04,888 --> 00:04:08,092
Release your presence in
the name of the Lord.

25
00:04:08,093 --> 00:04:10,728
Release your presence in
the name of the Lord.

26
00:05:20,598 --> 00:05:22,632
Father Connely?

27
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,268
Father?

28
00:05:26,837 --> 00:05:31,775
<i>â™ª Hallelujah</i>

29
00:07:43,407 --> 00:07:45,341
So I don't see a ring...

30
00:07:45,943 --> 00:07:50,346
any friends or
girlfriends, so, um...

31
00:07:54,084 --> 00:07:56,253
You wanna get outta here?

32
00:07:56,254 --> 00:07:58,654
Hell yeah.

33
00:08:43,201 --> 00:08:44,568
Go away.

34
00:08:44,569 --> 00:08:46,803
Clean in the morning.

35
00:08:46,804 --> 00:08:49,339
Rise and shine, Jason.

36
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,340
What the...

37
00:08:55,312 --> 00:08:57,646
What do you want, Diekmen?

38
00:09:00,217 --> 00:09:03,253
Thought I'd stop by and provide
you with a little support.

39
00:09:03,254 --> 00:09:06,056
I figured you'd need it
on a day like today.

40
00:09:06,057 --> 00:09:09,191
You really should count your
blessings, you know that?

41
00:09:10,661 --> 00:09:14,330
You've been allowed to
see yet another day.

42
00:09:20,237 --> 00:09:22,739
Maybe you didn't hear me earlier...

43
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,774
What do you want?

44
00:09:26,543 --> 00:09:28,944
We leave in a few hours.

45
00:09:39,356 --> 00:09:41,058
Will your lady friend
be joining us?

46
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:43,093
That's, uh... Julia.

47
00:09:43,094 --> 00:09:45,661
Nah, I don't think she will be.

48
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,432
Shall I wake her?

49
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:49,766
Nah.

50
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:54,438
I got an open door policy.

51
00:09:54,439 --> 00:09:56,306
She can let herself out.

52
00:09:56,307 --> 00:09:58,707
Ah, I see.

53
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:08,150
Shall we go then?

54
00:10:09,453 --> 00:10:11,153
After you.

55
00:10:19,096 --> 00:10:20,764
Eddie Bunkley...

56
00:10:20,765 --> 00:10:22,833
Do you understand why
I made the decision

57
00:10:22,834 --> 00:10:25,736
on whether or not to
accept your plea deal,

58
00:10:25,737 --> 00:10:27,938
and why it would be made public?

59
00:10:27,939 --> 00:10:29,006
Yes, your honor.

60
00:10:29,007 --> 00:10:33,610
Then you also understand that I
cannot ignore the D.A.'s excursion

61
00:10:33,611 --> 00:10:35,912
of your last stint as a free man?

62
00:10:35,913 --> 00:10:39,416
The man who entered prison ten years
ago was lost and without faith.

63
00:10:41,285 --> 00:10:43,186
Now that don't make
what I did right,

64
00:10:43,187 --> 00:10:45,387
but I am a better man, your honor.

65
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,425
Given the reports of
your good behavior

66
00:10:48,426 --> 00:10:51,361
and taking into consideration
the intel you provided

67
00:10:51,362 --> 00:10:54,865
through your co-operation
on a high profile case,

68
00:10:54,866 --> 00:10:59,703
it is the state and the court's
decision to grant you your release.

69
00:11:10,147 --> 00:11:11,480
Jason.

70
00:11:11,682 --> 00:11:13,350
Not now, old man.

71
00:11:13,351 --> 00:11:16,219
I've had enough of your
God's justice for one day.

72
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,055
Without forgiveness,
there can be no love.

73
00:11:18,056 --> 00:11:19,556
Can't you see that?

74
00:11:19,557 --> 00:11:21,024
You should feel proud
we live in a place

75
00:11:21,025 --> 00:11:24,194
where we don't hold
darkness in our hearts.

76
00:11:24,195 --> 00:11:26,296
What I see, Father, is that
you and people like you

77
00:11:26,297 --> 00:11:27,931
are no better than he is.

78
00:11:27,932 --> 00:11:29,966
that just got off for
killing my family,

79
00:11:29,967 --> 00:11:32,469
so don't tell me how I should feel.

80
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,037
I'm not a little kid anymore,
and Dad's not around

81
00:11:34,038 --> 00:11:37,072
to help force feed me
your religious bullshit.

82
00:11:38,542 --> 00:11:41,044
You must learn to forgive,

83
00:11:41,045 --> 00:11:44,179
or the darkness will
consume you from within.

84
00:11:45,515 --> 00:11:48,217
Father Connely is dead.

85
00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:55,459
I need you to come to the old
church where you grew up.

86
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,660
A lot has changed.

87
00:11:58,495 --> 00:12:02,131
I have something of your father's,
that he wanted you to have.

88
00:12:18,215 --> 00:12:21,451
I can't breathe when you hold
my head down like that, Roddy.

89
00:12:21,452 --> 00:12:23,253
Cindy...

90
00:12:23,254 --> 00:12:24,788
baby...

91
00:12:24,789 --> 00:12:27,090
I'm just trying to make
sure you do it right.

92
00:12:27,091 --> 00:12:28,958
That's all.

93
00:12:30,594 --> 00:12:33,295
You're so cute when you
think I'm mad at you.

94
00:13:26,017 --> 00:13:28,251
What the hell, Roddy?!

95
00:13:28,252 --> 00:13:29,586
- Well good grief, baby!
- That kinda hurt.

96
00:13:29,587 --> 00:13:31,121
Well good grief, baby!

97
00:13:31,122 --> 00:13:34,090
There's a dumb son of a bitch
in the middle of the road.

98
00:13:35,793 --> 00:13:38,995
Well, maybe he's sick or something.

99
00:13:40,997 --> 00:13:42,531
Hey, buddy!

100
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:45,567
Move your ass outta the road!

101
00:13:46,636 --> 00:13:47,838
Babe...

102
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,840
Just go around.

103
00:13:49,841 --> 00:13:51,274
Nah, I ain't gonna
stand for this shit.

104
00:13:51,275 --> 00:13:53,176
Hey!

105
00:13:53,177 --> 00:13:56,211
Move your ass outta the road!

106
00:14:04,322 --> 00:14:06,121
Hey... hey!

107
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,527
- Babe, what's going on?
- What are you doing?

108
00:14:45,228 --> 00:14:47,530
It's all a bit much, isn't it?

109
00:14:47,531 --> 00:14:51,368
Most churches have Bibles and
crucifixes, not swords and...

110
00:14:53,671 --> 00:14:55,337
okay.

111
00:14:59,342 --> 00:15:02,111
I see you remembered
how to get here.

112
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:06,249
It's not Sunday, so I'm
not missing any games.

113
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,084
Thought I'd come turn a
little water into wine.

114
00:15:10,921 --> 00:15:13,055
After you.

115
00:15:17,929 --> 00:15:22,098
The very basis of our belief stems
from the arrival of the Apostles,

116
00:15:22,099 --> 00:15:26,335
from such places as Jerusalem,
Africa, and even Asia.

117
00:15:27,404 --> 00:15:30,205
With the spread of Christianity
throughout the Roman Empire.

118
00:15:31,775 --> 00:15:36,446
Upon the turn of the second century,
the Papacy, as you know it today,

119
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,315
was constantly ever-changing.

120
00:15:38,316 --> 00:15:42,485
With one central point being
our Savior, Jesus Christ.

121
00:15:42,486 --> 00:15:44,888
You're killing me, man.

122
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:47,090
Upon the destruction of
the western Roman Empire,

123
00:15:47,091 --> 00:15:49,125
the church in the West
was a major factor

124
00:15:49,126 --> 00:15:51,094
in preserving classical
civilizations;

125
00:15:51,095 --> 00:15:53,330
establishing monasteries,
and sending missionaries

126
00:15:53,331 --> 00:15:55,497
to the people of far
northern Europe...

127
00:15:56,466 --> 00:15:58,734
as far as Ireland, in the North.

128
00:15:59,669 --> 00:16:01,870
So what exactly is your point?

129
00:16:02,739 --> 00:16:06,743
My point, Jason, is what
isn't written or taught

130
00:16:06,744 --> 00:16:10,480
is the existence of an
establishment, <i>Esorcistato,</i>

131
00:16:10,481 --> 00:16:12,849
which was created
during ancient times

132
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:16,619
to combat the dealings of
<i>Daemon Everto Possessio,</i>

133
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,390
or as you know it,
"demonic possessions."

134
00:16:20,391 --> 00:16:22,292
A rite formed,

135
00:16:22,293 --> 00:16:24,461
to monitor and perform exorcisms

136
00:16:24,462 --> 00:16:26,361
on the damned...

137
00:16:26,696 --> 00:16:29,565
known as The Cloth.

138
00:16:30,266 --> 00:16:32,669
"The Cloth."

139
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,437
So what you're telling me is
there's a group of old people

140
00:16:34,438 --> 00:16:38,540
out there wandering the globe, aimlessly
fighting a war with the devil?

141
00:16:41,311 --> 00:16:43,179
It's not as simple as that, but...

142
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,815
Basically, that's
what I'm saying, yes.

143
00:16:45,816 --> 00:16:47,916
Okay, wow.

144
00:16:48,518 --> 00:16:50,986
Diekmen, I knew you
were crazy, but this?

145
00:16:51,521 --> 00:16:53,622
This is a stretch, even for you.

146
00:16:54,657 --> 00:16:57,360
Spinning their heads,
spittin' up pea soup...

147
00:16:57,361 --> 00:16:59,529
<i>Ephpeta, quod est, adaperire.</i>

148
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:00,430
Be open.

149
00:17:27,724 --> 00:17:30,226
<i>Appropinquabit enim judicium dei.</i>

150
00:17:30,227 --> 00:17:31,694
What is this place?

151
00:17:31,695 --> 00:17:33,396
<i>Appropinquabit...</i>

152
00:17:33,397 --> 00:17:35,397
Jason, be still.

153
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,766
Don't move.

154
00:17:41,771 --> 00:17:43,672
<i>Pax tibi.</i>

155
00:17:45,475 --> 00:17:47,976
<i>Pax tibi.</i>

156
00:17:51,281 --> 00:17:53,915
It's alright, Jason.

157
00:17:55,185 --> 00:17:56,419
Her name is Nybass.

158
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,522
Mind your eyes!

159
00:17:59,523 --> 00:18:02,092
She's an amphonxious spiritous.

160
00:18:02,093 --> 00:18:03,392
What is it?

161
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:07,263
Two spirits, one body.

162
00:18:07,264 --> 00:18:08,964
One good...

163
00:18:09,966 --> 00:18:11,700
and one bad.

164
00:18:12,202 --> 00:18:14,036
Where'd she come from?

165
00:18:15,138 --> 00:18:17,005
Texas.

166
00:18:18,374 --> 00:18:22,545
What you see before you is
someone who is possessed,

167
00:18:22,546 --> 00:18:26,950
and in a rare case, found herself
battling within her own body.

168
00:18:26,951 --> 00:18:29,119
She managed to keep some
of her motor functions

169
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,722
and cognitive functions separate
from the demon within her.

170
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,059
Nybass...

171
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,964
I believe you know why I'm here.

172
00:18:44,901 --> 00:18:46,569
It is time.

173
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:49,172
You must begin the sacrament.

174
00:18:49,173 --> 00:18:53,241
The crossover has already begun.

175
00:18:57,413 --> 00:18:59,315
Beware, Father.

176
00:18:59,316 --> 00:19:02,118
Before the souls are gathered,

177
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:06,355
you will breathe your last breath.

178
00:19:15,598 --> 00:19:17,100
What the hell was that, back there?

179
00:19:17,101 --> 00:19:19,669
You guys just keep that thing
locked up underneath the church?

180
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,538
What's with the whole dead
animal/hand puncture...

181
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:24,941
I realize you must have
a lot of questions.

182
00:19:24,942 --> 00:19:26,442
Questions are for history lessons.

183
00:19:26,443 --> 00:19:28,311
All I need to know is the
next flight back home,

184
00:19:28,312 --> 00:19:29,846
because apparently there's
something going on here

185
00:19:29,847 --> 00:19:31,181
that I don't want to be a part of.

186
00:19:31,182 --> 00:19:35,150
Can you think of someone other
than yourself for a change?

187
00:19:35,718 --> 00:19:39,489
There is a lot more going on here
than you can begin to grasp, Jason.

188
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:43,693
There is a war coming, and we
don't have that much time.

189
00:19:43,694 --> 00:19:46,329
What do you mean?

190
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,665
I need to begin the sacrament.

191
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,300
So for the moment,

192
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:53,503
try and learn as much as you can
from Laurel, our gatekeeper.

193
00:19:53,504 --> 00:19:56,739
She's responsible for recording and
organizing all of our actions,

194
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,874
past and present.

195
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:04,045
Remain focused.
There is much to do.

196
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:11,521
The Apostles were more
than philosophers.

197
00:20:11,522 --> 00:20:14,891
The clergy, during the holy war,

198
00:20:14,892 --> 00:20:17,594
had to be well equipped
in order to deal with

199
00:20:17,595 --> 00:20:20,996
extreme cases of
demonic possession.

200
00:20:24,534 --> 00:20:28,571
You have to remember
that back in those days,

201
00:20:28,572 --> 00:20:33,608
any unexplainable event was met
with a religious explanation.

202
00:20:39,015 --> 00:20:41,017
Are you paying
attention, Mr. Pafford?

203
00:20:41,018 --> 00:20:42,452
Okay, wow.

204
00:20:42,453 --> 00:20:43,753
You used my government name.

205
00:20:43,754 --> 00:20:47,856
So, yeah...
Clergy, holy war, demons...

206
00:20:49,192 --> 00:20:52,462
So did you know they have an
amphibious double-inhabited thingy,

207
00:20:52,463 --> 00:20:54,663
girl, underneath the church?

208
00:20:56,132 --> 00:20:58,767
Is everything just a game to you?

209
00:21:01,471 --> 00:21:05,708
For the past few days, we've
had over 100 requests

210
00:21:05,709 --> 00:21:08,710
for paranormal assistance, alone.

211
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,548
Why do you think that is?

212
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:15,550
Uh, people are all crazy as hell?

213
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,788
Look, listen...

214
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:20,156
This is all new to me, okay?

215
00:21:20,157 --> 00:21:25,061
Just a few hours ago, I was watching
the man I hate most in this world

216
00:21:25,062 --> 00:21:27,395
get off for killing my family.

217
00:21:28,131 --> 00:21:30,098
Please, just...

218
00:21:34,337 --> 00:21:37,006
I'm sorry about your family.

219
00:21:37,007 --> 00:21:39,374
No, it's fine.

220
00:21:41,244 --> 00:21:44,212
So what do I need to know?

221
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:50,153
Kasdeya,

222
00:21:50,154 --> 00:21:53,656
the fifth Satan, according
to the Book of Enoch,

223
00:21:53,657 --> 00:21:56,125
which is found in the over 14 books

224
00:21:56,126 --> 00:21:59,329
of the Apocrypha, and omitted
from the final version

225
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:01,096
you've come to know.

226
00:22:01,831 --> 00:22:04,967
Kasdeya appears in human form,

227
00:22:04,968 --> 00:22:07,937
as the gateway key to pave
the way for the arrival

228
00:22:07,938 --> 00:22:09,772
of Beelzebub himself.

229
00:22:10,941 --> 00:22:13,109
According to the records,

230
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:17,013
he was once responsible
for tempting men

231
00:22:17,014 --> 00:22:20,616
into turning their
backs against God,

232
00:22:20,617 --> 00:22:23,619
and then bringing them
forward for judgment.

233
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:27,824
The Cloth's main objective
is to seek and destroy

234
00:22:27,825 --> 00:22:31,694
those that would do harm to
the balance of good and evil

235
00:22:31,695 --> 00:22:33,396
from within...

236
00:22:33,397 --> 00:22:39,202
the only place a battle can
truly be waged amongst men.

237
00:22:39,203 --> 00:22:42,038
Nybass provides us
with the locations

238
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:44,374
of all paranormal insights
and demon leaders

239
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:46,376
that may have entered our realm.

240
00:22:46,377 --> 00:22:50,079
Before her, we relied
upon word of mouth,

241
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,149
and it limited our effectiveness.

242
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:56,486
Her insights guide us
from location to location

243
00:22:56,487 --> 00:22:58,687
as we attempt to enforce the pact.

244
00:22:59,422 --> 00:23:02,024
Once a person has become possessed,

245
00:23:02,025 --> 00:23:05,961
their soul no longer
exists in this realm.

246
00:23:13,903 --> 00:23:15,905
Once Kasdeya arrives,

247
00:23:15,906 --> 00:23:20,543
he has seven days before he
must return to his realm.

248
00:23:20,544 --> 00:23:26,681
It is very important that he doesn't
take any lost souls with him.

249
00:23:31,354 --> 00:23:34,389
<i>Ephpheta, quod est, adaperire.</i>

250
00:23:35,591 --> 00:23:37,258
Be open.

251
00:23:38,227 --> 00:23:42,198
Credis in jesum christum
filium <i>eju unicum,</i>

252
00:23:42,199 --> 00:23:45,368
<i>dominum nostrum, natum et pasum?</i>

253
00:23:45,369 --> 00:23:46,869
I believe.

254
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:49,104
<i>Pax tibi.</i>

255
00:23:53,142 --> 00:23:55,777
Where do we stand
on the boy, Father?

256
00:23:57,313 --> 00:24:00,149
Father Tollman, I
have come to ask you

257
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:02,285
for permission to
begin the sacrament.

258
00:24:02,286 --> 00:24:05,186
The sacrament takes years
of dedication and devotion.

259
00:24:06,289 --> 00:24:08,558
It's not something to be expedited.

260
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,659
Your concerns are noted.

261
00:24:11,894 --> 00:24:16,332
Father Diekmen, are you
certain he is the one?

262
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:18,600
We have other worthy candidates...

263
00:24:19,802 --> 00:24:22,537
all of whom are
strong in the faith.

264
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,476
I understand your reluctance,

265
00:24:26,477 --> 00:24:29,579
but I knew his father,
and he believed in me.

266
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:33,316
And I see the same devotion,
deep down inside of him.

267
00:24:33,317 --> 00:24:36,185
He's survived this
long without our help.

268
00:24:36,186 --> 00:24:38,421
Imagine if he realizes
his full potential.

269
00:24:38,422 --> 00:24:39,489
Hm.

270
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:44,794
There have been an increase in
activity over the past few days.

271
00:24:44,795 --> 00:24:48,197
We have reason to believe
Kasdeya has arrived.

272
00:24:48,198 --> 00:24:50,198
Then we don't have much time.

273
00:24:50,833 --> 00:24:53,234
Stopping Kasdeya is
our top priority.

274
00:24:53,936 --> 00:24:56,606
You only have seven days.

275
00:24:56,607 --> 00:24:57,772
<i>Pax tibi.</i>

276
00:24:58,107 --> 00:24:59,574
<i>Pax tibi.</i>

277
00:25:01,511 --> 00:25:05,613
So, basically you're using a form
of prayer to keep Nybass contained.

278
00:25:06,983 --> 00:25:12,154
Nybass is very imperative
to the operation.

279
00:25:12,155 --> 00:25:14,622
To gain that much insight...

280
00:25:15,858 --> 00:25:20,061
has enhance our understanding
into the demonic realm.

281
00:25:25,835 --> 00:25:27,936
You ever get away from this place?

282
00:25:36,546 --> 00:25:40,582
My beliefs come before
my own personal desires.

283
00:25:41,584 --> 00:25:42,951
In short...

284
00:25:45,821 --> 00:25:48,323
I'm here for God.

285
00:25:49,225 --> 00:25:51,459
That explains it.

286
00:25:53,229 --> 00:25:54,863
What, exactly?

287
00:25:55,565 --> 00:25:57,699
Why you're so uptight.

288
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:04,240
You gotta get out, live a little.

289
00:26:04,241 --> 00:26:07,342
All this demonic talk could
drive a person crazy, you know?

290
00:26:08,744 --> 00:26:11,180
Look, I say we grab a drink later..

291
00:26:11,181 --> 00:26:12,947
Mr. Pafford...

292
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:18,119
We are all here on our
own personal journey.

293
00:26:19,689 --> 00:26:22,124
But more importantly,

294
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:27,796
we are here for something
bigger than our own ideals.

295
00:26:29,231 --> 00:26:31,666
Then you're more of a prisoner
than Nybass will ever be.

296
00:26:32,602 --> 00:26:34,236
What's the point in all this
'saving the world' talk

297
00:26:34,237 --> 00:26:36,471
if you can't even feel alive in it?

298
00:26:38,074 --> 00:26:40,842
Everyone dies, Laurel.

299
00:26:41,777 --> 00:26:44,245
Not everyone lives.

300
00:26:49,619 --> 00:26:51,252
Jason.

301
00:26:56,792 --> 00:26:58,693
It is time.

302
00:27:04,467 --> 00:27:06,201
What is it?

303
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:09,938
This belonged to your father.

304
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,681
It's time you met Helix.

305
00:27:38,402 --> 00:27:43,272
Looks like you need to take those
things back to the drawing board.

306
00:27:43,273 --> 00:27:45,773
The power of God is
strong, my friend.

307
00:27:54,183 --> 00:27:55,950
Very strong.

308
00:27:59,288 --> 00:28:01,890
I call this one "The Judge."

309
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:04,960
Helix is our weapons specialist.

310
00:28:04,961 --> 00:28:07,929
And quality control for
the communion wine.

311
00:28:08,831 --> 00:28:11,566
You must be Jason.

312
00:28:14,303 --> 00:28:16,806
Helix, we don't have much time.

313
00:28:16,807 --> 00:28:18,974
The sacrament has already begun.

314
00:28:18,975 --> 00:28:21,175
What, this early?

315
00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:26,481
But... he doesn't look like he
could take Laurel in a fight.

316
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:29,851
No offense.

317
00:28:32,755 --> 00:28:34,557
Why wasn't I told?

318
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:36,492
How come I'm always
the last one to know

319
00:28:36,493 --> 00:28:39,829
about anything that
goes on around here?

320
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,731
Nice robe, by the way, Laurel.

321
00:28:41,732 --> 00:28:43,432
It looks fantastic.

322
00:28:43,433 --> 00:28:46,000
You need to give
him a crash course.

323
00:28:50,172 --> 00:28:51,839
Crash course.

324
00:28:53,109 --> 00:28:54,442
Hm.

325
00:28:54,577 --> 00:28:55,843
Okay.

326
00:28:55,945 --> 00:28:59,213
Somebody slap me with
the devil's nut sack.

327
00:29:00,216 --> 00:29:03,052
You think I can just sum up
everything there is to know

328
00:29:03,053 --> 00:29:06,187
about what we do here
in a couple of hours?

329
00:29:07,223 --> 00:29:09,157
Yes.

330
00:29:13,629 --> 00:29:15,964
I'll see what I can do.

331
00:29:19,602 --> 00:29:21,203
Your armor...

332
00:29:21,204 --> 00:29:24,106
is said to have been blessed
by the Seven Archangels,

333
00:29:24,107 --> 00:29:26,609
and passed down to Pope
Saint Gregory the First.

334
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:30,045
It's essential in dealing
with otherworldly figures.

335
00:29:30,046 --> 00:29:32,915
All the metal we use in
our weaponry and armor

336
00:29:32,916 --> 00:29:36,484
was found inside the
Ark of the Covenant.

337
00:29:37,953 --> 00:29:41,656
You still talking about
this Friar Tuck outfit?

338
00:29:49,632 --> 00:29:52,635
The bullets burst
into projectile form.

339
00:29:52,636 --> 00:29:55,304
And the combustion chamber
consists of holy water

340
00:29:55,305 --> 00:29:59,508
and a fusion liquid that's been
manufactured beneath the church,

341
00:29:59,509 --> 00:30:01,277
which is why we're located here.

342
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:02,178
Isn't it, Dieks?

343
00:30:02,179 --> 00:30:05,481
Why else am I never
allowed out of this...

344
00:30:05,482 --> 00:30:08,016
urban paradise?

345
00:30:08,851 --> 00:30:14,356
Your armor doesn't allow for friendly
fire, which is lucky, because

346
00:30:14,357 --> 00:30:17,326
Diekmen's a terrible shot.

347
00:30:20,796 --> 00:30:23,833
It's also why you're not
an ashy pile of goo

348
00:30:23,834 --> 00:30:25,835
and how you'll be able to
defend yourself from...

349
00:30:25,836 --> 00:30:29,271
any attack from a demonic creature
that's dwelling in our realm.

350
00:30:29,272 --> 00:30:31,540
While they might have
certain abilities...

351
00:30:32,809 --> 00:30:36,378
telekinesis, superior strength...

352
00:30:36,379 --> 00:30:37,713
there are limits.

353
00:30:37,714 --> 00:30:41,183
It's a consequence of
their human counterparts.

354
00:30:41,184 --> 00:30:43,819
Even Kasdeya has weaknesses.

355
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,554
Your job is to find them.

356
00:30:46,389 --> 00:30:48,589
Exploit them.

357
00:30:52,495 --> 00:30:53,661
Gabriel...

358
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,732
one of my personal favorites,

359
00:30:56,733 --> 00:30:57,867
is used on more...

360
00:30:57,868 --> 00:31:00,135
ethereal creatures.

361
00:31:00,136 --> 00:31:01,537
The Uriel...

362
00:31:01,538 --> 00:31:03,839
is effective at close range.

363
00:31:12,581 --> 00:31:15,251
The choice of weapon
will depend upon

364
00:31:15,252 --> 00:31:18,587
the level of demon that
possesses your victim.

365
00:31:22,524 --> 00:31:23,592
Uh..

366
00:31:23,593 --> 00:31:26,495
Your bloodline will
allow you to wield

367
00:31:26,496 --> 00:31:29,031
certain weapons that we're
no longer able to operate,

368
00:31:29,032 --> 00:31:32,700
due the recent
passing of... your....

369
00:31:34,169 --> 00:31:35,603
Um.

370
00:31:41,176 --> 00:31:43,811
Yeah, well...

371
00:31:45,247 --> 00:31:48,417
Holy water and crosses are
still the essential tools.

372
00:31:48,418 --> 00:31:49,752
Let's not forget the basics.

373
00:31:49,753 --> 00:31:50,953
Wouldn't dream of it.

374
00:31:50,954 --> 00:31:52,354
But, never forget...

375
00:31:52,355 --> 00:31:55,958
ye who wields the mightiest weapon.

376
00:32:08,437 --> 00:32:11,339
Those little babies are
called holy grenades.

377
00:32:15,711 --> 00:32:16,912
Yeah...

378
00:32:16,913 --> 00:32:18,447
Well...

379
00:32:18,448 --> 00:32:20,749
holy water explodes
on impact, so...

380
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,884
be careful with those.

381
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,588
Got a lot of other weapons that...

382
00:32:26,589 --> 00:32:29,591
Well, they're not what
you'd call functional.

383
00:32:29,592 --> 00:32:31,425
But they are street ready.

384
00:32:31,894 --> 00:32:34,862
Unfortunately, Dick-men...

385
00:32:36,966 --> 00:32:39,700
won't let me show them to you.

386
00:32:40,769 --> 00:32:42,203
Helix...

387
00:32:42,805 --> 00:32:46,073
you're meant to aid our members...

388
00:32:47,242 --> 00:32:49,110
not injure them.

389
00:32:50,012 --> 00:32:51,347
I'm afraid she's right.

390
00:32:51,348 --> 00:32:52,980
We need to stick to the basics.

391
00:32:54,116 --> 00:32:57,084
- I'll just take that bad boy right there...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

392
00:32:58,687 --> 00:33:00,588
That's not for you.

393
00:33:03,492 --> 00:33:05,626
Then what do I get?

394
00:33:07,796 --> 00:33:09,564
Here you go.

395
00:33:13,769 --> 00:33:16,270
What am I supposed to do with this?

396
00:33:17,673 --> 00:33:19,774
You'll figure it out.

397
00:33:22,711 --> 00:33:24,213
If I pull this out on a demon,

398
00:33:24,214 --> 00:33:27,016
he's gonna think I'm
disrespecting him.

399
00:33:27,017 --> 00:33:30,119
This damn little thing is
gonna break in my pocket.

400
00:33:48,171 --> 00:33:49,538
Roxy.

401
00:33:49,539 --> 00:33:51,473
Hmm.

402
00:33:51,474 --> 00:33:54,343
What are you doing out
there by yourself?

403
00:33:54,344 --> 00:33:57,144
I'm waiting for you.

404
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:28,210
Mmm.

405
00:34:28,211 --> 00:34:30,511
You want some goodies?

406
00:35:58,767 --> 00:36:02,971
Mmm, it's getting
really hot in here.

407
00:36:43,178 --> 00:36:45,846
Something isn't right here.

408
00:38:20,742 --> 00:38:24,780
Fear not, for the wrath
of God is merciful...

409
00:38:24,781 --> 00:38:25,947
Tell me your name.

410
00:38:25,948 --> 00:38:29,751
but the wrath of sin is vengeful.

411
00:38:29,752 --> 00:38:31,486
Vengeance is God's.

412
00:38:31,487 --> 00:38:34,790
Kasdeya has come for your souls.

413
00:38:34,791 --> 00:38:37,926
<i>Exorcizo te, omnis
spiritus immunde,</i>

414
00:38:37,927 --> 00:38:40,294
<i>in nomine dei patris omnipotentis...</i>

415
00:38:42,965 --> 00:38:45,199
You okay?

416
00:38:55,177 --> 00:38:57,144
Jason, go!

417
00:39:17,065 --> 00:39:22,037
Next time, can I have more than a cross
before you send me into a gunfight?

418
00:39:22,038 --> 00:39:25,272
Well, you needed to
learn something.

419
00:39:32,714 --> 00:39:35,416
There's gotta be something missing.

420
00:39:36,151 --> 00:39:38,352
Corinthians...

421
00:39:42,591 --> 00:39:45,192
Letters to Paul...

422
00:39:46,328 --> 00:39:48,930
At the dawn of every
era, man must prove

423
00:39:48,931 --> 00:39:51,032
it is worthy of God's forgiveness.

424
00:39:51,033 --> 00:39:54,936
Beelzebub will need a
half-breed sacrifice

425
00:39:54,937 --> 00:39:58,138
in order to remain, permanently.

426
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:06,615
I am the way.

427
00:40:06,616 --> 00:40:09,149
You are the way.

428
00:40:12,621 --> 00:40:14,189
Oh, I didn't mean to scare you.

429
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,389
That's fine.

430
00:40:16,024 --> 00:40:18,859
I see you're reading
the Book of Sage.

431
00:40:21,363 --> 00:40:26,101
You know, you're as beautiful as
the day you were brought to us.

432
00:40:26,102 --> 00:40:28,637
If there's ever anything
that I can do for you,

433
00:40:28,638 --> 00:40:32,974
or that we can talk about,
please, please don't hesitate.

434
00:40:32,975 --> 00:40:34,776
I need to speak to Father Diekmen,

435
00:40:34,777 --> 00:40:37,478
- so, if you'll excuse me.
- Certainly.

436
00:40:40,115 --> 00:40:41,982
Laurel...

437
00:40:44,152 --> 00:40:49,256
Please do give the good Father
and his new prodigy all my best.

438
00:40:56,631 --> 00:40:59,000
Vanity's a sin. You do know that?

439
00:40:59,001 --> 00:41:01,503
What isn't a sin, Diekmen?

440
00:41:01,504 --> 00:41:04,104
I'm just making sure I look good.

441
00:41:05,974 --> 00:41:07,541
What's that?

442
00:41:08,743 --> 00:41:10,779
This isn't making any sense.

443
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:13,081
I've been telling you that
since the beginning, Dieks.

444
00:41:13,082 --> 00:41:18,086
According to the scrolls, Kasdeya
isn't the only gatekeeper.

445
00:41:18,087 --> 00:41:19,621
What does that mean?

446
00:41:19,622 --> 00:41:21,156
It means that...

447
00:41:21,157 --> 00:41:23,524
There's something
else at play here.

448
00:41:24,826 --> 00:41:26,527
I think we're here.

449
00:41:32,667 --> 00:41:33,835
Hey.

450
00:41:33,836 --> 00:41:36,137
Aren't you forgetting something?

451
00:41:36,138 --> 00:41:38,540
Come on, I still
don't have a weapon.

452
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:39,641
Oh...

453
00:41:39,642 --> 00:41:40,774
Right.

454
00:41:41,176 --> 00:41:43,143
Here you go.

455
00:41:44,679 --> 00:41:45,614
Hey...

456
00:41:45,615 --> 00:41:47,281
Why is yours bigger?

457
00:41:56,191 --> 00:41:57,658
Don't move.

458
00:41:59,194 --> 00:42:00,594
Lewis...

459
00:42:00,996 --> 00:42:02,496
Yeah.

460
00:42:02,998 --> 00:42:05,466
And who the hell are you?

461
00:42:06,134 --> 00:42:08,268
I'm Father Diekmen.

462
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:11,605
And this is my associate.

463
00:42:13,575 --> 00:42:16,176
I believe you know why we are here.

464
00:42:20,382 --> 00:42:22,316
You can't have her.

465
00:42:25,987 --> 00:42:31,159
Lewis, I don't have to tell you,
if you don't let us do our job,

466
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,227
the consequences...

467
00:42:32,228 --> 00:42:34,762
The hell with your consequences!

468
00:42:37,265 --> 00:42:39,366
That's my daughter.

469
00:42:54,583 --> 00:42:56,150
Diekmen.

470
00:44:04,285 --> 00:44:07,922
<i>Vade in pace, et dominus sit tecum.</i>

471
00:44:09,458 --> 00:44:12,494
<i>Vade in pace, et dominus sit tecum.</i>

472
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:15,764
Why are you here?

473
00:44:20,969 --> 00:44:23,237
Where is Kasdeya?

474
00:44:28,643 --> 00:44:30,544
Speak some more shit!

475
00:44:31,112 --> 00:44:34,349
<i>Exorcizo te, omnis
spiritus immunde...</i>

476
00:44:35,484 --> 00:44:37,786
<i>in nomine dei patris
omnipotentis...</i>

477
00:44:37,787 --> 00:44:43,024
<i>et in noimine jesu
christi filii ejus...</i>

478
00:44:47,162 --> 00:44:49,496
I am done.

479
00:44:51,499 --> 00:44:54,968
Well, that must have been
an awkward car ride home.

480
00:44:56,204 --> 00:44:58,640
Don't let it get to you, Jason.

481
00:44:58,641 --> 00:45:01,576
There's a lot more we
need to accomplish.

482
00:45:02,378 --> 00:45:04,145
What's going on?

483
00:45:04,146 --> 00:45:05,747
What's going on is,
I spent the last few days

484
00:45:05,748 --> 00:45:09,751
getting thrown into walls and
spit on by the devil's minions.

485
00:45:09,752 --> 00:45:12,887
What's going on is,
I don't belong here.

486
00:45:12,888 --> 00:45:16,224
This is what your
father wanted, I know.

487
00:45:16,225 --> 00:45:18,158
Well, he's not here, is he?

488
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,261
Did I miss something?

489
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:26,367
Your father believed in something
a lot bigger than himself.

490
00:45:26,368 --> 00:45:30,003
He did everything he could to
protect you and his family.

491
00:45:31,406 --> 00:45:37,144
If we don't stop Kasdeya now,
everything he fought for will be lost.

492
00:45:40,381 --> 00:45:44,919
And I have found an interesting
wrinkle in the prophecy.

493
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,087
Good luck with that.

494
00:45:53,561 --> 00:45:58,066
Okay, could somebody tell
me what just happened?

495
00:45:58,067 --> 00:46:00,802
Who throws Jesus on
a table like that?

496
00:46:00,803 --> 00:46:01,936
Come on!

497
00:46:07,408 --> 00:46:08,542
Father...

498
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:10,677
Rosa.

499
00:46:11,546 --> 00:46:14,315
We will pray for your family, but
our hands are tied at the moment.

500
00:46:14,316 --> 00:46:15,583
Is there anything you can do?

501
00:46:15,584 --> 00:46:18,652
You promised that if I
paid, someone would come.

502
00:46:19,721 --> 00:46:23,023
You gotta understand how
small your contribution was.

503
00:46:24,092 --> 00:46:26,761
Look, I'll talk to Father
Tollman, see what...

504
00:46:26,762 --> 00:46:27,495
if, something can be done.

505
00:46:27,496 --> 00:46:30,732
- Oh, Father, please.
- I've gotta get to confession.

506
00:46:30,733 --> 00:46:31,900
I gotta go to confession.

507
00:46:31,901 --> 00:46:33,166
No, Father...

508
00:46:45,013 --> 00:46:47,014
Forgive me, Father...

509
00:46:47,849 --> 00:46:49,716
I have sinned.

510
00:46:50,985 --> 00:46:52,587
Well the Lord is ready
to forgive you,

511
00:46:52,588 --> 00:46:53,855
if you are seeking forgiveness.

512
00:46:53,856 --> 00:46:56,157
But you must be willing to change.

513
00:46:57,259 --> 00:46:59,559
I fear that I can't, Father.

514
00:47:00,361 --> 00:47:02,896
I fear that I won't stop...

515
00:47:04,699 --> 00:47:07,901
until I have eliminated The Cloth.

516
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:11,438
Kasdeya...

517
00:47:14,209 --> 00:47:16,177
This is a violation of the pact.

518
00:47:19,515 --> 00:47:22,283
They say it's the root of all evil.

519
00:47:24,286 --> 00:47:27,587
I hope he is more merciful...

520
00:47:28,223 --> 00:47:29,457
than I am.

521
00:47:49,377 --> 00:47:51,678
Come on, Julia.

522
00:47:52,747 --> 00:47:55,683
Doesn't anyone take
"no" for an answer?

523
00:48:01,656 --> 00:48:05,226
Julia, sweetie, I know I
said to let yourself in, but

524
00:48:05,227 --> 00:48:07,527
this is a bit much.

525
00:48:21,109 --> 00:48:23,611
You know, I don't really
know how to say this, but

526
00:48:23,612 --> 00:48:26,546
I don't really see us
working out, you know?

527
00:48:27,448 --> 00:48:30,752
I mean, you're a nice
girl and all, but...

528
00:48:30,753 --> 00:48:33,487
I'm just not looking
for anything serious.

529
00:48:53,908 --> 00:48:59,212
I... will show you...
his true nature.

530
00:49:00,982 --> 00:49:05,085
Do you think you know what
it means to serve him?

531
00:49:06,955 --> 00:49:13,727
I will show you the
true desires of a man.

532
00:49:18,933 --> 00:49:21,902
The darkness will consume you!

533
00:49:26,941 --> 00:49:28,810
<i>Ephpheta, quod est, adaperire.</i>

534
00:49:33,681 --> 00:49:37,551
Mortal, you have nothing
that can harm me.

535
00:49:44,092 --> 00:49:46,626
Consider it your last.

536
00:49:50,298 --> 00:49:52,667
Prepare to meet your master.

537
00:50:01,276 --> 00:50:02,876
That's holy water.

538
00:50:05,013 --> 00:50:06,780
Bitch.

539
00:50:27,068 --> 00:50:28,536
Laurel.

540
00:50:28,537 --> 00:50:30,270
Hi.

541
00:50:31,005 --> 00:50:34,174
I got your address from
Father Diekmen's log.

542
00:50:35,209 --> 00:50:37,478
In regular clothes, no less.

543
00:50:37,479 --> 00:50:40,113
I mean, I didn't know you could.

544
00:50:41,049 --> 00:50:44,585
Well, I'm a historian, not a nun.

545
00:50:44,586 --> 00:50:47,922
I'm free to dress
accordingly to occasion.

546
00:50:47,923 --> 00:50:50,657
Well, you look human,
so that's a good thing.

547
00:50:51,692 --> 00:50:53,326
Thank you.

548
00:50:54,262 --> 00:50:56,164
What's that smell?

549
00:50:56,165 --> 00:50:58,865
- It smells like sulfur.
- Come on in.

550
00:51:02,103 --> 00:51:04,539
What happened here?

551
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:09,510
I had an ex-girlfriend drop by, and
we had a little confrontation.

552
00:51:09,511 --> 00:51:11,579
I wanted drapes, she wanted blinds,

553
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:14,515
but I think she really
just wanted my soul.

554
00:51:14,516 --> 00:51:17,717
Must be some soul.

555
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:20,555
Trouble's been following
me my whole life,

556
00:51:20,556 --> 00:51:23,490
I don't really expect relationships
to be any different.

557
00:51:25,026 --> 00:51:27,560
Do you want a drink?

558
00:51:28,096 --> 00:51:30,364
Did your girlfriend write these?

559
00:51:30,365 --> 00:51:31,766
Ex!

560
00:51:31,767 --> 00:51:34,668
I told you, I like to
keep my options open

561
00:51:36,304 --> 00:51:40,907
There are more layers to
the context of man...

562
00:51:41,642 --> 00:51:45,446
And so are there to
the context of evil.

563
00:51:45,447 --> 00:51:47,548
I am the way.

564
00:51:47,549 --> 00:51:49,349
You are the way.

565
00:51:49,951 --> 00:51:52,053
I mean, I saw these
same exact markings

566
00:51:52,054 --> 00:51:54,421
from my readings from earlier.

567
00:51:56,224 --> 00:51:57,757
What do you mean?

568
00:51:58,292 --> 00:52:00,461
It means...

569
00:52:00,462 --> 00:52:04,932
that Kasdeya is only one piece...

570
00:52:04,933 --> 00:52:06,599
of the puzzle.

571
00:52:07,235 --> 00:52:08,835
It means that...

572
00:52:09,303 --> 00:52:11,439
Beelzebub...

573
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,108
isn't just trying
to walk amongst us.

574
00:52:17,011 --> 00:52:19,746
He's trying to bring
his hell with him.

575
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:24,452
So I just started doing
everything I could

576
00:52:24,453 --> 00:52:27,921
to dispel any rumor I was
my father's son, you know?

577
00:52:29,423 --> 00:52:33,027
It seems like he wanted
what was best for you.

578
00:52:33,028 --> 00:52:34,095
Yeah, well...

579
00:52:34,096 --> 00:52:37,864
I think he blamed me for my
mother's death in child birth.

580
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:43,538
Somehow feeding me all that religious B.S.
was just a way to atone for that guilt.

581
00:52:43,539 --> 00:52:45,405
That's what I believe.

582
00:52:48,543 --> 00:52:51,112
Tell me about the accident.

583
00:52:54,982 --> 00:52:58,719
I'd just done a stint in juvie
when my old man picked me up.

584
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,355
It was rainy, and the
roads were slick.

585
00:53:01,356 --> 00:53:02,690
I remember saying so to my dad,

586
00:53:02,691 --> 00:53:04,992
who was preaching to me about
how God had provided me

587
00:53:04,993 --> 00:53:10,398
all the tools I needed, and I
needed to stop wasting my gifts.

588
00:53:10,399 --> 00:53:14,735
Eddie had just lost his job and
then his kids in a divorce.

589
00:53:14,736 --> 00:53:16,470
He decided to go out drinking.

590
00:53:16,471 --> 00:53:17,838
One thing led to another.

591
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:19,674
He lost control of
his wheel, and...

592
00:53:28,849 --> 00:53:31,985
People were yelling at the
sight of all the blood.

593
00:53:33,321 --> 00:53:34,655
I remember looking up,

594
00:53:34,656 --> 00:53:38,192
and seeing everything burning
up around me; all the chaos.

595
00:53:38,193 --> 00:53:40,728
I looked over at my dad.

596
00:53:40,729 --> 00:53:42,829
He wasn't afraid at all.

597
00:53:47,401 --> 00:53:48,336
Here it was, you know?

598
00:53:48,337 --> 00:53:50,238
That moment people talk about.

599
00:53:50,239 --> 00:53:53,074
What would you say if you had to make
amends for a failed relationship?

600
00:53:53,075 --> 00:53:55,243
What would you say
with your last breath?

601
00:53:55,244 --> 00:53:57,878
Like, this was our moment.

602
00:53:57,879 --> 00:54:00,180
You wanna know what he said to me?

603
00:54:01,616 --> 00:54:04,252
He looked me straight
in the eye and said,

604
00:54:04,253 --> 00:54:07,720
"Be open." That's it.

605
00:54:10,291 --> 00:54:15,229
I can't begin to understand your
relationship with your father.

606
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:21,602
But I do know that he devoted
his life to our cause.

607
00:54:21,603 --> 00:54:23,070
Lot of good his work did.

608
00:54:23,071 --> 00:54:25,371
World's gonna end, anyway.

609
00:54:26,574 --> 00:54:32,178
Everyone dies, Jason,
but not everyone lives.

610
00:54:33,314 --> 00:54:36,583
Look, Father Diekmen needs you.

611
00:54:37,451 --> 00:54:42,056
Father Dean was attacked by
Kasdeya in his church up north.

612
00:54:42,057 --> 00:54:44,492
- How's that possible?
- I don't know.

613
00:54:44,493 --> 00:54:48,996
But I'm not naive enough to believe
that everyone is playing by the rules.

614
00:54:48,997 --> 00:54:51,399
Father Dean was rumored
to be taking bribes

615
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:56,170
in exchange for assistance in
dealing with the paranormal.

616
00:54:56,171 --> 00:54:58,406
Corruption in the church?
Go figure.

617
00:54:58,407 --> 00:55:02,108
There's no such thing as
corruption in the church, Jason.

618
00:55:03,311 --> 00:55:07,547
The only church that has
ever existed lies within.

619
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:12,719
Father Dean was found
with over 3,000 coins...

620
00:55:13,621 --> 00:55:18,159
lodged in his digestive
system and main arteries.

621
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:21,928
Sounds like maybe Kasdeya's
not such a bad guy after all.

622
00:55:24,031 --> 00:55:26,600
Hell is coming to Earth.

623
00:55:26,601 --> 00:55:30,438
And you're too busy living
in your own to even notice.

624
00:55:30,439 --> 00:55:31,972
I don't even know why I thought

625
00:55:31,973 --> 00:55:34,974
that coming here would
make a difference.

626
00:55:40,481 --> 00:55:44,318
And you can't forgive
Eddie because deep down,

627
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:47,754
you were the one
driving that truck.

628
00:55:50,725 --> 00:55:52,126
I thought you needed my help.

629
00:55:52,127 --> 00:55:54,260
We'll do it without you.

630
00:55:54,729 --> 00:55:57,365
What happened to being open?

631
00:56:30,064 --> 00:56:32,532
232 South Pike Boulevard.

632
00:56:35,536 --> 00:56:37,270
Eddie?

633
00:56:42,576 --> 00:56:44,210
Eddie?

634
00:56:45,012 --> 00:56:47,814
Look, I don't mean to
intrude, the door was open.

635
00:56:48,849 --> 00:56:50,618
Well, I just wanted to come
down here and tell you

636
00:56:50,619 --> 00:56:52,686
I've been doing a lot of
thinking about what happened.

637
00:56:52,687 --> 00:56:54,622
And, you know, I went
down to the courthouse

638
00:56:54,623 --> 00:56:57,458
and got your address, so I just
wanted to tell you officially that...

639
00:56:59,294 --> 00:57:01,394
Eddie?

640
00:57:04,031 --> 00:57:06,532
Oh, you gotta be shitting me!

641
00:57:09,537 --> 00:57:11,572
How was the house call?

642
00:57:11,573 --> 00:57:13,107
It was hell.

643
00:57:13,108 --> 00:57:15,742
Where do we stand?

644
00:57:18,279 --> 00:57:20,314
We have Kasdeya's location.

645
00:57:20,315 --> 00:57:23,384
He's being held up in a
spot called Dante's.

646
00:57:23,385 --> 00:57:25,820
And that's not the best part.

647
00:57:25,821 --> 00:57:28,322
Apparently tonight
is a special night.

648
00:57:28,323 --> 00:57:30,558
And not just because
ladies get in for free,

649
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:33,526
but because... it's the last day.

650
00:57:34,562 --> 00:57:36,664
If he's in a stationary
position like this,

651
00:57:36,665 --> 00:57:38,999
we believe he may have
all the souls he needs

652
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,802
to have Beelzebub pass over.

653
00:57:41,803 --> 00:57:43,737
Which means it's up
to us to stop him.

654
00:57:43,738 --> 00:57:46,172
Gear's on the table.

655
00:57:49,276 --> 00:57:52,613
Your father had the same
look of determination.

656
00:57:52,614 --> 00:57:54,847
The same fire.

657
00:57:57,818 --> 00:58:00,787
I remember the last
time I saw his face.

658
00:58:02,022 --> 00:58:05,159
He was holding a possessed
girl in his clutches,

659
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:08,462
not wanting to turn her
over to the order.

660
00:58:08,463 --> 00:58:10,931
Why didn't he want to give her up?

661
00:58:10,932 --> 00:58:14,502
Your father had the ability
to see the good in everyone.

662
00:58:14,503 --> 00:58:16,736
And on that day...

663
00:58:18,439 --> 00:58:21,708
he saw the good in Laurel.

664
00:58:24,044 --> 00:58:29,216
Father Tollman had never seen anyone
recover from such a strong possession,

665
00:58:29,217 --> 00:58:32,819
and he deemed it necessary
to terminate the child.

666
00:58:34,355 --> 00:58:36,323
But your father felt otherwise.

667
00:58:36,324 --> 00:58:39,660
As I lay there in his arms,

668
00:58:39,661 --> 00:58:43,030
my mind and soul being torn

669
00:58:43,031 --> 00:58:46,834
into two separate identities,

670
00:58:46,835 --> 00:58:48,903
he looked at me and said,

671
00:58:48,904 --> 00:58:52,172
the battle between good and evil

672
00:58:52,173 --> 00:58:56,843
will be won in the only place
it has ever been waged...

673
00:58:58,412 --> 00:58:59,846
from within.

674
00:59:03,384 --> 00:59:07,286
<i>Ephpheta, quod est, adaperire.</i>

675
00:59:09,757 --> 00:59:11,691
Be open.

676
00:59:14,094 --> 00:59:16,397
As much as I hate to be the
one to break up this...

677
00:59:16,398 --> 00:59:18,065
tender moment,

678
00:59:18,066 --> 00:59:22,603
you've got until the stroke of
midnight, or the crossover begins.

679
00:59:22,604 --> 00:59:24,871
Weapon up, Jason.

680
00:59:27,775 --> 00:59:29,509
Right.

681
00:59:31,011 --> 00:59:36,083
As much as I appreciate your
dedication to the smaller things...

682
00:59:36,084 --> 00:59:40,386
I believe a little more of the
good Lord's grace is in order.

683
00:59:42,623 --> 00:59:44,525
Amen, Father.

684
00:59:44,526 --> 00:59:46,193
Amen!

685
00:59:49,530 --> 00:59:51,297
Give 'em hell.

686
01:03:22,910 --> 01:03:24,678
It's gonna be alright.

687
01:03:24,679 --> 01:03:27,546
Just keep some pressure on it.

688
01:03:29,950 --> 01:03:32,084
Be open, Jason.

689
01:03:35,122 --> 01:03:38,257
She's more important than you know.

690
01:03:40,627 --> 01:03:43,763
- No...
- You must protect her.

691
01:03:50,637 --> 01:03:53,139
You are the way.

692
01:04:07,287 --> 01:04:11,223
Valiant and noble effort, human.

693
01:04:14,128 --> 01:04:16,663
You'd do well in my legion.

694
01:04:17,899 --> 01:04:20,033
<i>Exorcizo te, omnis
spiritus immunde,</i>

695
01:04:20,034 --> 01:04:21,568
<i>in nomine dei patris omnipotentis</i>

696
01:04:21,569 --> 01:04:24,705
<i>et in noimine jesu christi filii
ejus, domini et judicis nostri,</i>

697
01:04:24,706 --> 01:04:28,041
<i>et in virtute spiritus ut
discedas ab hoc pasmate Dei!</i>

698
01:04:28,042 --> 01:04:30,577
It's a little late for
that, don't you think?

699
01:04:30,578 --> 01:04:32,212
Thought I'd give it a shot.

700
01:04:37,085 --> 01:04:39,052
I really must thank you.

701
01:04:40,421 --> 01:04:42,621
Jason.

702
01:04:43,223 --> 01:04:46,260
You had no clue what
this was all about.

703
01:04:46,261 --> 01:04:49,763
And yet, here you are,

704
01:04:49,764 --> 01:04:55,034
providing us with the very
thing we needed all along.

705
01:04:57,170 --> 01:04:59,506
Be open, Jason.

706
01:04:59,507 --> 01:05:02,376
Eventually we will get to you.

707
01:05:02,377 --> 01:05:04,378
Just like we did Eddie.

708
01:05:04,379 --> 01:05:07,915
Not once, but twice.

709
01:05:07,916 --> 01:05:10,083
And I can't wait to taste

710
01:05:10,084 --> 01:05:14,620
that sweet, sweet Laurel.

711
01:05:24,899 --> 01:05:26,832
She...

712
01:05:28,235 --> 01:05:29,870
is the key.

713
01:05:33,807 --> 01:05:38,111
You left her in the
hands of one of us.

714
01:05:38,112 --> 01:05:41,448
How's it feel knowing
that everyone you love

715
01:05:41,449 --> 01:05:45,319
will soon be serving
my master on Earth?

716
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:47,054
Or, should I say...

717
01:05:47,055 --> 01:05:48,889
in Hell?

718
01:05:56,763 --> 01:06:00,934
<i>Ego te baptizo in nomine patris
et filii et spiritus sancti.</i>

719
01:06:00,935 --> 01:06:02,936
You...

720
01:06:02,937 --> 01:06:03,770
will...

721
01:06:03,771 --> 01:06:05,305
fail!

722
01:06:18,652 --> 01:06:21,287
Nybass?

723
01:06:26,593 --> 01:06:29,863
I need to ask you a question.

724
01:06:42,442 --> 01:06:44,143
Laurel.

725
01:06:44,679 --> 01:06:48,781
How did I break free
from your spell?

726
01:06:49,816 --> 01:06:53,320
You have one of your
own to thank for that.

727
01:06:53,321 --> 01:06:55,889
<i>Tu autem effugare, diabole...</i>

728
01:06:57,558 --> 01:06:58,358
<i>tu autem...</i>

729
01:06:58,359 --> 01:07:01,161
Save your useless prayer.

730
01:07:02,997 --> 01:07:07,868
For years you let me
rot in this prison.

731
01:07:07,869 --> 01:07:14,808
You knew it was you
I wanted all along.

732
01:07:14,809 --> 01:07:17,343
You are the way.

733
01:07:18,412 --> 01:07:22,349
With you, we shall be
free to rule this realm.

734
01:07:31,825 --> 01:07:35,261
Where's Father Diekmen?

735
01:07:39,766 --> 01:07:41,200
Oh.

736
01:07:45,072 --> 01:07:47,773
I see.

737
01:07:50,777 --> 01:07:53,113
We got there and they hit us hard.

738
01:07:53,114 --> 01:07:56,215
There should have been more of us.

739
01:08:00,454 --> 01:08:02,354
Where's Laurel?

740
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:04,857
Helix?

741
01:08:07,194 --> 01:08:09,228
She's been taken.

742
01:08:09,763 --> 01:08:11,131
By who?

743
01:08:12,266 --> 01:08:14,233
Nybass.

744
01:08:18,405 --> 01:08:23,910
Nybass is planning on
completing the crossover.

745
01:08:23,911 --> 01:08:27,314
And she's gonna use Laurel
as the final gateway.

746
01:08:27,315 --> 01:08:29,816
We killed Kasdeya, how
is that possible?

747
01:08:29,817 --> 01:08:33,519
Kasdeya was just a distraction.

748
01:08:42,462 --> 01:08:45,332
You gave Laurel up
to be sacrificed.

749
01:08:48,735 --> 01:08:51,070
God don't like ugly.

750
01:08:57,477 --> 01:08:59,479
Do you wanna tell
me what's going on?

751
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:03,615
Yeah, Father Tollman gave Laurel up
for the emergence of the dark Lord.

752
01:09:05,986 --> 01:09:07,621
Is this thing ready?

753
01:09:07,622 --> 01:09:09,856
It's as ready as it's gonna get.

754
01:09:09,857 --> 01:09:11,091
I need these.

755
01:09:11,092 --> 01:09:16,695
Okay, I don't think you're in the
right state of thinking, right now.

756
01:09:19,633 --> 01:09:21,968
You're going up against Nybass.

757
01:09:21,969 --> 01:09:25,172
Not only that, you're
going behind enemy lines.

758
01:09:25,173 --> 01:09:28,208
The crossover has
begun as we speak.

759
01:09:28,209 --> 01:09:31,478
Yeah, well, I always wanted to
expand my spiritual horizons.

760
01:09:31,479 --> 01:09:33,446
But you don't even
know where she is.

761
01:09:33,447 --> 01:09:36,449
- I'll figure it out.
- Wait.

762
01:09:36,450 --> 01:09:38,250
Just a second...

763
01:09:40,987 --> 01:09:44,124
You don't really understand
what you're going up against.

764
01:09:44,125 --> 01:09:46,558
I really think we need to plan.

765
01:09:47,227 --> 01:09:48,594
Okay.

766
01:09:49,196 --> 01:09:50,997
Okay?

767
01:09:50,998 --> 01:09:53,499
Yeah, okay. We need a plan.

768
01:09:54,334 --> 01:09:56,469
Good, 'cause, for a second there,

769
01:09:56,470 --> 01:09:59,573
I thought you were going
to do something really...

770
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:14,187
Hello, Eddie.

771
01:10:14,188 --> 01:10:18,091
Soon Beelzebub will be upon you.

772
01:10:18,092 --> 01:10:19,492
Maybe.

773
01:10:19,493 --> 01:10:21,828
Not until you tell me
what I want to know.

774
01:10:21,829 --> 01:10:23,929
I'll tell you nothing.

775
01:10:25,232 --> 01:10:30,203
I'm gonna ask this, one time
nice, and one time naughty.

776
01:10:30,204 --> 01:10:32,604
Where will they make the sacrifice?

777
01:10:39,146 --> 01:10:43,583
What do you know?
Somebody put holy water
in my gun.

778
01:10:43,584 --> 01:10:45,085
Where did they take her?

779
01:10:45,086 --> 01:10:49,623
They took her back
to where it all began.

780
01:10:49,624 --> 01:10:51,858
But you're too late.

781
01:10:53,928 --> 01:10:56,096
I got some good news.

782
01:10:56,097 --> 01:10:57,964
I'm not gonna kill ya.

783
01:10:57,965 --> 01:10:59,698
Hold on to this for me, will ya?

784
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:09,842
Do you think this is the life
he would have wanted for you?

785
01:11:19,419 --> 01:11:21,054
At some point, Jason,

786
01:11:21,055 --> 01:11:24,157
you are gonna have to
take control of your life.

787
01:11:24,158 --> 01:11:27,359
It's what your father
would have wanted.

788
01:11:51,451 --> 01:11:53,252
This isn't the lab.

789
01:11:53,888 --> 01:12:00,660
Though not quite as much as when you
dragged me up to the roof of the church.

790
01:12:00,661 --> 01:12:01,995
I...

791
01:12:01,996 --> 01:12:03,530
Oh, for Heaven's sake.

792
01:13:22,442 --> 01:13:25,377
Lord, show me the way.

793
01:13:31,885 --> 01:13:33,819
That didn't work.

794
01:13:44,631 --> 01:13:47,734
There are more layers
to the context of men,

795
01:13:47,735 --> 01:13:51,137
and so must there be to the
context of good and evil.

796
01:13:51,138 --> 01:13:53,839
I am the way, you are the way.

797
01:15:22,395 --> 01:15:23,363
Father...

798
01:15:23,364 --> 01:15:24,230
Help me.

799
01:15:28,501 --> 01:15:29,736
How'd you get down here?

800
01:15:29,737 --> 01:15:31,670
I serve the church.

801
01:15:34,407 --> 01:15:38,510
It was only a matter of time before
I found out about this place.

802
01:15:39,846 --> 01:15:43,216
The crossover, it's complete.

803
01:15:43,217 --> 01:15:45,585
Are there any others?

804
01:15:45,586 --> 01:15:49,856
The new trainees and the recruits
started disappearing this morning.

805
01:15:49,857 --> 01:15:54,259
So I came down and investigate,
and I was attacked.

806
01:15:55,428 --> 01:15:57,696
We have to keep moving forward.

807
01:16:03,202 --> 01:16:06,104
This is where the pact was formed.

808
01:16:13,713 --> 01:16:16,848
The Cloth's been working
above this the whole time?

809
01:16:18,017 --> 01:16:20,286
Yes, this is our beginning.

810
01:16:20,287 --> 01:16:24,357
The first true church formed underground
during the time of our exile.

811
01:16:24,358 --> 01:16:28,293
It was the only time where you
could practice your faith.

812
01:16:29,596 --> 01:16:32,198
This is the place where they
planned to make people believe

813
01:16:32,199 --> 01:16:33,865
in the church again.

814
01:16:39,072 --> 01:16:40,839
Laurel!

815
01:16:45,144 --> 01:16:47,345
Laurel, it's Jason.

816
01:16:53,886 --> 01:16:56,755
Father, I could use
some help in here.

817
01:16:59,994 --> 01:17:04,262
Did you miss me, my love?

818
01:17:16,976 --> 01:17:18,443
Oof!

819
01:17:27,654 --> 01:17:29,020
Soon...

820
01:17:30,156 --> 01:17:32,791
my master...

821
01:17:34,794 --> 01:17:37,930
will inhabit this Earth...

822
01:17:37,931 --> 01:17:40,199
and claim the rest...

823
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:42,200
of your weak...

824
01:17:43,469 --> 01:17:46,238
pathetic souls.

825
01:17:49,776 --> 01:17:52,879
<i>Excorcizo te, omnis
spiritus immunde,</i>

826
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:55,815
<i>in nomine dei patris
omnipotentis...</i>

827
01:18:15,334 --> 01:18:19,804
For years, I've waited
for this moment.

828
01:18:22,408 --> 01:18:25,310
I will have my vengeance.

829
01:18:26,245 --> 01:18:28,446
Let Laurel go.

830
01:18:33,319 --> 01:18:38,123
Your pretty little girlfriend...

831
01:18:39,525 --> 01:18:41,860
is in good hands.

832
01:18:54,073 --> 01:18:56,007
It is time.

833
01:19:24,971 --> 01:19:27,072
Jason, we're running out of time!

834
01:19:32,645 --> 01:19:34,280
Come in to me.

835
01:19:34,281 --> 01:19:38,885
<i>In oderem suavitatis, tu
autem effugare, diabole.</i>

836
01:19:38,886 --> 01:19:40,920
<i>Ephpheta, quod est, adaperire.</i>

837
01:19:40,921 --> 01:19:43,755
I am the way, you are the way.

838
01:19:46,058 --> 01:19:48,261
<i>Exorcizo te, omnis
spiritus immunde,</i>

839
01:19:48,262 --> 01:19:52,999
<i>et in noimine jesu christi filii
ejus, domini et judicis nostri</i>

840
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,901
<i>et in virtute spiritus ut
disedas ab hoc plasmate Dei!</i>

841
01:20:13,953 --> 01:20:15,488
Your soul...

842
01:20:15,489 --> 01:20:16,888
shall be mine.

843
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:24,664
Now you'll serve the
one true master.

844
01:20:33,506 --> 01:20:36,374
Is the best you can do?

845
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:39,411
Hey, asshole.

846
01:20:41,047 --> 01:20:43,548
Be open.

847
01:20:51,991 --> 01:20:53,625
Are you okay?

848
01:20:57,496 --> 01:20:59,297
Is it over?

849
01:21:01,067 --> 01:21:02,901
I think so.

850
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:16,916
Sorry, this one's...

851
01:21:16,917 --> 01:21:18,851
not quite...

852
01:21:18,852 --> 01:21:20,785
street ready.

853
01:21:22,922 --> 01:21:24,789
You know you missed
everything, right?

854
01:21:25,858 --> 01:21:27,994
We coulda used a plan.

855
01:21:27,995 --> 01:21:30,363
Oh, that's really funny.

856
01:21:30,364 --> 01:21:33,032
Just watch your back,
that's all I'm saying.

857
01:21:33,033 --> 01:21:35,501
Your gauntlets sucked, by the way.

858
01:21:35,502 --> 01:21:39,772
You just never had a big boy weapon
before, that's your problem.

859
01:21:39,773 --> 01:21:41,374
Button in the palm.

860
01:21:41,375 --> 01:21:43,109
You gotta make an "X"

861
01:21:43,110 --> 01:21:45,444
Chicks dig the "X", man.

862
01:21:45,445 --> 01:21:48,714
Chicks? Bro, you
gotta get out more.

863
01:21:48,715 --> 01:21:50,182
I don't think it worked for Laurel.

864
01:21:50,183 --> 01:21:52,752
It's a symbol for The Cloth,
what are you talking about?

865
01:21:52,753 --> 01:21:54,220
Are you going to do this all night?

866
01:21:54,221 --> 01:21:55,787
Yes!

867
01:21:58,291 --> 01:21:59,558
You did, though, didn't you?

868
01:21:59,559 --> 01:22:01,893
You made the "X" when
you did it, yeah?

869
01:22:03,896 --> 01:22:06,032
Yeah, I made the "X."

870
01:22:06,033 --> 01:22:08,533
That's what I'm talking about.
