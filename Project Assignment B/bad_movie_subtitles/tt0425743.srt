1
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,068
Let's dance, big dog.

2
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,156
Okay, all around defense, boys.
You know the drill.

3
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:16,802
Second Battallon found some new kind
of IED's.

4
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,178
I heard.

5
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,348
Hope you kept that thing Ellen
and the kids sent up for you.

6
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,059
If I can't eat it, forget about it...

7
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,978
especially fuzzy shit.

8
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,021
Vermont teddy bears ain't cheap,
soldier.

9
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,565
Teddy bear.

10
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,316
I ain't no kid, man.

11
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,110
Naw, man, it ain't that.

12
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,194
It's a good luck thing.

13
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,237
By the way, she's gonna ask.

14
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,947
Better have your story straight.

15
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:41,994
I'll tell her a goat ate it.

16
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,496
Don't you dare, soldier.

17
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:45,622
Don't you dare.

18
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,508
Go go go go!

19
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,604
Mortar. An eighty-three.

20
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,231
We gotta cIear that fucker
for the convoy.

21
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,942
Grab your squad, fIank 'em on the right.

22
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,485
Me and my boys'll go left.

23
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:16,904
Got it?

24
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,864
Roger that.
- Let's move!

25
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,325
Alright boys, stay on my ass!

26
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,330
Go go go!

27
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:27,915
Dowdy, Johnson, wait here!

28
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:30,500
Pena, Carver, against the fence!

29
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,545
I see them, Sergeant! I see them!

30
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,130
Get the fuck back!

31
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,175
Cease fire, Dowdy! Get the fuck down!

32
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,135
Dowdy! Goddamnit!

33
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:45,682
Sarge, Sarge, are you there?

34
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,151
Sarge, are you there?

35
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,028
That stupid sonofabitch, Dowdy!

36
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,322
He's got his ass pinned down
under the bridge.

37
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,325
Put Carver and Johnson on Dowdy
and suppress that fire.

38
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,910
Then hook to the right with Pena.

39
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,119
Hold your positions.

40
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:07,162
Your eyes on the road.

41
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,497
Roger that.

42
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,374
Let's move!

43
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,800
Johnson, Carver, we need cover fire now!

44
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:20,968
Stat! Stat!

45
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,511
Pena, Come with me!

46
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,929
Move! Move!

47
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,242
In position, Sarge.

48
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,544
There's a pick-up passin' me now, Ron.

49
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,671
I think there's gonna be one passin'
you pretty quick.

50
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:02,009
Right on, Sarge. I see 'em coming.

51
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,802
Let's get set for a double switchback.

52
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,762
Just Iet it roll.
It'll take the heat off Dowdy.

53
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,347
Then we get 'em on the way out.

54
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,505
Yeah, I got em, guys. Wheeoo!

55
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,632
I got the sonuvabitch!

56
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,190
You okay, Pena?

57
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,191
Still breathing, sarge.

58
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,359
I got 'em!

59
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you wish, little buddy.

60
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,154
You just thank your ol' Uncle Deke.

61
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,531
Hey, way to tumble, meatball.

62
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:13,830
Open fire!

63
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:21,046
RPG! Get down!
(RPG: Rocket Propelied Grenade)

64
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,053
Doc!

65
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:36,812
Shit!

66
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,355
Alright, defense, now!

67
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,690
Get his shit off!. Get his shit off!.

68
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:50,242
Gut wound. He's losing a ton of blood.

69
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:51,618
We need an immediate medevac.

70
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,079
No! By the time they scramble a helo,
and get it out here

71
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,997
he'll be dead from sestemic poisoning.

72
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,292
He needs surgery FAST
or he hasn't got a prayer.

73
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,419
A bunch of us dellvered med-supplies

74
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,796
to an Iraqi hospital around here
about a week ago.

75
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,090
It's about five minutes away.
Area seemed okay.

76
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,050
No, no, fuck that,
Cohen, you know how long it'd take

77
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,677
to get clearance
for something like that?

78
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:09,803
Fuck the clearance.

79
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:10,637
It's on me.

80
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,431
I left before you got here.

81
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,808
I'll lose a stripe for
the sarge any day.

82
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,101
Same here.

83
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,436
Me too.

84
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:18,854
Fuck it.

85
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,981
You can keep your damn stripe Jackson.

86
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,607
This one's on me.

87
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,777
Carver! Johnson!
Stretcher, let's go!

88
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:26,611
Move!

89
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:27,320
We're going now.

90
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,697
Easy... easy.

91
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:29,573
Come on, breathe.

92
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,074
Hang in there, man.

93
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,951
Hang in there, Sarge.

94
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,330
Listen guys,

95
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,250
keep your heads up
and watch for movement.

96
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,170
How's it going up there, Jackson?

97
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:45,172
Looks quiet so far, sarge.

98
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:49,134
Can't this tub of shit go any faster?
We're losing him!

99
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:53,513
Yeah, well fast ain't gonna mean
dick if we hit an IED, doc.

100
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,640
We gotta play this thing smart.

101
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,858
It's all my fault, sarge.

102
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,069
Get off it.

103
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,448
You did your best, sarge did his.

104
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:14,451
Shit went down, okay?
That's war, Billy.

105
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,077
You just gotta regroup and move on.

106
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:19,372
Sarge, man, you think
DeIvecchio's got a chance?

107
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:20,999
I mean he was bIeeding out, man.

108
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:24,085
Gonna be pIenty of blood
where we're going. Don't you worry.

109
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,879
Yeah, but I wish there
were more of us, sarge.

110
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:29,549
I mean this city shit is way freaky.

111
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,718
Well, tell him to put
on some Depends, sarge,

112
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,887
then he can piss himseIf all he wants.

113
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,015
Listen, we're the last shot he's got.

114
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:40,477
I'd drive into hell in a
gasoline tanker for that man.

115
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:44,314
So if the shit goes down, so be it.

116
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,325
Dowdy, get your tall back on your gun.

117
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,826
Johnson, on the 240.

118
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:59,204
Carver,
I need an open watch, right now!

119
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:05,085
Doc, these guys run away
from you last week?

120
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,670
No sarge!

121
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,215
Jackson. Somethin's hinkey, man.

122
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,841
You guys stay frosty.

123
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,428
Alright, reposition the vehicles.

124
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:22,936
Am I dead yet?

125
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,314
No sarge. You're in a hospital.
We got to operate on you.

126
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,820
Okay... easy.

127
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,409
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

128
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,743
Gunshot wounds.

129
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,539
This must be one of the motherfuckers
who tried to whack us.

130
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,085
Fuck 'em. You go save the sarge first.

131
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,921
He needs O-positive blood,
and his intestine sutured -

132
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,214
-- sewn back together, understand?

133
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:54,467
No, no if we don't operate on them,
the others, they'll kill us.

134
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:55,468
There's others?

135
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,387
Yes. Down the hallway.

136
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,055
Operate!

137
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,224
Doc, give 'em some motivation.

138
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,145
No, stay on the sarge.

139
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,523
You, get some blood, now!

140
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,900
You! Get some anesthetic
and start surgery.

141
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:13,069
Take it easy, baby, we got you.

142
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,113
Easy now. Easy.

143
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,995
Sarge, are you okay?

144
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,622
You're okay. Easy.

145
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:15,131
Look, I'm sorry about all this.
We just came here for help.

146
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,301
Hey Sarge...?
-Yeah?

147
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,430
Some asshole has an RPG! Get down!

148
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,189
I'm always having to
save your ass, Pena.

149
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,483
Hey, that's my job, sarge.
Keeping you on your toes.

150
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,110
I guess I deserve a raise, huh?

151
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,404
The shit's hitting the fan.

152
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,864
Doc, how you doing?
It's getting hot out there.

153
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:40,949
Good.

154
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:44,077
Newsflash, doc,
sarge says we got to do it.

155
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,787
Doc, is sarge ready to be moved?

156
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,205
The operation's done
but I don't think --

157
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,624
No no no, no buts.
That's an order.

158
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,335
Okay, get him in there,
get him ready to go.

159
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:56,923
Listen, if it's too hot for gunships,
you give me fixed wing support, sir.

160
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,758
No, I don't have a forward
air controller.

161
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,009
Come on,
let's go. Let's go!

162
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,970
Move your asses, lot's go!

163
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:05,014
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
well that's just fucking great, sir.

164
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,808
Goddamnit!

165
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,353
Move! Move! Move!

166
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,713
Doc, the sarge, how is he?

167
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,591
We've got to get back to base ASAP.

168
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:42,969
Roger that, Jackson.

169
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,263
Doc says we gotta get there fast.

170
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,389
We need a shortcut.

171
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:49,684
Sarge, why the fuck are these guys
so pissed off at us, man?

172
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:50,852
Just cuz we're here.

173
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,520
Yeah, but I don't get it.
We shit-canned Sadam...

174
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,855
what, that doesn't count for nothing?

175
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,524
Yeah? Well how would you feel
if they were in Miami?

176
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:57,692
Don't even go there, man, because

177
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,402
Miami'd be a totally different story
Alright.

178
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,570
These guys would be toast.

179
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,030
Fuck with my home town
you're goin' down.

180
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,072
That's just the way it is, Alright?

181
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,451
That's my point, dumbass.
Nobody likes being occupied.

182
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,036
It's like living with your parents.

183
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,668
Doc...

184
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:20,423
Sarge...I can't make out a
word you're saying. Just relax.

185
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,759
Just go back to sleep sarge,
take it easy.

186
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,761
Let the anaesthetic do its job.

187
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,228
We've got this, Alright.

188
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,360
Hold your fire, too many civilians.

189
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,987
He's not gonna make it back.
Not like this we're not.

190
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,740
Sarge, this ain't cuttin' it.
Give me a man.

191
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,742
Let's go with the Louisana two-step.

192
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:48,785
Go Jackson.

193
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,246
Pena, you're up,
Louisana two-step.

194
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:54,207
Say hello to my little friend,
you fucking cock-a-roaches.

195
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,835
What the hell's a Louisana two-step?

196
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,711
You're about to find out.

197
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,467
Go Pena, go!

198
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,823
You Alright, Jackson?-Yeah.

199
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,157
You okay, Pena?-Yeah.

200
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,576
Good job, boys.

201
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:34,914
Wheeooo! That's what I call
Iraqification, motherfuckers.

202
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,709
Hey! Dowdy, you shut the hell up.

203
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,335
You show a little bit more respect,
Alright?

204
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:39,919
But sarge...

205
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:43,464
No buts!
That goes for the rest of y'all.

206
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,969
Let's get the hell outta here.
Back to base.

207
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,032
Guys, guys, I got an idea.

208
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,700
Cubans, hand-rolled.

209
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,161
All you got to do is ride the
smoke right to heaven, my friend --

210
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,748
Hey, Mr. Miami. It ain't over 'tll
we're back on base, Alright?

211
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,499
So you put those away.

212
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,251
Sarge, man,
you got to think positive, dude.

213
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,961
I mean guys,
you know what I think he needs?

214
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,380
Some prime ass Miami tall, my friend.

215
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:27,508
The meanest bikinis and
the best hotties in the world.

216
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,510
Every night's like girls gone wild.

217
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,639
That'll put a shit-eating grin
on your face, I swear to you.

218
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,641
I thought this war was over, Jesse.

219
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:38,227
We're building schools,
hospitals, roads,

220
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:42,357
Seems to me like we're getting a lot of
hate and discontent in return.

221
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:45,026
Makes me homesick for Afghanistan.

222
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:20,979
Steady guys. These folks are friendlies
until they prove different.

223
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,275
Stop--stop--STOP! IED!

224
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,695
Sarge, stop! IED!

225
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:29,946
Where?

226
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,614
Right there.

227
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,246
What's up?

228
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,998
We think we got an IED.

229
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,958
Just don't worry about it,
go back to sleep.

230
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,627
Count sheep or strippers or something.

231
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,380
Okay, listen up,
I want everybody to dismount

232
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,549
and move these people
back behind the truck.

233
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:50,842
Keep your eyes open.

234
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,969
Get those marshmallows ready.

235
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,512
Come on, let's get those sandaIs moving.

236
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,264
There's a big-ass fire coming up.

237
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,441
Coast is cIear, Aikens, take your shot.

238
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:08,860
Stop that kid!

239
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:15,491
Shit doc, get in there.

240
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,371
Holy fuck! Deke...Deke?

241
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,164
Is everyone all right?

242
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,749
Doc! Doc!

243
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:23,833
You okay?

244
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,127
How's the kid?

245
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,795
You Alright, man?

246
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,255
Oh my God. Move, move, move!

247
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,175
What's wrong with you, boss?

248
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,719
Where am I hit, doc?

249
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,929
Where am I hit?
I don't know, give me a second.

250
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,682
Why the fuck did you
run out like that, man?

251
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:45,104
You lucky son of a bitch, Deke,
it's just a fucking superficial wound.

252
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,065
It's just a scratch
on the surface, baby.

253
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,859
Jackson, get in here, please.

254
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,362
It took balls, Deke.
It took balls.

255
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,866
I got two sisters back home
as young as that kid.

256
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:03,039
I don't want my famlly to get hurt,
I don't want no famllies to get hurt.

257
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,541
It ain't what I signed up for.

258
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,460
It's fine, Deke, it's fine.

259
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,880
I ain't never seen so much blood on
such a pussy wound, buddy.

260
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,256
Hold him up, Hold him up.

261
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,550
Okay guys, we got work to do.

262
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,678
We need him in the truck fast.

263
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,223
You good?
-I couId have been killed, man.

264
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,016
You good to drive?
You want me to drive for you?

265
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,102
Yeah, I seen your driving.

266
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,997
Hey Deke, how'd it feel?

267
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,666
How did what feel, sarge?

268
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:48,835
When you got hit.

269
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:53,506
Yeah, right. Scary, I guess...

270
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,510
Peaceful.

271
00:18:58,428 --> 00:18:59,804
Peaceful huh?

272
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,103
Ease up on yourseIf, sarge.

273
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:12,567
Y'know, I just want to get
us all home safe, Deke.

274
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,070
I just want to get us all home.

275
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,159
Hey, how's the sarge doin' back there?

276
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,829
Talking in his sleep.
Probably giving orders.

277
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,081
That sounds about right.

278
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,835
What about you, doc?
How you Holdin' up?

279
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:35,548
Till we get him back to base
I'm just one ball of stress, babe.

280
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:37,592
I don't know what it is, dude,

281
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,844
but I feel like a bucket
of chum right now.

282
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,806
You know, the shit they put in
the water to attract the sharks.

283
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:47,143
What, am I the onIy guy that watches
Discovery ChanneI around here or what?

284
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,187
Look, just don't think about it.

285
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:50,313
Don't think about it?

286
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,272
Wait a minute,

287
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:52,231
what the hell am I supposed
to think about,

288
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:53,441
you know what I mean?

289
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:57,737
Think about the best day you ever had.

290
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:01,157
Are you kidding? That's really hard,
man, how am I supposed to do that?

291
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,700
Okay bitch, I'll think about it then...

292
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:09,874
um, my best day...Probably when
I hooked up with the sarge.

293
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:14,086
Alright, well whatever you do on your
time with him is fine with me

294
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,713
just don't do it in front of me.

295
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,590
Fuck you, Alright.

296
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:25,473
Hey Jackson.
-Yeah.

297
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,893
How do you activate a car bomb again?

298
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,187
Why you askin', dude?

299
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,232
Because I think we're right beside one.

300
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,317
Sarge, we got ourselves a car bomb.

301
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,862
Roger that.
Deke, back it up, back it up.

302
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,739
we got a possible car bomb IED.

303
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:42,949
What the fuck do we do?

304
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,327
We back up slowly.

305
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,788
Backing up...

306
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:50,957
Run.

307
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,588
Get back! Get back! It's a car bomb.

308
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:04,053
Move it! Get the hell out of here!

309
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,556
In the alley!

310
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,269
Turn! Turn! Turn!

311
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:12,561
Keep your eyes open!

312
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,064
Don't bunch up! Don't bunch up!

313
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,361
Shoot them!

314
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,939
Sarge! He's hit!

315
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,066
Sarge is down!

316
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,735
Factory 12:00.

317
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,282
Sarge is hit! I repeat, sarge is hit!

318
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,616
I'm coming to see you now.

319
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,285
Jesse, give me a wall!

320
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,453
Damn! The engine's fried.

321
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,912
The engine's fried.

322
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:48,407
Doc man, Doc, come on.
Come on, you got to help him out.

323
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:49,367
Come on, you got to help him.

324
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,869
Romeo, Dowdy, we need a sweep.
Let's go!

325
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:57,208
Come on, man, hang in there.

326
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,711
Come on, Doc, come on, let's go,

327
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:03,756
You got to help him out, man.

328
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:06,926
Oh Jesus! Fuck!

329
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,803
What? Come on, what is it? What is it?

330
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,848
His artery's severed.

331
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,475
Do something. Come on doc, come on.

332
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,729
Okay, we got you.
You're a fighter, baby, get in there.

333
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,107
Don't worry about it,
stick with us now, stick with us.

334
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:42,503
Shit!

335
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,508
It ain't your fault. doc.

336
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:49,969
I can't fucking clamp
this fucking thing.

337
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,638
It's just getting shredded.

338
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,224
Listen,
-What?

339
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,475
I want you to tell
my ma I...Iove her.

340
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:58,561
I'm not telling her anything, man.

341
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,729
You're gonna be there to tell her,
Alright?

342
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,402
Alright, listen up...

343
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:11,490
You guys better watch each others backs.

344
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:16,745
You watch each others backs...Alright?

345
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:22,376
You keep your ass up
-and you get home.

346
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:24,795
Get home.

347
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,548
Come on, Doc, man,

348
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,675
Say hi to EIvis for me.

349
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:32,052
He's not going anywhere, man!
He's going to stay right here.

350
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,263
You're not going anywhere,
you're staying right here.

351
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,183
You're a goddamn hero, sarge.

352
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,521
Come on, Doc...

353
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:48,861
What are you doing?

354
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,198
Come on, man,
let's go. Come on, doc.

355
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:53,282
No Pena, he's gone.

356
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,034
No man, what are you doing?
Come on, man?

357
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:58,412
He's gone. I'm sorry.

358
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:00,789
He's not going anywhere,
he's here.

359
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:04,460
Come on, bring him back.
You're the fucking doctor, man.

360
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:10,174
Just take it easy,
okay! It's over!

361
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,342
Pena...

362
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,760
What?

363
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,888
You gotta put your hurtin'
time on Hold, son...

364
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,974
we need your ass now...
right doc?

365
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,393
Goddamn right, sarge.

366
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:25,147
So stop bitchin'...and
act like you got a fuckin' pair.

367
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:30,653
That's how you pay your respects
back to Sgt. STalker, you hear?

368
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,155
Yeah, I got it. I got it.

369
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:54,760
Doc, ain't nothing about
what you did or didn't do.

370
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,429
It's just the way it is.

371
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,766
I need you guys.

372
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,273
Sarge, hurtin' much?

373
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:13,195
Pain's cool.
Means it ain't plantin' time.

374
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,157
So what are we gonna
do about this, soldier?

375
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:23,038
You tell me. We're trapped

376
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,129
Let's start with
getting untrapped first.

377
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,008
Get our own battallon.

378
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,859
Base can't help us,
they got hit by truck bombs.

379
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,944
And there's Still no air.

380
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:58,907
We got to hang on until troops
from all the way from brigade get here.

381
00:26:59,075 --> 00:26:59,950
Fuck!

382
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,620
We'll do it ourseIves.

383
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,496
SaddIe 'em up, Jackson.
Now!

384
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:14,006
Pena, he was as much a friend
to me as he was to you.

385
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,342
And he was a good soldier.

386
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:19,595
He's in a better place
than this fucking hell, man.

387
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,681
But right now
we gotta do this right.

388
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,434
You understand
what I'm saying to you, soldier?

389
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:29,229
Yeah sarge. I do.-Okay.

390
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:41,867
Hey guys, it's a TripIe Decker
Hall Mary like we learned on base.

391
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,035
You all know what to do.

392
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:48,791
Carver, it's time.

393
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,380
You're on the left with the guys.

394
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,133
It's a shitstorm out there, Jesse.

395
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,426
You scared?

396
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,763
Hell no, man,
I'm just tired of this place.

397
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,723
Then let's go home.

398
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,101
Me and you.

399
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:09,311
Every step of the way.

400
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,940
Shit!

401
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,244
Our guys couIdn't make it,
but guess who did.

402
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,330
Romeo, let's go!

403
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,154
Go, go, go!

404
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,330
Those Johnny Jihads
got a hard on for us.

405
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,752
We got help comin'. But right now
we need a place to hoIe up, lieutenant.

406
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:18,046
Go my station.
Police station. Go left.

407
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,882
Romeo. Do it.

408
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,091
Got it, sarge!

409
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,760
I am Lieutenant Ahmed.

410
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:25,471
Your enemy are my enemy,
my friend.

411
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,682
We heard on radio you were under fire.

412
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:32,311
You guys came just
in the nick of time, buddy.

413
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:34,438
Just in the nick of time.

414
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,026
Where'd you get that pig?

415
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:39,943
Pig?

416
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,528
The M60, dude.

417
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,614
Blackmarket.

418
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:47,117
You need,
how do you say, an edge?

419
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:48,160
Oh yeah.

420
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,787
Got to have an edge, yeah.

421
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:11,183
WeIcome to the new Iraq,
my friend.

422
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,769
My home is your home.

423
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,897
Is not much, but it is ours.

424
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:18,732
Allah Akbah!

425
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,486
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

426
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,947
What the hell's going on back there?

427
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,281
Don't shoot. He has a bomb.

428
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,783
Hold your fire.

429
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:44,633
[SPEAKS ARABIC]

430
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,598
HoIy shit!

431
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:55,602
Is everyone all right?

432
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,106
Thanks, man.

433
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,359
You're a straight up dude,
you know that, right?

434
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:06,154
Doc, see if there's
anything you can do?

435
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:07,781
Yeah.

436
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:09,366
Jackson?
-Yeah?

437
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:10,742
Cover his ass.

438
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:12,536
Okay.

439
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,831
Finding when and where to take
a pissbreak,

440
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,250
now that is truly the art of war.

441
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,590
What the fuck, Dowdy, come on man,
you're pissing on my boots.

442
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:08,342
Control your sprinkler.

443
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:09,676
Sorry, dude.

444
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:12,721
It's kind of hard to drain your
snake when people are bumping into you.

445
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,599
Hey, you know they got
pills you can take that'll

446
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,184
grow that little nub of yours.

447
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,019
Fuck you, Jesse.

448
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:22,147
Whoa man, now you got me
to piss on my boots!

449
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:24,608
Will you guys please
Control your dicks!

450
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:29,529
Hey, you guys think we'll be
doin' this tomorrow? Together?

451
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:32,699
people might start Talkin'
we make a habit of it.

452
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,284
That ain't what I mean.

453
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:36,411
I know what you mean.

454
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:41,625
Y'all kept your peckers hard
and powder dry... so far.

455
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:46,838
Keep it up you bet your ass
we're gonna come outta this together.

456
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,966
Every last swingin' dick.

457
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,767
Lieutenant, how many cops you got?

458
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,102
Not enough.

459
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,229
Kind of hard to keep
the position full, huh?

460
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:05,065
No. For every man they kill,

461
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:08,944
his brother or son comes to fight
in his place.

462
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:12,447
The rest of my men
are out on the street.

463
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:16,618
After weeks of quiet
we have many gunfights.

464
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:20,330
They are rattling our chain today, yes?

465
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,999
You got that right, Lieutenant.

466
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,042
Alright guys, load up.

467
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:30,007
Sir, we have one soldier KIA...
2 wounded,

468
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,842
and our squad leader is critical.

469
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,593
Now we need help, and we need it fast.

470
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,846
What is the ETA on your support column?

471
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:40,100
Captain...?

472
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:41,852
Fuck.

473
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,062
What's up?

474
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,276
We need to get sarge out,
we need to do it on our own.

475
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:54,031
No, we're gonna sit tight and
wait this shit out. Right here.

476
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:58,035
Sarge, with all due respect,
no fucking way.

477
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:00,954
He's bareIy stable.
We need to get him out.

478
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:05,125
Sorry, sarge. Doc outranks you
on this medicaI shit, and you know it.

479
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,836
What is this? Free stripe
hand outs all of a sudden?

480
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,425
Incoming.
Get the sarge down! Everybody down!

481
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,182
Sarge, you okay?

482
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,238
Dowdy, time to get
out the other stretcher.

483
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:36,656
CIear this shit away!

484
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,035
Up! Up!

485
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,704
All around defense, now!

486
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:45,290
Fuck!

487
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,291
You'll be Alright, doc.

488
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:49,419
Fuck, his stitches have torn loose,
we got major blood fIow.

489
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,880
He needs a hospital.
He needs a surgeon.

490
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,799
And he needs a real fucking doctor.
And he needs it now, man.

491
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:56,176
It ain't happening, doc.

492
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:58,762
Shit!

493
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:00,388
I got to go in.

494
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:03,892
I'll see what I can do.
I'll try and stitch him back up.

495
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:04,851
You can do that, doc?

496
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:07,854
I don't know! I'm just a fucking medic.
I've never done surgery before

497
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,190
and I shouIdn't be fucking doing it now.

498
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,733
But you're gonna fucking do it.

499
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:15,362
I'm not gonna Iay here on my ass
and bIeed my llfe away, doc, do it!

500
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,905
Do it!

501
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,448
Yeah. Pressure.

502
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:21,952
Get some morphine.

503
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:23,829
Morphine'll drop your
blood pressure too Iow.

504
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:24,955
I can't give it to you.

505
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:28,458
I got some IocaI shit that might
take the edge off, if we're lucky.

506
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,001
TyIer...?

507
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:32,003
Right here, sarge. I'm right here.

508
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:36,341
if I don't come outta this,
you get these boys home-you hear?

509
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,718
Don't fucking even go there, sarge.

510
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,388
Don't be afraid of it.

511
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,556
Afraid of what?

512
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:44,266
You taking over.

513
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:47,269
Is that all you think you are to me,
sarge?

514
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:48,770
A fuckin' way to dodge command?

515
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:53,108
No disrespect, sarge, fuck you.

516
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:55,527
Coming in. Easy.

517
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,821
Hold her steady. Just a second, baby.

518
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,253
Don't fuckin' move!

519
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:18,675
Get your weapon off my man.

520
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,553
Come on, Lieutenant.
This motherfucker was in the other room

521
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,763
on a cell phone when
we heard the first blast.

522
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:25,557
Now we're all in the same room again

523
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,559
and he's on a cell phone
in another room.

524
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:29,186
Do the math.

525
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,856
You don't belleve me? Check his fucking
cell phone. Hit the readout button.

526
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:46,036
[SPEAKS ARABIC]

527
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,374
No! No, no!

528
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:02,552
Cover the doc and sarge.
Nobody gets in here.

529
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,970
Nobody.

530
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:49,474
Who can I trust, if I can't
trust my own men? Tell me.

531
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,642
Lieutenant, you okay?

532
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,318
All that matters is
you can trust me - Alright?

533
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:45,155
I trust you, and we gotta
wade outta this shit together

534
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:48,450
or it's gonna fuckin'
sink both of us, okay?

535
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,076
Together, yes.

536
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:58,752
Keep pressure on that blood bag, Carver.

537
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:04,841
Jesus Christ.
I'm no surgeon, man.

538
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:09,596
Your folks are docs, right?
It's aImost the same thing.

539
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,183
I'm not wired right for this shit!

540
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,356
That's why I joined up, Deke...

541
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:22,734
To get away from all that pressure
to be daddy's little doctor

542
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:27,906
as soon as I finished basic,
they found out I was pre-med in college.

543
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:30,700
Bam! SuddenIy I'm a medic.

544
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,204
Sarge deserves better than this.

545
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,415
Better than I can give him.

546
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:42,337
Hey! One foot in front of
the other gets it done. Alright?

547
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,756
It's the onIy way we're
going to get through this shit.

548
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,008
You just gotta have faith.

549
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,312
Doc, how we doin'?

550
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:02,399
I don't know!
Maybe sarge can field that one.

551
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:06,027
Got a beat or two
left in me yet, doc.

552
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:11,116
Look, whlle you been goin'
through this I been thinkin' sarge,

553
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:14,828
And I never really thanked you,

554
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:21,209
I mean said the words for
everything you've done for me,

555
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:28,299
Thank the army, son.
I do...along with that judge.

556
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:29,717
What judge, sarge?

557
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,720
One who gave me the choice...

558
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:37,267
between servin' time or servin'
my country.

559
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:40,228
Are you trying to tell us
you were a badass once?

560
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,523
I had a thing for
fast cars that weren't mine.

561
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,610
Army straightened my ass out...

562
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:51,739
Shit! There's a special
fucking delivery for us.

563
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,493
Fuck!-Great.

564
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:57,954
Alright
we got incoming...Truck bomb.

565
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,205
Let's go.

566
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:00,331
double time...double time...

567
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:04,294
Deke, stay here with Doc
watch the doors.

568
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:11,778
Still here!

569
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:13,404
Romeo, you good?

570
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:15,031
Fuck!

571
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,367
Romeo, how you doing, man.

572
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:20,828
You guys good?

573

Everybody Alright over here?

575
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:30,171
Good?

576
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:31,381
Yeah, we're good.

577
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:36,886
Nice work, guys
We took it to 'em, brothers.

578
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:40,765
Rest in peace, motherfuckers.

579
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,728
Whiskey, one one.

580
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:53,444
You are Lima Zulu at grid four one
seven eight eight one seven two two...

581
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:54,529
over.

582
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:02,287
Hey man, that was a fine piece
of homeland defense!

583
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,455
Alright, y'all, listen up.

584
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:06,749
I got some good news
and some bad news.

585
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:10,378
The bad news is ground
support's Still hung up,

586
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:14,424
the good news is the LZ
coordinates are on-hand.

587
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,175
We're getting our butts
air-llfted outta here!

588
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,511
Yeah baby, Alright.

589
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:22,098
You sorry ass bastards
Iook like you've been in a war.

590
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:23,558
You seem awful cheery, doc.

591
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,768
Sarge is Still kicking
in this world of shit.

592
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:26,978
Right sarge?

593
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:29,355
As soon as I get me a fllIup
I'm good to go.

594
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,107
See, I toId you you couId do it
man.

595
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,401
You got magic in those hands.

596
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:35,820
Where's Jackson?

597
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:37,113
I'm right here, sarge.

598
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,407
I see you heId Fort Apache, huh?

599
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:40,950
The team did.

600
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,578
Hell of a team, all of them.

601
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:46,289
You gotta eat somethin'
other'n adrenallne.

602
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,291
Break out those MRE'S.

603
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:49,959
You want to toss me one, dog?

604
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,465
Lieutenant, we gotta go.

605
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:09,354
I wish I couId go with you,
but I cannot.

606
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:16,611
As you can see,
I must stay with my dead and my wounded.

607
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:23,368
May Allah protect you
and make strong your hearts.

608
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,079
Back at you, brother.

609
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:28,498
Good luck, too, lieutenant.

610
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,375
You're a good soldier.

611
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,543
...and a friend.

612
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:34,837
Good luck.

613
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,303
Move out.

614
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,882
Hey Jackson,
not too much loving down there, Alright?

615
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:37,233
Well, she ain't the prettiest
landing site I ever did see.

616
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:41,529
But she's a damn sweet one,
I'll tell you that.

617
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:44,365
Hey guys, hang on.
Sarge wants to say something.

618
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:49,871
Now that we're getting out of here,
I just want you to know

619
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:54,917
that every breath I take from now on,
I owe you.

620
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:59,130
And if you live your lives
with the same spirit you had today,

621
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,467
it's all gonna work out for you.

622
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:06,095
So make your lives count for somethin',
you hear,

623
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:10,183
'cause you boys are the best
goddamn soldiers I've ever had.

624
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:16,105
Alright guys,
the chopper's going to be here soon.

625
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:18,274
I need a full defense. Let's go.

626
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:19,942
Alright, we're on it, dogs.

627
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:22,737
You think you can get us some R&R sarge?

628
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:23,696
No problem, Billy.

629
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:26,574
Hey Dowdy,

630
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,034

631
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:29,786
Whatcha gonna do in Paris, Billy?

632
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:32,747
Gonna go to up to the top
of the EiffeI Tower,

633
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:35,833
and take me a long sIow piss on France.

634
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:41,088
Me and Craig,
we're heading over to DisneyIand.

635
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,800
Yeah, I know it sounds corney,

636
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:46,677
but I just I want to feel like
a kid again, you know,

637
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:50,306
get to feellng so old
so fast around here.

638
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:51,808
see, I don't know if it's just me...

639
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:55,770
but I've always kind
of had this thing for Snow White.

640
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:57,522
She lives with seven dwarves...

641
00:46:57,689 --> 00:47:00,066
shit,
she's got to be a stone freak dogs.

642
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:01,317
I Iove it.

643
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,236
So doc? What about you?

644
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:04,570
I don't know, man.

645
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:08,032
I can't Iet myself think that
far ahead, y'know.

646
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,701
I just gotta get myself through today.

647
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:13,621
Hey Tyler, what about you?

648
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:17,041
Maybe I might go back to
that hospital we was at.

649
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:24,131
See if this nurse there wants to go,
I don't know, dancin' or something.

650
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:27,343
Aw man,
there ain't no place to dance in Iraq.

651
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:30,763
There's got to be,
hell, you can dance anywhere, man.

652
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:32,723
No, dude. I can't dance.

653
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:34,851
You can't dance?

654
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,353
Man, all you gotta do is just bounce.

655
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:40,648
Like this?

656
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:43,317
What the fuck is that?

657
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,153
Look, all you got to do is just...

658
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:48,239
you know, get ziggy with it,
you know, like this.

659
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,199
Last time this guy
got ziggy with anything

660
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:51,200
he got arrested for indecent exposure.

661
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:53,202
Him and the dude he was dancing with.

662
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:56,539
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Dowdy man,

663
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,332
I can't watch you dance
like that without a fucking beat.

664
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,543
Johnson, lay that beatbox down, man.

665
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,628
Okay,
I'm going to throw down a serious beat.

666
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:03,921
Okay, here's the man with the beat box.

667
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:04,839
Go go go go. Go.

668
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,299
Tear it up. Tear it up.

669
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:25,318
Oh oh. That is Romeo's mating dance.

670
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,875
Pump it up, pump it up.

671
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:42,376
Yeah, Dowdy!

672
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:51,177
Whiskey One one...over.

673
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,267
Copy that hotel six four...Sarge.

674
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,023
Hey Hush up...hey hush up...

675
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,068
Soul train's over.
Somethin's poppin' on the net.

676
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:13,407
Evacuation terminated...repeat,
evacuation has been terminated.

677
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:17,662
Fuck!

678
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:20,373
Jackson! Mount 'em up.

679
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,959
Sarge, the chopper's coming,
we're getting picked up.

680
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,210
Picked up by who, Jackson.

681
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:26,170
Our chopperjust got hit by an RPG.

682
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,171
What?

683
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:29,006
They need our help. Saddle 'em up.

684
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:30,174
Move.

685
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,426
Oh man. Shit.

686
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:33,552
Come on, you heard the sarge, let's go!

687
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,095
Move move move move!

688
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:37,390
Guys, you heard him.
Go! Move! Move!

689
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,684
We were on our way out of here,
goddamnit!

690
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:41,143
Bullshit!

691
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:44,021
Fuck!

692
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:03,124
hotel six-four, this is Whiskey-one-one,
send your Ioc-stat, over.

693
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:10,798
Loc-stat 416-927-623-Shit!

694
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:13,426
Fuck!

695
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,594
We're never gonna
get outta here are we?

696
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:18,806
The shit got deeper. So what?

697
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,267
We just gotta put on
our fuckin' rubber boots now.

698
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:22,768
And do what?

699
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:26,772
Stand by our men.
Go check for survivors.

700
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:29,025
Survivors? What, you shitting me, sarge?

701
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:30,651
Nothing's gonna be left.

702
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:32,278
Shit

703
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:33,904
Fuck, that's a bad omen.

704
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:35,740
I'm telling you, that's a bad omen.

705
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:36,407
help me get him up.

706
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:37,366
Get him up on the bench!

707
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,535
Move!

708
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:42,038
Move him up.

709
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:45,833
Sorry, sarge.

710
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,835
We're gonna get you home, I promise.

711
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,012
Poor sons of bitches.

712
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:04,852
That's got to be it.

713
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,897
Whoever brought down
that chopper couId Still be out there.

714
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:13,152
First, second fire teams, move out.

715
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:15,905
Watch your backgrounds.

716
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:01,742
Jeez.

717
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:38,070
Now.

718
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:43,200
Hey! You want hate?

719
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:52,251
Well, I do fucking hate!

720
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:55,629
I hate all of you people
and your shithole country.

721
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:24,909
You better run before
I put a slug up your goddamn ass!

722
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:28,204
Then you'll be dancing
the funky chicken motherfuckers!

723
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:46,430
Troy, what's the matter, man.

724
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:49,391
He's just a kid.

725
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:50,643
He's a kid with a gun.

726
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,686
He'd kill you the same way a man would.

727
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:56,106
I didn't come here to kill kids, man.

728
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:59,318
No. No you didn't.

729
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:02,238
You came here to do your duty,
just like the rest of us.

730
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:05,074
Just don't think of 'em, okay?

731
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:07,910
That road goes nowhere, man.

732
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:17,878
You're going to need this, buddy.

733
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:25,219
Good job guys.

734
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,056
You boys good?

735
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,100
We are.

736
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:37,690
Doc. Call the graves.

737
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:39,024
Let them know.

738
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:40,609
Alright, saddle up.

739
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,118
Copy that AIpha Three Zero.

740
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:50,744
Take cover!

741
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:57,668
Piece of Horse shit.

742
00:54:57,877 --> 00:54:59,545
Sarge! We lost another engine.

743
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:01,463
Dismount! We're sitting ducks up here!

744
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:05,759
Jackson,
get them under cover across the road.

745
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:07,636
You go! Go go go!

746
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:08,637
CIear the truck.

747
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:10,889
We're not going to Ieave them behind.

748
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:16,020
How the hell are we going to get you
and the sarge out of here on foot?

749
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:25,321
Don't worry, sarge, we got you.

750
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,370
Take cover.

751
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:35,706
Return fire!

752
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:39,752
Sorry, sarge.

753
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:41,295
Sorry sorry sorry

754
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:45,007
Cover me!

755
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:50,095
I'm hit!

756
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,523
How bad is it, doc?

757
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:02,941
You'll live.

758
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:06,236
Reloading!

759
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:07,071
Guys, with your firearms.

760
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:08,822
Conserve that ammo.

761
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:10,908
Doc, get on that fucking radio!

762
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:12,868
It's not going to make a difference,
goddamnit!

763
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:15,329
No one's coming up fast enough
to mean shit.

764
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:17,831
Yeah, what are we supposed to do
when we run out of ammo, sarge?

765
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:19,917
Fuck Tommy,
get some more from the truck!

766
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:21,585
Yeah? To watch them fucking blow us up?

767
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:22,503
I fucking don't.

768
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:24,129
Man up, Johnson!

769
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:26,632
Who the hell are those guys?

770
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:29,760
I don't know,
but they're putting out a sniper team.

771
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:37,184
Wheehoo! Bullseye!

772
00:56:38,853 --> 00:56:40,270
Dammit, I Iove those snipers!

773
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:41,480
It's okay, Rick.

774
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:42,940
We're Alright now, man.

775
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,360
It's not okay, man.

776
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:49,988
Lay him down. Let him down.

777
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:57,913
Romeo, how's the Ieg?

778
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,220
You gentIemen Alright?

779
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:14,888
We're good, sir.

780
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,098
Thanks to you.

781
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:19,268
I'm Sgt. DeIvecchio...
1 st Cav...these are my men.

782
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:21,979
Lt. Banning, Ohio National Guard.

783
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:25,858
This is Lt. Diggs, and Sgt. Wlikes.

784
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:28,485
And I believe
you've aIready met my sniper team.

785
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:30,487
That was safe shooting, man.

786
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:31,613
I mean... uh... sir.

787
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:32,823
Helluva shot.

788
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:37,369
Jesus Christ,
we got their distress call...

789
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:38,954
Wish we couId have been here sooner.

790
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:40,497
Our truck got shot to shit.

791
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,124
Mind giving us a ride back to your base?

792
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,375
No problem.

793
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:46,211
But we do have to make a stop first.

794
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:48,839
As you can see we're an MP-unit.

795
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:51,175
Have some prisoners to drop off.

796
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:53,385
We're not picky, sir.

797
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:56,013
Carver, Aikens...
get the 50 caI off the truck.

798
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:58,599
Lt. Diggs,
make some room for these guys.

799
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:10,736
C'mon sarge.

800
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:12,404
Don't be such a tough guy.

801
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:13,614
We're almost home.

802
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:16,450
A little Morphine'll knock
that pain right out.

803
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:19,912
Yeah, things got
a bit active back there, huh?

804
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:28,795
You know, we Iost a good man today
because of you fucking Johnny Jihads...

805
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:34,801
We kill enough soldiers,
America Will lose its stomach for Iraq.

806
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,470
It is your history.

807
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:39,389
Your Engllsh is pretty good.

808
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:41,892
I was educated in London.

809
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,019
Yeah? What you study?

810
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:45,395
Bomb making?

811
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:46,647
Beheadings?

812
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:48,065
Baby killings?

813
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:49,983
Law, actually.

814
00:58:51,152 --> 00:58:52,694
Aw, that's fucking hllarious.

815
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:55,614
You kill our boys. We kill yours.

816
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,449
Kids are butchering kids.

817
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:58,492
For what?

818
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:00,661
Explain it to me, huh?

819
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:02,496
It is a Holy War.

820
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:06,291
Talk to Allah. Not me, crusader.

821
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:08,377
God wants you dead.

822
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:10,629
We were safer under Sadaam.

823
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:12,381
That I know.

824
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,216
And so do my people.

825
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:17,386
You only brought more terror
to our country.

826
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:18,971
Not Iess.

827
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:21,557
After 9-11 , we gotta take the fight
to the enemy.

828
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:24,935
And Sadam was our enemy,
but why do YOU have to be our enemy,

829
00:59:25,436 --> 00:59:28,021
Because of my brother's wedding party!

830
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:33,485
Bombed by you, by mistake,
or such was the cIaim.

831
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:36,363
My brother was no insurgent,

832
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:41,243
no, he belleved in you
and you killed him.

833
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:47,416
You killed my parents, my cousins,
but you missed me.

834
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:49,459
And that was your mistake,

835
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:53,547
for I Will fight
you now until my last breath.

836
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:30,542
This place Iooks like a
fucking dog kenneI.

837
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:36,173
These guys are all severely dehydrated..
Jesus.

838
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:39,134
Come on, Jackson, let's move, man.

839
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:41,386
There's no insignia
on these uniforms, sir.

840
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:45,015
CIA and its contractors run Camp Zebra.

841
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:48,518
It's for ghost detainees-
high-vaIue interrogations

842
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:51,021
of guys the Pentagon
wants kept off the books,

843
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:54,941
but that is strictly off the record,
Alright?

844
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:56,568
Yes.
-Come on, let's go.

845
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:18,298
Allow me to introduce myself.

846
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:22,844
I'm Comandante Fredrico Cruz de Ia Roha.

847
01:01:23,596 --> 01:01:25,013
I am a warrrior.

848
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:28,725
But my battIefield is here, with you.

849
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:33,355
My skills are extraction of information.

850
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:37,317
So, I Will share my knowIedge with you,

851
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:39,903
and you Will share
your knowIedge with me...

852
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:44,491
...sooner or later, that I promise you.

853
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:49,079
With the soldiers we are losing
to these despicabIe IED's,

854
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:52,874
We have orders to push
the envelope of interogation.

855
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:54,835
And the Geneva Convention?

856
01:01:55,002 --> 01:01:57,045
Does not apply here at Camp Zebra.

857
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:59,131
These are not prisoners of war.

858
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:00,841
These are terrorists.

859
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:25,198
Information!

860
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:33,206
Information.

861
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:35,083
Talk to me.

862
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:44,176
Sgt. Wlikes, can you make sure
that water gets on our trucks, please?

863
01:02:48,222 --> 01:02:51,016
Sir, this place, don't it bother you?

864
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:53,018
It's not my call, Jackson, Alright?

865
01:02:53,227 --> 01:02:54,853
They're in charge of interrogation.

866
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:55,771
We're transport.

867
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:57,647
He's got his orders
just like I've got mine.

868
01:02:57,815 --> 01:02:58,565
That's bullshit.

869
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:02,527
I've buried some fine men, Alright.

870
01:03:03,404 --> 01:03:04,738
And you're gonna too.

871
01:03:05,656 --> 01:03:09,242
If we can bury fewer of them,
that is a good thing, Jackson.

872
01:03:11,537 --> 01:03:12,788
That's a good thing.

873
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:40,273
Sarge, I got a big problem here.

874
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:44,361
Lt. Banning brought these prisoners here
for interrogation

875
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:51,284
Shit, this place...it's into beatings
and torture and shit like that.

876
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:55,121
Sorry son, I'm Iosin' it.

877
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,874
You have my command now.

878
01:03:58,876 --> 01:04:00,710
He's fine. It's just the morphine.

879
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:06,967
So what, if it saves one American llfe,
who cares, right?

880
01:04:07,134 --> 01:04:08,093
Yeah, Iook at what they did to Sgt.

881
01:04:08,302 --> 01:04:09,010
STalker, man.

882
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:10,428
And the sarge.

883
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:13,056
Never mind what's been happening to us
all fucking day.

884
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:15,058
Fuck them, man. They deserve it.

885
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:17,185
This ain't about them...

886
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:20,021
It's about us.

887
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:25,694
That we stand for something...
or we don't.

888
01:04:26,779 --> 01:04:29,906
We got a code
of uniform mllitary justice

889
01:04:30,074 --> 01:04:34,870
that says this type of shit don't fIy,

890
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:40,792
we have a duty not to walk away.

891
01:04:50,928 --> 01:04:51,928
Fuck it.

892
01:04:56,183 --> 01:04:57,475
I'll go it alone.

893
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:00,645
You're not going alone.

894
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:03,690
I'm not going to llve with this.

895
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,233
No fucking way.

896
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:11,197
You know what, Jackson,
I do stand for something.

897
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:13,491
This isn't it.

898
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:15,952
Let's go.

899
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:22,584
Carv?

900
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:23,960
Where the fuck you going?

901
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:28,506
They always got my back,
right? always.

902
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:31,843
But who the fuck has your back
all the time?

903
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:33,970
I do.

904
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:37,641
Serious man, so fuck it.

905
01:05:45,149 --> 01:05:46,274
Watch the sarge.

906
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,777
You're putting yourseIf
into a world of hurt, doc.

907
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:50,111
Maybe.

908
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:53,406
But I know right from wrong, Billy.

909
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:55,033
This is wrong.

910
01:05:55,785 --> 01:06:00,080
And if it's crossing the llne...
then fuck the line!

911
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:09,631
We're being smart, dude.

912
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:14,844
What are you doing, Jackson?

913
01:06:15,012 --> 01:06:16,846
Sir, you do not
have to be a part of this.

914
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:18,223
Part of what?

915
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:27,232
Cut him down.

916
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,024
Weapons down! Now!

917
01:06:28,192 --> 01:06:29,109
Weapons on the fIoor.

918
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,905
What in God's name are you doing,
soldiers?

919
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:35,740
Rellevin' you of your command.

920
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:37,701
I work for the CIA.

921
01:06:37,868 --> 01:06:40,745
You have no authority over me
whatsoever!

922
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:42,414
I say I do.

923
01:06:42,748 --> 01:06:44,833
Guess we'll be sortin'
that shit out Iater, huh?

924
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:47,502
You are making the biggest mistake
of your llfe, soldier.

925
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:48,670
All of you.

926
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:50,714
If you walk out that door
with MY prisoner --

927
01:06:51,799 --> 01:06:54,009
He is no longer your prisoner.

928
01:06:54,635 --> 01:06:58,430
The entire weight of The Agency
Will fall on your heads -

929
01:06:58,597 --> 01:07:00,015
-- all your heads -

930
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:01,891
and for what?

931
01:07:02,476 --> 01:07:03,560
For your enemy?

932
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:04,769
It's insane!

933
01:07:04,937 --> 01:07:08,898
No, this is our duty --

934
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:12,193
Banning,
you're just going to stand there?

935
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:14,112
Let's go.

936
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:15,488
Banning...

937
01:07:16,073 --> 01:07:17,490
Let's go! Move it!

938
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:18,658
Move!

939
01:07:30,337 --> 01:07:33,423
Sir, just tell your commander
that we took your vehicles at gunpoint

940
01:07:33,632 --> 01:07:34,841
You're right for doing this.

941
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:37,469
I'll round up my men,
you get the prisoners out of their cells

942
01:07:37,678 --> 01:07:38,636
and we'll get the hell out of here.

943
01:07:38,846 --> 01:07:40,764
Sorry I put you in this position, sir.

944
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:42,891
I never liked this place, Jackson.

945
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:44,100
I hope you know that.

946
01:07:44,268 --> 01:07:45,435
I'll see you out there.

947
01:07:47,188 --> 01:07:49,481
Move! Let's go! Front of the gates.

948
01:07:49,982 --> 01:07:50,982
Nice work, Doc.

949
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:52,150
Keys, where they at?

950
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:53,401
Weapons down!

951
01:07:53,652 --> 01:07:55,320
How about you guys first?

952
01:07:55,988 --> 01:07:59,074
Put it down...nice and sIow.

953
01:07:59,784 --> 01:08:01,284
You'll never get away with this.

954
01:08:01,452 --> 01:08:03,078
Get the fuck in there and shut up.

955
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:24,224
Okay, your ribs are cracked.

956
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:28,019
It won't take the pain away,

957
01:08:28,562 --> 01:08:31,022
but at Ieast the pain
Will Iet you know you're Still allve.

958
01:08:37,905 --> 01:08:38,905
Hold on a second.

959
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:40,573
Private, see what we've got up here.

960
01:08:43,327 --> 01:08:44,285
Turn right! Turn right!

961
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:47,914
Do not turn, I repeat Lieutenant,
do not turn! It's an ambush.

962
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:56,673

Group! Get to cover in the warehouse!

965
01:09:22,366 --> 01:09:23,741
Move! Cover's this way!

966
01:09:23,909 --> 01:09:25,660
Go! Go!
Get to cover! Go! Go!

967
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:27,287
No, we've got to keep moving!

968
01:09:27,454 --> 01:09:28,621
We're in a kill zone!

969
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:30,290
Take cover!

970
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:34,878
Pena, Romeo, guard the fIank!

971
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:41,426
The bastards
ain't killing us today, man.

972
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:42,218
Not today.

973
01:09:42,386 --> 01:09:43,094
Move me by the door.

974
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:44,679
Sarge, don't push it --

975
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:47,557
Shut the fuck up, Doc!
Morphine's kicked in.

976
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:48,808
That's an order.

977
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:53,771
Lieutenant, we need a perimeter.

978
01:09:55,482 --> 01:09:58,234
Sargeant Wlikes,
give me a defensive perimeter.

979
01:09:58,402 --> 01:09:59,944
Take some men. Go! Now!

980
01:10:00,112 --> 01:10:02,405
Kelly, Cooper! Now! Now! Now!

981
01:10:05,075 --> 01:10:06,034
Doc, come here!

982
01:10:06,243 --> 01:10:06,910
Oh, Jesus Christ!

983
01:10:07,077 --> 01:10:08,036
Come on.

984
01:10:14,793 --> 01:10:16,252
They're walking rounds in on us.

985
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:17,962
Ain't no job for MP's.

986
01:10:18,172 --> 01:10:19,797
Nah man, it's a caIvary thing?

987
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:21,841
Give me a heads up and I'll go with you.

988
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:23,593
I'm so tired of carrying your ass.

989
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:24,844
Bullshit!

990
01:10:26,263 --> 01:10:27,931
Ro, keep an eye on Troy.

991
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:30,892
Pena, you're with me.
Let's go.

992
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,101
Move it!

993
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:41,778
Put pressure on that.

994
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:43,488
Put your hand on it, goddamnit!

995
01:10:43,989 --> 01:10:47,158
Christ, take this and wrap it
around his Ieg, he's fucking fine.

996
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:07,553
Hey, those are our sniper boys.

997
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:12,892
Robin, Sallnsky, we got men down.

998
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:14,143
Move on it! Move!

999
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:31,411
Got to get you up.

1000
01:11:31,578 --> 01:11:32,954
Got to get you to safety.

1001
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:39,294
Deke! Deke! I'm coming.

1002
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:11,492
Doc, you got to save him.

1003
01:12:11,702 --> 01:12:12,744
Move! Move! Move!

1004
01:12:12,911 --> 01:12:13,953
He's been hurt bad! ReaI bad!

1005
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:15,371
Fix him up, doc.

1006
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:16,080
Take it easy.

1007
01:12:16,248 --> 01:12:17,498
Carver...

1008
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:21,502
What have we got, buddy?

1009
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:23,713
What have we got?

1010
01:12:23,922 --> 01:12:26,049
Jesus fucking Christ!

1011
01:12:26,216 --> 01:12:27,383
Sarge...

1012
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:33,723
Was it worth it, sarge?

1013
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:38,811
Carver, fight it, please.

1014
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:42,732
please say goodbye to my little brother.

1015
01:12:43,567 --> 01:12:45,985
Dog, don't go...fight it dog. Fight it!

1016
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:50,907
Fight it, please!

1017
01:12:55,496 --> 01:12:57,789
please, Carver...

1018
01:12:57,956 --> 01:12:58,289
Hold him down!

1019
01:12:58,457 --> 01:12:59,499
Someone Hold him down!

1020
01:12:59,666 --> 01:13:00,833
Do something!

1021
01:13:04,171 --> 01:13:04,754
We're all here with you.

1022
01:13:04,963 --> 01:13:05,755
We're all here with you, Deke.

1023
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:06,381
We're all here with you, buddy.

1024
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:07,673
We're all here.

1025
01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:23,398
Deke!

1026
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:24,607
He's gone.

1027
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:27,860
Fuck!

1028
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:31,406
Goddamn this place to hell.

1029
01:13:31,615 --> 01:13:36,327
There ain't one thing in this place
that was worth Deke.

1030
01:13:38,038 --> 01:13:39,372
Not one!

1031
01:13:42,042 --> 01:13:43,167
Not one.

1032
01:13:51,885 --> 01:13:54,220
How the fuck am I gonna make it
through without him now?

1033
01:13:57,182 --> 01:13:58,141
I can't.

1034
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:01,185
I'm fuckin' fucked.

1035
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:07,024
Craig...

1036
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:16,284
You Still got us...

1037
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:19,120
all of us.

1038
01:14:25,043 --> 01:14:26,627
Jackson...
-Yeah?

1039
01:14:27,171 --> 01:14:29,088
I need a help. Now!

1040
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:42,768
Sorry doc.

1041
01:14:44,104 --> 01:14:45,188
The other ones need you.

1042
01:14:45,355 --> 01:14:46,439
We got to go.

1043
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:48,065
It never ends.

1044
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:50,359
There's no fucking rest.

1045
01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:07,001
Lieutenant...

1046
01:15:10,005 --> 01:15:11,923
Sir, with all these bombs,

1047
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:14,050
fighters Will be drawn here like
flles to shit.

1048
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,219
Doc'll do what he can
to stabllize your guys

1049
01:15:16,428 --> 01:15:17,887
but after that we gotta jump.

1050
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:19,096
Bombs chewed us up, sir.

1051
01:15:19,306 --> 01:15:20,973
If the fighters come,
our llnes won't Hold.

1052
01:15:21,808 --> 01:15:25,228
Okay, then let's saddle up.

1053
01:15:26,021 --> 01:15:27,939
Weapons and ammo of the dead, Alright?

1054
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:35,196
Gotta work fucking miracles here.

1055
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:21,701
Doc.

1056
01:16:21,868 --> 01:16:22,451
Yes.

1057
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:24,495
Gimme a shot of adrenaline.

1058
01:16:24,663 --> 01:16:24,954
What?

1059
01:16:25,163 --> 01:16:26,205
You heard me.

1060
01:16:26,373 --> 01:16:28,666
I gotta be sharp. Come on.

1061
01:16:29,209 --> 01:16:32,920
But sarge, the crash from
an adrenaline surge couId kill you.

1062
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:34,672
And most likeIy Will.

1063
01:16:35,674 --> 01:16:38,050
You can stick your diagnosis up
your ass.

1064
01:16:38,218 --> 01:16:40,511
Just do it. That's an order.

1065
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:42,847
That's an order?

1066
01:16:43,181 --> 01:16:45,308
Fine, but you know what, sarge?

1067
01:16:45,475 --> 01:16:46,475
We survive this shit?

1068
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:48,185
You get my ass transferred.

1069
01:16:48,395 --> 01:16:51,314
I'm through being a fucking medic.
I hate it.

1070
01:16:51,773 --> 01:16:54,775
I been seeing my guys

1071
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:55,484
Okay.

1072
01:16:55,652 --> 01:16:57,612
I'm not cut out for this shit.

1073
01:16:59,323 --> 01:17:01,866
I got the bodies of good friends
to prove it.

1074
01:17:02,826 --> 01:17:03,868
Fuck, come on.

1075
01:17:07,331 --> 01:17:09,999
Your shot? Here's your goddamned shot.

1076
01:17:11,084 --> 01:17:13,210
Steady. Steady, doc.

01:17:14,796 --> 01:17:15,296
Hold that.

1078
01:17:15,505 --> 01:17:17,381
Hold Still or
you're going to fucking get it.

1079
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:19,925
You're doin' great,

1080
01:17:21,762 --> 01:17:23,387
and you got nothing but talent.

1081
01:17:24,514 --> 01:17:25,848
Don't ever forget that.

1082
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:30,770
But you ain't God and onIy
He couIda saved Ron and Deke,

1083
01:17:30,937 --> 01:17:32,647
so stop Talking shit.

1084
01:17:33,690 --> 01:17:35,524
I'm Still breathing because of you.

1085
01:17:35,692 --> 01:17:37,109
Did you forget about that?

1086
01:17:37,361 --> 01:17:38,569
I know I didn't.

1087
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:55,044
IED!

1088
01:17:55,212 --> 01:17:56,921
Look for survivors, doc! Go!

1089
01:17:57,798 --> 01:17:59,090
Pena, cover me!

1090
01:17:59,299 --> 01:18:01,092
Shoot anything that moves!

1091
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:03,427
Your guys did this!

1092
01:18:03,637 --> 01:18:04,887
It was your guys that did this!

1093
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:14,313
Fuck.

1094
01:18:26,576 --> 01:18:27,702
How many men do I have dead?

1095
01:18:28,912 --> 01:18:30,705
How many men do I have dead, Jackson?

1096
01:18:31,915 --> 01:18:33,124
I want to see my men.

1097
01:19:05,449 --> 01:19:08,617
I promised my men
I'd bring them home safe, Jackson...

1098
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:12,371
I promised their famllies
I'd bring them home...

1099
01:19:17,502 --> 01:19:19,462
I promised that I would...

1100
01:19:20,672 --> 01:19:22,548
...take care of them for them...

1101
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:28,179
They were just weekend warriors,
for Chrissakes.

1102
01:19:30,265 --> 01:19:32,516
They wanted to help out with floods
and emergencies back home,

1103
01:19:32,684 --> 01:19:34,769
not fight a war in Iraq...

1104
01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:40,316
and I commanded them,
and I got them killed.

1105
01:19:44,988 --> 01:19:47,448
How am I going to explain
this back home,

1106
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:58,834
I wish I had answers for you
but I don't.

1107
01:20:01,838 --> 01:20:07,635
We were trying to do right thing
by these prisoners,

1108
01:20:08,929 --> 01:20:09,929
and instead...

1109
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:12,431
Shit!

1110
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:22,066
They were better off
in those fucking cages.

1111
01:20:23,401 --> 01:20:24,443
Goddamn!

1112
01:20:30,534 --> 01:20:33,994
Good intentions don't mean shit here.

1113
01:20:40,168 --> 01:20:43,170
We'll call graves,
they'll take care of the bodies.

1114
01:20:44,965 --> 01:20:46,924
But we gotta get out of here now.

1115
01:20:48,718 --> 01:20:49,718
Okay.

1116
01:20:53,974 --> 01:20:57,351
We have to help ourseIves, Lieutenant.

1117
01:20:59,813 --> 01:21:03,607
Because no one is coming to save us.

1118
01:21:07,737 --> 01:21:08,821
Not today.

1119
01:21:10,657 --> 01:21:11,198
Let's go.

1120
01:21:11,408 --> 01:21:12,408
Okay.

1121
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:15,202
Pena, guys...let's go.

1122
01:21:55,118 --> 01:21:56,577
This shit's not going to stop.

1123
01:21:59,247 --> 01:22:00,915
Your boys did your best for them.

1124
01:22:02,125 --> 01:22:03,918
But right now it's time to make it ready

1125
01:22:04,502 --> 01:22:05,961
Eyes and ears are everywhere

1126
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:09,340
These fucks want us,

1127
01:22:11,051 --> 01:22:12,468
Iet them come get us.

1128
01:22:20,435 --> 01:22:21,685
I'm sick of this shit.

1129
01:22:22,896 --> 01:22:25,606
Deke's dead...STalker's dead...

1130
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:27,566
And we're Probably dead too.

1131
01:22:28,401 --> 01:22:29,735
And for what, Sarge?

1132
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:34,156
I joined up 'cause of 9-11 and WMDs,

1133
01:22:34,532 --> 01:22:36,951
and Iraq ain't got shit to do
with neither one.

1134
01:22:38,203 --> 01:22:40,746
Iraq don't mean a goddamn thing to me,
sarge!

1135
01:22:40,914 --> 01:22:42,623
Not a goddamn thing.

1136
01:22:42,874 --> 01:22:45,125
You ain't fightin' for Iraq, numbnuts.

1137
01:22:45,877 --> 01:22:52,174
You're fightin' for Romeo and Aikens,
and us and these Ohio boys

1138
01:22:52,342 --> 01:22:55,594
and Iraq just happens to be the place
where we have our sorry asses.

1139
01:22:56,096 --> 01:22:58,639
This ain't nothin', you hear me?

1140
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:01,100
Just keep your shit focused.

1141
01:23:01,267 --> 01:23:03,644
Training and muscIememory
Will take care of the rest.

1142
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:08,232
Today ain't gonna be over
for a long time, man.

1143
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:12,152
It's going to last, dogs.

1144
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:44,601
Hey sarge, check it out.

1145
01:23:45,937 --> 01:23:47,604
Doc, get me up.

1146
01:23:51,276 --> 01:23:53,402
Jackson...check it out.

1147
01:23:55,989 --> 01:23:57,364
Shit.

1148
01:23:58,491 --> 01:24:02,494
Fuck, this place has no fucking mercy,
does it.

1149
01:24:02,662 --> 01:24:04,496
Think they can smell blood, sarge?

1150
01:24:05,373 --> 01:24:10,461
Because it's like they're trackin us
like woIves...like fucking woIves.

1151
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:13,297
We'll never outrun 'em,
not in this truck.

1152
01:24:13,506 --> 01:24:14,798
And we're short on ammo.

1153
01:24:15,633 --> 01:24:18,135
Jackson...what do you think?

1154
01:24:18,803 --> 01:24:23,390
I don't know about you guys,
but I'm tired of runnin'.

1155
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:24,933
Me too.

1156
01:24:26,853 --> 01:24:31,690
Lt. Banning, we got troubIe on our ass,
here's the plan, sir...

1157
01:24:53,963 --> 01:24:55,089
Open fire!

1158
01:25:28,706 --> 01:25:30,124
Johnson, more ammo, hurry up!

1159
01:25:53,106 --> 01:25:54,189
Lieutenant!

1160
01:26:04,367 --> 01:26:05,659
Johnson, I need a mag!

1161
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:10,831
Johnson, stay Iow!

1162
01:26:19,591 --> 01:26:20,757
Johnson, I'm out!

1163
01:26:28,099 --> 01:26:30,142
Johnson!
-That's it. I'm out!

1164
01:29:31,032 --> 01:29:32,115
Choke on it!

1165
01:29:32,283 --> 01:29:34,326
You piece of shit! Die!

1166
01:30:05,983 --> 01:30:06,608
What do you got?

1167
01:30:06,776 --> 01:30:08,402
What do you got, huh?

1168
01:30:13,282 --> 01:30:15,075
Fuck! Fuck!

1169
01:31:03,666 --> 01:31:06,126
Doc! Come check out the sarge.

1170
01:31:13,426 --> 01:31:15,510
Alright, what you do to yourself now?

1171
01:31:16,596 --> 01:31:19,181
Come on, hurry up,
Doc, take a look at it.

1172
01:31:21,434 --> 01:31:24,311
Lieutenant,
we got to move these men out.

1173
01:31:48,711 --> 01:31:49,836
What do you see?

1174
01:31:50,963 --> 01:31:52,422
It's not too bad.

1175
01:31:54,175 --> 01:31:55,258
Incoming!

1176
01:32:00,681 --> 01:32:02,015
You got a gift, doc.

1177
01:32:03,351 --> 01:32:04,392
Use it.

1178
01:32:05,561 --> 01:32:06,686
Stay down!

1179
01:32:07,647 --> 01:32:08,730
Sarge, no!

1180
01:32:08,898 --> 01:32:10,357
Okay, mother fuckers!

1181
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:12,150
What are you doing?
Sarge

1182
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:13,401
What you got? Huh?

1183
01:32:13,569 --> 01:32:14,611
Sarge

1184
01:32:21,577 --> 01:32:22,661
Hey, sarge!

1185
01:32:23,287 --> 01:32:24,329
Sarge?

1186
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:38,802
No! No! No! No!

1187
01:32:44,767 --> 01:32:45,976
No!

1188
01:32:53,442 --> 01:32:55,193
I falled you, sarge.

1189
01:32:59,282 --> 01:33:01,199
The mission was to save you.

1190
01:33:01,951 --> 01:33:06,871
And my best wasn't good enough.

1191
01:33:09,834 --> 01:33:13,795
Look sarge...he went out like he lived,

1192
01:33:14,005 --> 01:33:15,630
y'know, with the heart of a llon.

1193
01:33:16,924 --> 01:33:18,425
We gotta have heart too...

1194
01:33:19,719 --> 01:33:22,429
you know, we owe him that.

1195
01:33:31,647 --> 01:33:32,981
All this shit...

1196
01:33:35,401 --> 01:33:36,735
all I did...

1197
01:33:40,406 --> 01:33:41,615
we all did...

1198
01:33:44,577 --> 01:33:45,952
it was for nothing...

1199
01:33:47,079 --> 01:33:48,955
it was for fucking nothing!

1200
01:33:56,130 --> 01:33:58,673
No...

1201
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:02,218
you saved him, doc,

1202
01:34:04,305 --> 01:34:06,473
you saved him
so he couId save all of us.

1203
01:34:08,225 --> 01:34:09,851
and that's not nothin'.

1204
01:34:14,398 --> 01:34:16,733
and Sarge woulda been the first
to tell you that.

1205
01:34:29,205 --> 01:34:30,413
We need a perimeter.

1206
01:34:32,291 --> 01:34:37,295
Craig, those guys had M-16's,
so that means they have ammo.

1207
01:34:38,464 --> 01:34:39,589
Find it.

1208
01:34:59,819 --> 01:35:02,779
I want him turned over to competent
military authority

1209
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:04,989
...and treated right.

1210
01:35:05,157 --> 01:35:06,491
You have my word.

1211
01:35:07,159 --> 01:35:09,661
Lieutenant, thanks for the Humvee.

1212
01:35:10,287 --> 01:35:12,580
I'll turn your men over to graves.

1213
01:35:54,915 --> 01:35:56,583
This fucking place.

1214
01:35:58,919 --> 01:36:00,378
It ain't nothin'.

1215
01:36:04,967 --> 01:36:09,596
We just gotta make our lives
count for somethin'.

1216
01:36:13,893 --> 01:36:15,852
We did our duty today...

1217
01:36:17,938 --> 01:36:19,189
we're soldiers...

1218
01:36:20,983 --> 01:36:22,275
that's ourjob.

1219
01:36:24,987 --> 01:36:26,196
That's ourjob.

1220
01:36:32,244 --> 01:36:33,620
Let's go.

1221
01:37:15,162 --> 01:37:16,621
The Department Of Defense

1222
01:37:16,831 --> 01:37:19,290
has confirmed the deaths of
the following American soldiers killed

1223
01:37:19,458 --> 01:37:20,542
in Iraq on April 12, 2004:DELVECCH

1224
01:37:20,751 --> 01:37:22,377
' 'The greatest treasure
the United States

1225
01:37:22,586 --> 01:37:24,212
has is our enlisted men and women.

1226
01:37:24,421 --> 01:37:26,714
When we put them in harms way,
it had better count
