1
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,681
<i>I had this plan.</i>
<i>Study hard in private school.</i>

2
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,248
<i>Study harder in medical school.</i>
<i>Make everyone proud.</i>

3
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:46,022
<i>Make a new life</i>
<i>far from the old neighborhood.</i>

4
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,731
<i>But fighting my sister Pam's addiction</i>
<i>took everything my parents had,</i>

5
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,704
<i>including my boarding school</i>
<i>tuition money.</i>

6
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:57,503
<i>And after Pam died,</i>
<i>I had no choice but to return home.</i>

7
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:07,076
<i>But I won't be there for long.</i>
<i>I have a plan to get back.</i>

8
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:11,817
<i>My private school scholarship exam.</i>
<i>I've only got weeks to prep.</i>

9
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:14,223
<i>But I'll do what I have to.</i>

10
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,339
<i>It's funny, isn't it?</i>

11
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:34,607
<i>How one moment</i>
<i>changes a million after it.</i>

12
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:49,255
You tell that bitch to stay there,
you hear?

13
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,421
Yo, you think I'm playing?

14
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:09,142
<i>Nice. Nice. Do it again. Do it again.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

15
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:15,351
<i>Come on, Little Ray.</i>
<i>That's it, Raya. Like that.</i>

16
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:17,620
<i>Nice.</i>

17
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:24,454
<i>Pamela Elizabeth Green will be</i>
<i>remembered by her father, David...</i>

18
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:25,758
Be strong, Faye.

19
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:30,234
<i>... her mother, Faye,</i>
<i>and by her younger sister, Raya.</i>

20
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:34,139
<i>May she rest in peace.</i>

21
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:15,971
No. No necklace, no locket.

22
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:18,243
Look, I'm telling you,
she didn't bring it in to me.

23
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,182
She's brought half our apartment
in here, Mike,

24
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:21,753
so don't play dumb with me.

25
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:24,516
I mean, this isn't a stupid TV
or stereo, all right?

26
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:27,149
It's my grandmother's antique locket.

27
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,195
Pam gave it to me.
I have to get that back.

28
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:31,524
What can I tell you, kid?

29
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:34,566
The Lord giveth,
the junkie pawn-eth away.

30
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:12,266
<i>I love my boots! My boots!</i>
<i>Oh, I love my boots!</i>

31
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:16,934
<i>I love my hard stomping, head nodding</i>
<i>J Street boots!</i>

32
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:22,003
<i>I love my boots, my boots!</i>
<i>Oh, I love my boots!</i>

33
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:26,313
<i>I love my hard stomping, head nodding</i>
<i>J Street boots!</i>

34
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,751
<i>This ain't no ordinary crew!</i>

35
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,848
<i>They know how we do!</i>

36
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:38,025
<i>J Street makes the crowd go "Ooh!"</i>

37
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,699
<i>Jane Street, you all ready?</i>

38
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,393
S'up, Little P?

39
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:49,167
<i>I love my hard stomping, head nodding</i>
<i>J Street boots!</i>

40
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:54,235
<i>I love my boots, my boots!</i>
<i>Oh, I love my boots!</i>

41
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:59,444
<i>I love my hard stomping, head nodding</i>
<i>J Street boots!</i>

42
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:02,277
<i>This is ain't no ordinary crew!</i>

43
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:06,685
<i>They know how we do!</i>

44
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,161
<i>J Street make the crowd go "Ooh!"</i>

45
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,361
<i>Jane Street, you all ready?</i>

46
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,368
<i>We're ready!</i>

47
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:35,076
<i>Raise the ruckus for 5KO!</i>

48
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,389
Let's do it.

49
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:46,391
You care for my crew,
you'd have something to show for it.

50
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:49,059
- Garvey Gaines.
- What's going on, B?

51
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:51,796
- See you on back on our home court.
- Yeah, I came to check out your steps,

52
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:54,532
but I guess you're saving the good stuff
for Step Monster, huh?

53
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,902
Look, if you and the Brooklyn boys

54
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:57,737
wanna go up there
and do your step thing,

55
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:01,473
then by all means knock yourself out,
but we cool right here.

56
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:05,449
Keep holding onto this dead weight,
you're going to sink, bro.

57
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,586
Whoa, whoa, what's up? What's up?
What, you lost or something?

58
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:17,891
Just 'cause I'm not out here looking
for you, doesn't mean I'm lost, Bishop.

59
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,522
So, so what, they give you time off
from that rich school?

60
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:23,466
Something like that.
You guys were good in there.

61
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:28,405
That was just a warm-up.
You wanna see the full effect,

62
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,942
you better come up the street
and check us out sometime.

63
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:33,944
And why would I want to do that?

64
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:35,308
Say, why not?

65
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:44,384
Just think about it, all right?

66
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,989
It was wack!

67
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:02,067
Damn. Shit.

68
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:05,143
Hey, Raya, what you doing here?
Missing McCabe?

69
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:07,508
Thought it'd be a good idea
if I came back for a little while.

70
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:10,514
So what? Them stosh girls finally boot
you out of the 'burbs?

71
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:11,776
I just told you, Selia.

72
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,375
Well, don't go slumming
on our account.

73
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,889
I'm looking for two brave
and brilliant volunteers.

74
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:24,724
And, class, please, before anyone asks,
no, you may not go to the bathroom,

75
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,092
you may not go to your locker,

76
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:28,962
but what you can do, however,
is raise your hand up,

77
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:32,765
walk up to the board, and show me
that you've at least learned something

78
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:36,933
since last September. Anyone?

79
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:40,171
How about we give a big round
of applause to our first volunteer?

80
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:43,612
Do I have any volunteers
for contestant number two?

81
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:48,680
- She'll be all right.
- Thank you, Miss Davis. Come on up.

82
00:09:57,296 --> 00:10:01,460
All right. We have one equation.
Use the quadratic form.

83
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:05,059
First person to cross the finish line
will win my utmost admiration.

84
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:07,731
- All right, begin.
- Come, on Miche. Let's go, Miche.

85
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:12,000
Come, on Miche.

86
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:17,879
- Go, go.
- The answer's three!

87
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:21,944
Is this what a $20,000 education
gets you?

88
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:25,990
A tying score with an 18-year-old
who failed this class twice?

89
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,128
Come on, Michey!

90
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,634
Come on, Michey, looking good today!

91
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,270
Win some, Michey!

92
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:49,106
Well, it looks like we got ourselves
a winner.

93
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:50,905
Stop cheating!

94
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,679
The correct answer is two.
How refreshing.

95
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:58,518
Come on, Mister J!
You gotta give Michelle another chance.

96
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,684
Hey, Michelle, quick.
How many fingers?

97
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,427
That was cruel.

98
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,532
So, I got the take from last night.
Here you go.

99
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:12,229
Gotta go pay the rent,
and get some food.

100
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,572
Man, what happened to your job?

101
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,734
Come on, baby. You know I'm too pretty
for minimum wage, man.

102
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,141
- This all the money we got?
- What?

103
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:23,306
That warehouse was pack up.
I seen nuff of them dropping $50 bets.

104
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,782
Yo, you don't you think
I'm sick of Niko's five dollar shit, too?

105
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,409
This... Let's go deal
with that bitch, man.

106
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,579
What are we waiting on?
I know where he stay.

107
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,783
Yo, I told you I ain't about to catch
a case on account of nobody.

108
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:36,259
We got the warehouse coming up.
That's always a payday, right?

109
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:41,292
Man, what I tell you
about messing up my shit, man?

110
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,063
I been working on your step.

111
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,935
Just go stick another book up your ass,

112
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,667
and keep out of big people's business.

113
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:51,572
B, handle your brother, man.

114
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:58,414
Seriously, B, you need to run
some CSI shit on that boy

115
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:00,951
'cause one of you was adopted.

116
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:06,355
- Raya, Raya. What's up?
- Hey.

117
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,051
It's fine.

118
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:12,287
I think Michelle is losing her man.

119
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:14,657
How can you lose what you don't have?

120
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:17,497
I really hope you don't think
I can't hear you.

121
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:25,341
Hey, I was just asking where I could
find you.

122
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,876
- Listen, about that thing in class...
- What thing?

123
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,382
You know what? Forget it.

124
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:36,747
It's impressive, man.

125
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,518
It's been like, what, three years, and
you've still got that quick exit down.

126
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,786
- Come on, Miche. Just cool it.
- That's your issue?

127
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:44,795
I didn't hang around here doing nothing
and going nowhere with you?

128
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,455
So what, you came back here
to show us

129
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:49,295
nothing, nowhere people something?

130
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:53,167
So then come now.
Come show me a little something.

131
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,538
This is stupid.

132
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:09,715
All right. You think your step is better
than mine? Show me.

133
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:08,744
Whatever.

134
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:39,640
And on that nowhere nothing tip,
that shit's in your family line, not mine!

135
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:46,247
Hey! That's enough.

136
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:50,818
- Get off me!
- That's it! Enough!

137
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:06,565
It's a little late for that,
don't you think, Miss Green?

138
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:10,569
And you, Miss Davis. Do you know
how close you are to expulsion?

139
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,507
- Very.
- Very.

140
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:20,979
Impressive transcripts.
Any ideas on future plans?

141
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:24,647
Med School. Probably Johns Hopkins.

142
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,623
- Seaton turns out a ton of Ivy Leaguers.
- Good.

143
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:30,786
65 percent of our students
go on to higher education.

144
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:33,296
That's nice for your students.

145
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:35,330
Well, Dr. Green.

146
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:39,167
Miss Davis here is on the brink
of academic disaster.

147
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,364
And you're going in
on a rescue mission.

148
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:42,906
Excuse me?

149
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:44,771
Peer tutoring.

150
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,643
There are study areas
reserved in the library.

151
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:50,943
Make sure you turn in the signed forms
at the end of each session.

152
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,952
- I don't need anything from her.
- I expect you both to meet twice a week.

153
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,318
I can't. I've got a scholarship exam
in less than a week.

154
00:15:57,423 --> 00:16:00,824
For a school that won't admit students
with suspensions on their record.

155
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:04,123
That is, of course, your alternative here.

156
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:07,494
Good. So, we're all in agreement, then.

157
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:12,195
Twice a week. Turn in the forms
at the end of each session.

158
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,236
Do you want a ride?

159
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:21,177
The 27 stops a block from my building.
Straight shot.

160
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,942
Okay, so you still
know your way around here, then?

161
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:28,484
So then you know the 27 stops running
after 6:00, right?

162
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:41,994
- Late for something?
- Yeah.

163
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,729
Well, supposed to be home already.

164
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,965
Parents got you on lock-down?
What did you do?

165
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,798
Who has to do anything?

166
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:02,151
- So, yo, that stuff with Michelle?
- Stupid.

167
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:03,721
She may have nothing better
to do with herself,

168
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,221
but I shouldn't let her get to me like that.

169
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:06,586
So that's what you think step is?

170
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,125
Just a bunch of people with nothing
better to do?

171
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:09,990
I never said that!

172
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:12,086
Ray, I'm just saying,
you've got a serious step.

173
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:16,133
You know what I'm saying? A few weeks
with me, you could be dangerous, yo.

174
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:20,101
Bishop, it's done, all right?
Seriously, it doesn't even matter.

175
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:26,369
I thought you said the 27 stopped
running after 6:00?

176
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:31,544
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

177
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:41,554
Raya.

178
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,762
Don't pick a fight
that ain't worth winning.

179
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,559
I'm just saying,
watching you in that shop,

180
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:53,126
I've never seen anybody fight so hard
for something that doesn't even matter.

181
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,331
That's all this place is, Bishop.

182
00:17:55,441 --> 00:18:00,276
A whole lot of people killing themselves
for things that don't even matter.

183
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,616
How you making out?

184
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,123
I'm about 20 minutes off
on the essay part.

185
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,254
But I'll have it down by Friday.

186
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:30,869
She used to love it when you did this.
It made her look so pretty.

187
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:35,706
Looking pretty don't mean anything
if you live dirt.

188
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:07,668
Hey, what's up, pretty girl?

189
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:22,723
Library. Friday. Bring your books.

190
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,124
Look, I don't care what your deal is,

191
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,959
but I'm not about to let you
mess with mine.

192
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:28,225
Is this when I'm supposed to cry?

193
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,598
'Cause, you know, it might take me
a minute to work that up.

194
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,138
Do what you want.

195
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:37,902
I just hope it works out better for you
than it did for my sister.

196
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:52,289
You know, you ain't changed
your hiding spot since third grade.

197
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:56,020
That's why you were always it.
Pam and I could always find you.

198
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,138
Look,

199
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,978
I sort of got this English final tomorrow,

200
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:17,674
and, I mean, if I flunk out,
my moms will...

201
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:21,850
Well, I can't flunk out.

202
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:25,351
I've got this thing at Seaton
in the morning.

203
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:28,893
Just keep it Mondays and Fridays
in study hall, all right?

204
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,829
Right.

205
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:38,201
Wonder why
Pam never asked you for help.

206
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:47,403
When the final buzzer goes,
you will put your pencils down,

207
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:50,948
and turn your exams in
at the front of the room.

208
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:52,311
Ready?

209
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:55,118
Begin.

210
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:12,794
Time! Turn in your exams
at the front of the room.

211
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,381
That was so hard...

212
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:40,097
- No, no, no! Mommy, please!
- No!

213
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:43,190
Please what? Please what, Michelle?

214
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:46,504
You think you're a big woman?
You don't have to take your test then?

215
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:49,733
Well, go on then, big woman!
Go on and get out of me house!

216
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:53,072
Give me another chance,
come on, give me another chance!

217
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:57,778
- I'll take that test over. Please, I swear...
- No!

218
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,575
Rayanne.

219
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:04,122
My goodness, look upon you.
How you do, sweetie?

220
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:07,419
- How are your mommy and daddy?
- They're doing all right.

221
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:11,421
I actually just wanted
to drop these off for Michelle.

222
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,623
She asked me to help
bring her grades up,

223
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:16,826
so I made some review sheets
to get things started.

224
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:23,033
So I'll see you later?

225
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,371
You know where to find me.

226
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:42,723
Rayanne?

227
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:44,721
Hey.

228
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:47,360
I thought you had to work.

229
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:48,524
It was no good.

230
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:51,227
I was sick to my stomach
the whole time you was there.

231
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:52,997
How you think you did?

232
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:55,503
I aced it.

233
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:03,371
Thank you, Jesus!

234
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:07,213
Thank you, Jesus!

235
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:11,714
I told you.
I have everything under control.

236
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:16,519
Oh, my God! That is my girl.

237
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:23,896
So I guess you expect me
to say thanks or something?

238
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:27,597
Oh, God, no.
I'd never make you do a thing like that.

239
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:31,833
So what's up with these math formulas?

240
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:36,638
Raya? Raya.

241
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,374
It's that test, isn't it?

242
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:44,254
So there's absolutely no way
your parents can swing the tuition?

243
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:46,987
Big sis took care of that.

244
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:52,962
Well, maybe you could get
a scholarship or something.

245
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:55,396
Could have, should have, didn't.

246
00:23:56,902 --> 00:24:00,030
Okay, so if you follow
on the review I gave you,

247
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:02,504
- you can see how solving...
- Yo.

248
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:06,474
Me and the girls make a few dollars
at them step comps.

249
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:09,739
And we've been thinking
about bringing on some new blood.

250
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:12,510
- You guys make a lot?
- A little bit here and there.

251
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,346
I mean, top spot makes the most

252
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:17,217
but they always be giving that
to the guy crews.

253
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:31,400
They've got ninth graders
reading Tolstoy?

254
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:32,504
No. They've got ninth graders reading
<i>Death Of A Salesman.</i>

255
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:34,768
No. They've got ninth graders reading
<i>Death Of A Salesman.</i>

256
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:36,704
I'm reading Tolstoy.

257
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,270
Okay.

258
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,746
It's a "disturb and die" policy.

259
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:45,408
But I'm sure it only applies to me.

260
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,197
No, no, no! Whoa, whoa.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

261
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,204
Yo, you guys ain't doing it right, man.

262
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:10,900
Yo, E. <i>C.,</i> come and show them
how it's done.

263
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,203
Ready?

264
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:34,096
You see what I'm saying though, right?

265
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,963
But we've gotta do something
with that last beat, yo. The timing's off.

266
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:40,333
Yeah, but I think we know
who we gotta blame for that.

267
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:42,733
E. <i>C.,</i> is that you want dead?

268
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:45,469
You know what I want is for you to stop
that Ja-faking accent.

269
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:46,601
Thank you.

270
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,474
Everybody know you from
Scarborough. Look at you.

271
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,514
Shut up! You don't know where
my people are from!

272
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:53,550
This Scarborough guy's
still troublesome.

273
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:56,382
Yeah? Yeah? You want some of that?

274
00:25:58,723 --> 00:25:59,815
Let's all break for some eats

275
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:02,758
and we'll come back
and do the damn thing, all right?

276
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:06,262
Yo, I don't think that invite was for you.
Check it out.

277
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:22,307
What? I'm hungry. Now what?

278
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:26,650
It's just... You look like her, that's all.

279
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:32,882
Listen, now, when you gonna come by

280
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:35,824
and let me show you
some of my moves and stuff?

281
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:40,227
I've known you since the fifth grade,
Bishop. I've seen all your moves.

282
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,829
Anyway, the only plan I got time for
right now is a payment plan.

283
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,666
What? Little cash crisis?

284
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:51,401
Little is an understatement,
but I think I might have a solution.

285
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,275
What's up?

286
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:04,313
I wanna be on your crew.
We could win Step Monster.

287
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:06,287
Come on, Raya.

288
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,893
You been to the comps,
you know the deal.

289
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:13,692
The whole mixed team thing?
It don't work like that.

290
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:17,028
Look, I gotta go.

291
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:22,934
You're the one who said
I had a serious step, remember?

292
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:25,874
Was that true, or was that just what you
say when you're trying to hit it?

293
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,342
Get out.

294
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:30,574
Man, she's not going nowhere.
Hurry up!

295
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:32,979
I don't see nothing wrong with a little
bump and grind,

296
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:34,449
but we got some work to do, bro!

297
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:38,010
Yes, I think you got a serious step, okay.
And I wasn't saying that just to hit it.

298
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:39,385
Why don't you just hook up
with Michelle's crew?

299
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,686
You all could take
some local comps easy.

300
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:43,886
But this shit right here, Ray,
is a whole other level.

301
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,622
Just give me a chance!

302
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:49,063
They'll never give top dollar to a
girls' crew. You know that.

303
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:52,068
Bishop! Where you at, man?

304
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,900
- Just give me a minute, man!
- I need this.

305
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:59,935
Bishop? Come now, man!

306
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,041
I can't.

307
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:30,134
He was right, you know.

308
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:32,637
Bishop.

309
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:35,008
Is that a fact, Quincy?

310
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:38,377
It's Quake. And yeah, it is.

311
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,814
Step is one thing,
but stepping the money?

312
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,978
I've been to the cash
competitions before.

313
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:45,352
My sister did it like a hundred times.

314
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:48,017
Oh, yeah? How many times you do it?

315
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:54,825
They got a comp coming up.

316
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,498
They're rehearsing at my uncle's
shop tonight.

317
00:28:57,602 --> 00:28:59,069
Come around 6:30.

318
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,764
- Meet me upstairs.
- Excuse me?

319
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:10,475
I expect more from a Tolstoy fan.

320
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,247
- Wow, this is pretty...
- Neurotic?

321
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:22,326
I was gonna say amazing.

322
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,657
So how many cash comps
have you stepped?

323
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,628
None.

324
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:32,095
Look, Quake, I appreciate you wanting
to help, but I really need this money.

325
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:24,176
Tomorrow morning in the shop.

326
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:27,915
It's a chance, not a guarantee.

327
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:31,778
Seven-thirty.
And don't even think of being late.

328
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:36,616
And you? Clean this shit up
before Uncle C sees it, man.

329
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:49,504
Look, don't I always
have all your backs?

330
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:51,438
We wanna start getting
some outside attention,

331
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:53,407
then we gotta try something new.

332
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:56,605
Bishop, maybe
you got chance in your budget,

333
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:58,409
we ain't got no room for it, B.

334
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:01,246
Look, I've got no problem with you
playing us for what you could score,

335
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:03,343
but don't make your personal issues
my professional problems.

336
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:05,354
Yo, you know it ain't even about that.

337
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:08,289
Look, man, we take the stage with her,
and they kill us, B.

338
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:09,951
Yo, you keep stepping like you been
stepping lately,

339
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:12,495
and I'll kill you my damn self.

340
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:13,922
Ain't that the truth.

341
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:15,590
What you think that don't apply
to you, too?

342
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,534
Yo, maybe you all been laxing it,
but my shit is always tight.

343
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:35,449
All right, yo, get on the hood.
Ray, you take the roof.

344
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:36,781
Take the what?

345
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:40,149
Stand on the roof. E. <i>C.,</i> get on the hood.

346
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:46,094
I got you scared or something,
Ernest Charles?

347
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,663
Trey.

348
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:58,241
Pick it up. Put it into step.
Five, six, seven, eight.

349
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:17,684
Wait, wait, wait, hold up, hold up!

350
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:19,854
Yo, she can't keep up with our speed.

351
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:22,956
She can hear you and she can handle
herself, so let's just do it again.

352
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:26,332
All right, all right. Switch spots,
switch spots, switch spots.

353
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:28,598
- Check it out.
- Yeah.

354
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,267
Yo, Trey. Come again.

355
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:14,011
Holy shit!

356
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:15,949
- Damn!
- Oh, man.

357
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:27,560
You wanna do some damage
on the stage?

358
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:30,099
You better do some damage here first.

359
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:34,102
Yo, Bishop!

360
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:37,368
Get off me, man.

361
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:40,273
I'm done with your shit.
Your team, your steps.

362
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:43,506
Man, what do you think
you'd be without me, huh?

363
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:46,412
It gonna be some shit when you
find out.

364
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:50,317
- Now, E. <i>C.,</i> come on.
- You want your spot? It's all yours!

365
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:53,550
Yo, E?

366
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,351
E!

367
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:03,993
You know, what you all waiting on?
Warm up, man.

368
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,501
Look,

369
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:13,803
me and E.C.
Go back to the sandbox, all right?

370
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:16,607
So this thing, it ain't a thing.

371
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:18,306
Okay?

372
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:23,384
JSJ, let's run it through.

373
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,746
Looks like you got a spot
on Bishop's crew.

374
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:00,721
What, my crew
not good enough for you?

375
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,020
- It's not how it looks.
- Really?

376
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:07,325
'Cause it looks like you's a lying-ass
bitch who can't be trusted for nothing.

377
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:10,495
Well, you can cross me off that
community service list, all right?

378
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:13,570
- Call it time served.
- Michelle, you know my situation.

379
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:16,367
Do you know mine?
Do you know Selia's?

380
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:19,500
You know anyone else's but yours?

381
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:22,010
I'm doing what I have to,
to get out of here.

382
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:25,947
And I wouldn't be a friend if I didn't
tell you, you could do the same.

383
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:31,615
You start making
people like this a habit,

384
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:33,849
and then you're the habit.

385
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,892
And then, you're done.

386
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:40,324
You know why Pam started hanging
around people like this?

387
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:43,366
Because it's too hard
being fake-ass people like you.

388
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:59,005
- Man, what does Garvey want?
- What's up, Bishop?

389
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:01,482
Uncle C,
a special order came in this morning.

390
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:04,919
You think
you could pack that up for me?

391
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:06,421
- Nice boots.
- I'm gonna have to copy that.

392
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:08,253
You really done a lot with the place.

393
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:11,851
Looks like business
is good on every front, doesn't it?

394
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:13,925
What's up, Little P?

395
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:18,127
You know, we all send our condolences
on your sister there.

396
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:22,935
She was one down-ass, bit... homegirl.
Wasn't she, fellows?

397
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,874
Yeah, I used to come check out her
shows. She's no joke up on that stage.

398
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:30,744
Funny. She used to say
the same thing about you.

399
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:33,840
The brothers from Brooklyn
always down for the party,

400
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:36,613
always late for the funeral, homie.

401
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,455
Yo, let's go man.

402
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:46,688
Five to one I take that stage
and put you back in your place, boy.

403
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:50,823
Step Monster Comp.
That boot shit that you do?

404
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:55,133
You think you can play that in Detroit?
Against my crew?

405
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:59,198
Well, I'll put 25 grand on it,
you only gotta come up with five.

406
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:03,505
You put up that 25. We going to come
up with the five grand.

407
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:24,934
Oh, shit.

408
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:28,228
Come on!

409
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:29,567
That's enough.

410
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,510
All right, that's a night.

411
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:38,943
Tomorrow we'll run it from the top
straight through.

412
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,245
Bishop, I was thinking we could add
a couple of steps in the middle.

413
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:43,786
Listen, those lights hit you
Saturday night,

414
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:45,617
you'll be lucky
if you remember your name,

415
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:48,988
never mind some steps you threw in
the night before.

416
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:55,766
Later, man.

417
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:57,800
Hey. Hey.

418
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:03,734
- I just wanna walk you up.
- I don't think that's such a good idea.

419
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,638
Why not?
You earned your spot on the team.

420
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:08,371
It's got nothing to do with nothing else.

421
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:11,975
Things are complicated enough
right now.

422
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:14,580
You and me?

423
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,178
It would just make things harder.

424
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:24,359
So, I'll just... I'll see you at rehearsal.

425
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:31,060
<i>Good golly, Miss Molly</i>
<i>when you walk in</i>

426
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:34,160
<i>I really love it when you come around</i>

427
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:37,104
<i>When you smile when you see me</i>
<i>When you kiss and you see me</i>

428
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,472
<i>When you love it</i>
<i>when you come around</i>

429
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:42,236
- Come here, come here. Come on.
- Hey.

430
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:44,610
Come here. Good golly, Miss...

431
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:47,548
Whoa, whoa! Miss Dance Hall Queen,
come dance with me.

432
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:51,212
David, I'm late, right. Why you always
starting foolishness when I'm late?

433
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:52,755
Oh, come on!

434
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:55,348
Do you know when they'll send back
the test?

435
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:56,756
Probably not for a few weeks.

436
00:39:56,861 --> 00:40:01,195
<i>The plans I have for you this evening</i>
<i>will surely make you smile</i>

437
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:06,634
<i>Plans I have this evening</i>
<i>will turn back the hands of time</i>

438
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,763
<i>I don't know what's come over me</i>

439
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:12,775
<i>Loving you this time</i>

440
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:15,744
<i>Thought I was brave, but you can see</i>

441
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:20,044
<i>I'm showing my nerves this time</i>

442
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:22,847
<i>Good golly Miss Molly</i>
<i>when you walk in</i>

443
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:26,081
Lord, David.
How long you supposed to fix that?

444
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:30,690
It would seem I can't find the time
for it, yeah.

445
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:36,424
I'll take up the whole thing for you
next week.

446
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:40,330
Hey, you want to go to Cousin Bunny

447
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,598
- for some ice cream?
- Yeah?

448
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:44,833
The child has school work to do, David.
Just leave her in peace.

449
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:47,433
What, I can't talk to my daughter?

450
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:54,784
Is now you choose to talk?
What, you just now find your voice?

451
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:56,648
How about when your other child
left school

452
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:59,154
and started running the streets
with them worthless boys?

453
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:02,054
Is me the one
did have voice to talk then!

454
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:06,321
- Jesus.
- Are you okay, Dad?

455
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:09,094
Never mind, Ray Ray.

456
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:12,658
I'll take care of myself.

457
00:41:26,547 --> 00:41:27,514
- I'm hungry, man.
- I feel you, man,

458
00:41:27,615 --> 00:41:31,813
but I can't believe
you eating that shit again.

459
00:41:31,919 --> 00:41:35,548
What you all thought I forgot?
Straight from Kingston, Jamaica.

460
00:41:35,656 --> 00:41:38,056
They call it The Separator.
The men from the boys.

461
00:41:38,158 --> 00:41:40,786
- Man, you all know what I mean.
- Yeah, yeah, we know what you mean.

462
00:41:40,895 --> 00:41:43,762
- Anyways, whoever eats the most, wins.
- Wins what?

463
00:41:43,864 --> 00:41:44,922
My respect.

464
00:41:45,032 --> 00:41:47,694
Great. Give me something
I can actually use.

465
00:41:53,807 --> 00:41:56,105
- Oh, man, you just didn't... No.
- Oh.

466
00:41:58,045 --> 00:41:59,569
You can't just arm wrestle for respect?

467
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,673
This way if you throw up on stage,
you can blame it on something else.

468
00:42:13,227 --> 00:42:15,388
Oh, good God, Q.

469
00:42:18,032 --> 00:42:19,590
It's a little hot.

470
00:42:25,139 --> 00:42:27,733
Tingle on the tongue a little bit?

471
00:42:41,422 --> 00:42:43,049
You all right?

472
00:42:46,026 --> 00:42:48,551
- It was the peppers.
- Yeah.

473
00:42:53,968 --> 00:42:57,233
Bishop! My boy, my boy.

474
00:42:58,238 --> 00:43:02,231
Been talking to my money men all day,
and they say your numbers been sliding.

475
00:43:02,343 --> 00:43:06,109
Word is that a pair of panties
done punked you out.

476
00:43:08,616 --> 00:43:10,345
Is that what the word is, Niko?

477
00:43:10,451 --> 00:43:14,012
- It's on you, boy.
- Always is, Niko.

478
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:25,958
<i>All right, now this next team</i>
<i>that's coming on,</i>

479
00:43:26,066 --> 00:43:28,796
<i>they been in the game</i>
<i>since the game started in T-Dot.</i>

480
00:43:28,902 --> 00:43:32,804
<i>You know, I'm not even going to hold</i>
<i>them up no more. Everybody, give it up</i>

481
00:43:32,906 --> 00:43:36,603
<i>for Black Ice! Come on!</i>

482
00:44:02,936 --> 00:44:04,563
<i>The floor is hot!</i>

483
00:44:05,773 --> 00:44:11,075
<i>All right, JSJ versus Fem Phatal!</i>

484
00:44:11,178 --> 00:44:13,612
<i>Fem Phatal, first to step.</i>

485
00:44:16,617 --> 00:44:19,085
Excuse us, ladies.

486
00:44:21,055 --> 00:44:23,285
This is humiliating, yo.

487
00:44:24,258 --> 00:44:27,091
Yo, don't worry about it, B.
It ain't nothing but easy money.

488
00:44:27,194 --> 00:44:30,425
So make them broke-ass blood-clots
keep talking!

489
00:44:36,804 --> 00:44:38,999
She's cracking our steps.

490
00:44:39,139 --> 00:44:42,472
Man, I told you we shouldn't have let
that bitch up in our space, man!

491
00:45:20,013 --> 00:45:21,275
Come on!

492
00:46:17,504 --> 00:46:21,964
<i>Give it up for Fem Phatal!</i>
<i>Yo, they came with it!</i>

493
00:46:23,944 --> 00:46:29,075
<i>Now, JSJ, make your way to the stage!</i>

494
00:46:29,183 --> 00:46:32,380
- So what do we do now?
- We do the routine.

495
00:46:32,486 --> 00:46:33,976
- Shit.
- What?

496
00:46:34,588 --> 00:46:37,022
<i>JSJ, make your way.</i>

497
00:46:37,825 --> 00:46:40,293
Look, all they did was crack our steps
just a little bit.

498
00:46:40,394 --> 00:46:43,386
We stick to the routine and show them
what done right looks like.

499
00:46:43,497 --> 00:46:44,987
- Let's go.
- All right, man.

500
00:46:45,098 --> 00:46:46,258
<i>Jane Street Juntas!</i>

501
00:46:46,366 --> 00:46:49,563
<i>Come out, come out, wherever you are!</i>

502
00:47:10,023 --> 00:47:12,651
Same song? Is that the same song?

503
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,004
- Bishop, I was just trying...
- We stick to the routine.

504
00:48:08,115 --> 00:48:09,343
You didn't hear me say that?

505
00:48:09,449 --> 00:48:12,043
Hey, yo, at least
she tried to do something.

506
00:48:12,152 --> 00:48:13,619
They weren't feeling that out there, B.

507
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,153
Yeah, and then a bunch of people
on the stage

508
00:48:15,255 --> 00:48:16,882
looking like we making shit up
as we go along.

509
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:19,788
- You ain't feeling that too, huh?
- Come on, B.

510
00:48:21,261 --> 00:48:22,785
You think you can go
to Detroit after that shit?

511
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:25,797
- You think you're ready for that?
- Why don't you back off her, Bishop?

512
00:48:25,899 --> 00:48:28,527
Man, why don't you find somebody else
to look out for your punk ass, man?

513
00:48:28,635 --> 00:48:31,763
'Cause I'm tired of the job, all right?

514
00:48:34,675 --> 00:48:36,336
Don't touch me.

515
00:48:36,944 --> 00:48:39,845
You didn't have to do him like that,
Bishop. There's still time till Detroit.

516
00:48:39,947 --> 00:48:41,107
We can fix this.

517
00:48:41,214 --> 00:48:43,614
We? Weren't no "we" up there, Raya.
It was "you."

518
00:48:43,717 --> 00:48:44,843
You broke rank.

519
00:48:44,952 --> 00:48:47,546
You trashed four other people's lives
just so you could have the spotlight.

520
00:48:47,654 --> 00:48:49,781
I thought we were losing, Bishop.
I had to do something.

521
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:53,792
No, Raya. It's my team.
I had to do something.

522
00:48:55,128 --> 00:48:56,925
You're off the crew.

523
00:49:17,784 --> 00:49:20,548
The College Consortium's
in Baltimore this year.

524
00:49:21,121 --> 00:49:25,023
I've been before. It's useful,
but I guess we can't afford it.

525
00:49:26,927 --> 00:49:30,385
It's Baltimore, not Barbados.
I'm sure we'll manage.

526
00:49:30,797 --> 00:49:34,494
You go and make sure they know
all they need to know about you.

527
00:49:36,236 --> 00:49:39,399
Daddy's home after 11:00,
and supper's on the stove.

528
00:49:39,506 --> 00:49:41,701
I'm gonna try and work a double tonight,
but if you need anything...

529
00:49:41,808 --> 00:49:44,709
Mom. I've got it under control.

530
00:49:47,681 --> 00:49:50,149
Yeah, I've heard that before.

531
00:49:57,791 --> 00:49:59,918
What is it you need, Raya?

532
00:50:01,128 --> 00:50:04,427
Why would I need anything from you?

533
00:50:04,531 --> 00:50:06,658
I saw you up on that stage.

534
00:50:07,567 --> 00:50:11,333
And you weren't stepping like a girl
who wanted to win.

535
00:50:11,438 --> 00:50:13,099
No. Those...

536
00:50:13,206 --> 00:50:16,607
Those are definitely
"need to win" steps.

537
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:18,234
Big difference.

538
00:50:18,345 --> 00:50:23,783
So, now that Bishop's cut you loose,
I have a proposition for you.

539
00:50:23,884 --> 00:50:26,978
Seems to me you're in need of a crew.

540
00:50:27,454 --> 00:50:29,547
I'm asking five grand.

541
00:50:34,161 --> 00:50:36,254
I'll give you 3,400.

542
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:40,063
Are you serious, man?
There's like two grand alone in the tires.

543
00:50:40,167 --> 00:50:42,727
And I'll have to spend three times that
under the hood.

544
00:50:42,836 --> 00:50:45,771
Now, 3,400, take it or leave it.

545
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:50,002
- Yeah, man.
- Terrific.

546
00:51:00,353 --> 00:51:02,412
I'm not sure what the weather's like
in Baltimore.

547
00:51:02,522 --> 00:51:05,013
You think one jacket will be enough?

548
00:51:07,961 --> 00:51:09,223
Dad?

549
00:51:27,514 --> 00:51:29,038
Mom?

550
00:51:55,909 --> 00:51:59,436
You know, if you'd just ask,
Garvey'd give you a spot on his crew.

551
00:52:00,147 --> 00:52:02,741
Why you acting like
I don't know you, dawg?

552
00:52:02,849 --> 00:52:06,444
This nine to five hustle, that ain't us.
That's bullshit.

553
00:52:09,256 --> 00:52:13,750
You can't trip on Manny and them, B.
We gotta handle our own.

554
00:52:14,227 --> 00:52:17,390
Just grab your shit, man. Let's go.

555
00:52:29,042 --> 00:52:30,703
You know what, E?

556
00:52:32,045 --> 00:52:34,138
I don't think you know me anymore.

557
00:52:40,353 --> 00:52:43,288
Looks like I'm not the only one.

558
00:52:51,398 --> 00:52:54,162
I think the guys will work things
out eventually.

559
00:52:55,602 --> 00:52:58,264
So, that's what they teach you
on the hill, huh?

560
00:52:58,371 --> 00:53:02,034
To take people you care about,
and what, treat them like nothing?

561
00:53:02,142 --> 00:53:05,339
I guess that's something
I'll have to ask your brother.

562
00:53:26,733 --> 00:53:28,758
So, we're down a man for Detroit.

563
00:53:30,737 --> 00:53:33,501
Look, if you want me to fill in for Raya,

564
00:53:34,174 --> 00:53:36,005
I get an extra 20 percent of the take.

565
00:53:36,109 --> 00:53:39,738
Are you serious, man?
Come on, your own brother?

566
00:53:40,313 --> 00:53:42,474
So now you're my brother.

567
00:53:42,582 --> 00:53:45,016
Twenty percent, take it or leave it.

568
00:53:46,486 --> 00:53:48,545
All right, 20 percent.

569
00:54:18,585 --> 00:54:20,712
- Hello?
<i>- Sister Green? It's Michelle's mom.</i>

570
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:24,847
- Hello, Sister Davis. How are you?
<i>- I'm fine. How you do?</i>

571
00:54:24,958 --> 00:54:26,255
Fine. Yes.

572
00:54:26,359 --> 00:54:29,795
<i>I was wondering if Michelle could ride</i>
<i>with Raya to the step thing in Detroit?</i>

573
00:54:29,896 --> 00:54:33,627
<i>- It's because I'm a little worried...</i>
- I'm sorry. I don't understand you.

574
00:54:33,733 --> 00:54:36,668
You want Michelle to ride
with Raya where?

575
00:54:37,103 --> 00:54:39,799
I wasn't really trying to break any
traditions or anything.

576
00:54:39,906 --> 00:54:43,842
I just figured you gotta get yourself
the right man for the job and...

577
00:54:43,943 --> 00:54:48,346
In this case, the right man
was this woman right here.

578
00:54:51,451 --> 00:54:54,716
Frankly, I'm a little surprised
by all the attention as well.

579
00:54:56,489 --> 00:55:00,823
<i>You've reached the Green residence.</i>
<i>Leave a message at the beep.</i>

580
00:55:02,095 --> 00:55:05,326
Hey, Mom. Sorry, I missed you guys,
but I just wanted to let you know

581
00:55:05,432 --> 00:55:06,990
we all got here safe.

582
00:55:07,734 --> 00:55:11,727
It'll be crazy the next few days,

583
00:55:11,838 --> 00:55:15,171
so if you don't hear from me,
don't worry, okay?

584
00:55:17,377 --> 00:55:19,709
<i>Pimps and players</i>
<i>and all that up in here.</i>

585
00:55:19,813 --> 00:55:23,214
<i>We know what you're here for!</i>
<i>Welcome to the one, the only</i>

586
00:55:23,316 --> 00:55:26,046
- Step Monster Competition!
- Step Monster Competition!

587
00:55:27,554 --> 00:55:31,081
Yeah! Glad to hear you all!

588
00:55:40,033 --> 00:55:43,469
Diamond Dynasty's giving you
a little taste of what's coming up.

589
00:55:44,537 --> 00:55:45,868
Yeah!

590
00:55:50,643 --> 00:55:53,077
Check that out. See, that's
the kind of love we want you all to show

591
00:55:53,179 --> 00:55:55,010
when you see something you like.

592
00:55:55,115 --> 00:55:58,050
Yo, that's right, because this weekend
we've got some of the best judges

593
00:55:58,151 --> 00:56:02,520
that any competition has ever had,
and you know that's gonna be you!

594
00:56:04,657 --> 00:56:06,887
You got them all pumped up now,
Keyshia. Look at them.

595
00:56:06,993 --> 00:56:10,895
You? Me? No, not you in particular.
All of you all.

596
00:56:10,997 --> 00:56:13,522
Who stays? Who goes?
It's all up to you.

597
00:56:13,633 --> 00:56:15,498
We don't know unless you make
some noise!

598
00:56:15,602 --> 00:56:20,904
So, without further ado, Detroit, are
you all ready to get this thing started?

599
00:56:22,275 --> 00:56:23,503
<i>Let's move!</i>

600
00:57:09,923 --> 00:57:12,187
JSJ, let's go!

601
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:49,149
Stay with it, man.

602
01:00:45,038 --> 01:00:49,065
You know what, DeRay? I think this is
the best step competition in America.

603
01:00:49,842 --> 01:00:53,334
No, this is the best step competition
in the universe, yo!

604
01:00:55,381 --> 01:00:58,316
Keyshia, look. I been dancing
backstage, you all, for Keyshia

605
01:00:58,451 --> 01:01:01,852
and, I'm telling you,
she wanna put me in her next video.

606
01:01:01,954 --> 01:01:03,148
No.

607
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:05,016
Come on?

608
01:01:05,892 --> 01:01:07,257
So, you all know
what we coming down to, right?

609
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:11,421
We got three teams gonna compete
tomorrow in our showdown finale.

610
01:01:11,631 --> 01:01:15,431
Our first finalist is last year's
champions. Kin Dreadz, you all!

611
01:01:15,535 --> 01:01:17,002
Kin Dreadz!

612
01:01:19,872 --> 01:01:23,467
Finalist number two! The Step Monster
freshmen have finally graduated.

613
01:01:23,576 --> 01:01:26,773
You all show some love for JSJ!

614
01:01:31,751 --> 01:01:36,120
That's right! And last, but definitely
not least, is Washington's finest

615
01:01:36,222 --> 01:01:38,383
- Dem Boys!
- Dem Boys!

616
01:01:39,559 --> 01:01:42,255
Look at Dem Boys. They can't stop
stepping for nothing, huh?

617
01:01:42,361 --> 01:01:43,658
Now we got our top three,

618
01:01:43,763 --> 01:01:46,698
but only one of them
is walking away with the 50 Gs.

619
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:48,130
So, you all make sure you all be back.

620
01:01:48,234 --> 01:01:49,861
We'll see who
the champion is tomorrow.

621
01:01:49,969 --> 01:01:51,197
Fifty Gs!

622
01:02:39,719 --> 01:02:41,516
What's up, Little P?

623
01:02:52,198 --> 01:02:54,063
I'm sorry. I got to pee.

624
01:02:54,167 --> 01:02:56,067
Where did you get that locket?

625
01:02:56,369 --> 01:02:59,736
From my man, and it's antique, too.

626
01:03:00,306 --> 01:03:02,069
- Take it off!
- Excuse me?

627
01:03:02,208 --> 01:03:04,369
- Take it off!
- Bitch, I ain't taking off shit.

628
01:03:04,477 --> 01:03:06,604
Give it to me. Give it to me.

629
01:03:08,181 --> 01:03:09,512
- Get off me!
- Chill!

630
01:03:09,615 --> 01:03:10,809
- Chill.
- What the hell's going on out here?

631
01:03:10,917 --> 01:03:12,782
What is she doing with that?

632
01:03:14,387 --> 01:03:17,652
- Pam gave it to me.
- My sister would never give that to you.

633
01:03:18,324 --> 01:03:21,259
What do you want me to tell you?
The girl had a need to feed.

634
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,385
Chill! Chill!

635
01:03:23,496 --> 01:03:25,691
It ain't nothing but business, baby.

636
01:03:26,232 --> 01:03:28,757
We didn't get here
on angel wings, Raya.

637
01:03:28,868 --> 01:03:30,130
Look,

638
01:03:31,537 --> 01:03:36,201
I had mad love for your sister, okay?
She just couldn't handle the business.

639
01:03:37,343 --> 01:03:42,337
Now, you and me,
we're "do what we gots to do" people.

640
01:03:43,516 --> 01:03:47,782
And what we gots to do right now,
is chill the fuck out.

641
01:03:50,690 --> 01:03:54,126
<i>Frankly, I'm a little surprised</i>
<i>by all the attention as well.</i>

642
01:03:56,062 --> 01:03:57,723
<i>We're the only mixed team</i>
<i>in the competition.</i>

643
01:03:57,830 --> 01:03:59,627
You dancing or what?

644
01:04:51,417 --> 01:04:53,510
You know, ain't no hoochie
from Jamaica, Queens

645
01:04:53,619 --> 01:04:56,281
gonna take
a real Jamaican queen, all right?

646
01:04:59,859 --> 01:05:01,053
Oh, wait.

647
01:05:05,364 --> 01:05:08,925
You know, if you really
wanna teach something,

648
01:05:09,902 --> 01:05:13,497
best teach these trifling girls
how to tack up a weave.

649
01:05:25,952 --> 01:05:28,147
Pam meant this only for you.

650
01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:35,227
You guys were pretty fierce yesterday.
Too bad about that catch, though.

651
01:05:36,228 --> 01:05:37,752
Yeah, well.

652
01:05:40,399 --> 01:05:43,334
At least, your man still got
a chance, right?

653
01:05:47,106 --> 01:05:49,040
Look, I'm pretty sure Bishop
doesn't want to hear anything

654
01:05:49,141 --> 01:05:50,836
from me right now.

655
01:05:50,943 --> 01:05:53,605
I can't exactly say I blame him.

656
01:05:53,913 --> 01:05:57,440
So you're just gonna play it safe
and not find out for sure?

657
01:06:01,954 --> 01:06:02,921
Uncle C?

658
01:06:03,322 --> 01:06:05,256
Did anyone buy one of my customs yet?

659
01:06:06,926 --> 01:06:09,588
All right, listen,

660
01:06:10,029 --> 01:06:13,362
can you put them up
in the window for half price?

661
01:06:13,466 --> 01:06:17,562
Now, when someone buys one, call me.
All right? Bye.

662
01:06:21,374 --> 01:06:23,171
You gotta be kidding.

663
01:06:23,275 --> 01:06:27,735
I left Garvey's crew.
And I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

664
01:06:30,883 --> 01:06:32,976
I just...

665
01:06:33,085 --> 01:06:35,212
I know it doesn't fix anything,

666
01:06:36,122 --> 01:06:38,283
but you guys put a lot on the line for me,

667
01:06:38,391 --> 01:06:43,624
and I never put it on the line for you.
And for that, I'm sorry.

668
01:06:58,677 --> 01:07:01,737
Listen, how you getting back?

669
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:06,050
We got people strapped to the roof.

670
01:07:06,152 --> 01:07:08,279
It's all right. I'll figure it out.

671
01:07:10,156 --> 01:07:13,717
Look, it's a tight squeeze.
You can come back with us.

672
01:07:15,961 --> 01:07:19,362
In the meantime,
just stay out of the way.

673
01:07:36,749 --> 01:07:38,910
We're still a grand short.

674
01:07:39,018 --> 01:07:41,452
Dawg, if we don't have the money,
we don't have the money, B.

675
01:07:41,554 --> 01:07:42,919
That's all there is to it.

676
01:07:43,022 --> 01:07:46,150
Yo, man, Garvey be wiping his ass
with thousand dollar bills, man.

677
01:07:46,258 --> 01:07:49,284
And we just struggling.
Struggling for a few hundred.

678
01:07:49,395 --> 01:07:53,889
- You tried, B. We all tried.
- What's it all worth trying for?

679
01:07:54,934 --> 01:07:57,960
Whose world makes sense, man?
Ours or his?

680
01:07:58,337 --> 01:07:59,804
I don't know.

681
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:03,774
Bullshit, man. Garvey wins again.

682
01:08:19,191 --> 01:08:22,024
Look, about that 25 grand deal
with Garvey.

683
01:08:24,096 --> 01:08:26,530
Do you mind? We're trying to have
a team discussion here.

684
01:08:26,632 --> 01:08:29,430
I figure this
should cover you with Garvey tonight.

685
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:36,235
I mean, I thought you were saving up
for school?

686
01:08:36,342 --> 01:08:38,207
Raya, this has no guarantees.

687
01:08:38,644 --> 01:08:40,578
All you can do is try, Bishop.

688
01:08:40,679 --> 01:08:45,514
So, now you think you can go
to the ATM and buy your way back in?

689
01:08:45,985 --> 01:08:47,247
Listen, Raya,

690
01:08:48,687 --> 01:08:52,953
that may work at rich man hill,
but that no go so here. Saying?

691
01:08:59,064 --> 01:09:00,463
Yo, that money?

692
01:09:00,566 --> 01:09:04,229
She just pawned the locket
her sister gave her to get that.

693
01:09:04,336 --> 01:09:08,534
But if E.C. Came knocking on this door,
you all would take him back in a minute.

694
01:09:10,309 --> 01:09:13,608
How sorry does she gotta be
to make you happy?

695
01:09:22,521 --> 01:09:26,150
Look, we started rehearsals.

696
01:09:26,859 --> 01:09:28,759
Means you're late.

697
01:09:42,007 --> 01:09:44,339
Are you worried that our team
isn't big enough?

698
01:09:44,443 --> 01:09:46,411
Please, I ain't worried.

699
01:09:50,349 --> 01:09:55,150
It just that, you know, Garvey's crew
got a whole lot on their side, that's all.

700
01:10:03,362 --> 01:10:05,421
You do, too.

701
01:10:09,435 --> 01:10:12,495
All right, look, break's over, guys.
We're gonna run it from the top.

702
01:10:12,605 --> 01:10:14,971
And, Q?

703
01:10:16,475 --> 01:10:19,273
I want you starting off the second part
with of one of these.

704
01:10:19,378 --> 01:10:22,142
All right, everybody shadow Q
until you catch it.

705
01:10:23,015 --> 01:10:25,108
But these are my steps. I mean...

706
01:10:25,451 --> 01:10:28,420
I know what they are.
Can you do it or not?

707
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:29,680
Yeah.

708
01:10:31,090 --> 01:10:34,184
All right. Let's go.
We're gonna hit them with the remix.

709
01:10:58,284 --> 01:11:02,118
Welcome back to day two of our
competition. The Step Monster Finale.

710
01:11:02,621 --> 01:11:07,490
Back to defend their championship
title, make some noise for Kin Dreadz!

711
01:11:07,626 --> 01:11:09,457
Kin Dreadz!

712
01:13:31,904 --> 01:13:34,566
Kin Dreadz! Come on, come on, you all.

713
01:13:34,673 --> 01:13:38,507
- All right! All right!
- Hey, Keyshia. What am I?

714
01:13:38,610 --> 01:13:41,010
What are you...
I don't know what that is.

715
01:13:41,113 --> 01:13:43,946
- I don't know what that is.
- I'm a Step Monster.

716
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:46,811
No, no, that wasn't nothing?

717
01:13:46,919 --> 01:13:49,615
- Corny!
- All right, it ain't about me, right now.

718
01:13:56,562 --> 01:13:59,793
- It was the peppers, huh?
- Must be.

719
01:14:00,365 --> 01:14:01,457
It's hot in here!

720
01:14:01,567 --> 01:14:02,966
Somebody better find them
Umbrella Girls,

721
01:14:03,068 --> 01:14:05,662
tell them the sprinklers
almost went off in here. It was hot!

722
01:14:05,771 --> 01:14:08,763
I know that's right. But we're not about
to cool down right now.

723
01:14:08,874 --> 01:14:11,001
So let's keep it going
with our next team,

724
01:14:11,109 --> 01:14:13,737
known for their shake-the-ground
big sound.

725
01:14:13,846 --> 01:14:15,507
Put your hands together for

726
01:14:15,614 --> 01:14:17,343
- Dem Boys!
- Dem Boys!

727
01:14:40,072 --> 01:14:42,870
I'll just be over there.

728
01:14:48,947 --> 01:14:52,075
You know, I don't know which is worse.

729
01:14:52,618 --> 01:14:55,712
Having Michelle's mother tell me
what you're doing,

730
01:14:55,821 --> 01:14:57,914
or knowing you lied to my face.

731
01:14:58,357 --> 01:15:00,052
I'm sorry.

732
01:15:00,158 --> 01:15:04,754
- But I blew the scholarship exam...
- I know all about the exam, Raya.

733
01:15:17,910 --> 01:15:21,744
Ninety-two percent. We made it back!

734
01:15:21,847 --> 01:15:26,284
You watch. All of them big universities
soon come calling you.

735
01:15:26,385 --> 01:15:29,752
This is unbelievable. I'm going back.

736
01:15:29,855 --> 01:15:34,519
This is what happen when smart girls
make proper use of their time.

737
01:15:35,394 --> 01:15:37,692
Leave the fools to their foolishness,
all right?

738
01:15:37,796 --> 01:15:41,562
It's not foolishness.
I want to perform with my team.

739
01:15:42,401 --> 01:15:45,962
I need them as much as they need me.
Probably more.

740
01:15:46,772 --> 01:15:48,137
I know why that scares you.

741
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:51,004
Until you watch your daughter's life
get destroyed,

742
01:15:51,109 --> 01:15:53,873
don't bother telling me what you think
I know, all right?

743
01:15:53,979 --> 01:15:55,469
I loved Pam, too.

744
01:15:56,415 --> 01:15:58,406
But she made a different choice
for herself.

745
01:15:58,517 --> 01:16:00,781
And what was the result of that?

746
01:16:00,886 --> 01:16:03,446
Spending all her time
with these sort of people?

747
01:16:03,555 --> 01:16:05,489
Mommy, this is me.

748
01:16:06,091 --> 01:16:08,116
And just because I'm moving ahead,

749
01:16:08,226 --> 01:16:11,559
doesn't mean I have to leave
everything behind. It's all me.

750
01:16:11,663 --> 01:16:13,927
School. Step.

751
01:16:14,032 --> 01:16:16,023
You. All of it.

752
01:16:16,568 --> 01:16:19,059
If I can accept that, why can't you?

753
01:16:19,171 --> 01:16:22,663
Do young people always think
they can have everything?

754
01:16:23,308 --> 01:16:26,106
Well, life have a way of teaching
you different.

755
01:16:26,778 --> 01:16:29,576
Now, get your things and let's go!

756
01:16:44,029 --> 01:16:45,792
Looks like Dem Boys are in it to win it.

757
01:16:45,897 --> 01:16:47,694
Show your love one more time,
you guys!

758
01:16:47,799 --> 01:16:49,027
Yeah!

759
01:16:51,436 --> 01:16:54,269
Look at that. Look at that,
head moving, but the body just still.

760
01:16:54,373 --> 01:16:55,806
That's what I'm talking about.

761
01:16:55,907 --> 01:16:59,775
Ain't no stepping like old school
stepping, you all. Am I right?

762
01:17:01,747 --> 01:17:03,715
- Come on!
- You know I've got moves.

763
01:17:03,815 --> 01:17:07,478
I know you've got something.
I just hope it's not contagious.

764
01:17:09,721 --> 01:17:12,246
Now it's time for our last finalist.

765
01:17:12,357 --> 01:17:14,518
And you know the drill. You all, look.

766
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:18,118
We can't make the call
if you don't make no noise.

767
01:17:18,730 --> 01:17:24,168
All right, now. Here's JSJ with a little
island flavor to savor, you know.

768
01:17:28,874 --> 01:17:30,307
Go!

769
01:18:18,323 --> 01:18:24,262
- Need a ride? Hop on this.
- JSJ transform!

770
01:19:12,878 --> 01:19:14,812
Speed it up now!

771
01:19:32,898 --> 01:19:36,231
<i>We know, we know, let's go, let's go.</i>

772
01:20:48,773 --> 01:20:51,401
- All right. It's that time, you all!
- Yeah!

773
01:20:51,509 --> 01:20:53,670
We're gonna take our last roll call.

774
01:20:57,182 --> 01:20:59,047
Yeah! Tell us how you feel!

775
01:21:00,485 --> 01:21:03,921
Here we go. Here we go.
How you feel about Kin Dreadz?

776
01:21:05,757 --> 01:21:07,884
Yeah? Kin Dreadz, you all? Okay.

777
01:21:08,493 --> 01:21:11,155
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah! All right, yes.

778
01:21:11,663 --> 01:21:14,496
Show the love, show the love
show the love!

779
01:21:14,599 --> 01:21:16,464
Or is it Dem Boys?

780
01:21:17,903 --> 01:21:21,339
Dem Boys? Dem Boys? Come on!

781
01:21:21,439 --> 01:21:25,000
Clap if that's what you want!
Is that what you want?

782
01:21:25,577 --> 01:21:28,740
Okay, okay. What about JSJ, you all?

783
01:21:31,349 --> 01:21:33,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

784
01:21:33,285 --> 01:21:34,752
Yeah!

785
01:21:34,853 --> 01:21:36,980
Okay! Okay!

786
01:21:40,258 --> 01:21:41,316
Yeah!

787
01:21:41,426 --> 01:21:43,417
All right, all right! All right!

788
01:21:44,429 --> 01:21:45,828
We got this one.

789
01:21:45,931 --> 01:21:49,890
This year's Step Monster Champions,

790
01:21:52,570 --> 01:21:54,401
JSJ!

791
01:22:45,724 --> 01:22:47,316
How you doing?

792
01:22:47,993 --> 01:22:49,017
Fine.

793
01:22:50,528 --> 01:22:51,790
I

794
01:22:52,897 --> 01:22:55,661
called, but there was no answer.

795
01:22:56,234 --> 01:22:57,963
I went after Raya.

796
01:23:00,238 --> 01:23:03,207
She ran off to some step show
in Detroit.

797
01:23:03,408 --> 01:23:05,171
You saw her dance?

798
01:23:05,410 --> 01:23:07,878
So many people everywhere and...

799
01:23:09,347 --> 01:23:11,008
Traveling with those...

800
01:23:13,184 --> 01:23:15,618
And anything could happen to her.

801
01:23:18,490 --> 01:23:20,185
How was she?

802
01:23:23,194 --> 01:23:25,219
She danced so beautiful.

803
01:23:31,770 --> 01:23:34,705
Both my daughters dance so beautiful.

804
01:23:44,182 --> 01:23:45,547
It's okay.

805
01:23:59,064 --> 01:24:00,929
<i>It's funny, isn't it?</i>

806
01:24:01,032 --> 01:24:04,263
<i>How one moment</i>
<i>can change a million after it.</i>
