         BE HERE IN 2 YEARS.    

100
00:11:13,688 --> 00:11:16,124

REALLY TASTY.                   

102
00:11:21,796 --> 00:11:23,498

 EVERYTHING IS SO FRESH.        

106
00:11:29,704 --> 00:11:31,038
        IT'S                    
    UNBELIEVABLE.               

107
00:11:31,106 --> 00:11:32,473
                 EVERYTHING     
                 ALL RIGHT HERE?

108
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:35,543

109
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,612
                     [Christine]
             YOU WON'T BELIEVE  
            HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS

110
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:40,080
     FOR ME TO CONVINCE LARRY   
        TO COME THIS WEEKEND.   

111
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:41,782
                 MR. THOMPSON?  
            YES.                

112
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,484
                 HAVE YOU TAKEN 
             SOME GOOD PICTURES?

113
00:11:43,552 --> 00:11:47,221
        [Mr. Thompson]          
        I THINK I HAVE          
         SOME DANDIES.          

114
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:49,423
                     EXCUSE ME. 

115
00:11:49,491 --> 00:11:51,859
             WHERE ARE THOSE 2  
            GUYS THAT YOU HIRED?

116
00:11:51,926 --> 00:11:54,328
I SUPPOSE THEY FINISHED         
THEIR WORK AND THEY LEFT.       

117
00:11:54,396 --> 00:11:55,863
                 LEFT?          

118
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:59,066
     WELL, YOU CAN TELL THEM    
         THAT THEY'RE FIRED.    

119
00:11:59,134 --> 00:12:01,802
             SPEAKING OF THAT,  
             WHY DON'T YOU TRY  
             A LITTLE OF THAT   

120
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:05,573
         OLD-WORLD CHARM THAT

            FOR ON OUR GUESTS?

            I AM NOT RUNNING A  
         CHARITY ORGANIZATION.  

122
00:12:12,981 --> 00:12:14,998
         I'VE ALWAYS WANTED     
         TO LIVE NEAR THE WATER.

123
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,534
     IT'S BEAUTIFUL HERE,       
            ISN'T IT?           

124
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:18,269
YES, IT IS LOVELY.              

125
00:12:43,761 --> 00:12:46,464
             HOW ARE YOU DOING? 

126
00:12:46,531 --> 00:12:48,532
        FINE.                   
 CHARLIE, RIGHT?                

127
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,101
                        RIGHT.  

128
00:12:50,168 --> 00:12:52,103
 GOOD, CHARLIE.                 

129
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,571
     WHAT ARE YOU DOING?        

130
00:12:53,638 --> 00:12:58,109
         TRYING TO FIGURE       
     OUT WHAT EVERYBODY'S       
            DOING HERE?         

131
00:12:58,176 --> 00:12:59,776
HERE TO BUY LAND.               
WHAT ELSE?                      

132
00:12:59,844 --> 00:13:01,479
                 NOT EVERYONE.  

133
00:13:01,546 --> 00:13:03,280
             OUR AVERAGE IS 1   
                OUT OF 3 PEOPLE 

134
00:13:03,348 --> 00:13:06,550
                COME ALONG JUST 
                 FOR THE RIDE.  

135
00:13:06,618 --> 00:13:08,586
 YOU SHOULD BE MORE             
CAREFUL WHO YOU INVITE.         

136
00:13:08,653 --> 00:13:10,554
                 WE SURE WOULD  
                 LIKE TO,       

137
00:13:10,622 --> 00:13:16,727

         WITH THAT STATISTIC    
             NO MATTER WHAT.    

138

WHAT ABOUT                      
THIS GROUP?

WHO'LL BE THE BUYERS            
AND WHO AREN'T?                 

140
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,034
                    NOT EXACTLY.

141
00:13:24,102 --> 00:13:29,473
         BUT I THINK I'VE GOT   
            YOU FIGURED OUT.

143
00:13:31,176 --> 00:13:32,976
             NOT ONLY COULD YOU 
             NOT AFFORD A LOT,  

144
00:13:33,044 --> 00:13:34,845
     BUT I THINK YOU'D HAVE     
         A HELL OF A TIME       

145
00:13:34,912 --> 00:13:38,249
                 SWINGING FOR   
                 THE BOAT RIDE. 

146
00:13:38,316 --> 00:13:42,653
                 AM I RIGHT?    

147
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,855
    CHEERS.

                 HAD ENOUGH?    

150
00:13:57,051 --> 00:13:58,452
ENOUGH WHAT?                    

151
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,220
                 PARTY BULLSHIT.

152
00:14:00,289 --> 00:14:03,758
I KNOW WHAT                     
YOU MEAN.                       

153
00:14:03,825 --> 00:14:08,763
         WHY DON'T WE TAKE A    
         LOOK AROUND? SEE IF    
         THIS PLACE IS FOR REAL.

154
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,499
I DON'T THINK YOUR              
WIFE WOULD LIKE THAT.           

155
00:14:11,566 --> 00:14:15,503
                 UH, WE HAVE    
            DIFFERENT INTERESTS.

156
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:17,805
I'M SURE YOU DO.                

157
00:14:17,872 --> 00:14:23,977
                 HOW ABOUT IT?

YOU UNDERSTAND.                 

163
00:14:36,991 --> 00:14:41,462
IT'S QUITE A                    
RESPONSIBILITY.                 

164

            AND I LIKE THE MOST.

167
00:14:51,373 --> 00:14:54,475
             THAT'S A LONG TIME 
         TO BE WITH ONE COMPANY.

168
00:14:54,543 --> 00:14:57,345
     NOT WHEN YOU CONSIDER      
         ALL THE BENEFITS       
         THAT CAN ACCRUE--

         RETIREMENT PENSION.    

170
00:14:59,981 --> 00:15:02,950
     NO WONDER YOU'RE LOOKING   
     INTO LAND INVESTMENTS.     

171
00:15:03,017 --> 00:15:06,721
I WOULDN'T SAY THAT             
I'M EXACTLY LOOKING             
FOR INVESTMENTS.

        NOBODY IS GOING TO      
         HUSTLE YOU INTO        
         BUYING ANYTHING.

I JUST MET YOU AN HOUR AGO      

179
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,259
    AND HERE I AM

                    NOT WITH ME.

184
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,205
 IT'LL BE ONE OF THE BIG        
DISAPPOINTMENTS IN MY LIFE.     

185
00:15:42,273 --> 00:15:44,458
     WHERE YOU GOING?

                 SON OF A BITCH!

    RELAX, RELAX.

192
00:15:58,373 --> 00:16:00,508
I JUST WANT TO GET TO

194

GOOD FRIENDS. AAH!

             THE BOAT DRIVER.

             I GET YOU HERE     
             AND I GET YOU BACK.

211
00:18:07,535 --> 00:18:09,203

FOR DOMESTIC HELP.              

216
00:18:24,118 --> 00:18:27,154
 BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE         
ALL THE SAVINGS I'VE GOT,       

217
00:18:27,222 --> 00:18:28,655
SO I'VE GOT TO                  
MAKE CERTAIN

222
00:18:38,199 --> 00:18:42,936
IS IT A GOOD THING?             

223
00:18:43,004 --> 00:18:44,204
OR NOT?                         

224
00:18:44,272 --> 00:18:45,906

         SOMEBODY ELSE, PLEASE? 

226
00:19:05,276 --> 00:19:11,348
         I JUST HAD A PRETTY    
        ROUGH TIME OF IT MYSELF.

227
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:15,285
             AND I GUESS IF     
             I WEREN'T SO SICK  
         OF THE WHOLE ROUTINE,  

228
00:19:15,353 --> 00:19:18,389
                I'D PROBABLY BE 
             DOING WHAT YOU'RE  
             DOING RIGHT NOW.   

229
00:19:18,456 --> 00:19:20,991
I BEG YOUR PARDON?              

230
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:26,330
 ALL THIS SELF-PITY,            
"NOBODY-GIVES-A-DAMN"           
         ATTITUDE.              

231
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:28,232
         WHAT?                  

232
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:31,935
                     THE BOOZE. 

233
00:19:32,003 --> 00:19:33,170
         RIGHT.                 

234
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:41,145
                 YOU KNOW, UMM  
                WHEN I MET YOU  
                 ON THE BOAT,   

235
00:19:41,212 --> 00:19:43,747
                 I DIDN'T LIKE  
                 YOU VERY MUCH. 

236
00:19:43,814 --> 00:19:46,850
THAT'S NOT EXACTLY              
A SURPRISE.                     

237
00:19:46,918 --> 00:19:48,685
                 I DON'T KNOW.  

238
00:19:48,753 --> 00:19:52,322
            I GUESS I THOUGHT   
         YOU WERE ONE OF THOSE  
         MACHO, PHONY TYPES,    

239
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:58,828
         THE KIND WHOSE BRAINS  
         FALL OUT EVERY TIME    
         HE UNZIPS HIS FLY.     

240
00:19:58,896 --> 00:20:04,401
SAY, WHAT IS THIS,              
GROUP THERAPY?                  

241
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,570
                         MAYBE. 

242
00:20:06,637 --> 00:20:11,908
         I CAN'T AFFORD TO MAKE 
         A MISTAKE, THAT'S ALL. 

243
00:20:11,976 --> 00:20:13,810
         I LIED TO THEM         
        BACK THERE BEFORE.      

244
00:20:13,878 --> 00:20:16,080
         I TOLD THEM            
        I HAD A GOOD JOB,       

245
00:20:16,147 --> 00:20:21,751
        BEEN WORKING FOR THE    
     SAME MAN FOR 20 YEARS.     

246
00:20:21,819 --> 00:20:24,988
     THE TRUTH OF IT IS,        
         HE FIRED ME.           

247
00:20:25,056 --> 00:20:32,763
         ALL I'VE GOT           
         IS SEVERANCE PAY       
         AND REFERENCES.        

248
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,999
             I'VE GOT A JOB THAT
            PAYS $30,000 A YEAR,

249
00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:40,604
             I OWN A 2-BEDROOM  
         CONDOMINIUM, I'VE GOT  
         A $10,000 SPORTS CAR,  

250
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:43,006
            I'VE GOT A WIFE AND 
         I GOT A 4-YEAR-OLD KID 

251
00:20:43,074 --> 00:20:44,374
                     WHO THINKS 
                     I'M GOD.   

252
00:20:44,442 --> 00:20:45,742
                     HOW'S THAT?

253
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:49,245
THAT'S TERRIFIC.                
THAT'S FABULOUS.                

254
00:20:49,313 --> 00:20:51,347
LOOK, I WAS JUST TRYING         
TO TELL YOU THAT                

255
00:20:51,415 --> 00:20:53,617
 I CHANGED MY MIND              
ABOUT NOT LIKING YOU.           

256
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:57,588
     THAT'S ALL.                

257
00:20:57,655 --> 00:21:00,457
             FORGET IT.         

258
00:21:00,524 --> 00:21:02,759
             I'M A BAD          
             INVESTMENT.        

259
00:21:02,827 --> 00:21:06,630
 AND WHY DO                     
YOU SAY THAT?                   

260
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:11,234
             BECAUSE THE...     

261
00:21:11,302 --> 00:21:17,741
                $30,000-A-YEAR  
                JOB WENT IN THE 
             TOILET LAST YEAR.  

262
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:21,878
             AND THE SPORTS CAR 
             NEEDS AN OVERHAUL. 

263
00:21:21,946 --> 00:21:24,948
                    AND MY WIFE 
                 IS AN EX-WIFE, 

264
00:21:25,016 --> 00:21:28,619
                WHO'S SUING ME  
             FOR BACK SUPPORT.  

265
00:21:28,686 --> 00:21:33,841
        MY KID WON'T EVEN TALK  
         TO ME ON THE PHONE.    

266
00:21:33,908 --> 00:21:38,512
     WHAT ABOUT                 
 YOUR CONDOMINIUM?              

267
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,081
             PLASTIC,           

268
00:21:41,148 --> 00:21:45,986
         LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE.  

269

                     SHALL WE?  

270
00:21:47,154 --> 00:21:51,324
            OK.                 

271
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:55,796
            IF IT WAS MY MONEY  
            AND I WAS GOING TO  
             BUY THIS LAND,     

272

273
00:22:01,168 --> 00:22:04,722
                 AND THEN I'D   
             STILL THINK TWICE. 

274
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:09,092
             DOES THAT ANSWER   
                YOUR QUESTION?  

275
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,127

 THEY'RE SO CLOSE TO THE RIVER. 

694
01:03:15,622 --> 01:03:17,556
         YOU FOLKS DON'T HAVE   
            TO WORRY ANYMORE.   

695
01:03:17,624 --> 01:03:19,893
                    ALL YOU HAVE
                 TO DO IS REST, 

696
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:22,128
                UNWIND AND WE'LL
             GET YOU CLEANED UP.

697
01:03:42,399 --> 01:03:45,101
I RADIOED ONE OF MY DEPUTIES    
TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS.           

698
01:03:45,169 --> 01:03:47,403
    I HOPE THIS PLACE           
     IS NICE ENOUGH             
     FOR YOU FOLK.              

699

MAKE A PHONE CALL.              

701

STATE CAPITAL COULD             
GET HELP HERE FAST.             

702

         SURE, GO AHEAD.        

703
01:03:59,450 --> 01:04:01,718
         [Coreen]               
     WHAT I REALLY WANT         
     TO DO IS GO HOME.          

704
01:04:01,786 --> 01:04:05,071
 [Sherrif] AS SOON AS WE GET    
     THE MAIN HIGHWAY OPEN,     
 YOU CAN ALL BE ON YOUR WAY.    

705
01:04:05,139 --> 01:04:06,873

             PROBLEMS, HARRISON,

                 TELL YOU MINE. 

707
01:04:08,675 --> 01:04:10,810
         I WANT THAT SHIPMENT   
            OF SUGAR IN MY TOWN

         OR YOU CAN FORGET IT.  

709
01:04:13,314 --> 01:04:15,849

01:04:27,678 --> 01:04:31,047
         ANSON PARKER.          
        HE OWNS THE MOTEL.      
     HE'S ALSO OUR MAYOR.       

715
01:04:31,114 --> 01:04:32,715
         VERY WEALTHY.          

716
01:04:32,783 --> 01:04:36,185
            DON'T TAKE 3 DAYS   
         TO DRIVE THOSE RIGS    
        FROM YOUR PLACE TO MINE.

717
01:04:36,253 --> 01:04:38,087
                 IT'S A LOUSY   
                    800 MILES.  

718
01:04:38,155 --> 01:04:40,306
                 TELL THE MEN TO
                 DRIVE ALL NIGHT
                IF THEY HAVE TO.

719
01:04:40,374 --> 01:04:45,244
            REMEMBER THAT SUGAR 
            REFINERY WE PASSED  
             ON OUR WAY HERE?   

720
01:04:45,312 --> 01:04:47,513
                SOMETHING FUNNY.

721
01:04:47,581 --> 01:04:48,614
            FUNNY?              

722
01:04:48,682 --> 01:04:50,483
                        YEAH.   

723
01:04:50,551 --> 01:04:53,553
                WHEN WE WERE    
                BACK AT THAT    
             OLD COUPLE'S HOUSE,

724
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:55,355
                 THE WOMAN SAID 
                 SOMETHING TO ME

725
01:04:55,422 --> 01:04:57,757
             THAT JUST DIDN'T   
                MAKE SENSE,     
                THAT'S ALL.     

726
01:04:57,825 --> 01:04:59,325
WHAT DID SHE SAY?               

727
01:04:59,393 --> 01:05:02,061
                 SHE SAID,      
             "WHATEVER YOU DO,  

728
01:05:02,128 --> 01:05:06,366
                 "DON'T LET THEM
                 TAKE YOU TO THE
                SUGAR REFINERY."

729
01:05:06,433 --> 01:05:09,736
             ISN'T THAT CRAZY?  

730
01:05:09,803 --> 01:05:12,739
 THERE'S NO WAY TO              
GET A CALL THROUGH?             

731
01:05:12,806 --> 01:05:16,476
DAMMIT, DON'T YOU HAVE          
SOME EMERGENCY LINES?           

732
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:19,061
             IT'S NONE OF YOUR  
             BUSINESS WHAT I'M  
         DOING WITH THE SUGAR.  

733
01:05:19,129 --> 01:05:21,464
             OUR REFINERY IS    
                 TURNING OUT    
                 ALL IT CAN,    

734
01:05:21,532 --> 01:05:25,602
                 FULL BLAST AND 
                 WE NEED MORE.  

735
01:05:25,669 --> 01:05:31,340
                    OK. FINE.   
                     BYE-BYE.   

736
01:05:31,408 --> 01:05:33,075
                         SORRY. 

737
01:05:33,143 --> 01:05:35,294
                 A LITTLE       
             BUSINESS PROBLEM.  

738
01:05:35,362 --> 01:05:37,764
         YOU MUST HAVE COME UP  
         FROM DREAMLAND SHORES. 

739
01:05:37,831 --> 01:05:41,150
        HOW DID YOU KNOW        
         WE CAME FROM           
        DREAMLAND SHORES?       

740
01:05:41,218 --> 01:05:43,920
     FIX THESE PEOPLE UP        
        WITH SOMETHING          
     REAL NICE, MAYOR.          

741

                     THE HOUSE.

743
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:48,858
     I GUESS I'VE DONE          
        ALL THAT I CAN.         

744
01:05:48,926 --> 01:05:50,627
         I'LL GO BACK           
         TO THE RIVER           
        AND LOOK FOR...         

745
01:05:50,694 --> 01:05:52,662

         TALKING ABOUT.         

746
01:05:52,730 --> 01:05:53,930

     WHEN I'VE MORE TIME.       

748
01:05:55,766 --> 01:05:57,667
     IF I FIND ANYTHING,        
     I'M GONNA LET YOU KNOW.    

749
01:05:57,735 --> 01:06:00,136
[Dan]

     I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.      

751
01:06:09,947 --> 01:06:13,315
 IS THERE ANY PLACE             
     AROUND HERE                
 I CAN RENT A CAR?              

752
01:06:13,383 --> 01:06:15,351
            A COUPLE OF BLOCKS  
             UP THE STREET.     

753

OF THE STORM.                   

762

             THAT'S ODD,        
        THE MAYOR WAS TALKING   
         LONG-DISTANCE.         

763
01:06:42,329 --> 01:06:45,297
