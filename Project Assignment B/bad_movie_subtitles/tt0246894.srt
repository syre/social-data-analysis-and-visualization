1
00:01:26,078 --> 00:01:30,986
- Three photographers, $250 each.
- I thought it was $400 each.

2
00:01:31,186 --> 00:01:33,518
Kid, are you in or out?

3
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:36,582
I'm in.

4
00:01:37,059 --> 00:01:41,962
Okay, here to the bridge. Winner take all.
If the cops get you, you're on your own.

5
00:01:50,138 --> 00:01:52,003
Hey, right here, man.

6
00:02:26,641 --> 00:02:27,972
Beautiful.

7
00:02:30,045 --> 00:02:31,478
Hey, kid.

8
00:02:32,013 --> 00:02:33,742
Smile.

9
00:03:19,327 --> 00:03:21,693
Hey, give me room, will you?

10
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:26,464
Shit!

11
00:03:35,877 --> 00:03:38,311
You almost got me killed, asshole!

12
00:03:41,383 --> 00:03:42,941
You son of a bitch!

13
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,504
Grab hold!

14
00:04:17,152 --> 00:04:18,483
Oh, shit!

15
00:04:27,896 --> 00:04:31,662
Marcus Ridley, how the hell are you doing?
How long have you been back?

16
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:35,191
Three weeks. Spent it with my kids.
I miss them when I'm over there.

17
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,500
I'll bet. Why don't you bring them back?

18
00:04:37,572 --> 00:04:39,938
You could afford it. Look at these baubles.

19
00:04:40,008 --> 00:04:41,976
So, what happened, man?
What's going on?

20
00:04:42,043 --> 00:04:45,171
- Still trying to kill yourself?
- Something like that.

21
00:04:45,447 --> 00:04:46,709
What happened to playing pro?

22
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:49,579
I thought you got picked
for the minors last fall.

23
00:04:49,818 --> 00:04:53,584
Yeah. Well, that didn't quite work out.

24
00:04:53,655 --> 00:04:56,283
You know, coach wanted me to play "D."

25
00:04:56,825 --> 00:04:59,487
- What did you do? Hit him?
- I should've.

26
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:01,721
Wasting your life.

27
00:05:02,731 --> 00:05:07,259
I just haven't gotten the break I need.
NHL tryouts are in three months.

28
00:05:08,236 --> 00:05:10,864
Jon, the break you need is right here.

29
00:05:11,072 --> 00:05:14,007
They'll cover your travel,
give you $5,000 just to show up...

30
00:05:14,075 --> 00:05:16,168
...and if you make the team...

31
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:20,241
Come on. That's a circus, not a sport.

32
00:05:20,649 --> 00:05:22,879
- Pretty sunset, though.
- It's the mines.

33
00:05:22,951 --> 00:05:24,509
- What is?
- Dust from the mines.

34
00:05:24,586 --> 00:05:28,249
It makes the sunset red.
Come on. We both know cash is king.

35
00:05:28,423 --> 00:05:32,883
I last two more years, I have enough
to retire, support my family for life.

36
00:05:32,994 --> 00:05:37,055
They love Americans, especially
baby-faced, boy-next-door types like you.

37
00:05:37,565 --> 00:05:40,125
It'll be just like high school.
You run, I block.

38
00:05:40,201 --> 00:05:44,069
Besides, it's where even a doofus-ass
white boy like you can get laid.

39
00:05:44,739 --> 00:05:47,071
- Is that right?
- That's right.

40
00:05:50,312 --> 00:05:53,372
I appreciate the offer,
but I should stick around.

41
00:05:53,982 --> 00:05:56,109
This is my year to make pro.

42
00:05:56,284 --> 00:05:58,081
I tried. Good luck with that.

43
00:05:58,153 --> 00:06:01,748
My flight leaves at 9:00 p.m. tonight,
in case you change your mind.

44
00:06:05,527 --> 00:06:07,586
Thanks for saving my ass today.

45
00:06:07,962 --> 00:06:09,293
Anytime.

46
00:07:42,357 --> 00:07:45,724
- You better walk.
- What? What's the matter?

47
00:07:45,793 --> 00:07:48,091
It's Sunday. The mines are out.

48
00:07:50,198 --> 00:07:51,665
Oh, shit.

49
00:08:35,777 --> 00:08:38,769
I don't understand a word
you're saying to me.

50
00:08:38,846 --> 00:08:43,721
But maybe if you say it louder,
I won't understand you even better.

51
00:08:45,189 --> 00:08:48,681
I get it. Your nipples get hard
at the very sight of me, right?

52
00:08:52,063 --> 00:08:55,624
A new bio on the kid.
Now he's a rodeo champion.

53
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:35,231
Jon-a-ton! Jon-a-ton! Jon-a-ton!

54
00:10:46,076 --> 00:10:47,065
Jonathan.

55
00:10:48,012 --> 00:10:49,445
They're waiting.

56
00:11:31,789 --> 00:11:35,953
Hailing from the wide-open plains of Texas,
a former rodeo champion...

57
00:11:36,026 --> 00:11:39,792
...and first-round draft pick by
the prestigious National Hockey League...

58
00:11:39,864 --> 00:11:43,561
...back in the States.
Considered the next Wayne Gretzky...

59
00:11:43,634 --> 00:11:48,594
...he refused a king's ransom from the NHL
to play here in a real man's league.

60
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:51,869
The Red Horsemen's sure bet
for Rookie of the Year...

61
00:11:51,942 --> 00:11:56,276
...who kills his stubble each morning
with a Wilkinson Sword Tri-flex.

62
00:11:56,714 --> 00:11:59,410
Here he is, your very own...

63
00:11:59,483 --> 00:12:01,576
...Jonathan Cross.

64
00:12:23,807 --> 00:12:26,970
Please, my friends, sit down. Have a seat.

65
00:12:31,315 --> 00:12:35,581
You are his boy. Looks like Alexi's
got himself some hot investors.

66
00:12:37,421 --> 00:12:38,752
Vodka!

67
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,593
You got your armadillo on?

68
00:12:44,695 --> 00:12:46,526
Jesus, you're an idiot.

69
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,565
You want to be a paraplegic?

70
00:12:55,973 --> 00:12:58,601
Do you know what those guys
can do to your spine?

71
00:12:58,676 --> 00:13:00,667
Gotta catch me first, Rid.

72
00:13:00,744 --> 00:13:03,076
- Right. It's your face.
- Yes, Mother.

73
00:13:03,147 --> 00:13:04,239
At least do it up.

74
00:13:04,315 --> 00:13:06,010
- Okay, Mom.
- Stubborn bastard.

75
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:07,948
Toba!

76
00:13:08,819 --> 00:13:12,118
Okay, Toba! Big roar now!
Let's hear it! Let's go!

77
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:16,887
Great roar, Toba! Now, you hang tight
up there tonight, okay?

78
00:13:17,194 --> 00:13:18,456
You, too, Jonathan.

79
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:19,727
All right.

80
00:13:25,302 --> 00:13:26,496
Listen up, thugs.

81
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:29,903
Got our butts kicked last game,
but we're not going down again.

82
00:13:29,974 --> 00:13:31,168
Are you?

83
00:13:31,608 --> 00:13:34,441
- I didn't hear an answer! Are you?
- No!

84
00:13:34,511 --> 00:13:37,105
Give them something to think about
for the playoff.

85
00:13:37,181 --> 00:13:40,878
That means teamwork,
so no more cowboy hot-dog dogshit.

86
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:42,851
Can't we all just get along?

87
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,218
No, Aurora's right.

88
00:13:45,723 --> 00:13:48,419
No more of the cowboy hot-dog dogshit.

89
00:13:54,865 --> 00:13:57,629
When the Red Horsemen went
to the Golden Horde last month...

90
00:13:57,701 --> 00:14:00,465
...they came back with their tails
between their legs.

91
00:14:00,537 --> 00:14:03,563
Now the Horde comes to Horsemen town.

92
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,608
The word is "rematch."

93
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:10,308
And the Horsemen hope
it's spelled "payback."

94
00:14:12,349 --> 00:14:14,977
A team must go around the track twice...

95
00:14:15,052 --> 00:14:19,079
...maintaining possession of the rollerball
before they can score.

96
00:14:19,156 --> 00:14:20,885
It's really that simple.

97
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:25,520
As simple as using a Lifestyle
female condom before sex.

98
00:14:27,498 --> 00:14:29,591
The ball must be held at all times.

99
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,831
Player gear may be only used
to dislodge the ball...

100
00:14:33,904 --> 00:14:35,929
...or prevent a score.

101
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,767
A team gaining possession
must first do the rabbit hole.

102
00:14:39,843 --> 00:14:42,368
That's that killer tunnel above each bench.

103
00:14:42,446 --> 00:14:44,846
Then make one circuit
through enemy territory...

104
00:14:44,915 --> 00:14:47,748
...and then they're eligible to score.

105
00:14:47,818 --> 00:14:52,380
All you really have to know is,
there's only one way to score...

106
00:14:52,456 --> 00:14:55,084
...and that's when a player
takes one of the balls...

107
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:58,595
...wings it at one of the goals
hard enough to set off the pyro.

108
00:14:58,762 --> 00:15:00,161
As for the rest of the rules...

109
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:03,324
Well, the rest of the rules are Russian
and complicated.

110
00:15:04,501 --> 00:15:07,834
What's it going to be, U-Chow?
Us or them?

111
00:15:08,205 --> 00:15:11,174
Patience, outlander.
The gods not yet ready.

112
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:14,267
Big goons over there.
Watch your backsides.

113
00:15:15,245 --> 00:15:17,008
Ten seconds to the first ball.

114
00:15:17,081 --> 00:15:20,380
First ball wagers close in ten seconds.

115
00:15:21,585 --> 00:15:22,847
Five...

116
00:15:23,187 --> 00:15:24,415
...four...

117
00:15:24,488 --> 00:15:25,614
...three...

118
00:15:26,056 --> 00:15:27,614
It's us!

119
00:15:27,691 --> 00:15:29,420
Go, go! Denekin, move!

120
00:15:29,526 --> 00:15:30,424
Ball's away.

121
00:15:30,494 --> 00:15:33,657
It's rollerball!

122
00:15:40,871 --> 00:15:44,238
First play of the rollerball game
is underway.

123
00:15:45,742 --> 00:15:47,107
Through the rabbit hole.

124
00:15:47,177 --> 00:15:48,974
I need a ride, Rid.

125
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,308
On the way.

126
00:15:52,015 --> 00:15:53,573
It's a 12-foot jump.

127
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:00,114
And Jonathan Cross is in enemy turf.

128
00:16:02,426 --> 00:16:04,121
He crosses back around.

129
00:16:04,194 --> 00:16:07,357
This game,
I cannot believe it, is starting this early.

130
00:16:07,698 --> 00:16:09,290
Yes!

131
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,726
Cross leaps!

132
00:16:11,635 --> 00:16:13,432
Cross is in the air.

133
00:16:14,471 --> 00:16:15,904
He scores!

134
00:16:15,973 --> 00:16:18,703
Cross has scored in record time!

135
00:16:18,876 --> 00:16:21,868
Only 12 seconds after the first ball...

136
00:16:21,945 --> 00:16:25,244
...and he soars over the heads
of the Horde!

137
00:16:25,315 --> 00:16:29,115
Cross has led a 1-to-0 lead!

138
00:16:40,664 --> 00:16:42,757
She say you must do again.

139
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,767
- What?
- Drink again.

140
00:16:45,636 --> 00:16:46,943
Label out.

141
00:16:46,943 --> 00:16:47,568
Label out.

142
00:16:48,612 --> 00:16:50,079
Put the label out.

143
00:17:29,252 --> 00:17:32,847
We're the hottest sports-entertainment
start-up in the world, bar none.

144
00:17:35,892 --> 00:17:37,985
We have to pay a couple of headliners...

145
00:17:39,396 --> 00:17:42,160
...but the rest get bollocks.
They'll fight for peanuts.

146
00:17:43,934 --> 00:17:45,526
It's about to get interesting!

147
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:04,111
Good move for Denekin!

148
00:18:04,187 --> 00:18:08,089
The local boy who made good used to work
right here in the coal mines!

149
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:28,936
All the glitz is put on
in the media trailer out back.

150
00:18:31,581 --> 00:18:36,484
We even had a computer to build
the city around it. You know?

151
00:18:40,357 --> 00:18:42,416
And it becomes Vegas!

152
00:18:49,966 --> 00:18:54,767
We've got a fight down there!
There is a fight going on right there!

153
00:19:00,777 --> 00:19:02,711
She just swung at a referee!

154
00:19:06,349 --> 00:19:08,783
Well, that's a tutu in the penalty box!

155
00:19:11,988 --> 00:19:13,546
What was she thinking?

156
00:19:13,623 --> 00:19:17,889
We got a fox in the box! A fox in the box!
They put that fox in the box!

157
00:19:38,682 --> 00:19:40,274
She's called in the catcher.

158
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:44,719
He's a 400-pound monster on his way in!

159
00:19:47,257 --> 00:19:49,953
I will not allow this game
to become corrupted...

160
00:19:50,026 --> 00:19:53,223
...like so many things
in this part of the world.

161
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,599
The integrity of the game
must be maintained.

162
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:59,226
For the people, to keep their heroes alive.

163
00:19:59,469 --> 00:20:01,801
And to keep them gambling, of course.

164
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:10,844
Go!

165
00:20:32,268 --> 00:20:34,099
Are you crazy? Are you insane?

166
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:37,697
- Why are you mixing it up with that guy?
- So he's doped up. Big deal.

167
00:20:37,774 --> 00:20:40,242
It could be PCP, for all you know.

168
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:43,802
That dude doesn't feel anything.
Stay the hell away from him.

169
00:20:44,047 --> 00:20:45,480
Payback?

170
00:20:45,682 --> 00:20:50,244
How many of you will last the season
with management out there watching...

171
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,016
...this sissy performance?
- That woman.

172
00:20:53,323 --> 00:20:55,223
- Come on!
- Go out and score.

173
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:58,692
Stay focused. We have a lead.
We have to keep up the pressure.

174
00:20:58,762 --> 00:21:01,230
Tell cowboy to pass the ball
once in a while.

175
00:21:01,297 --> 00:21:03,026
- They're keying on him.
- She's right.

176
00:21:03,099 --> 00:21:06,125
If she'd get in the air,
somebody would pass her the ball.

177
00:21:06,202 --> 00:21:08,693
Enough! We have a game to play!

178
00:21:09,305 --> 00:21:13,036
On three. One, two, three! Get some!

179
00:21:23,987 --> 00:21:26,649
- She's wide-open...
- Come on! Throw it!

180
00:21:26,723 --> 00:21:27,883
He bogarts it!

181
00:21:27,957 --> 00:21:30,152
Cross keeps the ball!

182
00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:34,793
- Come on, Jon!
- I'm on it! Go! Move!

183
00:21:35,131 --> 00:21:36,723
You don't listen, do you, cowboy?

184
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,631
Here you go, princess.

185
00:22:20,677 --> 00:22:22,304
Toba, get down! Move!

186
00:22:24,681 --> 00:22:26,808
Toba! Somebody get a medic!

187
00:22:34,657 --> 00:22:35,885
You're okay.

188
00:23:22,038 --> 00:23:25,735
Guys, wait! Hold on. Here you go, buddy.

189
00:23:26,109 --> 00:23:27,770
Toba, you're fine!

190
00:23:29,913 --> 00:23:31,141
Hang in there.

191
00:24:44,287 --> 00:24:46,118
And don't screw up.

192
00:24:56,399 --> 00:24:58,867
What the hell is wrong with the officials?

193
00:24:58,935 --> 00:25:02,803
I mean, the band can smell it.
The audience can feel it coming.

194
00:25:03,006 --> 00:25:05,270
Cross is going over the top.

195
00:25:05,341 --> 00:25:08,572
And if the officials would quit
playing games down there...

196
00:25:08,645 --> 00:25:11,988
...maybe we'll get this thing going!

197
00:26:45,781 --> 00:26:50,741
"From the mountain, to the prairies

198
00:26:53,356 --> 00:26:56,883
"From sea to shining sea"

199
00:27:01,564 --> 00:27:04,499
He asks if it's true your mother
is a crack whore.

200
00:27:04,567 --> 00:27:08,196
You actually translated that?
My mother's a pediatrician.

201
00:27:27,209 --> 00:27:30,110
The plane leaves at 8:00 a.m. sharp.

202
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:32,875
That's 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

203
00:27:33,282 --> 00:27:35,443
Be there. Be on it, or be history.

204
00:27:36,185 --> 00:27:38,517
We will see you in the morning.

205
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,220
My friends, they call me rabbit.

206
00:27:49,398 --> 00:27:50,626
Really?

207
00:27:58,006 --> 00:27:59,496
What was that?

208
00:27:59,575 --> 00:28:03,443
I think it's something about her
only batting for the home team.

209
00:28:22,097 --> 00:28:24,429
Management told me
you got to wear the hat.

210
00:28:24,499 --> 00:28:26,899
- Like hell I will.
- No, I'm serious.

211
00:28:26,969 --> 00:28:29,995
Management's going to tell us
what to do, Rid?

212
00:28:30,072 --> 00:28:31,733
- You got me.
- You wear the hat!

213
00:28:33,475 --> 00:28:36,672
I told you this was the promised land.
First one to the club buys?

214
00:28:37,412 --> 00:28:38,344
Jonathan!

215
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,469
You get off!

216
00:28:40,182 --> 00:28:42,412
- Asshole!
- I'm going to kick your ass, Rid.

217
00:29:37,873 --> 00:29:39,135
You guys are nuts!

218
00:29:39,207 --> 00:29:42,370
- I told you. It's the promised land.
- Yes, sir.

219
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:48,810
Hey, listen, please take extra special care
of this car, okay?

220
00:29:49,151 --> 00:29:50,345
Thank you.

221
00:29:50,552 --> 00:29:54,318
- Ready for Ridley's great adventure?
- Yeah, let's go play ball.

222
00:30:04,499 --> 00:30:06,160
Gentlemen.

223
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,473
- Rodeo.
- That's great.

224
00:30:41,103 --> 00:30:42,832
I love this country.

225
00:30:48,377 --> 00:30:53,212
Oh, my God. Honeys at 4:00.
Yes, ladies. Sir Ridley's in the house.

226
00:30:53,382 --> 00:30:56,647
- American horses, right?
- Absolutely. And hung like one.

227
00:30:57,686 --> 00:30:58,880
We don't speak much.

228
00:30:58,954 --> 00:31:01,650
That's the way I dig it, yo.
You don't speak much.

229
00:31:01,723 --> 00:31:03,088
"The way I dig it, yo"?

230
00:31:03,992 --> 00:31:06,825
You ever try to get laid
with an accounting degree?

231
00:31:09,331 --> 00:31:10,992
Hey, Jonathan!

232
00:31:11,233 --> 00:31:13,827
Hey, Katya, how are you?

233
00:31:13,902 --> 00:31:16,530
- My number. I got my number on.
- She's official.

234
00:31:16,605 --> 00:31:17,902
She's got her number.

235
00:31:17,973 --> 00:31:20,908
Congratulations. It looks beautiful!

236
00:31:21,043 --> 00:31:24,035
Don't like the idea
of a number tattooed on your face?

237
00:31:24,112 --> 00:31:25,477
You guessed it.

238
00:31:26,048 --> 00:31:29,211
Now we will all get big bonuses,
thanks to you, Uncle Sammies.

239
00:31:29,284 --> 00:31:31,411
To Jonathan and to Ridley.
Thank you very much.

240
00:31:31,486 --> 00:31:33,954
No. This toast should be to Toba.

241
00:31:35,023 --> 00:31:36,422
To Toba.

242
00:31:36,925 --> 00:31:38,358
Hey, come here.

243
00:31:38,427 --> 00:31:40,486
Come here. Take it. Go.

244
00:31:41,963 --> 00:31:43,726
Why do you show me disrespect?

245
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:46,768
You work 24 hours in the mines,
and it pays you nothing.

246
00:31:46,835 --> 00:31:49,429
I brought you here, and you try to pay?

247
00:31:51,473 --> 00:31:54,169
All right, my gypsy brother. Have a drink.

248
00:31:56,812 --> 00:31:59,007
A little wound tonight, Denny?

249
00:32:01,683 --> 00:32:05,210
What happened could have happened
to any of us.

250
00:32:07,122 --> 00:32:09,147
It's very bad shit, man.

251
00:32:09,257 --> 00:32:11,919
It's a rough game. That's why we get paid.

252
00:32:12,627 --> 00:32:15,289
You make a hundred times what I do.

253
00:32:16,731 --> 00:32:18,062
What's up, Denny?

254
00:32:27,142 --> 00:32:28,803
What if it wasn't an accident?

255
00:32:29,778 --> 00:32:31,245
What are you talking about?

256
00:32:32,314 --> 00:32:33,303
U-Chow.

257
00:32:34,616 --> 00:32:35,605
Show him.

258
00:32:41,189 --> 00:32:44,181
- The chin strap's been cut.
- Where'd you get this?

259
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,287
I found it in the trainer's office.

260
00:32:47,362 --> 00:32:48,829
Look at this.

261
00:32:54,102 --> 00:32:57,435
She says the gambling syndicate
probably put them up to it.

262
00:33:01,476 --> 00:33:03,341
We need to go tell Petrovich.

263
00:33:03,411 --> 00:33:05,504
No, we'll deal with this on the track.

264
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:08,811
Toba was almost killed, Rid.
He's the owner.

265
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,781
I wouldn't bother him with it.

266
00:33:10,852 --> 00:33:13,514
Fine, captain. I'll go.

267
00:33:14,556 --> 00:33:16,456
Enjoy the party.

268
00:33:22,998 --> 00:33:25,125
No move. Me be back soon.

269
00:33:32,807 --> 00:33:35,935
Tonight was the best game.
Real cowboy shit?

270
00:33:36,144 --> 00:33:38,476
- Is he available?
- Of course, for you.

271
00:33:38,547 --> 00:33:40,913
Gentlemen, please.

272
00:33:47,689 --> 00:33:49,156
My stallion.

273
00:33:49,758 --> 00:33:51,726
Hey, Ridley, my homie.

274
00:33:53,695 --> 00:33:55,162
Let me introduce my friends.

275
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:58,324
This is John Buckley from the US network.

276
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,631
- Enzo Molinadi, Canale Cinque.
- Hello. Pleasure to meet you.

277
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,375
And Yuri Kotlev, owner of the Horde.

278
00:34:10,445 --> 00:34:13,710
Be careful, Jonathan.
I think he's angry with you.

279
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:20,284
Dirk Cannon, an investor from Montana.
One of those places, you know.

280
00:34:20,355 --> 00:34:22,619
How do you do, son? Nice to meet you.

281
00:34:23,124 --> 00:34:24,421
Big money.

282
00:34:25,693 --> 00:34:27,888
Could I talk to you for a minute?

283
00:34:28,196 --> 00:34:30,391
Yes, of course. Please, this way.

284
00:34:31,633 --> 00:34:33,396
What can I do for you?

285
00:34:35,537 --> 00:34:37,971
I think the chin strap's been cut.

286
00:34:41,843 --> 00:34:44,812
- Where did you get this?
- It doesn't matter.

287
00:34:46,147 --> 00:34:48,547
No, you're right. It doesn't matter.

288
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:55,314
If that fat swine was behind this,
I will get the owners to take his team.

289
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:58,356
- May I keep this?
- What are you gonna do?

290
00:34:58,426 --> 00:35:01,589
I'll take care of it.
I swear on my mother's grave.

291
00:35:10,071 --> 00:35:14,007
Jonathan is the angriest man in the game.

292
00:35:14,642 --> 00:35:16,803
He just doesn't know it yet.

293
00:35:18,413 --> 00:35:20,677
Borges, you still back there?

294
00:35:20,748 --> 00:35:22,079
Discreetly.

295
00:35:22,283 --> 00:35:25,343
And how is Mr. Jonathan tonight?
You play good?

296
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:29,420
How come it always feels like
we got the freeways to ourselves?

297
00:35:29,757 --> 00:35:33,716
We are not a rich country, sir.

298
00:35:34,095 --> 00:35:38,054
No shit. So why's everybody bet their ass
on the rollerball?

299
00:35:38,132 --> 00:35:40,692
We call it the Atlantic City syndrome.

300
00:35:40,768 --> 00:35:42,759
Watch what you're saying.

301
00:35:44,706 --> 00:35:49,006
My apology, Jonathan.
Our problem. Not your problem.

302
00:35:50,445 --> 00:35:53,881
That's no worry, Borges.
You guys be good tonight.

303
00:35:54,282 --> 00:35:55,271
Don't wait up.

304
00:37:58,006 --> 00:38:00,440
You think we could do this
in a bed sometime?

305
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:02,968
You know, with sheets and stuff?

306
00:38:03,044 --> 00:38:04,841
We've been through this.

307
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,811
This should be our secret.

308
00:38:10,251 --> 00:38:14,085
How could I forget?
It could be used against us.

309
00:38:17,692 --> 00:38:19,455
Against me.

310
00:38:20,161 --> 00:38:21,856
You're untouchable.

311
00:38:23,031 --> 00:38:26,228
Come on, Aurora.
You don't need to hide all the time.

312
00:38:26,434 --> 00:38:27,526
I don't.

313
00:38:27,602 --> 00:38:30,901
Yes, you do.
You live in the dark, for Christ's sake.

314
00:38:31,939 --> 00:38:34,533
Your face isn't nearly as bad as you think.

315
00:38:34,609 --> 00:38:35,974
I know that.

316
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:39,873
Yeah, that's why you always turn your
left side to people.

317
00:38:41,115 --> 00:38:42,878
I don't always turn.

318
00:38:51,292 --> 00:38:52,919
Toba's helmet was cut.

319
00:38:56,197 --> 00:38:58,028
I took it to Petrovich.

320
00:38:59,667 --> 00:39:01,498
And you think that does some good?

321
00:39:01,569 --> 00:39:05,528
He seemed pretty upset.
I think he'll take it to the Horde owner.

322
00:39:07,241 --> 00:39:08,902
You are so naive.

323
00:39:10,144 --> 00:39:13,511
- Jonathan, they knew.
- They knew what?

324
00:39:14,015 --> 00:39:18,213
One of the TV guys put me on to this.
I think I can call it up.

325
00:39:21,055 --> 00:39:22,317
Here, look.

326
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:25,951
That's Toba getting hit.
It's caught clearly on five cameras.

327
00:39:26,027 --> 00:39:27,995
So they were following the action.

328
00:39:28,062 --> 00:39:30,360
Let me back the feeds up five seconds.

329
00:39:33,401 --> 00:39:34,595
Okay, now look.

330
00:39:34,669 --> 00:39:36,261
One camera follows the action...

331
00:39:36,337 --> 00:39:40,137
...and four cameras follow a simple-minded
boy at the other end of the track.

332
00:39:40,208 --> 00:39:44,770
They were called and told to get on him
15 seconds before it happened.

333
00:39:46,013 --> 00:39:50,313
The Horde did not make that happen.
Not on their own.

334
00:39:51,486 --> 00:39:54,421
This TV guy, you know where to find him?

335
00:40:04,499 --> 00:40:06,490
- What's going on?
- Demonstration.

336
00:40:06,634 --> 00:40:09,694
It is the headquarters for the mines.
Hang on.

337
00:40:18,412 --> 00:40:19,845
What do you want me to do?

338
00:40:26,821 --> 00:40:27,947
Get out of the car!

339
00:40:28,022 --> 00:40:29,785
- Get out!
- What's going on?

340
00:40:29,857 --> 00:40:33,054
- Trust me. Get out! Hurry!
- Aurora, what's the matter?

341
00:40:33,094 --> 00:40:34,412
Quick, Jonathan!

342
00:40:34,412 --> 00:40:34,673
Quick, Jonathan!

343
00:40:35,546 --> 00:40:36,979
Come over here!

344
00:40:37,581 --> 00:40:38,570
Hurry!

345
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,546
Jonathan, get in here!

346
00:40:46,857 --> 00:40:48,620
- Get in here!
- What is going on?

347
00:40:54,065 --> 00:40:56,192
That's my goddamn car!

348
00:40:58,169 --> 00:40:59,898
That's not your car.

349
00:41:00,404 --> 00:41:02,269
It belongs to Petrovich.

350
00:41:02,339 --> 00:41:04,739
He'll have another one for you tomorrow.

351
00:41:05,009 --> 00:41:07,443
Goddamn it. This is unbelievable.

352
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:13,609
Don't you know they can track you
with these things? Come on.

353
00:41:16,921 --> 00:41:18,149
What's with this place?

354
00:41:18,222 --> 00:41:22,056
The state housing authority sold off
the apartments, they went out of business.

355
00:41:22,126 --> 00:41:23,184
So what?

356
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:26,855
They never sold off the hallways.
Now there's no one to take care of them.

357
00:41:26,931 --> 00:41:28,592
No shit.

358
00:41:31,535 --> 00:41:32,797
Sergei?

359
00:41:47,384 --> 00:41:49,477
Stop! Don't kill him.

360
00:41:49,954 --> 00:41:52,855
Let me guess,
this isn't your friend Sergei, is it?

361
00:41:55,292 --> 00:41:56,953
No, Sergei's gone.

362
00:41:57,428 --> 00:42:00,864
Of course he is. We can't call the police
about it, either, right?

363
00:42:01,065 --> 00:42:03,932
Let's get out of here.
He may be the police.

364
00:42:28,659 --> 00:42:30,786
You almost missed the flight.

365
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:35,824
Jonathan, good morning.
It's a beautiful day.

366
00:42:38,302 --> 00:42:40,566
- Yeah.
- It was a long night.

367
00:42:40,938 --> 00:42:44,203
It was, yeah.
Partied, the usual thing with the team.

368
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:49,136
We found your car. Are you all right?

369
00:42:49,847 --> 00:42:53,715
- Yeah, I just had a little accident.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

370
00:43:01,625 --> 00:43:05,356
Hey, Serokin, did you follow me last night?

371
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:10,228
I just found your car. That's all.
Wouldn't want you to be without.

372
00:43:13,003 --> 00:43:16,131
So there was a goon in the apartment,
and he bugged out.

373
00:43:16,207 --> 00:43:19,973
Might've been a thousand reasons why.
He might've been lying to Aurora.

374
00:43:23,614 --> 00:43:26,777
Let's say they are screwing with the game.
Then?

375
00:43:27,251 --> 00:43:28,650
Yeah, then what?

376
00:43:32,289 --> 00:43:33,756
Then nothing.

377
00:43:34,391 --> 00:43:38,589
Status quo. We play, we win.
If it gets too sick, we walk.

378
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,548
Come on, guys. I've got meetings.

379
00:44:20,838 --> 00:44:23,170
Why can't I just take a cab to the hotel?

380
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,698
When the circus came to town,
did they let the elephants take a cab?

381
00:44:27,211 --> 00:44:30,044
You're the elephant. Get in the car, son.

382
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:23,363
It's an honor and a pleasure to be
broadcasting to you this evening...

383
00:45:23,434 --> 00:45:25,561
...with a crowd pushing 50,000...

384
00:45:25,636 --> 00:45:30,266
...in this beautiful desert city
on the shores of the blue, blue...

385
00:45:41,051 --> 00:45:43,542
Jeez, this outfit's got a lot of money.

386
00:45:44,421 --> 00:45:45,888
What is that?

387
00:45:47,558 --> 00:45:49,890
I'd say it's a good time in a can.

388
00:46:15,085 --> 00:46:17,383
Come on in here, and get your ass kicked.

389
00:46:17,454 --> 00:46:18,443
Come on!

390
00:46:19,523 --> 00:46:20,512
I love you.

391
00:46:27,831 --> 00:46:31,164
What channel did you say you
gave us in your territory?

392
00:46:31,368 --> 00:46:34,360
- 109.
- 109. I see.

393
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:37,007
1-freaking-09.

394
00:46:38,175 --> 00:46:40,973
They do origami on Channel 6...

395
00:46:41,045 --> 00:46:43,240
...of your silly hairball network!

396
00:46:43,747 --> 00:46:45,806
You ungrateful cretin!

397
00:46:48,385 --> 00:46:49,716
I will kill you myself!

398
00:46:50,354 --> 00:46:52,481
I will disappear your whole family!

399
00:46:52,623 --> 00:46:55,456
Tell your people,
you want to do business with us...

400
00:46:56,026 --> 00:46:59,052
...we are on Channels 1 through 5! Got it?

401
00:47:04,401 --> 00:47:05,493
You got that?

402
00:47:10,841 --> 00:47:12,433
Goddamn mouse.

403
00:47:14,244 --> 00:47:15,905
Goal, yes, goal.

404
00:47:15,979 --> 00:47:18,215
The Red Horsemen are rolling
over the home...

405
00:48:25,048 --> 00:48:26,413
No! Stop it!

406
00:48:53,376 --> 00:48:54,968
Are you from Omaha or something?

407
00:48:55,045 --> 00:48:57,570
It was a matter of time
before they realized...

408
00:48:57,647 --> 00:49:00,582
...their take would go up
if they got blood on the track.

409
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:03,483
Think they struggle with the morality of it?

410
00:49:03,687 --> 00:49:06,781
- Soon they'll kill somebody.
- That's what I'm talking about.

411
00:49:06,856 --> 00:49:09,916
I make more in a season
than I would 10 years doing taxes.

412
00:49:09,993 --> 00:49:12,484
Nothing will happen to us. They need us.

413
00:49:12,629 --> 00:49:16,292
So just close your eyes,
and take the money, okay?

414
00:50:06,449 --> 00:50:07,814
Sergei, the TV guy...

415
00:50:10,654 --> 00:50:14,988
...they found him at the border,
his throat cut and his mouth sewn shut.

416
00:50:15,058 --> 00:50:16,889
Hey, what's up?

417
00:50:28,738 --> 00:50:30,899
You don't look so good. What's going on?

418
00:50:33,843 --> 00:50:38,405
Well, you hit the Pod ramp and jump,
and then I cross under and go.

419
00:50:38,481 --> 00:50:40,847
And then you shot,
and then you did the 4-40...

420
00:50:40,917 --> 00:50:43,886
...so I wasn't sure,
but I think you scored the touchdown.

421
00:50:46,322 --> 00:50:47,254
Got it?

422
00:50:48,525 --> 00:50:50,755
Absolutely.
I scored a touchdown and I win.

423
00:50:53,163 --> 00:50:54,755
Gotcha.

424
00:51:01,871 --> 00:51:03,179
We'll beat them!

425
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:08,710
This Mongol Blue Team
is on fire and insane!

426
00:51:08,818 --> 00:51:11,548
They're lathered up
like a Siberian wolf pack...

427
00:51:11,621 --> 00:51:14,988
...ready to tear the Reds limb from limb.

428
00:51:15,491 --> 00:51:17,959
You're not wearing
your spine protector, right?

429
00:51:18,027 --> 00:51:19,494
That's right.

430
00:51:35,111 --> 00:51:37,511
With a quarter left to play,
it's the Horsemen...

431
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:43,111
I see.

432
00:51:49,892 --> 00:51:52,258
We should make some arrangements.

433
00:51:52,929 --> 00:51:56,365
I don't want problems! I want solutions.

434
00:52:11,147 --> 00:52:12,478
It's in the works.

435
00:52:28,865 --> 00:52:32,995
We got ourselves a motorcycle race here!

436
00:52:44,147 --> 00:52:46,012
Aurora just got hammered!

437
00:52:46,082 --> 00:52:49,882
That son of a bitch has got to be
eight feet tall.

438
00:52:55,024 --> 00:52:57,993
Here's your bike, little lady.
Hope I didn't bend it.

439
00:52:59,495 --> 00:53:01,360
I wish you spoke English.

440
00:53:01,798 --> 00:53:04,062
I speak it just fine, asshole.

441
00:53:31,127 --> 00:53:32,253
Bail out!

442
00:54:12,335 --> 00:54:15,395
Easy fellas. Come on, get him out.

443
00:54:21,844 --> 00:54:23,175
We're out of here.

444
00:54:46,068 --> 00:54:47,729
Ridley, my man.

445
00:54:48,404 --> 00:54:49,632
How are you?

446
00:54:49,705 --> 00:54:51,969
I feel like Freddy Krueger.

447
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:56,706
- How is he, doctor?
- Hey, I'm good.

448
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:59,774
- He should be resting.
- I feel fine. I can play.

449
00:55:00,249 --> 00:55:01,876
- You sure about that?
- I feel fine.

450
00:55:01,951 --> 00:55:05,045
- Are you up to it?
- It was, after all, just an accident.

451
00:55:05,288 --> 00:55:08,382
You don't know how glad I am
to hear you say that.

452
00:55:09,525 --> 00:55:12,426
All right, that's it. Let's go. Out!

453
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:16,461
You promised me you'd stop this.

454
00:55:16,532 --> 00:55:19,262
Dear God, your tone.
How have I denied you?

455
00:55:20,036 --> 00:55:23,028
I have made you into a rich man,
an international star.

456
00:55:23,272 --> 00:55:25,433
I created a sport that you could thrive in.

457
00:55:25,675 --> 00:55:29,475
I have given you total freedom
to do as you please, and even satellite TV.

458
00:55:29,545 --> 00:55:32,207
And ask for one thing, your trust.

459
00:55:33,216 --> 00:55:36,413
So, will both my studs
be at practice tomorrow?

460
00:55:36,485 --> 00:55:38,453
- Yes, sir.
- Excellent.

461
00:55:38,854 --> 00:55:40,759
Horsemen, Number 1.

462
00:55:41,193 --> 00:55:45,027
Watch them. They take a shit,
I want to know what it smells like.

463
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:01,068
Let's go.

464
00:56:17,229 --> 00:56:18,321
Wait.

465
00:56:21,567 --> 00:56:23,159
Don't move.

466
00:56:37,483 --> 00:56:40,782
Close the doors.
It's cold as hell. Please, the door.

467
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:42,715
Hey, the door!

468
00:56:45,691 --> 00:56:47,022
Come on, Denny.

469
00:56:50,195 --> 00:56:51,628
What about our passports?

470
00:56:51,697 --> 00:56:53,858
Katya tried. She couldn't get them.

471
00:56:53,933 --> 00:56:55,901
She's afraid. They have something on her.

472
00:56:55,968 --> 00:56:58,698
- We have to wing it.
- You get the cash from my place?

473
00:56:58,771 --> 00:57:01,262
Your apartment was being watched
all the time.

474
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:06,971
The players put this together.

475
00:57:14,954 --> 00:57:16,216
Thanks, Den.

476
00:57:18,324 --> 00:57:19,416
Thank them.

477
00:57:19,892 --> 00:57:21,587
I don't know what to say.

478
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:24,993
Okay, look. The nearest border is Russia.

479
00:57:27,166 --> 00:57:30,499
You have two crossings
at the Russian border. Here and here.

480
00:57:30,569 --> 00:57:34,027
One is by the river.
Leave now, you can make it by morning.

481
00:57:34,106 --> 00:57:38,304
- I thought you two were coming with us...
- No, he has family here. I have my mother.

482
00:57:38,377 --> 00:57:41,039
If you don't want them to disappear
or have an accident...

483
00:57:41,113 --> 00:57:42,944
You can never really leave.

484
00:57:43,749 --> 00:57:45,444
- Aurora, wait a minute!
- No.

485
00:57:45,517 --> 00:57:47,815
- Are you going to be okay?
- Stop.

486
00:57:54,994 --> 00:57:57,622
Before you say something
even more stupid.

487
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:10,208
Get the light over there on the wall.

488
00:58:28,293 --> 00:58:32,787
There's no way I'm going to die
in this shithole of a country. No way.

489
00:58:33,532 --> 00:58:35,329
We left the rest of the team, Rid.

490
00:58:35,401 --> 00:58:38,268
How many times
you have to get your head handed to you...

491
00:58:38,337 --> 00:58:41,363
...before you stop picking fights
with people who are too big?

492
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:46,036
This isn't some college coach you can
flick off. These are dangerous people.

493
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,110
Look, Jon. She's safe.

494
00:58:52,818 --> 00:58:55,844
She's safe. Nobody knew about you two.

495
00:59:06,932 --> 00:59:09,162
Shit. We have company.

496
00:59:16,341 --> 00:59:18,832
Looks like they brought
the whole Russian cavalry.

497
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:22,074
Great. We're being chased
by our own bodyguards.

498
00:59:30,923 --> 00:59:33,289
Here they come! They're on your bumper!

499
00:59:33,659 --> 00:59:35,923
The fender. Squeeze them!

500
00:59:36,662 --> 00:59:37,651
Shit!

501
00:59:42,234 --> 00:59:44,099
Come on, you son of a bitch!

502
00:59:53,579 --> 00:59:56,446
- That ain't going to work twice.
- They're still coming on us.

503
00:59:56,515 --> 00:59:59,416
- Remember Squeak Harris?
- Of course I remember Squeak Harris.

504
00:59:59,485 --> 01:00:00,884
Remember how he died?

505
01:00:02,688 --> 01:00:05,486
- Change with me.
- Shit.

506
01:00:09,728 --> 01:00:12,219
Let's rock 'n' roll! One, two, three!

507
01:00:43,595 --> 01:00:46,587
Goddamn it! This road isn't even paved!

508
01:00:47,666 --> 01:00:51,830
I haven't seen lights in about an hour.
Why don't we back it off a little?

509
01:00:52,104 --> 01:00:54,538
How fast are we going, anyway?

510
01:00:55,207 --> 01:00:56,902
I don't know. It's in clicks.

511
01:00:56,975 --> 01:01:01,241
- Well, how fast is it in clicks, then?
- 110, 120.

512
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:03,241
That's not so bad.

513
01:01:06,084 --> 01:01:08,678
Ridley, that's in miles per hour!

514
01:01:08,921 --> 01:01:11,321
- So what?
- So what?

515
01:01:11,623 --> 01:01:16,026
You're going 120 miles per hour
on a hog on a dirt road!

516
01:01:16,461 --> 01:01:19,191
It's not an off-road bike, Rid!

517
01:01:20,499 --> 01:01:23,127
It's 10 clicks to the border. Chill.

518
01:01:23,335 --> 01:01:27,999
That 10 clicks is going to be a long walk
if one of these tires goes out.

519
01:01:32,211 --> 01:01:34,907
Shit. Ridley, we've got lights!

520
01:01:35,714 --> 01:01:37,909
Don't look! Watch the road!

521
01:01:37,983 --> 01:01:40,781
- It looks like they're gaining on us.
- What?

522
01:01:43,024 --> 01:01:45,925
They're definitely gaining on us, and fast!

523
01:01:46,328 --> 01:01:48,319
What the hell could they be driving?

524
01:01:48,396 --> 01:01:50,330
Look, my limit's 150, man.

525
01:01:54,069 --> 01:01:57,300
Faster!
What in the world are they driving?

526
01:02:00,809 --> 01:02:02,242
Shit!

527
01:02:05,614 --> 01:02:07,172
Son of a bitch!

528
01:02:22,130 --> 01:02:23,495
Come on, baby!

529
01:02:24,432 --> 01:02:26,423
Who said this isn't an off-road bike?

530
01:02:28,837 --> 01:02:33,171
I got news for you, Rid!
They've got an off-road airplane!

531
01:02:52,794 --> 01:02:53,920
There it is.

532
01:02:53,995 --> 01:02:56,122
That's it? That's the border?

533
01:02:56,398 --> 01:02:58,866
What do you want?
A Stuckey's and a casino?

534
01:04:11,339 --> 01:04:12,863
We can make it.

535
01:04:13,441 --> 01:04:15,170
It won't work. Not double.

536
01:04:15,543 --> 01:04:18,307
- Then you go.
- Don't get saintly on me.

537
01:04:19,447 --> 01:04:20,641
Look, I got you into this!

538
01:04:20,715 --> 01:04:22,512
Your kids. Go home.

539
01:04:23,418 --> 01:04:26,114
- Ridley, I'll be fine. I promise.
- No!

540
01:04:26,187 --> 01:04:28,553
Get to the American consulate
on the other side.

541
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:31,917
They'll have me on a plane first thing
in the morning.

542
01:04:33,261 --> 01:04:35,456
Go! Get out of here! Go!

543
01:04:35,797 --> 01:04:37,424
You better make it.

544
01:04:39,467 --> 01:04:40,695
Serokin.

545
01:04:45,707 --> 01:04:48,972
"Close your eyes, and take the money."
God forgive me.

546
01:04:52,947 --> 01:04:53,936
Wait.

547
01:04:54,249 --> 01:04:55,682
Let's see if he makes it.

548
01:04:58,253 --> 01:04:59,413
Come on.

549
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:10,520
Magnificent.

550
01:05:40,495 --> 01:05:41,689
Let's go.

551
01:05:42,030 --> 01:05:44,692
Make sure you tip the border guards well.

552
01:05:59,214 --> 01:06:02,308
Did you really think
I could let you pull a stunt like that?

553
01:06:02,417 --> 01:06:05,352
Even if I wanted to? In front of them?

554
01:06:06,588 --> 01:06:08,317
How could you do that to me?

555
01:06:09,724 --> 01:06:11,692
How could you be so...

556
01:06:13,194 --> 01:06:14,218
...thoughtless?

557
01:06:15,630 --> 01:06:17,894
All right. We start again.

558
01:06:19,901 --> 01:06:24,099
I'll give you a bonus of $100,000 US,
payable however...

559
01:06:24,706 --> 01:06:27,072
...you play through the championship.

560
01:06:27,242 --> 01:06:30,678
Play till the goddamn cable deal closes.

561
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:33,311
Then you may go where you wish!

562
01:06:34,215 --> 01:06:37,309
I'll even give you a retirement game!

563
01:06:38,086 --> 01:06:39,917
Go fuck yourself.

564
01:06:45,293 --> 01:06:47,386
Throw that sack of shit out of here!

565
01:06:52,033 --> 01:06:53,762
Get rid of him!

566
01:07:09,751 --> 01:07:11,048
Jonathan.

567
01:07:13,888 --> 01:07:15,856
What are we going to do with you?

568
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:22,118
In the old regime, Petrovich was above the
official rank in Spetsnaz before he was 30.

569
01:07:23,464 --> 01:07:27,264
KGB colonels used to cross the street
when they saw him come.

570
01:07:27,602 --> 01:07:29,536
Now they line up to grovel in the dust.

571
01:07:29,604 --> 01:07:31,504
Would you like a drink of water?

572
01:07:33,241 --> 01:07:34,230
No.

573
01:07:34,475 --> 01:07:38,275
You obviously don't care anything
for yourself, but think of the girl.

574
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:42,176
You don't imagine
you have any secrets, do you?

575
01:07:42,917 --> 01:07:46,409
Why do you think she's still alive?
Because Petrovich needs you.

576
01:07:46,688 --> 01:07:49,885
He'll give you anything,
including the life of that lady...

577
01:07:49,958 --> 01:07:52,290
...if you play your cards right.

578
01:07:54,329 --> 01:07:56,729
You have an opportunity here.

579
01:07:57,231 --> 01:07:59,893
You might call it
the opportunity of a lifetime.

580
01:08:37,545 --> 01:08:41,914
You see Yevgeny over there,
so full of himself now.

581
01:08:43,451 --> 01:08:45,248
He used to work in the post office.

582
01:08:45,319 --> 01:08:49,847
I introduced him to the proper financing,
and now he owns the mines.

583
01:08:50,224 --> 01:08:52,124
Yeah, making a fortune.

584
01:08:52,293 --> 01:08:55,091
Keeps the miners in line. Good business.

585
01:08:57,531 --> 01:09:00,557
You might wonder why I'm not in it myself.

586
01:09:01,903 --> 01:09:05,634
I don't need to own the mines, Jonathan.
Do you know why?

587
01:09:05,907 --> 01:09:10,537
Because I own the man
who owns the mines. All he has, I have.

588
01:09:10,611 --> 01:09:14,843
Same with the supermarkets,
the TV station, locomotive plant.

589
01:09:16,050 --> 01:09:20,783
I don't need a political position,
because I own the men who do.

590
01:09:23,324 --> 01:09:26,384
We learn to separate ourselves
from humanity.

591
01:09:26,627 --> 01:09:30,688
Like you, Jonathan,
separate yourself from your teammates.

592
01:09:34,535 --> 01:09:36,696
You can keep your $100,000.

593
01:09:38,639 --> 01:09:40,504
But I do like the view from up here.

594
01:09:43,311 --> 01:09:45,336
No, I want more.

595
01:09:46,414 --> 01:09:51,113
I want ownership. Part of the media
rights, gambling revenues, the works.

596
01:09:54,188 --> 01:09:57,021
Jonathan, are you fooling with me?

597
01:10:01,562 --> 01:10:05,396
Come on, Alexi, we both want
the same thing here, don't we?

598
01:10:10,571 --> 01:10:12,266
Good. Very good.

599
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:16,970
Let Serokin take you back home.
You've got a big night ahead of you.

600
01:10:22,950 --> 01:10:23,974
What?

601
01:10:26,387 --> 01:10:30,255
Aurora's kind of bugging me.
You know? Getting way too serious.

602
01:10:30,424 --> 01:10:32,824
I hate that, too. Women.

603
01:10:35,930 --> 01:10:39,661
I want her out of my life.
Do me a favor and trade her.

604
01:10:40,101 --> 01:10:43,036
No problem. People disappear all the time.

605
01:10:43,237 --> 01:10:45,535
No, trade her, Alexi. Just trade her.

606
01:10:45,606 --> 01:10:49,098
I like the lady.
I don't want her disappeared, just gone.

607
01:10:49,176 --> 01:10:51,838
All right. I'll do that.

608
01:10:57,985 --> 01:10:59,077
Play well tonight.

609
01:11:00,354 --> 01:11:01,719
Play well.

610
01:11:11,298 --> 01:11:14,699
He gave me a load of shit
about wanting to become a partner.

611
01:11:16,404 --> 01:11:18,929
Just cover to get the girl out.

612
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:21,570
Did you give him that?

613
01:11:22,410 --> 01:11:24,901
I thought it was too subtle for him.

614
01:11:25,513 --> 01:11:28,277
So the first chance he gets, he'll bolt.

615
01:11:28,616 --> 01:11:32,347
Shit! I'm this close
to a North American cable deal!

616
01:11:34,989 --> 01:11:38,584
Well, maybe there is one thing we can do
to turn this to a profit.

617
01:11:38,793 --> 01:11:41,660
You did promise him
a retirement game, after all.

618
01:11:46,333 --> 01:11:48,130
Sanjay, you are a rat.

619
01:11:48,436 --> 01:11:50,870
But you are my rat, and I love you.

620
01:11:51,072 --> 01:11:53,233
Go ahead. Trade the girl.

621
01:11:57,912 --> 01:12:00,039
Trade the girl to the Horde.

622
01:12:00,247 --> 01:12:03,444
But we're playing them tonight.
He wants her gone.

623
01:12:04,151 --> 01:12:06,847
Life is full of little disappointments.

624
01:12:07,488 --> 01:12:10,082
Make sure they get a number on her.

625
01:12:49,964 --> 01:12:53,627
We heard you were in a rock-climbing
accident! Are you all right?

626
01:12:55,803 --> 01:12:58,931
Yeah, you know me. I'm hard to hurt.

627
01:12:59,073 --> 01:13:01,871
Where is Ridley?
You guys are always together!

628
01:14:00,501 --> 01:14:02,229
Be careful.

629
01:14:14,207 --> 01:14:16,437
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is what it's all about.

630
01:14:16,510 --> 01:14:20,640
One hard-fought struggle for
all the marbles. And the Red Horsemen...

631
01:14:22,415 --> 01:14:24,883
There is unbelievable tension in this arena.

632
01:14:25,085 --> 01:14:29,181
There are four teams in the quarterfinals,
but without Marcus Ridley...

633
01:14:29,289 --> 01:14:31,587
...who was crippled
by an attack of malaria...

634
01:14:31,725 --> 01:14:34,888
...which he contracted in the tropics
on an archeological dig.

635
01:14:34,995 --> 01:14:35,984
Malaria?

636
01:14:36,663 --> 01:14:38,961
If they'll buy it, I'll sell it.

637
01:14:56,917 --> 01:14:58,407
Rid isn't sick, is he?

638
01:14:58,485 --> 01:15:00,715
Don't get in this, Denny. Stay out of it.

639
01:15:01,521 --> 01:15:04,149
- You shouldn't go out there, man.
- I've got to.

640
01:15:04,291 --> 01:15:08,284
That's how I got him to send Aurora away.
He made it real clear.

641
01:15:08,495 --> 01:15:11,293
- Where are they sending her?
- What do I care?

642
01:15:11,464 --> 01:15:13,659
Just as long it's away from here.

643
01:15:13,967 --> 01:15:18,199
- What makes you think you can trust him?
- I don't have a choice.

644
01:15:18,438 --> 01:15:19,871
You can't help me, Denny.

645
01:16:25,772 --> 01:16:29,936
The Golden Horde, however, seem to have
several transfers from other teams.

646
01:16:55,435 --> 01:16:57,835
Hey. See they got a number on you.

647
01:16:58,338 --> 01:17:00,499
Nice. Very nice.

648
01:17:19,092 --> 01:17:22,357
Get the goddamn camera
out of my face, ass-wipe!

649
01:17:36,376 --> 01:17:40,608
And now for all of you out there,
a surprise is on the way.

650
01:17:40,814 --> 01:17:44,841
Despite reports of a rock-climbing accident,
he's coming back.

651
01:17:45,085 --> 01:17:49,579
Despite the pleading of his trainers
and his doctors, he's coming back.

652
01:17:50,156 --> 01:17:52,852
He's coming back for the love of the game.

653
01:17:52,926 --> 01:17:56,384
He's coming back for you and for me.

654
01:17:56,763 --> 01:17:59,823
The greatest rollerballer
who has ever lived...

655
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,491
...your very own Jonathan...

656
01:18:02,635 --> 01:18:03,624
Cross!

657
01:18:37,137 --> 01:18:38,502
Look.

658
01:18:39,406 --> 01:18:41,033
Bravo! Yes.

659
01:18:44,444 --> 01:18:45,376
What's this?

660
01:18:48,181 --> 01:18:49,512
You understand that?

661
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:55,017
They give this message to you:

662
01:18:55,188 --> 01:18:59,648
"Play well. And she will be on
the Horde team, playing tonight."

663
01:19:01,895 --> 01:19:04,090
Ladies and gentlemen,
a special announcement.

664
01:19:04,164 --> 01:19:06,655
As you all know,
at the last owners' meeting...

665
01:19:06,933 --> 01:19:09,925
...certain rule changes were
proposed and adopted.

666
01:19:10,136 --> 01:19:14,300
In the final elimination round,
normal rules and penalties are to be...

667
01:19:14,607 --> 01:19:16,575
...suspended.

668
01:19:18,745 --> 01:19:20,007
What are they doing?

669
01:19:22,549 --> 01:19:23,743
The game will be played...

670
01:19:23,817 --> 01:19:27,309
...with no fouls called and no penalties.

671
01:19:28,555 --> 01:19:31,388
What is this shit? There's no such rule!

672
01:19:47,574 --> 01:19:51,476
No penalties.
This is going to be interesting.

673
01:19:52,479 --> 01:19:54,310
He tattooed her face.

674
01:19:54,981 --> 01:19:58,348
- What are you going to do?
- Play the goddamn game, I guess.

675
01:20:05,191 --> 01:20:07,625
You ever see thugs like that
on the bench before?

676
01:20:08,094 --> 01:20:11,461
This will make us, my friend.
This will make us.

677
01:20:11,898 --> 01:20:14,992
You have the pictures and resumés
on the replacements?

678
01:20:24,344 --> 01:20:25,971
What we've got here...

679
01:20:28,348 --> 01:20:30,509
...is Jonathan and Uglich...

680
01:20:33,186 --> 01:20:34,983
...in a no-holds-barred cockfight.

681
01:20:44,664 --> 01:20:46,529
Say hello to Mr. Denekin!

682
01:20:51,371 --> 01:20:52,668
Cross snags it.

683
01:20:53,373 --> 01:20:56,604
No bogarting this time.
He passes it to Katya...

684
01:20:57,110 --> 01:20:58,475
...who scores!

685
01:20:58,678 --> 01:21:03,672
Boy, this crowd sure appreciates Denekin,
the local boy who made good.

686
01:21:04,217 --> 01:21:06,617
He has a lot of friends in the audience...

687
01:21:06,686 --> 01:21:09,849
...including his entire shift from the mine.

688
01:21:28,908 --> 01:21:31,934
Gold seems to have
an extra player on the track.

689
01:21:32,011 --> 01:21:33,960
Have we got some kind of
grudge match here!

690
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:35,086
Have we got some kind of
grudge match here!

691
01:21:35,161 --> 01:21:38,961
Aurora seems determined
to wipe out Jonathan Cross.

692
01:21:39,198 --> 01:21:41,689
Stay down. Get out of this.

693
01:21:42,702 --> 01:21:44,431
They're going to kill you!

694
01:21:44,504 --> 01:21:46,438
Aurora, get off the track.

695
01:21:48,007 --> 01:21:49,338
Go on, girl.

696
01:22:33,319 --> 01:22:35,480
Holy shit, he's wearing a spine protector.

697
01:22:35,555 --> 01:22:36,647
He knew.

698
01:22:45,331 --> 01:22:47,356
Here's your grudge match!

699
01:22:47,533 --> 01:22:50,434
Uglich and company
singling out Jonathan Cross...

700
01:22:50,503 --> 01:22:52,903
...and trying to put him in the ground!

701
01:22:55,541 --> 01:22:56,530
Shit.

702
01:23:00,546 --> 01:23:02,104
Cross turns it around!

703
01:23:04,984 --> 01:23:06,474
Takes out Robot!

704
01:23:07,186 --> 01:23:09,882
Look out! Uglich's dead meat!

705
01:23:17,296 --> 01:23:20,231
You see? The show is just getting started.

706
01:23:20,433 --> 01:23:23,596
That's about the hardest hit I've ever seen!

707
01:23:28,908 --> 01:23:32,241
I got the Asian flu. Come on, baby.

708
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:36,107
What the hell are they doing?

709
01:23:36,482 --> 01:23:37,574
Yeah!

710
01:23:38,484 --> 01:23:42,250
This may be getting out of hand.
Maybe we should call the whole thing off.

711
01:23:42,321 --> 01:23:43,345
No.

712
01:23:44,323 --> 01:23:46,348
The Red coach is calling a time-out...

713
01:23:46,926 --> 01:23:49,417
...trying to get her players out of the game.

714
01:23:49,595 --> 01:23:51,586
Come in! We want you to come in.

715
01:23:52,031 --> 01:23:56,627
- She should go kill herself.
- No. She's right. Get off the track.

716
01:24:05,645 --> 01:24:07,237
Is anybody going to stop this?

717
01:24:07,513 --> 01:24:10,573
- We should cut the feed.
- No. Leave it.

718
01:24:11,951 --> 01:24:14,920
Get off the track, Katya.
Denekin, get out of this.

719
01:24:16,789 --> 01:24:17,778
Dumb cowboy.

720
01:24:22,094 --> 01:24:23,755
You don't have to do this.

721
01:24:28,401 --> 01:24:30,369
The man wants a show, Rid.

722
01:24:31,303 --> 01:24:33,635
I guess we'll have to give him one.

723
01:24:52,191 --> 01:24:53,180
Punk!

724
01:25:36,335 --> 01:25:38,098
Cut the satellite feed.

725
01:25:38,704 --> 01:25:40,001
I said cut it.

726
01:25:47,613 --> 01:25:49,376
No more of this! Enough!

727
01:26:26,185 --> 01:26:29,211
Open your eyes, fool.
The world's about to blow up.

728
01:26:38,864 --> 01:26:40,229
Jonathan.

729
01:27:11,630 --> 01:27:13,063
Listen to them.

730
01:27:23,209 --> 01:27:24,699
I'd better go sort this out.

731
01:28:21,767 --> 01:28:22,893
Do it.

732
01:28:25,871 --> 01:28:26,860
Do it!

733
01:28:30,542 --> 01:28:32,373
Holy shit!

734
01:30:23,922 --> 01:30:26,652
Bravo! Jolly good show, and all that.

735
01:30:27,426 --> 01:30:29,553
I wonder what he was looking for.

736
01:30:31,997 --> 01:30:33,692
These probably.

737
01:30:37,302 --> 01:30:39,031
Well, young Jonathan...

738
01:30:40,405 --> 01:30:42,498
...you've done marvelously well.

739
01:30:42,608 --> 01:30:47,375
But one basic rule in this sort of thing is
that you must never kill a tyrant...

740
01:30:48,380 --> 01:30:51,679
...unless you've made an arrangement
with his successor.

741
01:30:53,151 --> 01:30:55,142
You do see what I mean, don't you?

742
01:30:56,154 --> 01:30:59,317
Yeah. It means I'm not done yet.

743
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:24,548
This game may be over.

744
01:31:56,715 --> 01:31:59,206
Hey, it's me.

745
01:32:04,589 --> 01:32:07,217
You may have started yourself
a revolution.

746
01:32:08,293 --> 01:32:10,488
Get some of these
shotgun pellets removed.

747
01:32:10,562 --> 01:32:12,291
Nah, he missed me.

748
01:32:12,364 --> 01:32:13,956
Not entirely, he didn't.

749
01:32:22,641 --> 01:32:24,165
What are they doing?

750
01:32:24,343 --> 01:32:27,779
You stood up to one of the monsters
that run their lives.

751
01:32:28,447 --> 01:32:30,540
And they saw you do it.

752
01:32:37,489 --> 01:32:40,356
- Where are we headed?
- To a doctor, to start with.

753
01:32:40,425 --> 01:32:42,359
And then if you're able...

754
01:32:43,028 --> 01:32:45,553
...I thought I might take you home
to my bed.
