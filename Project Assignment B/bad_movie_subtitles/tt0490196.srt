1
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,970
All right, boys.

2
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:48,802
Meow!

3
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:00,886
Don't fight. Don't fight.

4
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:03,182
Oh, to the left.

5
00:02:16,502 --> 00:02:18,970
<i>Bring mama home, baby!</i>
<i>Bring mama home, baby!</i>

6
00:02:19,071 --> 00:02:20,971
<i>Yes!</i>

7
00:02:21,073 --> 00:02:22,267
<i>- Jazmin!</i>
- Say my name, baby.

8
00:02:22,374 --> 00:02:25,832
- Jazmin Nellie Mae Biltmore!
- Oh, yes! Full address!

9
00:02:25,944 --> 00:02:29,243
Fine, but you made me do it.

10
00:02:31,717 --> 00:02:33,810
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yes!

11
00:02:35,153 --> 00:02:37,849
- Ooh! What's cooking?
- Soy oatmeal.

12
00:02:37,956 --> 00:02:40,151
Come on. Get up before you late for work.

13
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:42,318
Stacey's gonna be down there
blowin' any minute...

14
00:02:42,427 --> 00:02:44,327
and you need to be ready
when she comes.

15
00:02:44,429 --> 00:02:47,364
Hell, I'm trying to come too,
but your ass keep waking me up...

16
00:02:47,499 --> 00:02:50,127
before I get there,
you filthy bitch!

17
00:02:50,235 --> 00:02:53,432
Damn. Bitch can't even
get none in her own dreams.

18
00:02:56,408 --> 00:02:58,308
Good morning, beautiful.

19
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:02,564
<i>We'll pick up</i>
<i>where we left off tomorrow.</i>

20
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,564
Maybe if you stuck
to one of your diets...

21
00:03:07,034 --> 00:03:09,332
you could get some
in real life.

22
00:03:15,776 --> 00:03:17,801
I hate skinny bitches.

23
00:03:17,912 --> 00:03:20,073
<i>Ever since we were little girls...</i>

24
00:03:20,181 --> 00:03:24,277
<i>my cousin Mia was a bone,</i>
<i>and I was slightly larger.</i>

25
00:03:24,385 --> 00:03:26,250
<i>While our mothers were out</i>
<i>makin' a livin'...</i>

26
00:03:26,354 --> 00:03:28,379
<i>Grandma Nellie practically</i>
<i>raised us as sisters.</i>

27
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:30,855
<i>But I hated Mia</i>
<i>all through elementary school...</i>

28
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:35,361
<i>because she would just stand by and watch</i>
<i>as her skinny friends called me names...</i>

29
00:03:35,463 --> 00:03:37,761
<i>and terrorized me just 'cause</i>
<i>I ain't look like that.</i>

30
00:03:42,436 --> 00:03:44,404
<i>Besides Grandma,</i>
<i>my only friend was-</i>

31
00:03:44,505 --> 00:03:46,473
<i>God, please help me lose weight.</i>

32
00:03:46,574 --> 00:03:48,974
<i>But he didn't seem to be listening.</i>

33
00:03:49,076 --> 00:03:51,772
<i>By junior high school,</i>
<i>I was a solid 200 pounds...</i>

34
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:55,110
<i>and my school-yard entourage</i>
<i>consisted of a whopping three people-</i>

35
00:03:55,216 --> 00:03:58,185
<i>me, myself and I.</i>

36
00:03:58,285 --> 00:04:01,152
<i>Life as a skinny girl bull's-eye</i>
<i>was pretty much routine...</i>

37
00:04:01,255 --> 00:04:05,055
<i>until one day this real prissy</i>
<i>girl named Quaniqua Jackson...</i>

38
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:09,323
<i>called me a</i> fat bitch
<i>in front of Benji Ross.</i>

39
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,625
<i>Now, it wasn't the first time</i>
<i>I'd been called that...</i>

40
00:04:11,732 --> 00:04:15,793
<i>but calling me that in front of my</i>
<i>future husband, baby, that required action.</i>

41
00:04:15,903 --> 00:04:19,236
<i>I don't know what took over me,</i>
<i>but the next thing I knew...</i>

42
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,434
<i>Miss Quaniqua Jackson was seein' stars.</i>

43
00:04:22,543 --> 00:04:25,205
<i>Now, I learned a very</i>
<i>valuable lesson that day, and that was...</i>

44
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:28,679
<i>if I couldn't get respect</i>
<i>because I wasn't a stick...</i>

45
00:04:28,783 --> 00:04:33,277
<i>then I'd get respect</i>
<i>because I was a stone.</i>

46
00:04:33,387 --> 00:04:35,287
<i>What's up, L. A.? Good morning.</i>

47
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:38,552
<i>Time to get up and go to work. It's another</i>
<i>beautiful day in Southern California...</i>

48
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:41,059
<i>and you better leave on time</i>
<i>'cause traffic is a mother.</i>

49
00:04:41,162 --> 00:04:44,427
<i>- I'm coming, girl!</i>

50
00:04:44,532 --> 00:04:46,932
<i>- Come on!</i>
- All right.

51
00:04:47,034 --> 00:04:50,128
As soon as I find something to wear.

52
00:04:52,306 --> 00:04:54,240
All right.

53
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:58,505
Damn it! What the hell?

54
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:03,514
I swear these clothes
are shrinking.

55
00:05:03,617 --> 00:05:06,984
No, porky, your big ass just gettin' fatter.

56
00:05:08,189 --> 00:05:11,420
I'm coming, Stace! Damn!

57
00:05:15,463 --> 00:05:19,490
I need some Crisco.
Oh! Is this the wrong hole?

58
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,296
Wait a minute. Oh, sh-

59
00:05:37,318 --> 00:05:41,254
Not my sexiest combo,
but I still look good.

60
00:05:41,355 --> 00:05:43,789
Too hot for 'em, Jaz.

61
00:05:57,505 --> 00:05:59,769
- Child, come on before we get late.
- All right.

62
00:05:59,874 --> 00:06:03,037
I ain't gonna carpool with you no more
if you can't be on time.

63
00:06:03,143 --> 00:06:07,170
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right.
I couldn't find nothing to wear.

64
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:08,805
All them clothes
in your closet?

65
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:11,749
Ain't my fault the stores make all
the cute stuff in junior sizes.

66
00:06:11,852 --> 00:06:14,650
- That should tell you somethin'.
- Yeah, I need to keep sewing my own shit.

67
00:06:14,755 --> 00:06:17,849
- Or that fat girls can't wear
everything skinny girls can.
- I ain't fat.

68
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,620
- I'm sexy succulent.
- Get in the car.

69
00:06:35,342 --> 00:06:39,506
See, this is why we need
to start leaving earlier.

70
00:06:39,613 --> 00:06:41,706
Cookie?

71
00:06:41,815 --> 00:06:44,477
You know I'm trying
to stick to my diet.

72
00:06:44,585 --> 00:06:46,951
Oh, okay, now,
if I order an exercise video...

73
00:06:47,054 --> 00:06:48,954
and 10 bottles
of Metabo Pills...

74
00:06:49,056 --> 00:06:50,990
I could win me a trip
to Palm Springs.

75
00:06:51,091 --> 00:06:53,025
One of them
sweepstakes entries.

76
00:06:53,127 --> 00:06:55,789
It's like all them other
diet products you got- gimmicks.

77
00:06:55,896 --> 00:06:59,992
All right, but you ain't gonna be saying that
when I get bootylicious like BeyoncÃ©.

78
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,694
I think you got her beat
in the booty department.

79
00:07:02,803 --> 00:07:06,466
Give me these damn cookies.

80
00:07:21,155 --> 00:07:23,988
- Uh, hi.
- Hey, sweetie.

81
00:07:24,091 --> 00:07:27,492
Could you tell me
which one of these shirts...

82
00:07:27,595 --> 00:07:30,496
um, goes better
with these jeans?

83
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:34,830
Come on, baby.
Let's go get you a money outfit.

84
00:07:35,936 --> 00:07:38,200
- Excuse me. Excuse me, miss.
- Yeah?

85
00:07:38,305 --> 00:07:40,273
Can I get
your honest opinion?

86
00:07:40,374 --> 00:07:43,207
- Sure.
- Do I look fat in this?

87
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:48,213
No, Twiggy, I look fat in this.
You look ugly in that.

88
00:07:48,315 --> 00:07:51,580
- It's a perfect fit.
- Thanks. I'll take it!

89
00:07:54,989 --> 00:07:56,889
I hate skinny bitches.

90
00:07:56,991 --> 00:07:59,118
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

91
00:08:06,867 --> 00:08:08,767
That's a damn shame.

92
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:12,236
Brother know he need to be
spending his hard-earned money on a sister.

93
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:16,275
If I see another white girl with one of our men,
I swear I'm gonna shoot somebody.

94
00:08:16,377 --> 00:08:19,039
- Better get your gun cocked.
- What?

95
00:08:19,146 --> 00:08:22,377
Oh, hell, no.

96
00:08:25,886 --> 00:08:28,650
O.J. didn't teach you nothin'.

97
00:08:38,499 --> 00:08:40,933
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

98
00:08:42,002 --> 00:08:44,300
My hair!
Did it get me?

99
00:08:44,405 --> 00:08:48,307
Breathe. Count to 10.
Breathe. Count to 10.

100
00:08:48,409 --> 00:08:50,468
Why don't people watch
where they're drinking?

101
00:08:50,577 --> 00:08:52,636
<i>You still look good.</i>

102
00:08:52,746 --> 00:08:56,113
<i>Stay calm. Here. Here.</i>
<i>Take my car, go change...</i>

103
00:08:56,216 --> 00:08:59,014
and just be back
before lunch.

104
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,157
Who can even fit
in a size zero?

105
00:09:10,264 --> 00:09:13,062
A bitch with no ass, no thighs and hips
as wide as my forearms.

106
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:15,567
- Come on, girl. Let's go to lunch.
<i>- Can't. I just sent Kelly.</i>

107
00:09:15,669 --> 00:09:19,002
<i>I need you to go work in the</i>
<i>plus-size department until she gets back.</i>

108
00:09:19,106 --> 00:09:22,769
No, Stace, no. I can't go work
in that department.

109
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:25,709
<i>Look at that pitiful-ass excuse</i>
<i>for fashion over there.</i>

110
00:09:25,813 --> 00:09:29,476
Stace, even <i>you</i>
don't wear that stuff.

111
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,744
Who do they actually believe
is gonna buy that shit?

112
00:09:34,755 --> 00:09:38,350
See what I mean? Now, how's she gonna
get a man in that?

113
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:41,155
<i>We probably</i>
<i>look like that.</i>

114
00:09:42,896 --> 00:09:46,662
But she waddles.
We don't waddle.

115
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:50,134
- Do we?
- Hell, no, we don't waddle.

116
00:09:50,237 --> 00:09:52,205
Now, we might jiggle
just a little...

117
00:09:52,306 --> 00:09:54,331
but we don't waddle.

118
00:09:54,441 --> 00:09:56,341
Good.

119
00:09:56,443 --> 00:09:58,411
Ooh, Miss Thing!

120
00:09:58,512 --> 00:10:01,606
I will work the hell out of that top,
and I'm straight as an arrow.

121
00:10:03,233 --> 00:10:05,724
<i>- You like it, RamÃ³n?</i>
- Girl, I love it. It is phat.

122
00:10:05,835 --> 00:10:08,895
P-H-A-T.
"Pretty, hot and thick."

123
00:10:09,005 --> 00:10:11,940
- Okay, bitch. I didn't know where
you was goin' with that "phat."
- Thank you.

124
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,870
And while you bullshittin',
I heard that man over there...

125
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,700
And while you bullshittin',
I heard that man over there...

126
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:20,042
<i>is the head buyer of</i>
<i>the whole Bloomfeld's.</i>

127
00:10:20,149 --> 00:10:23,641
You need to go on over there and show
him your sketches and flatter him...

128
00:10:23,753 --> 00:10:25,948
<i>into launching</i>
<i>you a line, girl.</i>

129
00:10:26,055 --> 00:10:30,151
- The one next to dickface?
- Yeah, but I wouldn't call him
that when you go over there.

130
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,387
Well, I ain't the one
who named him Richard.

131
00:10:32,495 --> 00:10:34,656
Now, how you get "Dick"
out of "Richard" anyway?

132
00:10:34,764 --> 00:10:37,324
You back up very carefully.

133
00:10:37,433 --> 00:10:40,027
You did not hear that.

134
00:10:40,136 --> 00:10:43,105
- So y'all think I should go over there?
- Damn right, girl.

135
00:10:43,206 --> 00:10:46,437
Yeah, Jaz, go over there.
Show him your sketches, girl. Be bold.

136
00:10:46,542 --> 00:10:48,442
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, come with me, Stace.

137
00:10:48,544 --> 00:10:50,205
- No.
- See?

138
00:10:52,165 --> 00:10:54,395
<i>All right, let's do it.</i>
<i>Okay, give me the pound.</i>

139
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,491
- Okay. All right now.
- All right, here we go.

140
00:10:56,602 --> 00:10:58,763
Get up on his grille.
Sell him that stuff.

141
00:10:59,805 --> 00:11:01,705
<i>Oh, no.</i>

142
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:07,134
Yes, Jazmin?
What can I do for you?

143
00:11:07,246 --> 00:11:09,146
Well, actually,
I wanted to talk to him.

144
00:11:09,248 --> 00:11:11,148
Is that the head buyer
of Bloomfeld's?

145
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,684
And that information is
pertinent to you because?

146
00:11:13,786 --> 00:11:18,917
- Well, I want to show him
my fashion design sketches.
- Absolutely not.

147
00:11:19,024 --> 00:11:21,993
Robert Myer is an
extremely busy man...

148
00:11:22,094 --> 00:11:24,858
and doesn't have time
to entertain your amateur sketches.

149
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:28,297
Maybe he can just take a look
and tell me if I've got potential.

150
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,561
I got this whole
book of plus-size designs.

151
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:34,070
Since our plus-size selection could use some
help, I thought he might be interested.

152
00:11:34,173 --> 00:11:36,539
I can assure you he's not.

153
00:11:36,642 --> 00:11:39,042
But he's standing right there.
Can I just talk to him?

154
00:11:39,144 --> 00:11:42,671
You wouldn't believe how many big women
come up to me on the street every day...

155
00:11:42,781 --> 00:11:44,749
wantin' to know
where I got my outfit from.

156
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,751
And frankly,
I don't give a damn.

157
00:11:47,853 --> 00:11:52,654
Look, Jazmin, launching a clothing line
is much more than a notion...

158
00:11:52,758 --> 00:11:55,522
and takes a lot of things
that you don't have.

159
00:11:55,627 --> 00:12:01,088
Now, I have work to do and so do you
if you appreciate your job here.

160
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,600
Go... Bloomfeld's!

161
00:12:06,605 --> 00:12:11,269
<i>I'm gonna start my line. I'm gonna show</i>
<i>dickface. I'm gonna get me a bank loan.</i>

162
00:12:11,377 --> 00:12:13,937
Jaz, girl, you know I'm down
for you for whatever...

163
00:12:14,046 --> 00:12:16,139
<i>but bank loans</i>
<i>aren't easy to get.</i>

164
00:12:16,248 --> 00:12:17,806
They ain't just
handing 'em out.

165
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:20,111
Then I'll do whatever
it takes, Stace.

166
00:12:20,219 --> 00:12:24,212
- You serious about this, huh?
- Damn right I'm serious.

167
00:12:24,323 --> 00:12:28,054
I'm sorry, Ms. Biltmore,
your loan application has been denied.

168
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,060
- Denied?
<i>- Uh, due to...</i>

169
00:12:30,162 --> 00:12:32,630
insufficient
collateral.

170
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:35,996
Yes, unfortunately,
although the home that your...

171
00:12:36,101 --> 00:12:38,626
sweet Grandma Nellie left you...

172
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:41,900
is located in what <i>some</i>
might classify...

173
00:12:42,007 --> 00:12:43,907
as an upper-middle-class
neighborhood...

174
00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:47,843
uh, the bank classifies it
as a high-risk zone.

175
00:12:47,946 --> 00:12:51,109
- You mean a "black zone."
- Ms. Biltmore, this is not a race issue.

176
00:12:51,216 --> 00:12:56,244
No, no. We here at First Plantation Bank
are an equal-opportunity lender.

177
00:12:56,355 --> 00:12:59,688
<i>It says so right there</i>
<i>on our brochure.</i>

178
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:03,990
Sir, listen to me, okay?
Jazmin Biltmore don't beg nobody...

179
00:13:04,096 --> 00:13:06,121
but I really
need this loan.

180
00:13:06,231 --> 00:13:09,928
<i>And my clothing line is a surefire</i>
<i>moneymaker, 'cause big girls like myself...</i>

181
00:13:10,035 --> 00:13:13,004
we have a hard time
finding trendy clothes to wear.

182
00:13:13,105 --> 00:13:16,802
And consequently, we have a hard time
finding dates too, if you know what I mean.

183
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:19,935
<i>But, um, I didn't come in here to get</i>
<i>all up in my personal business...</i>

184
00:13:20,045 --> 00:13:23,208
but, Mr. Banker, I ain't been laid
in nine months, hear?

185
00:13:23,315 --> 00:13:25,215
Nine long months.

186
00:13:25,317 --> 00:13:27,444
<i>- So if-if you would...</i>

187
00:13:27,553 --> 00:13:31,216
give me the loan to help me
get my line off the ground...

188
00:13:31,323 --> 00:13:33,689
not only will you get
your money back twofold...

189
00:13:33,792 --> 00:13:36,761
but you'll be helping me
solve a very big problem...

190
00:13:36,862 --> 00:13:38,796
for a lot of big girls.

191
00:13:38,897 --> 00:13:41,491
Well, Ms. Biltmore,
if finding a date is your problem...

192
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,501
may I suggest...
Jenny Craig?

193
00:13:44,603 --> 00:13:48,039
- Excuse me?
- I said, if finding a date is your problem-

194
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,075
I heard what you said.
You wanna say that again, sucker?

195
00:13:51,176 --> 00:13:55,408
'Cause I will whip your balding ass all around
this bank! You don't say shit like that to me.

196
00:13:55,514 --> 00:13:57,812
- Suggest Jenny Craig? Yeah, you can suggest it.
- Security!

197
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,907
- Just say it!
- Security!

198
00:14:00,018 --> 00:14:01,986
<i>Say something!</i>
<i>Say something!</i>

199
00:14:02,087 --> 00:14:05,614
- If you ever in my part of town,
your ass is whupped!
<i>- Take her out of my bank now!</i>

200
00:14:05,724 --> 00:14:07,817
<i>- Don't you ever come in my bank!</i>
- Get me my stuff!

201
00:14:07,926 --> 00:14:10,019
<i>- Where's my toupee?</i>
- You're probably a cross-dresser!

202
00:14:10,129 --> 00:14:13,587
That's right! That's right! I ain't scared!
I ain't scared of your ass!

203
00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:15,860
- I will whup your ass!
<i>- Now, wait a minute.</i>

204
00:14:30,482 --> 00:14:32,541
Jaz, I know you're
depressed about the loan...

205
00:14:32,651 --> 00:14:35,347
but I think you need to
slow down on those drinks.

206
00:14:35,454 --> 00:14:37,422
Okay.

207
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,020
Bartender, give me another shot.
And for her-

208
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,724
- Another iced tea.
<i>- And do her a favor, baby.</i>

209
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,859
Drive it through Long Island
on your way back over here.

210
00:14:50,969 --> 00:14:53,870
And who's gonna drive us
home if we're both drunk?

211
00:14:53,972 --> 00:14:56,406
Not me.

212
00:14:56,508 --> 00:14:58,908
Yes, um...

213
00:14:59,011 --> 00:15:02,708
I'm gonna have
a Cosmopolitan. Whoo!

214
00:15:07,419 --> 00:15:12,220
Maybe this, uh, fine brother'll volunteer
to drive us home.

215
00:15:17,863 --> 00:15:21,060
You wasn't that cute
no way, nucka!

216
00:15:23,202 --> 00:15:27,161
<i> Some cheering-up session</i>
<i>this night turned out to be.</i>

217
00:15:27,272 --> 00:15:29,832
<i>Stace, pull up at that</i>
<i>Fatassburger over there.</i>

218
00:15:45,057 --> 00:15:47,992
Welcome to Fatassburger.
May I take your fat-ass order?

219
00:15:48,093 --> 00:15:52,553
Yes. I'm gonna have
a Skinny Ass protein burger.

220
00:15:52,664 --> 00:15:54,996
No bun, no mayo.

221
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,364
- And a skinny water.
- And I'll have-

222
00:15:57,469 --> 00:16:01,963
She'll have what I got. You're trying
to stick to the diet, remember?

223
00:16:02,074 --> 00:16:03,974
Yeah, I remember.

224
00:16:04,076 --> 00:16:07,637
Uh, look, give me what she got,
but while you're at it...

225
00:16:07,746 --> 00:16:09,805
make that Skinny Ass
protein patty...

226
00:16:09,915 --> 00:16:13,180
a Fat Ass double-beef patty
with extra mayo...

227
00:16:13,285 --> 00:16:17,381
<i>put the bun back on there,</i>
<i>slap on some bacon and cheese...</i>

228
00:16:17,489 --> 00:16:19,855
and when you done,
slide up a chili dog...

229
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:22,392
two Fat Ass fries,
a onion ring...

230
00:16:22,494 --> 00:16:25,759
a pecan pie
and a jumbo chocolate shake.

231
00:16:27,099 --> 00:16:29,226
And I'll have the same.

232
00:16:29,334 --> 00:16:32,701
What, y'all gonna need
a garbage bag to haul all that food out?

233
00:16:32,804 --> 00:16:34,704
Excuse me?

234
00:16:34,806 --> 00:16:37,366
What, you got too much fat
around your ears to hear?

235
00:16:37,476 --> 00:16:38,909
<i>- Ooh.</i>

236
00:16:40,412 --> 00:16:42,312
Oh, you punk.

237
00:16:42,414 --> 00:16:44,473
<i>See, if you want</i>
<i>to bag up in here...</i>

238
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:47,518
with your ugly ass, you got to come
a lot stronger than that.

239
00:16:47,619 --> 00:16:50,213
- Oh, well, let's do it.
- Well, let's do it!

240
00:16:50,322 --> 00:16:52,347
<i>Come on, punk,</i>
<i>what you got?</i>

241
00:16:52,457 --> 00:16:55,119
All right.

242
00:16:55,227 --> 00:16:57,422
You so fat...

243
00:16:57,529 --> 00:16:59,759
you can't fall down.

244
00:16:59,865 --> 00:17:01,833
<i>Boo.</i>

245
00:17:03,235 --> 00:17:05,260
You so ugly,
your birth certificate...

246
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:08,066
is an apology letter
from the condom factory.

247
00:17:10,509 --> 00:17:13,103
<i>All right, well,</i>
<i>you so fat...</i>

248
00:17:13,211 --> 00:17:17,341
that, uh, you got to sleep
on a Texas-sized mattress.

249
00:17:21,853 --> 00:17:24,822
You so ugly, when your mama
gave birth to you...

250
00:17:24,923 --> 00:17:27,619
- she named you Shit Happens.
- Ooh!

251
00:17:30,996 --> 00:17:33,556
All right, well,
you so fat that you need help...

252
00:17:33,665 --> 00:17:36,133
just to get out of bed in the morning.

253
00:17:37,302 --> 00:17:39,896
You worked hard
on that one, didn't you?

254
00:17:40,005 --> 00:17:44,032
You so ugly that your mama got
morning sickness <i>after</i> you were born.

255
00:17:44,142 --> 00:17:47,236
Boo-doo. Pow!

<i>What's wrong?</i>
<i>What's wrong?</i>

257
00:17:51,683 --> 00:17:54,311
See, you can't quit now,
'cause I'm just gettin' started.

258
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:57,650
You so ugly, that pimple
on top of your mouth...

259
00:17:57,756 --> 00:18:00,657
<i>mistook your lips</i>
<i>for the crack of your ass.</i>

260
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:03,922
I believe that's the herpes.

261
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:06,725
I don't want no damn food

262
00:18:06,832 --> 00:18:09,392
<i>Oh, you're bitchin'</i>
<i>up on me, Jack!</i>

263
00:18:09,501 --> 00:18:12,402
You so damn ugly...

264
00:18:12,504 --> 00:18:15,405
that every time
your mama sees you...

265
00:18:15,507 --> 00:18:17,407
she says to your daddy...

266
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:20,672
"Damn! I should've
just gave you head."

267
00:18:28,186 --> 00:18:31,485
I'm cool, man.

268
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:34,559
Stacey and Mia,
grab our shit.

269
00:18:36,061 --> 00:18:40,623
<i>I guess my cousin</i>
<i>told you.</i>

270
00:18:40,732 --> 00:18:44,259
She ain't tell me nothin'!
And she's still a fat bitch.

271
00:18:46,705 --> 00:18:49,003
Excuse me?

272
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:51,007
Did you just call me a-

273
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:54,442
That's right, I called you a-
fat bitch!

274
00:19:04,656 --> 00:19:07,124
<i>That's my cousin, y'all.</i>

275
00:19:07,225 --> 00:19:10,490
Damn! She knocked
his ass out cold.

276
00:19:35,086 --> 00:19:37,054
Oh, my God.

277
00:19:38,757 --> 00:19:43,217
Take a picture next time.
It'll last longer. Mm-mm-mm.

278
00:19:52,671 --> 00:19:55,799
You ever wonder why everybody
has somebody else...

279
00:19:55,907 --> 00:19:57,875
except us?

280
00:19:57,976 --> 00:20:02,174
See, Stace, the reason you don't have nobody
is the way you dress.

281
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,180
Now, you want a man?

282
00:20:04,282 --> 00:20:07,445
You know, show a little cleavage
or somethin'.

283
00:20:07,552 --> 00:20:11,079
And when's the last time
flashing cleavage got you a date?

284
00:20:11,189 --> 00:20:14,181
Oh, see, you didn't even have to go there.
You're hateful.

285
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,551
Jaz, look around.

286
00:20:18,997 --> 00:20:21,898
<i>You notice what I notice?</i>

287
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,628
We're the only
black people in here.

288
00:20:24,736 --> 00:20:27,466
- No, we're the only fat people in here.
<i>- Stace...</i>

289
00:20:27,572 --> 00:20:29,972
look, don't go there
with me, okay?

290
00:20:30,075 --> 00:20:33,306
I hate when you get like this.
I'm not trying to be depressed today.

291
00:20:33,411 --> 00:20:36,642
Bitch had a hard enough time
just gettin' out of bed this morning.

292
00:20:36,748 --> 00:20:38,648
I'm going on break.

293
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,014
You can take your lunch
when I get back.

294
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:44,782
All right.
Keep it together, Stace.

295
00:20:47,792 --> 00:20:50,590
One of us sure need to.

296
00:21:20,825 --> 00:21:23,089
I do waddle.

297
00:21:34,139 --> 00:21:36,437
<i>Hey, this is Jazmin Biltmore...</i>

298
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:39,203
<i>so at the beep, do your thing.</i>

299
00:21:39,311 --> 00:21:42,144
Hi. This is the Metabo Pill Corporation calling...

300
00:21:42,247 --> 00:21:45,444
<i>to inform Miss Jazmin Biltmore</i>
<i>that you've won an all-expense paid...</i>

301
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:48,348
<i>travel vacation</i>
<i>to a five-star resort...</i>

302
00:21:48,453 --> 00:21:50,353
- in Palm Springs.
- Oh, my God!

303
00:21:50,455 --> 00:21:53,356
- Oh, my God, you won!
<i>- To claim your prize, call 555-1212.</i>

304
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,358
You really won.

305
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,451
I can't believe people really do
win those things.

306
00:21:57,562 --> 00:22:02,864
A five-star spa luxury resort in Palm Springs.

307
00:22:02,968 --> 00:22:05,801
Oh, I've got so much
shopping to do.

308
00:22:05,904 --> 00:22:07,804
I- I am going, right?

309
00:22:07,906 --> 00:22:10,170
The mood I'm in,
I might not be going.

310
00:22:10,275 --> 00:22:14,177
Okay, that's a joke, right?
If you don't want it, I'll take it.

311
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:16,179
I've got some coworkers
at the gym.

312
00:22:16,281 --> 00:22:18,374
- They would love to go.
- Oh, no, Jaz, you going.

313
00:22:18,483 --> 00:22:23,011
You not sticking me alone in Palm Springs
with Mia and one of her carrot-nibbling friends.

314
00:22:23,121 --> 00:22:25,589
- Oh!
- Stace, I ain't trying to spend a whole week...

315
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:29,751
with a bunch of half-naked, skinny hos
flaunting around in dental floss all day.

316
00:22:29,861 --> 00:22:31,692
Forget them, Jaz.
We need this.

317
00:22:31,796 --> 00:22:34,856
If you won't go for you,
at least go for me.

318
00:22:34,966 --> 00:22:37,696
And for me, your best cousin.

319
00:22:40,005 --> 00:22:42,667
I'll go for you, Stace.

320
00:22:42,774 --> 00:22:45,038
A good a reason as any.

321
00:22:45,143 --> 00:22:47,543
Palm Springs
here we come!

322
00:22:47,646 --> 00:22:49,546
- You need some help?
- Stacey, why don't you-

323
00:22:49,648 --> 00:22:52,674
What are y'all doing?
Wait the car's moving. Wait-

324
00:22:52,784 --> 00:22:54,445
Are you okay?

325
00:22:56,521 --> 00:23:00,423
- Did y'all pack all of them?
- Don't scratch my bags.

326
00:23:00,525 --> 00:23:02,584
- Palm Springs here we come!
- Here we come.

327
00:23:02,694 --> 00:23:05,754
Whoo!
Let's do this!

328
00:23:05,864 --> 00:23:08,594
Now, see, all you have to have is a little faith...

329
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,600
'cause I knew I
was gonna win.

330
00:23:10,702 --> 00:23:13,466
- I knew I was gonna win this trip.
- She knew it.

331
00:23:13,571 --> 00:23:15,903
- You were right, Jaz.
- I didn't hear you, Stace.

332
00:23:16,007 --> 00:23:20,637
- I- I said, you were right, Jaz.
<i>- Damn right I'm right.</i>

333
00:23:28,553 --> 00:23:30,748
Skinny bitches.

334
00:23:55,647 --> 00:23:59,174
<i>- Do you smell smoke?</i>

335
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,324
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

336
00:24:07,425 --> 00:24:10,861
<i>Jesus, I done died</i>
<i>and gone to heaven.</i>

337
00:24:10,962 --> 00:24:13,430
Oh, if the lobby looks
like this, imagine what the-

338
00:24:13,531 --> 00:24:15,863
- The room.
- The buffets.

339
00:24:15,967 --> 00:24:20,461
<i>What? Have you guys never been</i>
<i>to a five-star resort before?</i>

340
00:24:20,572 --> 00:24:23,132
- No.
- No.

341
00:24:23,241 --> 00:24:25,675
<i>Well, I'm off</i>
<i>to the pool.</i>

342
00:24:25,777 --> 00:24:27,802
- You ladies coming with?
- Uh-huh.

343
00:24:27,912 --> 00:24:31,473
Just give me a second to throw a thong
up my crack. I'll be right with you.

344
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:34,609
Oh, but, Jaz, these deep-tissue
massages sound good.

345
00:24:34,719 --> 00:24:36,619
Okay, well,
you know, you ladies...

346
00:24:36,721 --> 00:24:39,053
y'all gonna have to
tell me all about it...

347
00:24:39,157 --> 00:24:43,059
because I'm off to find me a rich,
handsome gent to spend my week with.

348
00:24:45,897 --> 00:24:47,797
- See ya.
- See ya later.

349
00:24:47,899 --> 00:24:51,562
- All that damn skinny went right to her head.
- Right.

350
00:24:51,669 --> 00:24:53,637
One Cherry Blast
with a lime twist.

351
00:24:56,975 --> 00:24:59,068
Mmm. Good. Thanks.

352
00:24:59,177 --> 00:25:01,077
- That be all?
- Yeah.

353
00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:03,010
Mmm.

354
00:25:04,749 --> 00:25:08,082
On second thought, I think
I'm gonna have him to go.

355
00:25:11,289 --> 00:25:13,189
Monogrammed.

356
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:15,725
Girl, this is so much better
then that raggedy-ass...

357
00:25:15,827 --> 00:25:18,318
piece of terry cloth
grandma robe I brought from home.

358
00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:21,057
- I like it.
- So how you think yours is bad?

359
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:23,600
My terry cloth
is hanging by a thread.

360
00:25:28,973 --> 00:25:32,704
Pull it. Pull it.

361
00:25:32,811 --> 00:25:35,905
Wait a minute. Wait.
Oh, it's gonna see my-

362
00:25:36,014 --> 00:25:37,914
Wait a minute,
my... might be out.

363
00:25:38,016 --> 00:25:40,211
Let me see.

364
00:25:40,318 --> 00:25:42,286
- Terry cloth.
- Terry cloth.

365
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:56,267
I know you don't
expect our big asses...

366
00:25:56,367 --> 00:25:58,927
to fit on these
little-ass tables.

367
00:26:04,075 --> 00:26:07,374
Mm-mm.

368
00:26:21,926 --> 00:26:25,089
<i>Hmm. Thought you'd be hitched up</i>
<i>with some rich hunk by now.</i>

369
00:26:25,196 --> 00:26:28,359
Oh, I'm working on it...

370
00:26:28,466 --> 00:26:31,458
but this puppy
is playing a little...

371
00:26:31,569 --> 00:26:34,060
<i>harder than usual.</i>

372
00:26:34,172 --> 00:26:38,302
Have you ever seen a man just
so damn fine in all your life?

373
00:26:38,409 --> 00:26:40,309
All I see is arms
and legs kicking.

374
00:26:40,411 --> 00:26:42,936
<i>Well, we've been playing eye tag</i>
<i>for about an hour now.</i>

375
00:26:43,047 --> 00:26:47,108
<i>The drink-stand worker</i>
<i>says he's a doctor.</i>

376
00:26:47,218 --> 00:26:50,244
Oh, my God, girl, look.
He's gettin' out the pool.

377
00:26:56,961 --> 00:26:58,861
Tongue, be still.

378
00:27:19,417 --> 00:27:21,317
Oh, my God,
he's coming over here.

379
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:24,115
- How do I look, huh? How do I look?
- Like you always look.

380
00:27:24,222 --> 00:27:26,713
Oh, okay.
Perfect. Mm-hmm.

381
00:27:26,824 --> 00:27:30,385
<i>See, I knew it.</i>
<i>I knew he would finally break.</i>

382
00:27:30,495 --> 00:27:34,659
He wanted this.
He wanted it. Mmm.

383
00:27:34,766 --> 00:27:37,963
Damn. Why Skinny always
got to get the good ones?

384
00:27:38,069 --> 00:27:41,505
- Good afternoon, ladies.
- Good afternoon.

385
00:27:41,606 --> 00:27:43,665
- Hi.
- Are you all here on vacation?

386
00:27:43,775 --> 00:27:46,335
One of the many we take
throughout the year.

387
00:27:46,444 --> 00:27:51,347
So I hear you're here all the way from Africa
for the big medical convention.

388
00:27:51,449 --> 00:27:55,510
- Nigeria, to be exact.
- Well, isn't that interesting.

389
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:58,646
<i>You see, I've always wanted</i>
<i>to travel to exotic places.</i>

390
00:27:58,756 --> 00:28:02,749
So, tell me,
what's it like in Nigeria?

391
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,327
- Hot.
- Ooh.

392
00:28:05,945 --> 00:28:10,644
- Are you always this intensely quiet?
- Miss Motormouth here? Please.

393
00:28:10,749 --> 00:28:13,582
- She's the loudest one out of all of us.
- Oh, really?

394
00:28:13,686 --> 00:28:16,553
I find outspoken women
very fascinating.

395
00:28:16,655 --> 00:28:20,591
Truth be told, I'm quite
the little chatterbox myself.

396
00:28:20,693 --> 00:28:23,161
Chirp, chirp. Chatter, chatter.

397
00:28:23,262 --> 00:28:28,393
<i>Whoo! This heat.</i>
<i>Oh, it's just so treacherous.</i>

398
00:28:35,541 --> 00:28:40,740
<i>Wow, I did not know they made bodies</i>
<i>that beautiful here in America.</i>

399
00:28:40,846 --> 00:28:44,111
Oh, you see this body, baby,
it wasn't made overnight.

400
00:28:44,216 --> 00:28:47,777
I'm actually a world-renowned
aerobics instructor.

401
00:28:49,688 --> 00:28:53,749
Actually, I was talking
about your beautiful plump friend here.

402
00:28:53,859 --> 00:28:56,953
- Me?
- Her?

403
00:28:57,062 --> 00:28:58,825
Yes, her.

404
00:28:58,931 --> 00:29:02,094
Close your mouth, child.
Flies might get in.

405
00:29:04,387 --> 00:29:08,915
- What is your name?
- Sweet Jesus,
what the hell is my name?

406
00:29:09,024 --> 00:29:12,516
I am Tunde Jonathan.
Pleased to meet you.

407
00:29:16,031 --> 00:29:19,592
Do you have a name?

408
00:29:28,043 --> 00:29:30,204
Excuse her.
Her name is Jazmin.

409
00:29:30,312 --> 00:29:32,712
It is a pleasure
to meet you, Jazmin.

410
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:35,146
Oh, no, baby, the pleasure is all mine.

411
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:37,616
Jazmin, what is wrong with you?

412
00:29:37,719 --> 00:29:39,619
<i>This man is</i>
<i>talking to you.</i>

413
00:29:39,721 --> 00:29:41,916
Pardon me, ladies,
for being rude, but you are?

414
00:29:42,024 --> 00:29:43,958
Pissed off.

415
00:29:44,059 --> 00:29:45,959
- Mia.
- Stacey.

416
00:29:46,061 --> 00:29:49,258
Well, well, well,
what do we have here?

417
00:29:49,364 --> 00:29:52,424
Well, ladies,
meet my friends and colleagues.

418
00:29:52,534 --> 00:29:56,436
This is Akibo.
Godwin.

419
00:29:56,538 --> 00:30:00,338
This is Jazmin.
Stacey.

420
00:30:09,618 --> 00:30:11,984
And this is Mia.

421
00:30:26,068 --> 00:30:29,868
<i>Hey, I just thought</i>
<i>of a brilliant idea.</i>

422
00:30:29,972 --> 00:30:32,736
Maybe if you ladies
don't have plans tonight...

423
00:30:32,841 --> 00:30:37,175
you wouldn't mind
accompanying us to the fund-raising...

424
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,009
<i>party that our</i>
<i>native friends are throwing.</i>

425
00:30:40,115 --> 00:30:42,242
Actually, that would
be a great idea.

426
00:30:42,351 --> 00:30:47,186
If Miss Jazmin would be
my very special guest.

427
00:30:50,092 --> 00:30:53,858
- Yes, she will.
<i>- And you.</i>

428
00:30:53,962 --> 00:30:57,125
- Will you be mine?
- Okay.

429
00:31:04,573 --> 00:31:07,371
Godwin here is very shy
in expressing himself...

430
00:31:07,476 --> 00:31:11,412
but he would be delighted
if you were his guest of honor.

431
00:31:11,513 --> 00:31:13,037
<i>Oh, gao.</i>

432
00:31:13,148 --> 00:31:15,548
Lovely.

433
00:31:18,153 --> 00:31:19,984
Girl, a bitch tongue
just got paralyzed.

434
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:22,280
He is so juicy.
Girl!

435
00:31:22,315 --> 00:31:24,473
He is so juicy.
Girl!

436
00:31:24,575 --> 00:31:28,636
He is fine.
My Akibo is quite a hunk himself.

437
00:31:28,746 --> 00:31:30,680
I just want to say...

438
00:31:30,781 --> 00:31:34,842
I did not come all the way to Palm Springs
to get hooked up with Fat Albert.

439
00:31:34,952 --> 00:31:38,183
From the sounds of it, homeboy wasn't
digging you too much either.

440
00:31:38,289 --> 00:31:41,087
- Really not at all.
- "No, gao."

441
00:31:41,192 --> 00:31:43,752
"Gao!"

442
00:31:43,861 --> 00:31:47,627
Well, wait until you find out...

443
00:31:47,732 --> 00:31:51,862
how domineering and chauvinistic
those African men can be.

444
00:31:51,969 --> 00:31:56,838
They want their woman to be completely
submissive to them. And you know what else?

445
00:31:56,941 --> 00:32:00,968
One of my clients, she happens to be married
to this Nigerian guy...

446
00:32:01,078 --> 00:32:04,514
and she told me he even wants her
to get circumcised.

447
00:32:04,615 --> 00:32:07,641
Shi-Ain't nobody cuttin'
on my figgy puddin'.

448
00:32:07,752 --> 00:32:10,312
I'm sure all Nigerian men
do not believe in that.

449
00:32:10,421 --> 00:32:14,380
Well, here's my chance to find out.
Stace, how do I look?

450
00:32:14,492 --> 00:32:19,657
'Cause I could have some green stuck in my
teeth, and this heifer wouldn't even tell me.

451
00:32:19,764 --> 00:32:21,732
You put the "P"
in "phat," girl.

452
00:32:21,832 --> 00:32:24,562
And the "F" too, but we're not gonna
worry about that tonight.

453
00:32:24,669 --> 00:32:26,569
- All right.
- Go get the door. Go.

454
00:32:26,671 --> 00:32:29,469
- Get the door. Get the door!
- Okay!

455
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:33,472
And you look quite fabulous
yourself, darling.

456
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:35,670
Oh, girl.

457
00:32:38,249 --> 00:32:40,342
Good evening.

458
00:32:41,652 --> 00:32:43,620
You look, uh-

459
00:32:47,792 --> 00:32:49,760
Very nice, he says.

460
00:32:52,663 --> 00:32:54,130
Wow.

461
00:32:56,084 --> 00:32:59,383
<i>We are going to be the envy of every man</i>
<i>at the party tonight.</i>

462
00:33:01,355 --> 00:33:05,621
- Hello, Jazmin.
- Just tell me you do not believe
in circumcising women.

463
00:33:05,726 --> 00:33:08,593
Is that a greeting?

464
00:33:08,696 --> 00:33:11,324
<i>Well, I just want to know</i>
<i>before we step out this door.</i>

465
00:33:11,432 --> 00:33:13,832
What if we talk about
it in the car?

466
00:33:13,934 --> 00:33:15,834
Our driver is waiting.

467
00:33:25,579 --> 00:33:30,573
<i>Let's just say that in some remote parts</i>
<i>of Nigeria, they do practice it.</i>

468
00:33:30,684 --> 00:33:33,744
But do you believe in it?

469
00:33:41,762 --> 00:33:44,196
<i>Speak English, now.</i>

470
00:33:44,298 --> 00:33:48,530
Well, the simple answer to your question is no.

471
00:33:48,636 --> 00:33:52,037
Satisfied?

472
00:33:52,139 --> 00:33:54,505
Baby, I'm not going to be satisfied...

473
00:33:54,608 --> 00:33:57,372
till you get me back up
in your hotel room tonight.

474
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:02,312
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

475
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:04,680
- Welcome.
- Welcome. Welcome.

476
00:34:04,785 --> 00:34:10,314
Yeah, Dr. Tunde. Akibo. Where did you find this
beautiful, thick Madame from?

477
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:13,552
Your wish
is my command.

478
00:34:13,661 --> 00:34:16,687
- At your service.
- Mmm!

479
00:34:17,898 --> 00:34:21,698
Sister,
where is your meat?

480
00:34:21,802 --> 00:34:25,033
We have got to fatten you up
while you are here, huh?

481
00:34:59,206 --> 00:35:02,539
So, how do you find
Nigerian food?

482
00:35:02,643 --> 00:35:06,010
<i>- Tasty. Thank you.</i>

483
00:35:06,113 --> 00:35:08,411
If you are ever looking
for some native attire...

484
00:35:08,515 --> 00:35:10,710
I'm your man.

485
00:35:10,818 --> 00:35:13,116
Thank you.

486
00:35:14,221 --> 00:35:17,088
Thank-Thank you.

487
00:35:18,192 --> 00:35:20,626
I am glad that you
like Nigerian food.

488
00:35:20,728 --> 00:35:23,094
- You find it tasty?
- Bump the food.

489
00:35:23,197 --> 00:35:25,757
I wanna taste you,
you big, fine-ass African...

490
00:35:25,866 --> 00:35:27,959
spear-throwing, lion-hunting...

491
00:35:28,068 --> 00:35:30,628
"Mandingo" warrior
with a king-size-

492
00:35:30,738 --> 00:35:33,764
- Thirsty?
- Excuse me? Huh? Excuse me?

493
00:35:33,874 --> 00:35:36,206
Why don't we go
and get something to drink?

494
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:39,108
- Okay, okay. Mm-hmm.
- Yes?

495
00:35:47,321 --> 00:35:49,448
In order to truly
enjoy fufu...

496
00:35:50,691 --> 00:35:53,854
you have to swallow
big chunks at a time.

497
00:35:55,963 --> 00:35:58,329
Dip it in the egusi soup...

498
00:35:58,432 --> 00:36:00,832
and swallow.

499
00:36:05,672 --> 00:36:07,731
Ah, ah.

500
00:36:07,841 --> 00:36:10,503
Mm-hmm.

501
00:36:15,149 --> 00:36:17,049
It's okay, right?

502
00:36:17,151 --> 00:36:19,176
Mm-hmm.

503
00:36:21,622 --> 00:36:25,683
I want to get to know you
like no man has ever known you.

504
00:36:48,882 --> 00:36:53,444
<i>Perhaps</i>
<i>you need to eat more.</i>

505
00:36:53,554 --> 00:36:55,522
I know exactly
what I need to do.

506
00:36:55,622 --> 00:36:59,456
Thank you.
And it's not eat more.

507
00:37:04,231 --> 00:37:08,258
Taxi! Taxi! Oh! Ooh, get me the hell
out of here, please.

508
00:37:08,368 --> 00:37:10,928
These people are crazy!

509
00:37:11,138 --> 00:37:14,005
Ladies and gentlemen, the favorite part
of the evening-

510
00:37:14,108 --> 00:37:16,133
the spray dance!

511
00:37:30,057 --> 00:37:32,025
What's the spray dance?

512
00:37:32,126 --> 00:37:36,825
Oh, the spray dance. It is a tradition
where we dance for money.

513
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:41,424
<i>Uh-oh. It's about to be a strip show</i>
<i>up in this camp! Oh!</i>

514
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:57,181
<i>Yes, they are</i>
<i>inviting you out.</i>

515
00:37:57,284 --> 00:37:59,844
<i>- Come on, Stace.</i>
- I ain't going out there.

516
00:37:59,953 --> 00:38:02,581
<i>Okay. Then watch me</i>
<i>rack up on the dollars.</i>

517
00:38:20,724 --> 00:38:22,692
We have a saying
in my country.

518
00:38:22,792 --> 00:38:25,056
"A pearl is not a pearl...

519
00:38:25,162 --> 00:38:27,426
until it's out
of its shell."

520
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:33,664
And I know,
under that shy shell of yours...

521
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:38,605
there is a big, bold woman
waiting to burst out...

522
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:42,708
and enjoy life.

523
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:50,116
Just look at
your friend there.

524
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:56,323
<i>She's only your friend because</i>
<i>there's a lot of her...</i>

525
00:38:56,426 --> 00:38:58,326
<i>buried inside of you.</i>

526
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:04,054
That was just
a taste of Nigeria.

527
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,061
- I hope you enjoyed it.
- Oh, I did.

528
00:40:07,163 --> 00:40:09,893
A bitch racked up a hundred
dollars doing my number.

529
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,195
Ow! Y'all don't know
nothing about that, do ya?

530
00:40:12,302 --> 00:40:14,532
You gotta do me.
You gotta do me.

531
00:40:17,641 --> 00:40:20,508
You are a very rich
woman, Jazmin.

532
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:22,237
Well, I wouldn't
call a hundred dollars exactly rich.

533
00:40:22,345 --> 00:40:25,644
But cut me loose a few weeks in Nigeria,
and I might be.

534
00:40:25,749 --> 00:40:28,274
I was not speaking
in terms of money.

535
00:40:30,236 --> 00:40:31,999
<i>In Africa...</i>

536
00:40:32,104 --> 00:40:34,095
a woman's body size
is a reflection...

537
00:40:34,206 --> 00:40:36,299
of her social status.

538
00:40:36,408 --> 00:40:39,775
The thicker she is,
the richer she's presumed to be.

539
00:40:39,878 --> 00:40:42,506
Well, hell, I'm livin'
in the wrong country.

540
00:40:42,614 --> 00:40:45,447
I wanna live where
they like the fat girls.

541
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:48,018
Whoa. But we don't
call it "fat."

542
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,611
The term is "thick Madame."

543
00:40:50,722 --> 00:40:52,622
Thick Madame.

544
00:40:52,724 --> 00:40:54,692
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>
- I like it.

545
00:40:56,595 --> 00:40:58,529
Thank you.

546
00:41:00,432 --> 00:41:03,094
I might sound
extremely shallow...

547
00:41:03,201 --> 00:41:06,500
saying that on a scale
from one to 10...

548
00:41:06,605 --> 00:41:08,937
you are the perfect 20.

549
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:11,271
Wait a minute.

550
00:41:11,376 --> 00:41:13,435
<i>This is too good</i>
<i>to be true.</i>

551
00:41:13,545 --> 00:41:19,040
- You need a green card or somethin'?
- That's funny.

552
00:41:19,151 --> 00:41:21,483
That don't answer
the question.

553
00:41:21,586 --> 00:41:25,750
No. No.
I do not need a green card.

554
00:41:30,062 --> 00:41:33,122
<i>But I would like</i>
<i>to ask you one question.</i>

555
00:41:33,231 --> 00:41:36,325
Yes. Yes, I will marry you.

556
00:41:37,969 --> 00:41:41,029
Why do you refer
to yourself as "bitch"?

557
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:45,066
Wow. Um...

558
00:41:45,177 --> 00:41:47,145
it's just an expression.

559
00:41:47,245 --> 00:41:49,236
<i>American girls...</i>

560
00:41:49,347 --> 00:41:53,579
we sometimes use it
to refer to ourselves or our friends.

561
00:41:53,685 --> 00:41:56,984
It's... a term of affection.

562
00:41:58,223 --> 00:42:01,317
Okay. Thank you
for the explanation... bitch.

563
00:42:01,426 --> 00:42:04,759
- Excuse me?
<i>- You see?</i>

564
00:42:04,863 --> 00:42:08,424
It was not such
an affectionate term after all.

565
00:42:10,702 --> 00:42:15,071
<i>Jazmin, I cannot tell you</i>
<i>how to express yourself...</i>

566
00:42:15,173 --> 00:42:20,941
<i>but you are way too classy of a lady</i>
<i>to use such profanity.</i>

567
00:42:23,448 --> 00:42:25,848
<i>Tell you what.</i>

568
00:42:25,951 --> 00:42:30,752
Why don't we change into
something a bit more casual?

569
00:42:30,856 --> 00:42:34,383
And then we'll
meet here in 10 minutes.

570
00:42:35,494 --> 00:42:37,758
Okay. Ten minutes.

571
00:42:37,863 --> 00:42:40,263
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Okay.

572
00:43:00,652 --> 00:43:04,247
<i>So, I've been wanting</i>
<i>to ask you all night.</i>

573
00:43:06,558 --> 00:43:10,585
With a full figure
such as yours...

574
00:43:12,664 --> 00:43:16,760
why do you hide it under
all of this bulky clothing?

575
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:23,335
Because,
as big as I am...

576
00:43:23,441 --> 00:43:25,807
I don't need to be
showing no skin.

577
00:43:27,979 --> 00:43:30,812
If the decision
were mine...

578
00:43:30,916 --> 00:43:33,282
you would be naked
all the time.

579
00:43:34,953 --> 00:43:38,184
Um. Oh.

580
00:43:43,995 --> 00:43:47,897
- You okay?
- Oh.

581
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,175
This is nice.

582
00:44:04,282 --> 00:44:06,182
I knew you
would like it.

583
00:44:10,288 --> 00:44:12,188
Thank you.

584
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:14,258
Welcome.

585
00:44:15,827 --> 00:44:19,558
So tell me more about
your passion for fashion.

586
00:44:19,664 --> 00:44:22,462
I could talk about that
all night.

587
00:44:22,567 --> 00:44:25,161
One day,
I'm gonna go to Paris.

588
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:27,500
- Paris.
- Yes.

589
00:44:27,606 --> 00:44:30,404
Fashion capital
of the world.

590
00:44:30,508 --> 00:44:32,635
I did my
residency there.

591
00:44:32,744 --> 00:44:34,644
Mmm.

592
00:44:34,746 --> 00:44:36,839
Maybe it's just
a silly pipe dream...

593
00:44:36,948 --> 00:44:40,440
'cause it seems everybody and they mama
got a clothing line out now.

594
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:42,486
Whose mother?

595
00:44:42,587 --> 00:44:45,556
No, it's, um-

596
00:44:45,657 --> 00:44:47,648
It's just another
American expression.

597
00:44:47,759 --> 00:44:49,659
Oh.

598
00:45:07,779 --> 00:45:10,873
- What'd you say?
- It's French.

599
00:45:10,982 --> 00:45:14,281
I said, "Everything in
its own time, my dear.

600
00:45:14,386 --> 00:45:16,854
"It will happen for you
when you least expect it...

601
00:45:16,955 --> 00:45:20,686
"and on that day, you will
remember Dr. Tunde...

602
00:45:20,792 --> 00:45:22,692
and smile."

603
00:46:28,326 --> 00:46:30,988
I wish you could see
what I see.

604
00:46:34,532 --> 00:46:36,500
So, tell me...

605
00:46:37,736 --> 00:46:40,204
when was the last time
you had fun?

606
00:46:43,241 --> 00:46:45,835
Real fun.

607
00:46:45,944 --> 00:46:49,880
Just let go of
all of your inhibitions...

608
00:46:49,981 --> 00:46:54,213
and live passionately
in the moment...

609
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:56,287
with no thought
for tomorrow.

610
00:46:59,224 --> 00:47:01,124
Never.

611
00:47:01,226 --> 00:47:05,185
Well, it's time
to start living.

612
00:47:23,915 --> 00:47:25,849
How you doing?

613
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:30,546
Okay, well,
I guess we are here.

614
00:47:30,655 --> 00:47:34,887
- Is, uh, this room 334?
- Mm-hmm.

615
00:47:34,993 --> 00:47:39,362
Here we are, back to your room,
uh, safe and sound.

616
00:47:39,464 --> 00:47:42,797
I wouldn't want your girlfriends to think
that I was a bad doctor...

617
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:45,369
keeping you
out too long.

618
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:47,836
I'm sure they're worried sick
about me right now.

619
00:47:47,939 --> 00:47:51,534
Oh, yeah, baby, get thick with it.

620
00:47:51,643 --> 00:47:55,340
I think I'm gonna be sick.

621
00:47:55,447 --> 00:47:57,438
Ow, shit.

622
00:47:59,017 --> 00:48:02,578
<i>Well, looking forward</i>
<i>to seeing you again tomorrow.</i>

623
00:48:02,687 --> 00:48:05,451
You could've saw me tonight, fool.

624
00:48:05,557 --> 00:48:07,457
Okay. Oops.

625
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:10,858
Looks like your necklace is-
Let me fix it.

626
00:48:12,997 --> 00:48:16,524
I will be your African queen,
your thick Madame...

627
00:48:16,634 --> 00:48:21,765
your royal princess,
mother of all your babies.

628
00:48:21,873 --> 00:48:24,706
Oh, Tunde.

629
00:48:24,809 --> 00:48:26,709
Beautiful.

630
00:48:26,811 --> 00:48:28,779
Thank you.

631
00:48:30,815 --> 00:48:32,783
Okay, then.

632
00:48:36,321 --> 00:48:39,119
Good night,
my American princess.

633
00:48:39,224 --> 00:48:42,591
- Good night.
- Sleep tight.

634
00:48:42,694 --> 00:48:44,787
More like alone and disappointed.

635
00:48:44,896 --> 00:48:47,228
You too.

636
00:48:53,404 --> 00:48:55,372
I hope I'm not
going too fast.

637
00:49:06,734 --> 00:49:09,134
Child, a brother
was hittin' it so good...

638
00:49:09,236 --> 00:49:11,727
he had me singing the Nigerian
national anthem up in there.

639
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:13,807
Girl, you crazy.

640
00:49:13,907 --> 00:49:16,171
Oh, you think
I'm bullshittin'?

641
00:49:26,787 --> 00:49:29,381
I don't know what kind of
African roots...

642
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:32,425
that man put on you
to yank you out...

643
00:49:32,526 --> 00:49:34,862
that stuffy-ass shell of yours,
but I like it.

644
00:49:39,399 --> 00:49:42,527
Dang, Stace,
we had to hook up with men...

645
00:49:42,636 --> 00:49:46,003
visiting all the way from Africa
just to get some love.

646
00:49:46,106 --> 00:49:48,836
Who said anything
about love?

647
00:49:48,942 --> 00:49:51,001
This is a lust thing.

648
00:49:52,946 --> 00:49:55,176
I'm the queen of the world!

649
00:50:02,689 --> 00:50:06,921
Why do you insist on covering
up all of your assets?

650
00:50:09,796 --> 00:50:12,492
I don't ever want to see you
with clothes on again.

651
00:50:25,946 --> 00:50:30,508
<i>I can live without the tail,</i>
<i>but the head is the best part.</i>

652
00:50:30,617 --> 00:50:33,518
Can I see it?
I mean, I see.

653
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:35,645
I see you ate yours.

654
00:50:35,756 --> 00:50:39,317
You know, back home,
when a woman is in the kitchen...

655
00:50:39,426 --> 00:50:42,190
cooking fish for her husband,
she makes sure that...

656
00:50:42,296 --> 00:50:45,231
the eyeball stays in because...

657
00:50:45,332 --> 00:50:48,426
it is believed that fish eye
gives men extra stamina.

658
00:50:48,535 --> 00:50:51,595
- Does it?
- Oh, yes.

659
00:50:53,707 --> 00:50:56,642
Now, speakin' of women
in the kitchen...

660
00:50:56,743 --> 00:50:59,303
you don't believe that's where
her place should be, do you?

661
00:50:59,413 --> 00:51:02,746
- Only when they're not cleaning.
- Excuse me? Waiter.

662
00:51:02,849 --> 00:51:05,374
Wait.
I am kidding, okay?

663
00:51:05,485 --> 00:51:07,646
Don't test me,
okay, Tunde?

664
00:51:07,754 --> 00:51:10,587
'Cause I keep my boxing
gloves back in the room.

665
00:51:10,691 --> 00:51:13,319
Lord.

666
00:51:15,429 --> 00:51:20,230
Most men will find you
very intimidating...

667
00:51:20,334 --> 00:51:21,451
but I find you very-

668
00:51:21,486 --> 00:51:22,568
but I find you very-

669
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:24,797
So how was everything?

670
00:51:24,905 --> 00:51:29,171
- Good. Thank you.
- Excellent. We aim to please.

671
00:51:29,277 --> 00:51:31,211
Is there anything else
I can get you?

672
00:51:31,312 --> 00:51:33,337
No, that will be all.
Thank you.

673
00:51:33,447 --> 00:51:35,915
Dessert menu, perhaps?

674
00:51:36,017 --> 00:51:39,418
Did you hear what he said?
No, thank you.

675
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:45,152
Okay. Okay.
Well, you and your sister...

676
00:51:45,259 --> 00:51:47,557
<i>have a good one.</i>

677
00:51:47,662 --> 00:51:51,564
Sister? I'm about to put my foot
up her bony ass.

678
00:51:51,666 --> 00:51:53,691
Whoa, whoa!
Stop, stop. Come on.

679
00:51:53,801 --> 00:51:56,634
- Did you hear-
- Relax, relax. Come on. Sit here.

680
00:51:58,372 --> 00:52:01,341
Lord, I thought you forgot
your boxing gloves back in the room.

681
00:52:01,442 --> 00:52:03,376
Did you hear
how that bitch-

682
00:52:03,477 --> 00:52:06,037
woman tried to dis me?

683
00:52:06,147 --> 00:52:08,513
Jazmin, why do her
silly comments bother you?

684
00:52:08,616 --> 00:52:11,585
- I mean, I find it quite amusing.
- Well, I don't.

685
00:52:11,686 --> 00:52:15,349
And I don't know what you
do over in your village, but over here...

686
00:52:15,456 --> 00:52:17,591
you just can't
disrespect a sister.

687
00:52:18,959 --> 00:52:22,360
I suspect that the real
reason why you're angry...

688
00:52:22,462 --> 00:52:25,488
it's because you believe that
she can compete with you.

689
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:30,332
Well, she won't be able to as soon as I get
down to my perfect size five.

690
00:52:30,437 --> 00:52:33,600
Now, it's not gonna take me long,
'cause I just got this...

691
00:52:33,707 --> 00:52:37,473
workout video that will blow
Tae-Bo out the water.

692
00:52:37,577 --> 00:52:41,104
Jazmin, you will never be a size five.

693
00:52:41,214 --> 00:52:45,844
<i>And I'm speaking to you</i>
<i>as a medical professional.</i>

694
00:52:45,952 --> 00:52:49,752
Your body structure
is not made to be a five.

695
00:52:49,856 --> 00:52:51,790
<i>You are beautiful.</i>

696
00:52:51,891 --> 00:52:57,454
So why would you want to fit in with American
society's fleeting standard of beauty?

697
00:52:57,564 --> 00:53:00,032
Because, Tunde,
I live here, okay?

698
00:53:00,133 --> 00:53:02,033
And every time
I open up a magazine...

699
00:53:02,135 --> 00:53:06,128
or I go to the movies or I see the music videos,
all the girls are just-

700
00:53:06,239 --> 00:53:10,903
Hopelessly insecure
and incurably unhappy.

701
00:53:16,383 --> 00:53:18,230
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.

702
00:53:18,265 --> 00:53:20,078
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.

703
00:53:20,186 --> 00:53:24,623
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.

704
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:32,289
No!

705
00:53:55,922 --> 00:53:57,890
I have never been
so exhausted.

706
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:02,485
Shall we go
for lunch now?

707
00:54:02,595 --> 00:54:04,586
Oh, forget lunch.

708
00:54:04,698 --> 00:54:07,633
I got all the stuff
I need right here.

709
00:54:07,734 --> 00:54:09,634
No, not again. No.

710
00:54:09,736 --> 00:54:12,864
Hold on, I'm just
getting started.

711
00:54:28,154 --> 00:54:31,817
Now, I know what gave me the courage
to get my big ass in this bathing suit...

712
00:54:31,925 --> 00:54:33,825
but what about you?

713
00:54:33,927 --> 00:54:35,827
It ain't about courage.

714
00:54:35,929 --> 00:54:38,193
Akibo ripped up every outfit
I brought out here.

715
00:54:38,298 --> 00:54:40,198
I ain't got
no more clothes.

716
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:44,254
- Girl, you so crazy. So y'all hooking up tonight?
- Dinnertime.

717
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:49,814
Well, not that we'll be eating.

718
00:54:49,925 --> 00:54:51,950
What about y'all?

719
00:54:52,061 --> 00:54:53,961
You know, Stace,
I don't get it.

720
00:54:54,063 --> 00:54:56,463
I mean, the chemistry is there,
the attraction is bangin'...

721
00:54:56,565 --> 00:54:59,466
<i>and the sexual tension</i>
<i>is off the hook.</i>

722
00:54:59,568 --> 00:55:01,832
But, for some reason,
he won't go there with me.

723
00:55:01,937 --> 00:55:04,804
Because he is gay.
Hello?

724
00:55:04,907 --> 00:55:09,173
- But what do I know?
- Not a damn thing, hater.

725
00:55:09,278 --> 00:55:13,146
Okay, hold up.
Now check out Miss Stace here.

726
00:55:13,249 --> 00:55:17,777
<i>Girl, you got your titties up,</i>
<i>your legs showin'. Mmm.</i>

727
00:55:17,887 --> 00:55:20,378
Now what's gotten
into you, child?

728
00:55:20,489 --> 00:55:22,821
- Dr. Akibo.
- Dr. Akibo.

729
00:55:25,327 --> 00:55:27,318
Yes, he's in it.

730
00:55:30,032 --> 00:55:32,523
I really like you, Jazmin.

731
00:55:32,635 --> 00:55:35,126
Since the very first time
I laid eyes on you...

732
00:55:35,237 --> 00:55:37,205
I could feel that
special connection.

733
00:55:37,306 --> 00:55:39,638
Then, Tunde, why haven't you
tried anything, huh?

734
00:55:40,743 --> 00:55:44,144
Last night
it could've been on.

735
00:55:44,246 --> 00:55:48,546
I mean, on.
But you sat there like a lump on a log.

736
00:55:48,651 --> 00:55:52,849
And when you dropped me off at my room,
you gave me a handshake.

737
00:55:52,955 --> 00:55:55,150
It was a kiss on your hand.

738
00:55:55,257 --> 00:55:57,657
I was trying
to show you respect.

739
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,991
But if you gauge how much
a man likes you...

740
00:56:01,097 --> 00:56:03,657
by how quick he tried
to rip your clothes off...

741
00:56:03,766 --> 00:56:06,166
then I'd be happy
to oblige you.

742
00:56:06,268 --> 00:56:08,998
- My place or yours, baby?
- But, unfortunately...

743
00:56:09,105 --> 00:56:12,199
tonight I'll be tied up in a meeting
with the president...

744
00:56:12,308 --> 00:56:15,277
of the International
Medical Association.

745
00:56:15,377 --> 00:56:18,778
But tomorrow
I'll be all yours.

746
00:56:18,881 --> 00:56:20,781
Okay.

747
00:56:20,883 --> 00:56:23,875
Well, since I was
unable to appease you...

748
00:56:23,986 --> 00:56:27,478
with instant gratification,
perhaps-

749
00:56:53,682 --> 00:56:56,913
<i> Funny how one kiss</i>
<i>from the right guy can give a girl...</i>

750
00:56:57,019 --> 00:56:58,987
<i>a whole new attitude.</i>

751
00:56:59,088 --> 00:57:01,318
<i>Gloomy one day</i>
<i>and sunny the next.</i>

752
00:57:01,423 --> 00:57:04,392
Ooh, harder.
Harder. Yes.

753
00:57:06,929 --> 00:57:09,022
Yes, Tunde.

754
00:57:14,036 --> 00:57:16,732
Is that avocado?

755
00:57:16,839 --> 00:57:19,171
Mmm, tasty.

756
00:57:19,275 --> 00:57:23,177
<i> The world is finally comin'</i>
<i>around to seein' things my way.</i>

757
00:57:27,349 --> 00:57:30,580
<i>Well-</i>
<i>at least some of the world.</i>

758
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:45,190
Can you pass me
one of them cookies?

759
00:57:48,571 --> 00:57:52,701
Mmm.
Oh, that's the best cookie.

760
00:57:52,808 --> 00:57:56,005
That is the best cook-
Pop one of them cookies in your mouth.

761
00:57:56,111 --> 00:57:58,102
That's the best-
That's a good cookie.

762
00:58:03,419 --> 00:58:05,319
Oh.

763
00:58:10,826 --> 00:58:14,318
Feeling so damn good,
I got a date with myself.

764
00:58:14,430 --> 00:58:16,330
Ooh.

765
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:30,403
Oh, sweet Jesus.

766
00:58:39,855 --> 00:58:42,119
Let us pray.

767
00:58:42,224 --> 00:58:46,684
Dear Lord, thank you
for this blessed opportunity...

768
00:58:46,795 --> 00:58:51,164
and help me to know where to start
on this wonderful buffet.

769
00:58:51,267 --> 00:58:53,792
And, Lord, most importantly...

770
00:58:53,902 --> 00:58:57,531
let my stomach
be much bigger than my eyes.

771
00:58:58,941 --> 00:59:02,069
Amen. Amen.
Girl, dig in.

772
00:59:02,177 --> 00:59:04,509
Ooh, yes, that's what
I'm talkin' about, baby.

773
00:59:04,613 --> 00:59:06,774
Just get you some salad,
'cause you been workin' so hard.

774
00:59:06,882 --> 00:59:09,282
Just get a piece of turkey,
a little piece of protein.

775
00:59:09,385 --> 00:59:11,410
Little cracker.
This is my crouton.

776
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,683
Baby, chicken on a stick.
Pepperoni.

777
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:16,781
Hmm, you need company.

778
00:59:16,892 --> 00:59:20,089
Oh, just a couple pieces
of quiche, one little brownie, a croissant.

779
00:59:20,195 --> 00:59:23,562
And just one sparerib, okay?
Oh, Jesus, they got a couple shrimps.

780
00:59:23,666 --> 00:59:26,362
Wish I had a little
melted cheese to dip it in.

781
00:59:26,468 --> 00:59:28,902
I am doing so good.
Yes, you are, Jaz.

782
00:59:43,919 --> 00:59:46,012
<i>Hey, Jazmin,</i>
<i>what's going on?</i>

783
00:59:46,121 --> 00:59:48,919
Don't "what's going on" me! I thought
you were supposed to go to a meeting.

784
00:59:49,024 --> 00:59:50,821
- You tryin' to play me?
- No, this is-

785
00:59:50,926 --> 00:59:54,919
And who is she? You wouldn't sleep with me
'cause you were so busy sleeping with her?

786
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:57,498
Sorry. We're not sleeping together.
We're just colleagues.

787
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:00,966
Oh, and, Tunde, did you feed her
with the same lines you fed me with?

788
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:04,233
- Jazmin, you are mistaken.
- And what happened to your
meeting with the president...

789
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:06,968
of the International Association
or medical board or whatever?

790
01:00:07,076 --> 01:00:08,976
Did that conveniently
get canceled too?

791
01:00:09,078 --> 01:00:12,809
Jazmin, this is the president
of the International Medical Association.

792
01:00:25,594 --> 01:00:28,256
Excuse me, Sarah. Jazmin.

793
01:00:28,364 --> 01:00:31,561
<i>Jazmin, stop!</i>

794
01:00:33,902 --> 01:00:37,531
What is wrong with you, woman?
What just happened in there?

795
01:00:38,774 --> 01:00:40,833
Is it who you are?

796
01:00:40,943 --> 01:00:43,036
And if it is, then what?

797
01:00:43,145 --> 01:00:46,342
Then I'll be asking, why are you
such a suspicious person?

798
01:00:46,448 --> 01:00:48,348
Why are you so angry?

799
01:00:48,450 --> 01:00:52,614
That woman in there-
she's a friend, a colleague, like she said.

800
01:00:52,721 --> 01:00:56,487
She's also the wife of a fellow doctor
here at the convention.

801
01:00:56,592 --> 01:00:59,584
Well, still, if you're
not sleepin' with that woman...

802
01:00:59,695 --> 01:01:03,028
it's just a matter of time
before you're sleepin' with another one.

803
01:01:06,268 --> 01:01:08,566
What do you want me to do?

804
01:01:08,670 --> 01:01:11,104
I don't want you
to do nothin', Tunde...

805
01:01:11,206 --> 01:01:13,299
except just
leave me alone, okay?

806
01:01:13,409 --> 01:01:17,038
No, no, no. You're gonna have to answer
me one question.

807
01:01:17,146 --> 01:01:19,046
Look at me.

808
01:01:20,682 --> 01:01:23,344
What was this between us?

809
01:01:23,452 --> 01:01:26,785
Was it just a blip
in your life?

810
01:01:26,889 --> 01:01:32,088
I mean, this morning you said
that everything was perfect.

811
01:01:33,695 --> 01:01:38,530
And now... everything
turned out so ugly.

812
01:01:40,135 --> 01:01:43,195
'Cause maybe I'm ugly.
Okay, I mean, do you see this?

813
01:01:43,305 --> 01:01:47,401
Look at this. Look at it.
All of it. Look at it.

814
01:01:47,509 --> 01:01:50,672
It ain't goin' nowhere.
Nowhere. And neither are we, okay?

815
01:01:50,779 --> 01:01:53,942
So let's just stop kiddin' each other
and say good-bye now.

816
01:01:54,049 --> 01:01:56,609
Then you can go
get you a skinny woman.

817
01:01:56,718 --> 01:01:58,618
Jazmin-

818
01:02:09,998 --> 01:02:13,297
Hey, Stace, I'm sorry
to interrupt you guys...

819
01:02:13,402 --> 01:02:16,735
but I came to tell you I gotta
get the hell up outta here.

820
01:02:16,839 --> 01:02:18,807
<i>- I gotta go.</i>
- What happened?

821
01:02:20,509 --> 01:02:23,239
Come on, Mia, pack your shit.
We're leavin'.

822
01:02:23,345 --> 01:02:25,643
You ain't gots
to tell me twice.

823
01:02:27,983 --> 01:02:30,315
<i>Will you tell me</i>
<i>what happened?</i>

824
01:02:33,522 --> 01:02:35,490
Jaz!

825
01:02:35,591 --> 01:02:38,151
Move, Stace.

826
01:02:39,361 --> 01:02:41,795
What did Tunde do?

827
01:02:43,398 --> 01:02:46,424
- What did he do, Jaz?
- Nothing. Nothing, Stace.

828
01:02:46,535 --> 01:02:51,529
It was me, Stace. It was me. Me.

829
01:02:59,615 --> 01:03:01,947
It's okay.

830
01:03:02,050 --> 01:03:04,848
You can stay. I don't
want to ruin your trip.

831
01:03:04,953 --> 01:03:07,421
No. If you're leavin',
I'm leavin'.

832
01:03:07,523 --> 01:03:10,321
- No, Stace.
- Yes.

833
01:03:12,361 --> 01:03:15,262
I knew it was too good
to be true.

834
01:03:15,364 --> 01:03:18,094
I knew it was.

835
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:37,914
That's what I always say.

836
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:42,013
When it's too good
to be true...

837
01:03:42,124 --> 01:03:44,183
they must be gay.

838
01:03:50,232 --> 01:03:52,132
What?

839
01:04:09,518 --> 01:04:14,080
<i>Oh, hi, Madam Piggy Wiggy.</i>

840
01:04:14,189 --> 01:04:17,386
<i>I'm just sittin' here</i>
<i>feelin' sorry for myself.</i>

841
01:04:17,492 --> 01:04:19,790
<i>Thought I had a date</i>
<i>with Miss Slim Goody.</i>

842
01:04:19,895 --> 01:04:22,830
<i>Turns out she never intended</i>
<i>to go out with a fatty like me.</i>

843
01:04:22,931 --> 01:04:25,764
<i>It was all a big joke,</i>
<i>and I was the butt of it.</i>

844
01:04:25,867 --> 01:04:28,768
<i>But you don't look like</i>
<i>an ass to me, Mr. Fat Man.</i>

845
01:04:28,870 --> 01:04:31,703
<i>Hey, why don't you join me</i>
<i>in my pity party-</i>

846
01:04:31,807 --> 01:04:34,173
I mean, piggy party.

847
01:04:34,276 --> 01:04:38,110
<i>Your piggy parties is what got me</i>
<i>in this blubbery mess in the first place.</i>

848
01:04:38,213 --> 01:04:40,704
Mmm.

849
01:04:44,286 --> 01:04:48,814
<i>I think I got indigestion.</i>

850
01:04:52,527 --> 01:04:55,428
Hey, this is Jaz. Hang up at the beep.

851
01:04:55,530 --> 01:04:57,760
Jaz, you've been in that bed...

852
01:04:57,866 --> 01:05:01,529
wallowing in your misery for three days,
and it's time to snap out of it.

853
01:05:01,637 --> 01:05:05,801
'Cause the way I see it, Akibo was just
a preview of greater things to come for me.

854
01:05:05,907 --> 01:05:07,807
And the same goes
for you and Tunde-

855
01:05:07,909 --> 01:05:10,104
Message erased.

856
01:05:14,249 --> 01:05:16,274
...had frustrating results...

857
01:05:16,385 --> 01:05:19,912
and haven't been able to lose weight
on any of the other methods...

858
01:05:20,022 --> 01:05:22,115
come on in
and sleep that weight off.

859
01:05:22,224 --> 01:05:24,158
Dia-Trim Weight Loss Shoe
creates resistance-

860
01:05:24,259 --> 01:05:26,989
Studies have proven that daily exercise
is the fastest route to weight loss.

861
01:05:27,095 --> 01:05:28,892
So if you want
that perfect bod-

862
01:05:28,997 --> 01:05:32,933
I've tried all types of diets,
but nothing will work for me.

863
01:05:33,035 --> 01:05:37,028
<i>They tell me, "Oh, no, not you.</i>
<i>You're not fat. "</i>

864
01:05:37,139 --> 01:05:39,733
Of course I'm fat!
Look at me.

865
01:05:39,841 --> 01:05:44,676
<i>I just never imagined</i>
<i>that I could get this big.</i>

866
01:05:46,782 --> 01:05:51,378
I don't want
to have to eat lettuce!

867
01:05:51,486 --> 01:05:56,947
Those stupid bags
of spring mix piss me off!

868
01:05:57,059 --> 01:05:59,721
<i>The only thing I am sure of...</i>

869
01:05:59,828 --> 01:06:03,264
<i>is that there is no room</i>
<i>in this world for fat people.</i>

870
01:06:03,365 --> 01:06:07,802
<i>They should just round us all up</i>
<i>and send us to some island.</i>

871
01:06:07,903 --> 01:06:10,895
Hell, that
wouldn't even work...

872
01:06:11,006 --> 01:06:14,100
'cause we'd probably end up
eating each other.

873
01:06:30,025 --> 01:06:33,426
<i>Jazmin, you will never be a size five.</i>

874
01:06:40,736 --> 01:06:45,196
Jaz, honey, um,
I'm steppin' out for a second.

875
01:06:45,307 --> 01:06:47,571
<i>Do you need me</i>
<i>to bring you back anything...</i>

876
01:06:47,676 --> 01:06:49,576
<i>like some air freshener?</i>

877
01:06:49,678 --> 01:06:52,704
Bitch, what you say?

878
01:06:52,814 --> 01:06:54,975
<i>Your room stinks like hell...</i>

879
01:06:55,083 --> 01:06:57,313
<i>and it's time that you</i>
<i>get back with the program.</i>

880
01:06:57,419 --> 01:07:01,219
<i>- I mean, just look at yourself.</i>
- I am looking at me.

881
01:07:03,925 --> 01:07:06,917
<i>On second thought,</i>
<i>no, I'm not. You ain't me.</i>

882
01:07:07,028 --> 01:07:10,395
You ain't never been me.
You don't know what it's like to feel my pain.

883
01:07:10,499 --> 01:07:13,229
You ain't never weighed
more than a buck oh-five in your life...

884
01:07:13,335 --> 01:07:15,326
<i>and you think</i>
<i>you feel my pain?</i>

885
01:07:15,437 --> 01:07:18,998
- Huh, bitch?
- Jazmin, are you talking to me?

886
01:07:19,107 --> 01:07:23,168
Who the hell do you think
I'm talkin' to, you bulimic, anorexic bitch?

887
01:07:23,278 --> 01:07:27,044
Well, geez, you don't
gotta get ugly.

888
01:07:27,149 --> 01:07:30,175
Did you just call me ugly?
Bitch, did you just call me ugly?

889
01:07:30,285 --> 01:07:33,618
I will kick your-

890
01:07:33,722 --> 01:07:37,351
It's on. You hear me?
It's about to be on.

891
01:07:37,459 --> 01:07:39,620
Bitch, you have tortured me
and taunted me...

892
01:07:39,728 --> 01:07:43,129
made me do things to my body
trying to be like you.

893
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:45,791
What you say?
What you say? Take that!

894
01:07:45,901 --> 01:07:48,461
I hate you!
I hate you! I hate you!

895
01:07:52,407 --> 01:07:56,901
<i>I hate you! I hate you for all the times</i>
<i>you told me I was fat!</i>

896
01:07:57,012 --> 01:07:59,810
<i>Oh, my God!</i>
<i>My cousin has gone mad!</i>

897
01:07:59,915 --> 01:08:02,110
She's trying to kill me!

898
01:08:04,219 --> 01:08:06,653
Never be a size five!

899
01:08:06,755 --> 01:08:10,486
I won't! Oh! Oh, God!

900
01:08:17,299 --> 01:08:21,736
Oh! Oh, God! Oh, God!

901
01:08:21,837 --> 01:08:25,898
<i>Oh, somebody</i>
<i>shut that fat bitch up!</i>

902
01:08:26,007 --> 01:08:29,238
Oh, God!

903
01:08:34,449 --> 01:08:37,714
Oh, God! Oh!

904
01:08:37,819 --> 01:08:41,414
Oh! Oh! Oh, God!

905
01:08:41,523 --> 01:08:44,151
God!

906
01:08:45,627 --> 01:08:48,391
Oh, God. Oh, God.

907
01:08:48,496 --> 01:08:51,897
Grandma. Grandma?

908
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,127
Grandma!

909
01:08:54,236 --> 01:08:58,036
Look at me, Grandma.

910
01:08:58,139 --> 01:09:02,371
Grandma. Grandma. Grandma.

911
01:09:05,213 --> 01:09:09,741
You are beautiful.
Inside and out.

912
01:09:09,851 --> 01:09:12,183
You're beautiful, sugar.

913
01:09:21,696 --> 01:09:23,596
I'm beautiful.

914
01:09:23,698 --> 01:09:26,565
I am. I am.

915
01:09:26,668 --> 01:09:30,729
I am. I am beautiful.

916
01:09:30,839 --> 01:09:32,864
All of me.

917
01:09:32,974 --> 01:09:35,067
I love me.

918
01:09:35,176 --> 01:09:38,634
I love me. I love me.

919
01:10:51,319 --> 01:10:53,844
You are a diamond, girl.

920
01:10:53,955 --> 01:10:56,549
And don't you ever forget it.

921
01:11:01,096 --> 01:11:03,963
<i>Hello.</i>

922
01:11:04,065 --> 01:11:07,762
- Is it okay to enter?
- Come on in, girl.

923
01:11:07,869 --> 01:11:11,430
Ooh! I'm sorry, Jaz.
I didn't know you was dressin'. I'll come back.

924
01:11:11,539 --> 01:11:14,099
<i>Oh, no, it's all right.</i>
<i>I wasn't gettin' dressed.</i>

925
01:11:14,209 --> 01:11:17,645
I just felt
like bein' naked.

926
01:11:17,746 --> 01:11:19,771
Oh, okay.

927
01:11:19,881 --> 01:11:21,974
Oh, um, okay.

928
01:11:23,284 --> 01:11:25,275
Shoot, for a minute there
yesterday, girl...

929
01:11:25,387 --> 01:11:27,446
I thought you
had lost your mind.

930
01:11:27,555 --> 01:11:30,752
Oh, my God, Jaz.
What happened to your room?

931
01:11:30,859 --> 01:11:34,795
Just a little bit
of spring cleaning.

932
01:11:34,896 --> 01:11:37,660
It smells so good,
and it looks so clean.

933
01:11:37,766 --> 01:11:40,098
<i>You sure you're all right?</i>

934
01:11:40,201 --> 01:11:43,364
I am "fat-tabulous."

935
01:11:45,306 --> 01:11:47,433
- Yes, you are.
- Yeah.

936
01:11:47,542 --> 01:11:50,102
Mmm. I love you.

937
01:11:50,211 --> 01:11:52,111
I love you too.

938
01:11:52,213 --> 01:11:54,113
And I'm sorry
about your head.

939
01:11:54,215 --> 01:11:56,410
- You want me to show you how it feels?
- No.

940
01:12:17,806 --> 01:12:20,036
Ooh, Stace,
that's my cut!

941
01:12:20,141 --> 01:12:22,109
Come on. Come on.

942
01:12:22,210 --> 01:12:24,974
All night. Yeah.

943
01:12:32,654 --> 01:12:36,181
What's goin' on?

944
01:12:36,291 --> 01:12:39,556
Oh, it's nothin'.

945
01:12:39,661 --> 01:12:42,095
Just two fat bitches.

946
01:12:42,197 --> 01:12:45,360
Ooh.

947
01:12:52,807 --> 01:12:54,707
Jaz?

948
01:12:54,809 --> 01:12:56,777
Oh, I got this.

949
01:12:58,313 --> 01:13:00,247
What did you say?

950
01:13:00,348 --> 01:13:03,943
<i>I said it's just</i>
<i>two fat bitches.</i>

951
01:13:04,052 --> 01:13:06,543
Yeah, did she stutter?

952
01:13:06,654 --> 01:13:10,146
You know, the only thing
stopping me from putting my size 10 foot...

953
01:13:11,775 --> 01:13:15,734
<i>up y'all bony asses is the fact that I know,</i>
<i>as pretty as you girls are...</i>

954
01:13:15,845 --> 01:13:19,941
<i>if you got to clown somebody else</i>
<i>just to feel good about yourselves...</i>

955
01:13:20,049 --> 01:13:23,018
then you must feel
pretty damn ugly inside.

956
01:13:23,119 --> 01:13:27,249
<i>And if that's the case,</i>
<i>do me a favor-stop hatin'.</i>

957
01:13:27,357 --> 01:13:32,488
<i>'Cause I'm plump like a roast</i>
<i>and thicker than most.</i>

958
01:13:35,265 --> 01:13:37,529
Hah!

959
01:13:40,069 --> 01:13:43,869
Ooh-ooh! Ooh-ooh!
Ooh-ooh!

960
01:14:19,409 --> 01:14:22,572
Girl, they are jammin'.

961
01:14:22,679 --> 01:14:25,273
<i>Hey, ladies, what you drinkin'?</i>

962
01:14:25,381 --> 01:14:27,542
Give us something sexy.

963
01:14:27,650 --> 01:14:30,517
Two somethin' sexy's comin' up!

964
01:14:30,620 --> 01:14:33,350
Ooh, Miss Stace! Sexy.

965
01:14:33,456 --> 01:14:35,549
Feelin' sexy.

966
01:14:35,658 --> 01:14:37,990
You want to dance?

967
01:14:38,094 --> 01:14:42,428
He obviously doesn't remember us, Stace.

968
01:14:42,532 --> 01:14:44,432
See, the last time
we were here...

969
01:14:44,534 --> 01:14:46,434
I recall you
laughing at us...

970
01:14:46,536 --> 01:14:49,437
when we asked you to be a gentleman
and drive us home.

971
01:14:49,539 --> 01:14:51,439
- Right.
- I did?

972
01:14:51,541 --> 01:14:53,975
- Mm-hmm.
- Damn, what was I thinking?

973
01:14:54,077 --> 01:14:58,104
The same thing I'm thinkin' right now.

974
01:14:58,214 --> 01:15:01,206
- See ya! Peace.
- Peace.

975
01:15:02,518 --> 01:15:04,418
- Yes, baby.
- All right.

976
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:08,012
- You know what? I got this round.
- Uh-uh. I got it.

977
01:15:08,124 --> 01:15:11,093
Actually, ladies, those two gentlemen
over there got it.

978
01:15:14,130 --> 01:15:15,757
Oh.

979
01:15:15,865 --> 01:15:19,596
<i>Oh, child, we got some mens</i>
<i>buyin' us drinks and things.</i>

980
01:15:19,702 --> 01:15:24,401
Okay, okay. I want
the chocolate coffee.

981
01:15:24,507 --> 01:15:26,099
No cream, no sugar.

982
01:15:28,211 --> 01:15:31,544
- How you doin' ladies?
- Hey.

983
01:15:31,648 --> 01:15:33,673
I would love to dance.

984
01:15:33,783 --> 01:15:36,217
All right,
let's do it.

985
01:15:55,705 --> 01:15:59,766
Cha-cha. Ooh, I love this dress.
It's pink. It's fresh.

986
01:15:59,876 --> 01:16:01,380
<i>Hey, y'all, welcome back!</i>
<i>How was the vacation?</i>

987
01:16:01,415 --> 01:16:02,885
<i>Hey, y'all, welcome back!</i>
<i>How was the vacation?</i>

988
01:16:02,995 --> 01:16:06,226
- Life-changing.
- Ooh, ooh, I see.

989
01:16:06,331 --> 01:16:09,494
Girl, you got two eyes instead of four.
Look at those knockers.

990
01:16:09,601 --> 01:16:12,661
Mama said knock me out.

991
01:16:12,771 --> 01:16:15,035
Now, bitch, give me
all the juicy details.

992
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:18,541
- A good girl never kisses and tells.
- Ooh!

993
01:16:18,644 --> 01:16:20,544
- So where do you want me to start?
<i>- Okay.</i>

994
01:16:20,646 --> 01:16:24,446
<i>Excuse me. Can we get</i>
<i>some damn help around here?</i>

995
01:16:24,549 --> 01:16:28,451
Is anybody working here?

996
01:16:28,553 --> 01:16:29,918
<i>- Anybody?</i>

997
01:16:30,022 --> 01:16:31,853
- RamÃ³n.
- Customer.

998
01:16:31,957 --> 01:16:33,857
How can I help you?

999
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:39,458
Jaz, go help them.
I need to do inventory.

1000
01:16:39,564 --> 01:16:43,898
Yeah, can you tell me why everything in this
department matches my living room set?

1001
01:16:44,002 --> 01:16:46,300
- That's what I wanna know.
- Mm-hmm.

1002
01:16:46,405 --> 01:16:48,805
Well, ladies, unfortunately
I can't, because-

1003
01:16:51,209 --> 01:16:55,077
Because the only person that
can answer that question...

1004
01:16:55,180 --> 01:16:57,478
is that man
right over there.

1005
01:16:57,582 --> 01:16:59,550
<i>Why don't we go ask him?</i>

1006
01:16:59,651 --> 01:17:03,747
Can you give me a sec?
RamÃ³n!

1007
01:17:03,855 --> 01:17:06,153
I saw it comin'.

1008
01:17:06,258 --> 01:17:08,283
Ladies, follow me.

1009
01:17:08,393 --> 01:17:10,293
All right.

1010
01:17:11,396 --> 01:17:14,058
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, I do.

1011
01:17:14,166 --> 01:17:15,997
That's a bangin' dress
she's got on.

1012
01:17:16,101 --> 01:17:19,502
<i>- Oh, I'd wear the hell out of that, girl.</i>
- Yes, Jazmin, what is it?

1013
01:17:19,604 --> 01:17:22,072
Dick, these ladies
have a question for you...

1014
01:17:22,174 --> 01:17:24,267
and I have
a question for him.

1015
01:17:24,376 --> 01:17:26,640
- But you can't-
- Watch me.

1016
01:17:26,745 --> 01:17:29,714
Okay, 4:00 is good.

1017
01:17:29,815 --> 01:17:33,478
Hi. I'm sorry to disturb you.
My name is Jazmin Biltmore.

1018
01:17:33,585 --> 01:17:36,452
- I understand you're
the head buyer at Bloomfeld's.
- I am.

1019
01:17:36,555 --> 01:17:39,023
Excuse me.
Are you gonna help us or not?

1020
01:17:39,124 --> 01:17:43,322
Oh, I'm sorry, ladies.
How can I be of assistance?

1021
01:17:43,428 --> 01:17:46,625
We'd like to know which rack
she got her dress from.

1022
01:17:46,732 --> 01:17:51,635
Well, I'm not exactly sure.
Why don't we go ask her?

1023
01:17:51,737 --> 01:17:55,138
See, I'm an aspiring fashion
designer, and I was wondering-

1024
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:59,609
Jazmin, need I remind you that you're on
the clock and should be assisting customers?

1025
01:17:59,711 --> 01:18:02,509
Now, these ladies would like you
to go and show them...

1026
01:18:02,614 --> 01:18:04,673
which rack
you got your outfit from.

1027
01:18:04,783 --> 01:18:06,717
- Oh, that is not one of ours.
- No.

1028
01:18:06,818 --> 01:18:09,378
Actually, I designed it
and made it myself.

1029
01:18:09,488 --> 01:18:11,820
- You made that?
- You made that? That is fly!

1030
01:18:11,923 --> 01:18:16,326
It's got a lot of flavor.
It is sexy yet professional.

1031
01:18:16,428 --> 01:18:19,022
<i>Classy yet... sassy.</i>

1032
01:18:19,131 --> 01:18:21,463
And this was
last season's design.

1033
01:18:21,566 --> 01:18:24,296
There's a lot more
where this came from.

1034
01:18:25,771 --> 01:18:28,399
<i> Dang, girl, you gotta hook</i>
<i>your big sisters up.</i>

1035
01:18:28,507 --> 01:18:30,998
<i>- Just say how much.</i>
- Has anybody seen these?

1036
01:18:31,109 --> 01:18:33,805
Well, I asked Dick
the last time you were here...

1037
01:18:33,912 --> 01:18:36,380
if I could show them to you,
but he said you would never...

1038
01:18:36,481 --> 01:18:38,881
<i>be interested</i>
<i>in my amateur sketches.</i>

1039
01:18:38,984 --> 01:18:40,713
- This Dick?
- This Dick.

1040
01:18:40,819 --> 01:18:42,753
- So you saw these sketches?
- Well-

1041
01:18:42,854 --> 01:18:45,914
- And you held them back from me?
- Not exactly.

1042
01:18:46,024 --> 01:18:48,151
Richard, you and I
have got to talk.

1043
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:51,093
I agree.
She's got potential.

1044
01:18:51,196 --> 01:18:54,757
Potential? Potential is someone
who's on their way.

1045
01:18:54,866 --> 01:18:57,334
She's arrived.

1046
01:18:57,435 --> 01:19:01,667
- Mr. Myer-
- Please, call me Robert.

1047
01:19:01,773 --> 01:19:04,401
Let's go have a little chat.

1048
01:19:08,613 --> 01:19:11,548
Ladies, what
can I do for you?

1049
01:19:11,650 --> 01:19:13,709
- Nothing.
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

1050
01:19:15,754 --> 01:19:19,622
Robert, I need you to say to me in plain English
exactly what you're saying...

1051
01:19:19,724 --> 01:19:22,852
before I jump up and down
and make a total fool of myself.

1052
01:19:22,961 --> 01:19:25,623
Have a seat.

1053
01:19:25,730 --> 01:19:28,096
<i>In plain English,</i>
<i>what I'm saying is...</i>

1054
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:33,536
your fashion sense
is simply... amazing.

1055
01:19:33,638 --> 01:19:37,938
<i>If you allow me to test-market</i>
<i>your designs and they do well...</i>

1056
01:19:38,043 --> 01:19:40,443
I will see to it
by this time next year...

1057
01:19:40,545 --> 01:19:43,981
your line is in every major
department store in the nation.

1058
01:19:49,154 --> 01:19:51,054
Miss Biltmore.

1059
01:19:53,491 --> 01:19:55,391
Miss Biltmore?

1060
01:19:55,493 --> 01:19:59,657
You can jump up and down
and make a total fool of yourself now.

1061
01:20:04,102 --> 01:20:08,266
Oh! Oh, Stacey!

1062
01:20:08,373 --> 01:20:11,308
Baby, y'all should
have seen Dick's face.

1063
01:20:11,409 --> 01:20:13,934
Yes, he was dick-faced.

1064
01:20:14,045 --> 01:20:17,242
<i>- Dickface was dick-faced.</i>

1065
01:20:17,349 --> 01:20:20,750
What is the name
of your line gonna be?

1066
01:20:24,422 --> 01:20:27,448
Thick Madame.

1067
01:20:27,559 --> 01:20:29,993
- To the thick Madames!
- To the thick Madames!

1068
01:20:30,095 --> 01:20:32,359
To the thick Madames!
To the thick Madames!

1069
01:20:32,464 --> 01:20:35,592
To the thick Madames!
Go, Stace! Go, Stace!

1070
01:20:59,090 --> 01:21:01,217
This is fabulous!

1071
01:21:27,285 --> 01:21:29,549
<i>Hello?</i>

1072
01:21:29,654 --> 01:21:32,088
<i>Miss Biltmore, Robert Myer.</i>

1073
01:21:32,190 --> 01:21:34,090
<i>Yes?</i>

1074
01:21:34,192 --> 01:21:37,457
<i> It's this time next year.</i>
<i>I'm launching you nationally.</i>

1075
01:21:37,562 --> 01:21:42,022
Oh! Oh, my God!
Oh, my-Thank you.

1076
01:21:42,133 --> 01:21:45,534
Thank you so much! Oh!

1077
01:21:58,683 --> 01:22:02,744
Thank you, and no, I am not a thick Madame.

1078
01:22:02,854 --> 01:22:05,755
Thick, no.
Madame, ooh, maybe.

1079
01:22:07,692 --> 01:22:10,889
And now for the moment
you've all been waitin' for.

1080
01:22:10,996 --> 01:22:15,524
Help me welcome all
the fabulous thick Madames!

1081
01:22:22,007 --> 01:22:26,205
<i> They came, they saw,</i>
<i>they even sashayed.</i>

1082
01:22:26,311 --> 01:22:28,245
That's right!
Go, Thick Madame!

1083
01:22:28,346 --> 01:22:32,112
<i> Aren't they beautiful?</i>
<i>Aren't they opulent?</i>

1084
01:22:32,217 --> 01:22:34,651
<i>Aren't they lovely?</i>

1085
01:22:37,422 --> 01:22:39,788
<i>Absorb them. Love them. Take them in.</i>

1086
01:22:39,891 --> 01:22:42,121
<i>Who are they?</i>
<i>They are the uptown models.</i>

1087
01:22:42,227 --> 01:22:45,321
<i>They are the girls that fly!</i>

1088
01:22:45,430 --> 01:22:48,422
<i>Love you, Thick Madame!</i>

1089
01:22:48,533 --> 01:22:50,330
<i>They are here to work it.</i>

1090
01:22:50,435 --> 01:22:54,462
<i>This is the fashion line</i>
<i>for the uptown hot mama.</i>

1091
01:23:00,945 --> 01:23:05,006
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>this ain't no "Lame" Bryant.</i>

1092
01:23:06,251 --> 01:23:09,516
<i>Fashion that will</i>
<i>blow you away.</i>

1093
01:23:18,630 --> 01:23:20,427
Go Stacey! Yes!

1094
01:23:24,702 --> 01:23:27,068
<i>Thank you. Thank you, ladies!</i>

1095
01:23:29,407 --> 01:23:34,174
Help me welcome the legendary,
the one, the only...

1096
01:23:34,279 --> 01:23:38,875
the queen and my girl,
Miss Jazmin Biltmore.

1097
01:24:01,005 --> 01:24:04,270
Thank you.
Thank you all so much.

1098
01:24:04,375 --> 01:24:09,540
<i>Ooh, I just want to say that this night</i>
<i>is not just a celebration for me...</i>

1099
01:24:09,647 --> 01:24:12,241
but for all the full-figured
women of the world-

1100
01:24:12,350 --> 01:24:15,911
<i>black, white,</i>
<i>Asian, Latina.</i>

1101
01:24:16,020 --> 01:24:18,818
<i>It's a new day.</i>
<i>From this day forward...</i>

1102
01:24:18,923 --> 01:24:21,153
plus-sized women of America
will have a fashion line...

1103
01:24:21,259 --> 01:24:23,159
that we, too,
can be proud of.

1104
01:24:23,261 --> 01:24:25,923
<i>And to all the people who think</i>
<i>we got a weight problem...</i>

1105
01:24:26,030 --> 01:24:28,328
no, baby, we ain't
got a weight problem.

1106
01:24:28,433 --> 01:24:30,424
You just got a problem
with our weight.

1107
01:24:35,373 --> 01:24:38,900
<i>We've been called fat, chunky,</i>
<i>chubby, porky, piggy...</i>

1108
01:24:39,010 --> 01:24:41,342
every name you can think of.

1109
01:24:41,446 --> 01:24:44,506
They even took the name "phat."
But we're gonna take it back.

1110
01:24:44,616 --> 01:24:48,609
Because "P-H-A-T"
means "pretty, hot and thick."

1111
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:52,747
<i>Big women in the house,</i>
<i>we are the bellies of the ball.</i>

1112
01:24:52,857 --> 01:24:55,052
So stand the hell up
and take a bow.

1113
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:57,390
Yes!

1114
01:24:57,495 --> 01:25:00,191
<i>Let's make</i>
<i>Thick Madame wonderful.</i>

1115
01:25:00,298 --> 01:25:02,664
Let's make history.
I love you all.

1116
01:25:02,767 --> 01:25:05,429
<i>Thank you so much</i>
<i>for making my dream come true.</i>

1117
01:25:14,562 --> 01:25:18,589
Thick Madame! Thick Madame!
Thick Madame! Thick Madame!

1118
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:42,855
<i> It will happen for you</i>
<i>when you least expect it...</i>

1119
01:25:42,957 --> 01:25:47,860
<i>and on that day, you will</i>
<i>remember Dr. Tunde and smile.</i>

1120
01:25:52,466 --> 01:25:54,434
Thank you, Tunde.

1121
01:26:05,012 --> 01:26:07,412
Well, Jaz...

1122
01:26:07,515 --> 01:26:11,246
it took lots of
sweat and tears...

1123
01:26:11,352 --> 01:26:14,719
but you finally
got your dream.

1124
01:26:14,822 --> 01:26:16,756
Yeah.

1125
01:26:19,326 --> 01:26:21,294
I got it.

1126
01:26:23,364 --> 01:26:26,128
So, are we goin' to the club
to celebrate, or what?

1127
01:26:29,136 --> 01:26:33,232
This celebrating queen is not gonna
hang out with y'all right now.

1128
01:26:33,340 --> 01:26:36,070
I am just tired. I'm exhausted.
I need to get some rest.

1129
01:26:36,177 --> 01:26:39,840
Aw, come on. You can't be a party pooper
on the biggest night of your life.

1130
01:26:39,947 --> 01:26:42,677
Y'all go ahead. Y'all go ahead.

1131
01:26:42,783 --> 01:26:45,980
I'm okay.
Go have a good time. Really.

1132
01:26:46,087 --> 01:26:48,487
All right.
If you insist.

1133
01:26:48,589 --> 01:26:50,557
All right.

1134
01:27:03,838 --> 01:27:05,806
Yeah.

1135
01:27:22,690 --> 01:27:25,090
Y'all can't sneak up
on a fashion designer.

1136
01:27:25,192 --> 01:27:27,092
What?

1137
01:27:27,194 --> 01:27:30,186
Sorry, but I know you didn't think
we could go party without you.

1138
01:27:30,297 --> 01:27:34,597
Child, come on. If you don't want to go
to a club, we can go eat or something.

1139
01:27:34,702 --> 01:27:38,138
No, I don't have
too much of an appetite. Y'all go on.

1140
01:27:38,239 --> 01:27:41,402
Now, that's a... first.

1141
01:27:41,509 --> 01:27:43,875
Jaz, we gotta
go somewhere.

1142
01:27:50,101 --> 01:27:53,070
How far are y'all
willing to travel?

1143
01:28:29,924 --> 01:28:32,324
I guess I use
this big thing to knock?

1144
01:28:32,427 --> 01:28:34,361
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1145
01:28:34,462 --> 01:28:36,362
Okay.

1146
01:28:38,833 --> 01:28:40,733
Okay.

1147
01:28:40,835 --> 01:28:42,803
- My breath okay?
- Mm-mm.

1148
01:28:42,904 --> 01:28:45,031
Well, you ain't gotta
make that face. Damn.

1149
01:28:45,139 --> 01:28:48,267
Okay. Okay, here.

1150
01:28:48,376 --> 01:28:51,436
- Okay. You think he gonna like my hair?
- Fierce, baby.

1151
01:28:54,515 --> 01:28:57,780
- Um-
- Yes?

1152
01:28:57,885 --> 01:29:01,946
Hi. Are-Are you
Dr. Tunde's wife?

1153
01:29:02,056 --> 01:29:06,550
Yes. Yes. Dr. Tunde.

1154
01:29:06,661 --> 01:29:09,459
Dr. Tunde baby.

1155
01:29:09,564 --> 01:29:13,933
<i>Okay, I don't mean to disrespect</i>
<i>you or your household, ma'am...</i>

1156
01:29:14,035 --> 01:29:16,060
but, um, I'm an old friend
of Tunde's...

1157
01:29:16,170 --> 01:29:19,003
<i>and I traveled here</i>
<i>all the way from America...</i>

1158
01:29:19,107 --> 01:29:22,702
and, um, I just wanted to know
if I could say hi.

1159
01:29:22,810 --> 01:29:25,108
Would that be okay?

1160
01:29:35,156 --> 01:29:40,253
Damn. Hmm. Well, I guess
I won't be needing this.

1161
01:29:44,031 --> 01:29:47,694
Y'all go wait in the cab.
I, uh, want to get rejected in private.

1162
01:29:47,802 --> 01:29:50,862
- You sure? All right.
- Yeah. All right.

1163
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:08,854
- Jazmin?
- Tunde.

1164
01:30:14,095 --> 01:30:17,030
- Am I dreaming?
- No, you're not dreaming.

1165
01:30:17,131 --> 01:30:19,656
Um, I'm really here.

1166
01:30:19,767 --> 01:30:22,895
And I'm sorry to show up
at your home unannounced...

1167
01:30:23,004 --> 01:30:26,201
but I didn't think you would
take my call, so I just-

1168
01:30:26,307 --> 01:30:28,468
<i>I took a chance,</i>
<i>and I thought I'd come by to-</i>

1169
01:30:28,576 --> 01:30:31,943
to see if you can look
at this broken fingernail.

1170
01:30:33,581 --> 01:30:38,985
So you flew 8,000 miles to ask me
to look at a broken fingernail?

1171
01:30:39,086 --> 01:30:42,419
Yeah, because, I mean,
it could get infected.

1172
01:30:42,523 --> 01:30:46,220
And a girlfriend of mine, she had
to get her whole hand amputated.

1173
01:30:46,327 --> 01:30:50,320
Well, maybe that's not
the only reason I came.

1174
01:30:50,431 --> 01:30:55,528
Truth is, Tunde, um,
I flew all this way to- to say I'm sorry.

1175
01:30:55,636 --> 01:30:58,537
<i>And I know it's too late</i>
<i>to win you back...</i>

1176
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:02,040
<i>but I hope you can find it</i>
<i>in your heart to forgive me.</i>

1177
01:31:02,143 --> 01:31:04,805
And I just want you to know
if, uh-

1178
01:31:04,912 --> 01:31:09,576
if you ever regret meeting me,
I don't regret meeting you...

1179
01:31:09,684 --> 01:31:12,414
because it changed my life.

1180
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:18,117
<i>And, Tunde, you helped me see things</i>
<i>that no other man was able to.</i>

1181
01:31:18,226 --> 01:31:22,219
You were offering me so much,
but I didn't love myself...

1182
01:31:22,330 --> 01:31:25,697
<i>and I couldn't understand</i>
<i>why in the hell you wanted me...</i>

1183
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:28,394
so I couldn't love you.

1184
01:31:28,502 --> 01:31:32,302
<i>But thanks to you, Tunde,</i>
<i>I'm- I'm a different person.</i>

1185
01:31:32,406 --> 01:31:35,102
<i>And I hope one day I will-</i>

1186
01:31:35,209 --> 01:31:39,202
I will find another man
as wonderful as you.

1187
01:31:39,313 --> 01:31:41,543
<i>That's all I came to say.</i>

1188
01:31:44,919 --> 01:31:49,117
Jazmin, thank you.

1189
01:31:49,223 --> 01:31:52,784
And tell your wife I am so sorry
for barging in on y'all like that.

1190
01:31:52,893 --> 01:31:55,987
I mean, I may be a lot of things,
but I'm no home wrecker.

1191
01:31:56,097 --> 01:31:57,997
My wife?

1192
01:31:58,099 --> 01:32:00,829
The last time I checked,
I was still a single man.

1193
01:32:00,935 --> 01:32:04,462
The woman that answered
the door ain't your wife?

1194
01:32:04,572 --> 01:32:07,632
Heavens no. She's one
of the housekeepers.

1195
01:32:07,742 --> 01:32:10,609
- And her baby?
<i>- I delivered the baby...</i>

1196
01:32:10,711 --> 01:32:12,838
but had nothing to do
with the conception.

1197
01:32:12,947 --> 01:32:16,610
- But she said-
- Well, I doubt she said much of anything.

1198
01:32:16,717 --> 01:32:19,345
She doesn't even
speak English.

1199
01:32:19,453 --> 01:32:22,013
Hey, y'all,
it was a false alarm!

1200
01:32:22,123 --> 01:32:24,853
He ain't married!
She was the maid! Okay.

1201
01:32:24,959 --> 01:32:30,158
So- So, why ain't no woman
snatched you up yet?

1202
01:32:39,140 --> 01:32:42,041
I was waiting on you,
Jazmin.

1203
01:32:42,143 --> 01:32:45,010
I never stopped
thinking about you.

1204
01:32:45,112 --> 01:32:48,980
I prayed that one day
we would meet again...

1205
01:32:49,083 --> 01:32:53,577
and you will accept how beautiful
you are and let me love you.

1206
01:32:55,656 --> 01:32:59,422
Well, looks like my prayers
have been answered.

1207
01:33:01,929 --> 01:33:05,330
Jazmin, if you will have me-

1208
01:33:05,433 --> 01:33:07,333
Have you?

1209
01:33:08,703 --> 01:33:10,603
Tunde, will you have me?

1210
01:33:15,176 --> 01:33:19,078
<i> Oh, whoa, whoa. whoa!</i>
<i>Consummate! Consummate!</i>

1211
01:33:19,180 --> 01:33:21,944
Y'all get our stuff.
We stayin' awhile.

1212
01:33:22,049 --> 01:33:24,449
Whoo-hoo!

1213
01:33:24,552 --> 01:33:28,181
<i> She needs some</i>
<i>sexual healing, Tunde!</i>

1214
01:33:28,289 --> 01:33:31,019
I think I can
arrange that.

1215
01:33:54,415 --> 01:33:56,849
Let us pray.

1216
01:33:56,951 --> 01:34:00,751
Thank you, Precious Lord,
for this food...

1217
01:34:00,855 --> 01:34:02,755
and for our
visitors here.

1218
01:34:02,857 --> 01:34:05,018
<i>Thank you, Jesus Christi...</i>

1219
01:34:05,126 --> 01:34:10,894
for bringing our American
children safely to their homeland in Africa.

1220
01:34:15,703 --> 01:34:17,603
<i>Bless us all.</i>

1221
01:34:17,705 --> 01:34:21,436
Ashe, ashe, ashe.

1222
01:34:21,542 --> 01:34:24,306
Ashe.

1223
01:34:24,412 --> 01:34:25,776
- Ashe.
- Please help yourselves.

1224
01:34:25,811 --> 01:34:27,141
- Ashe.
- Please help yourselves.

1225
01:34:27,248 --> 01:34:29,739
More food is coming.

1226
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:33,914
Mmm.

1227
01:34:36,405 --> 01:34:38,930
Oh.

1228
01:34:43,545 --> 01:34:46,571
- This is pretty good.
- Child, are you all right?

1229
01:34:46,682 --> 01:34:50,880
- Mm-hmm, I'm good.
- I've never seen you eat
this much food in your life.

1230
01:34:50,986 --> 01:34:54,183
I'm trying to gain me some weight
so I can be a thick Madame too...

1231
01:34:54,289 --> 01:34:55,913
so I can get me a rich
Nigerian doctor.

1232
01:34:55,948 --> 01:34:57,537
so I can get me a rich
Nigerian doctor.

1233
01:34:57,643 --> 01:35:02,137
<i>Pass me some of that fufu he feedin' you.</i>
<i>Can I have some? Are you gonna eat that?</i>

1234
01:35:03,182 --> 01:35:05,082
I am. I need it.

1235
01:35:22,668 --> 01:35:25,364
Wait. Wait.

1236
01:35:30,175 --> 01:35:33,611
- What is it?
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1237
01:35:36,615 --> 01:35:39,140
I have been waiting
far too long...

1238
01:35:39,251 --> 01:35:42,311
for this moment for us
to do it in the dark.

1239
01:35:44,456 --> 01:35:50,019
I want to see
every... sexy...

1240
01:35:50,128 --> 01:35:52,562
bit of you.

1241
01:35:52,664 --> 01:35:55,030
- Yes?
- Yes.

1242
01:35:56,702 --> 01:35:59,762
- But what about them?
- Who?

1243
01:36:00,939 --> 01:36:03,874
Them.

1244
01:36:03,976 --> 01:36:06,103
Oh. Them.

1245
01:36:06,211 --> 01:36:08,179
Uh...

1246
01:36:09,648 --> 01:36:13,982
for all of you freaky-deaky,
nasty-minded voyeurs out there-

1247
01:36:14,086 --> 01:36:16,111
It's <i>voyeur.</i>
It's French.

1248
01:36:16,221 --> 01:36:18,416
Okay, them too.
Y'all too.

1249
01:36:18,523 --> 01:36:23,392
For all of y'all out there wanting to see
Jaz finally get her groove on-

1250
01:36:23,495 --> 01:36:26,293
well, this is PG-13.

1251
01:36:26,398 --> 01:36:28,798
So if you wanna see
some more freaky deaky...

1252
01:36:28,901 --> 01:36:30,201
go home and be
with the one you love.

1253
01:36:30,236 --> 01:36:31,502
go home and be
with the one you love.
