1
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,954
Shit. There's an immobilizer.

2
00:01:00,503 --> 00:01:01,914
Someone doesn't want us to leave.

3
00:01:02,005 --> 00:01:03,380
Oh, man.

4
00:01:03,506 --> 00:01:05,831
I've got a bad feeling about this.

5
00:01:07,176 --> 00:01:08,920
You're not going
to believe this shit.

6
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:12,138
- They've got one in my truck too.
- Well, now what?

7
00:01:13,474 --> 00:01:17,602
What now is,
we wait for bravo unit,

8
00:01:19,063 --> 00:01:20,936
then we all walk out
of here together.

9
00:01:36,454 --> 00:01:38,743
Victor! Victor! Victor!

10
00:01:55,723 --> 00:01:57,098
It's not gonna work.

11
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:02,344
Don't sweat it.
Stay sharp, fellas.

12
00:02:07,526 --> 00:02:08,985
Contact, ten o'clock!

13
00:02:09,278 --> 00:02:10,688
Victor! Victor! Victor!

14
00:02:10,821 --> 00:02:12,612
Hold your fire!

15
00:02:14,908 --> 00:02:17,909
Calm down. What's going on
out there? What's the damage?

16
00:02:17,994 --> 00:02:20,532
We got hit hard.
There are no other survivors.

17
00:02:21,915 --> 00:02:23,243
Okay. Continue on to base,

18
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,041
find Chernov
and tell her what's happened.

19
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,490
Get back-up. Got it?

20
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:28,420
- We got slaughtered.
- Got it!?

21
00:02:28,796 --> 00:02:30,623
- Yes, sir.
- Get moving!

22
00:02:34,802 --> 00:02:38,135
Hit the lights!
Position around the humvee.

23
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,245
Fire!

24
00:03:14,006 --> 00:03:16,544
Cease fire! Cease fire!

25
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:54,660
Is that it!
Is that all you've got!?

26
00:04:56,104 --> 00:04:57,479
Chernov!

27
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,853
Chernov! We need help!

28
00:05:01,609 --> 00:05:02,890
Chernov!

29
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:20,791
That was the last one, Dr. Krieger.

30
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,580
Outstanding.

31
00:05:24,173 --> 00:05:26,960
Absolutely outstanding.

32
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:07,371
Where are the whales, Jack?

33
00:06:07,714 --> 00:06:10,252
This is a whale
watching tour, right?

34
00:06:10,342 --> 00:06:12,418
Well that's funny,
because we scheduled them

35
00:06:12,511 --> 00:06:15,796
to breach over our
boat exactly at 2:45 and...

36
00:06:15,931 --> 00:06:19,015
You promised me whales,
George.

37
00:06:20,101 --> 00:06:22,473
You hear that?
You go get us some whales

38
00:06:22,562 --> 00:06:24,104
or you get us our money back.

39
00:06:24,355 --> 00:06:27,226
I told you, we don't guarantee
you see any whales.

40
00:06:27,358 --> 00:06:28,687
You get your three hours out

41
00:06:28,776 --> 00:06:30,685
like everyone else
and take your chances.

42
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,777
Oh, we're staying out here until
we see some whales.

43
00:06:32,863 --> 00:06:34,239
You might be,

44
00:06:34,365 --> 00:06:36,108
but this boat's going
to be back in the harbor...

45
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,860
at the three hour mark exactly.

46
00:06:37,952 --> 00:06:41,534
What's that accent?
You're German, right?

47
00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:45,833
Well let me tell you something
about American customer service.

48
00:06:46,543 --> 00:06:48,002
We're staying out.

49
00:06:50,047 --> 00:06:51,541
Okay.

50
00:06:51,965 --> 00:06:53,625
Can you come over here?

51
00:06:56,136 --> 00:06:58,093
Can you hold on to this for a sec?

52
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,761
Where are you going?

53
00:07:05,311 --> 00:07:06,853
Anybody want some beer?

54
00:07:12,485 --> 00:07:15,272
George,
what are you doing driving?

55
00:07:15,488 --> 00:07:16,567
What?

56
00:07:21,702 --> 00:07:26,031
Hey, and watch out for those rocks.
They're pretty sharp and big.

57
00:07:32,754 --> 00:07:34,296
We're alright, Jack.

58
00:07:34,965 --> 00:07:36,210
Take us back.

59
00:07:36,341 --> 00:07:39,010
But, George,
what about the whales?

60
00:07:39,135 --> 00:07:41,044
You wanna see a damn whale,
you drive the boat

61
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,385
- George.
- This was your idea.

62
00:07:45,516 --> 00:07:50,012
This was not my idea.
You blame everything on me.

63
00:07:50,104 --> 00:07:51,847
You're the one who bought all
that picture-book stuff

64
00:07:51,981 --> 00:07:54,686
with whales on it for Christmas.
You gave it to me,

65
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:55,938
but you wanted it for yourself...

66
00:07:56,026 --> 00:07:57,818
You blame everything on me.

67
00:07:57,903 --> 00:07:59,184
- You couldn't stop...
- You're the one who made us...

68
00:07:59,321 --> 00:08:01,563
- talking about the whales.
- Sign up for Greenpeace.

69
00:08:18,757 --> 00:08:20,215
Chernov.

70
00:08:21,885 --> 00:08:25,336
- Good work last night, Katia.
- Thank you, doctor.

71
00:08:25,847 --> 00:08:27,507
And they were some
of your best men.

72
00:08:28,057 --> 00:08:29,386
The best money can buy.

73
00:08:31,435 --> 00:08:33,013
Doctor,

74
00:08:33,104 --> 00:08:34,646
why wasn't I informed about
the maneuvers...

75
00:08:34,772 --> 00:08:36,100
outside the perimeter?

76
00:08:36,732 --> 00:08:38,606
Because it was part of research.

77
00:08:38,734 --> 00:08:41,854
Anything that takes place
outside on this island

78
00:08:41,987 --> 00:08:44,193
is a security matter
that concerns me.

79
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,529
Captain,
I didn't want to trouble you.

80
00:08:47,117 --> 00:08:50,403
I knew how you
would feel about testing.

81
00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:52,538
Testing?

82
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:56,164
Yes.
Our subject engaged live targets.

83
00:08:58,962 --> 00:09:00,753
You mean you tested him
on my men.

84
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:04,707
One unarmed,
genetically modified soldier

85
00:09:04,926 --> 00:09:07,677
eliminated ten
heavy-armed men.

86
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,432
This is, um...

87
00:09:12,767 --> 00:09:15,970
This is way beyond anything
the command would authorize.

88
00:09:16,103 --> 00:09:19,472
Captain,
they're not even your men.

89
00:09:20,983 --> 00:09:22,726
They're Chernov's people.

90
00:09:23,819 --> 00:09:26,571
All of those genetically
modified soldiers,

91
00:09:26,697 --> 00:09:28,903
or whatever you want
to call those creatures,

92
00:09:29,825 --> 00:09:31,901
were all once human.

93
00:09:32,202 --> 00:09:34,278
Yes, that's right.

94
00:09:35,747 --> 00:09:38,452
Now, if you would excuse me,

95
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,789
I have to finish my painting.

96
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,098
Chernov,
is he back in his holding pen?

97
00:09:56,475 --> 00:09:59,013
Yes. The time-released tranquilizer
worked perfectly.

98
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:03,147
Good. You know, if Parker wants
to get that much involved,

99
00:10:03,524 --> 00:10:07,901
why don't you have him and
his men clean up all the mess?

100
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,361
I'm not sure how much more
of this I can stomach.

101
00:10:14,951 --> 00:10:17,276
You mean having that hard bitch
as your boss?

102
00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:19,954
You know well enough
what I mean.

103
00:10:20,457 --> 00:10:22,116
Yeah, well I have my orders,

104
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,078
but you have a choice, Max.

105
00:10:24,669 --> 00:10:26,293
Why don't you just leave?

106
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:29,961
I keep thinking I can do more
good by staying. We'll see.

107
00:10:33,219 --> 00:10:35,425
Not much of a killer instinct
for a soldier.

108
00:10:35,638 --> 00:10:38,176
Yeah, well maybe he'll send you
out there next time.

109
00:10:42,603 --> 00:10:44,761
Don't you think
it's a little farfetched

110
00:10:44,897 --> 00:10:48,312
- genetically modified soldiers?
- I've got it from a good source.

111
00:10:50,736 --> 00:10:52,146
Nice.

112
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:55,448
You know, it looks like something
from your sasquatch file.

113
00:10:55,573 --> 00:10:56,854
Very funny.

114
00:10:56,992 --> 00:11:00,277
It's a surveillance photo taken
outside Krieger's research facility.

115
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,779
I don't need to tell you
how much trouble you can...

116
00:11:02,872 --> 00:11:05,541
get into snooping around
military affairs, do I?

117
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,157
That's just the thing. All my
usual sources say there's no...

118
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:10,459
official military installation
on that island.

119
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:12,748
This is from another source.

120
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:16,251
Gorgeous shot of a lumber mill.

121
00:11:16,886 --> 00:11:18,214
Who are these guys?

122
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:20,926
Okay,

123
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,465
so maybe it's super covert.

124
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:26,299
That's all the more reason not
to go snooping around.

125
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,144
Paul, Krieger has been known

126
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,938
to perform genetic experiments
on humans.

127
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,722
Now he resurfaces on an island
secured by soldiers.

128
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,944
Valerie, I trust your intuition,

129
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,856
but I am not going to have you
follow up on this lead.

130
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:39,270
Do you understand?

131
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,401
Fine, I'll do it on my own time.

132
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:45,447
What time? You work
fourteen hours a day on this paper.

133
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,116
I'll take some vacation then

134
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,783
You? Vacation?

135
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,749
I must have a few
weeks banked, right?

136
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,333
Why are you so determined
to follow this lead?

137
00:11:55,422 --> 00:11:57,498
Because it's too good
of a story to pass up.

138
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,498
Paul.

139
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,544
Besides,
I've got a personal interest.

140
00:12:23,074 --> 00:12:24,449
General.

141
00:12:25,868 --> 00:12:27,493
- General.
- Doctor.

142
00:12:27,578 --> 00:12:29,701
I'm assuming you've got
something interesting to show me.

143
00:12:29,872 --> 00:12:32,363
See for yourself. Parker.

144
00:12:42,301 --> 00:12:43,925
Please.

145
00:12:58,358 --> 00:12:59,686
Please.

146
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:09,947
As you can see, General,
your money was put to good use.

147
00:13:10,036 --> 00:13:12,990
Doctor, I couldn't care
about fancy facilities.

148
00:13:13,164 --> 00:13:15,619
What I care about is your results.

149
00:13:17,418 --> 00:13:20,372
I'm positive
that you'll be satisfied.

150
00:13:20,504 --> 00:13:21,915
We'll see about that.

151
00:13:23,715 --> 00:13:25,423
See for yourself.

152
00:13:31,389 --> 00:13:32,932
He looks fit.

153
00:13:34,976 --> 00:13:38,641
We have ten holding cells.

154
00:13:40,398 --> 00:13:43,849
And now I have to show you
something really incredible.

155
00:13:47,613 --> 00:13:51,362
Here's one we took the liberty
of field testing ourselves.

156
00:13:56,539 --> 00:13:57,914
Chernov,

157
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,700
the gun.

158
00:14:02,795 --> 00:14:05,368
- Shoot him.
- Shoot him?

159
00:14:05,505 --> 00:14:07,961
Yes, but be careful.
Not in the eyes...

160
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,544
and not in the mouth.

161
00:14:24,816 --> 00:14:27,567
- Subcutaneous armor?
- The skin itself,

162
00:14:27,693 --> 00:14:30,896
twenty times more resistant
to puncture than Kevlar.

163
00:14:30,988 --> 00:14:35,531
His muscles absorb the blows
and protect his organs.

164
00:14:36,285 --> 00:14:38,692
Let him loose.
Let's see how he moves.

165
00:14:38,787 --> 00:14:41,574
I cannot do that
without sedating him.

166
00:14:41,707 --> 00:14:44,494
He would kill everybody
in this room including me.

167
00:14:44,626 --> 00:14:46,251
Are you saying
that you can't control him?

168
00:14:46,378 --> 00:14:48,869
I can control him,
but I have to work on his?

169
00:14:49,005 --> 00:14:51,627
What good is that,
a weapon that we can't control?

170
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:54,331
You can use him under certain
circumstances for...

171
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:57,298
That's not what we commissioned
from you, doctor.

172
00:14:57,388 --> 00:14:59,962
You asked me to create
an invincible soldier.

173
00:15:00,058 --> 00:15:02,134
That's what I'm presenting
to you today.

174
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:03,893
Basically bulletproof,

175
00:15:04,354 --> 00:15:05,978
no need for sleep,

176
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:09,723
and he can fight harder and longer
than any human soldier.

177
00:15:09,817 --> 00:15:14,942
A soldier? You're making
brainless monsters!

178
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,240
Sedate him!

179
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:27,620
More!

180
00:15:33,757 --> 00:15:37,457
If he can't take orders then he's
no better than a vicious animal.

181
00:15:38,011 --> 00:15:39,505
But some more time

182
00:15:39,637 --> 00:15:41,796
- and some more money.
- No more funding...

183
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:44,012
until you produce something
that we can use.

184
00:16:03,702 --> 00:16:05,113
Chernov.

185
00:16:05,454 --> 00:16:06,912
Working late, Max?

186
00:16:16,297 --> 00:16:17,708
Hey, Uncle Max, it's me.

187
00:16:17,841 --> 00:16:19,383
I thought I'd leave you
a voice mail

188
00:16:19,467 --> 00:16:21,507
just in case you were
picking up your messages.

189
00:16:21,594 --> 00:16:23,836
I responded to your last email,
but I never heard anything back.

190
00:16:23,971 --> 00:16:25,252
I just wanted to check...

191
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:28,723
if we were still meeting
at that spot that you sent me.

192
00:16:28,976 --> 00:16:31,811
Anyway, I'm heading up now,
so I'll see you soon.

193
00:16:38,986 --> 00:16:41,228
Hi, this is...
Valerie Cardinal calling.

194
00:16:42,364 --> 00:16:44,570
I'm calling to confirm that
you were able to get that...

195
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,237
boat captain that
I requested... Jack Carver.

196
00:16:47,786 --> 00:16:49,363
That's right.

197
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,943
Terrific.

198
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:52,747
I'll be up there in a few hours.

199
00:16:52,874 --> 00:16:54,831
- Thank you.
- See you soon.

200
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,121
- Ralph,
- What?

201
00:16:57,212 --> 00:17:00,296
You made sure to tell jack
about the client today, right?

202
00:17:00,381 --> 00:17:02,457
- He knows.
- He should be on the dock,

203
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,507
fueling up and preparing by now.

204
00:17:05,136 --> 00:17:07,805
I thought I saw him going
in to the Golden Spruce last night.

205
00:17:08,097 --> 00:17:10,220
That wouldn't be too unlike him.

206
00:17:11,934 --> 00:17:13,559
Well his boat is just sitting
out over there.

207
00:17:13,644 --> 00:17:15,767
Do you see him on deck?

208
00:17:17,731 --> 00:17:18,762
No, pet, I don't.

209
00:17:18,857 --> 00:17:21,265
Which means he's probably
sleeping it off.

210
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,474
He could be.

211
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:24,397
Well, aren't you going
to go get him up?

212
00:17:24,488 --> 00:17:25,816
Hey, look, he'll be here.

213
00:17:25,947 --> 00:17:28,106
I'm not going to have a captain
represent us,

214
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,869
showing up unshaven
and hung over for a client!

215
00:17:30,952 --> 00:17:32,150
Get him up!

216
00:17:32,287 --> 00:17:33,781
Yes, Pet.

217
00:17:40,211 --> 00:17:43,129
Medusa, Medusa,
this is Day Beacon, over.

218
00:17:46,342 --> 00:17:50,174
Medusa, Medusa, wakey-wakey.
This is Day Beacon, over.

219
00:17:52,431 --> 00:17:54,091
Shit.

220
00:18:49,945 --> 00:18:51,487
Turn his head.

221
00:18:54,783 --> 00:18:56,574
Slowly, slowly.

222
00:19:01,205 --> 00:19:02,949
Max,

223
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:06,201
can you hear me?

224
00:19:10,673 --> 00:19:12,915
- Camera's working.
- Yes, sir, it is.

225
00:19:13,551 --> 00:19:14,831
Max,

226
00:19:15,344 --> 00:19:17,882
can you hear me?

227
00:19:20,557 --> 00:19:22,051
Light.

228
00:19:26,355 --> 00:19:28,014
Max,

229
00:19:29,566 --> 00:19:31,357
what color?

230
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:34,110
Red.

231
00:19:34,362 --> 00:19:35,904
Perfect.

232
00:19:39,033 --> 00:19:40,825
And now?

233
00:19:42,495 --> 00:19:45,247
- Green.
- Perfect. Perfect.

234
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,164
Take the light.

235
00:19:48,084 --> 00:19:51,369
Max. Max, I think
you're going to earn us...

236
00:19:51,504 --> 00:19:53,496
the rest of our funding.

237
00:19:55,549 --> 00:19:57,091
Good, good, good, good.

238
00:19:57,384 --> 00:19:59,543
- Stitch him up.
- Yes, doctor.

239
00:20:06,935 --> 00:20:08,762
She'll be here soon.

240
00:20:09,729 --> 00:20:12,351
Maybe you should take
the skiff out and check in on him.

241
00:20:13,191 --> 00:20:16,062
You know he doesn't like
people dropping in on him.

242
00:20:16,194 --> 00:20:18,233
Ralph, you're his boss.

243
00:20:18,363 --> 00:20:20,486
Well, technically,
he's a contractor.

244
00:20:20,823 --> 00:20:22,899
What? Are you scared of him?

245
00:20:23,034 --> 00:20:26,699
Pet, you've heard all the stories.

246
00:20:26,829 --> 00:20:29,118
That's all they are, stories.

247
00:20:29,206 --> 00:20:31,532
Special army my ass.
He's a drunk.

248
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,784
Just because he drinks
doesn't mean he's a drunk.

249
00:20:34,086 --> 00:20:36,328
It's special forces, pet,
not special army.

250
00:20:36,463 --> 00:20:37,792
Whatever.

251
00:20:39,091 --> 00:20:42,839
If you're not going to do anything,
I will. I'm gonna go get my gun.

252
00:20:45,681 --> 00:20:47,305
Menopause.

253
00:21:23,467 --> 00:21:24,877
Reload.

254
00:21:25,344 --> 00:21:27,834
I don't think you should be
playing with him like this Pat.

255
00:21:27,971 --> 00:21:30,094
Well, if he's as tough
as you all think...

256
00:21:30,181 --> 00:21:32,221
he is he should be able to handle
a little shooting.

257
00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:34,100
Someone could get hurt.

258
00:21:34,227 --> 00:21:38,556
I mean you could take out
an eye or something.

259
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:48,861
Special army my ass.

260
00:21:49,116 --> 00:21:52,948
Hi. Is this...
Day Beacon Boat Charters?

261
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:57,076
- Yes it is and you must be Valerie.
- Hi.

262
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:00,120
Hi. I hope I won't be needing one
of those where I'm going.

263
00:22:01,128 --> 00:22:04,247
Hey, we've got some
paperwork to do. Come on in.

264
00:22:49,716 --> 00:22:51,091
Keep flipping those, will ya?

265
00:22:51,593 --> 00:22:55,341
I didn't realize the tour
came with a meal.

266
00:22:56,598 --> 00:22:58,140
We head straight
back after lunch.

267
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,677
How much to charter
your boat for the night?

268
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:03,930
For the night?
We are not that kind of operation.

269
00:23:04,021 --> 00:23:06,097
You chartered me for six hours,
okay?

270
00:23:06,941 --> 00:23:08,352
Jack, did you serve in Germany

271
00:23:08,484 --> 00:23:10,642
with a man by the name
of Max Cardinal?

272
00:23:14,114 --> 00:23:17,448
- Who said I was in the services?
- Max is my uncle.

273
00:23:18,994 --> 00:23:21,829
Very sorry, but I don't know
anybody by that name.

274
00:23:22,456 --> 00:23:25,207
He said he was really glad to run
into you after he came out here.

275
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:29,746
Did he? I really don't know
the guy you're talking about.

276
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,040
Tischtennis.

277
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:34,424
What?

278
00:23:34,551 --> 00:23:36,958
Tischtennis.
That was your safe word.

279
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,304
So you're his niece, huh?

280
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:43,013
That would make you
the hotshot reporter.

281
00:23:43,601 --> 00:23:45,640
I prefer journalist.

282
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:48,521
Right.
What brings you out here?

283
00:23:48,606 --> 00:23:50,100
I'm meeting with Max.

284
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,440
- Where, on that island?
- Yeah.

285
00:23:53,819 --> 00:23:56,061
That island's off limits
to the public.

286
00:23:56,155 --> 00:23:58,859
Everyone around here knows
to stay well away from it.

287
00:23:58,991 --> 00:24:00,153
They're expecting me.

288
00:24:00,284 --> 00:24:02,691
Right. That's why you
chartered your own boat

289
00:24:02,828 --> 00:24:04,536
for a little night landing, huh?

290
00:24:04,663 --> 00:24:06,572
It's a personal visit.

291
00:24:09,876 --> 00:24:12,545
- Are you going to take me or not?
- No I won't.

292
00:24:12,837 --> 00:24:14,664
Max would understand why.

293
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:16,422
Did Max tell you what
they're doing over there?

294
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:19,087
- No.
- You're not curious?

295
00:24:19,385 --> 00:24:22,007
I'm curious how that fish
is going to turn out.

296
00:24:22,263 --> 00:24:24,505
It's almost done.

297
00:24:26,475 --> 00:24:28,219
I think Max might be in trouble.

298
00:24:28,352 --> 00:24:31,270
That man is perfectly capable
of taking care of himself.

299
00:24:31,438 --> 00:24:32,933
He set up this meeting.

300
00:24:33,023 --> 00:24:35,693
He sent me a message and
I haven't heard from him since.

301
00:24:37,069 --> 00:24:38,397
He found out that his client...

302
00:24:38,529 --> 00:24:40,320
was doing something
that he didn't like.

303
00:24:40,906 --> 00:24:43,112
Your uncle doesn't like things,
he'd quit.

304
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,991
I asked him to stay on.

305
00:24:46,411 --> 00:24:48,653
You're writing a little story, huh?

306
00:25:00,008 --> 00:25:02,083
That money will buy you
a ride exactly...

307
00:25:02,218 --> 00:25:04,092
to the island and back.
That's it.

308
00:25:05,888 --> 00:25:08,461
So much for camaraderie
between soldiers.

309
00:25:10,351 --> 00:25:12,142
Hey, your fish is cooked.

310
00:25:12,645 --> 00:25:14,388
Let's see.

311
00:25:20,235 --> 00:25:22,311
This is burnt.

312
00:25:22,696 --> 00:25:25,401
- They're crispy.
- Crispy?

313
00:26:14,621 --> 00:26:15,996
No sign of anyone.

314
00:26:16,331 --> 00:26:19,415
Max wanted me to meet him up
on the landing, in the woods.

315
00:26:19,917 --> 00:26:21,875
Why didn't he want
to meet you up on the pier?

316
00:26:22,086 --> 00:26:24,957
I don't know. Like I said,

317
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:27,128
all I got was the last message.

318
00:26:29,135 --> 00:26:30,712
Wanna come with me?

319
00:26:30,845 --> 00:26:34,972
No. I can take you to the shore,
but that's about it.

320
00:26:35,766 --> 00:26:38,435
- Okay.
- You sure you wanna go?

321
00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:41,853
Yeah. Max is waiting for me.

322
00:26:43,607 --> 00:26:45,398
Fine.

323
00:26:52,365 --> 00:26:55,615
- I can take you back.
- No. Let's go.

324
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:09,552
Here, take this.

325
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:13,398
- Thank you.
- I'm giving you exactly six hours.

326
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:16,436
You better be
here when I get back.

327
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:22,983
You better be
here when I get back.

328
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,801
Max?

329
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,976
Max?

330
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,599
Max?

331
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:01,777
Miss Cardinal,
welcome to the party.

332
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,478
Let's go.

333
00:29:04,408 --> 00:29:07,279
- Get rid of the boat.
- My pleasure.

334
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,703
You're late.

335
00:30:06,009 --> 00:30:07,634
Check her body.

336
00:30:09,763 --> 00:30:12,680
I hope you didn't leave anything
important on that boat.

337
00:30:13,516 --> 00:30:15,390
You just killed a man.

338
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,683
I'd be more concerned
about yourself.

339
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:23,359
- What have you done with Max?
- You'll see soon enough.

340
00:30:32,284 --> 00:30:35,783
I don't know why we're bothering.
The guy's dead. Bitch.

341
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:39,698
You go that way.
I'll check over here.

342
00:30:57,183 --> 00:30:59,591
- Chernov.
- Docter I have her.

343
00:30:59,936 --> 00:31:01,134
Good.

344
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:04,520
I'm checking for survivors. I'll be
back with the reporter shortly.

345
00:31:39,098 --> 00:31:40,758
Russell.

346
00:31:41,893 --> 00:31:43,173
Russell.

347
00:31:46,939 --> 00:31:48,599
Where are those guys?

348
00:32:08,835 --> 00:32:10,578
Check the wood line, nine o'clock.

349
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:13,873
- Yes sir. Go.
- Move! Move! / clear.

350
00:32:23,182 --> 00:32:25,175
We've lost contact
with Russell and Kyle.

351
00:32:25,267 --> 00:32:28,767
- Send a backup team.
- 10-4. Backup team on the way.

352
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:58,004
Go after them!

353
00:32:58,633 --> 00:33:02,084
- Go! Go!
- Go!

354
00:33:06,057 --> 00:33:08,512
Go! Go! Go! Here we up.

355
00:33:08,684 --> 00:33:11,389
- I'm handcuffed.
- Wait a second.

356
00:33:12,646 --> 00:33:15,315
- Universal handcuff key.
- Where'd you get that?

357
00:33:15,649 --> 00:33:18,270
Never leave home without one.
Turn around.

358
00:33:22,697 --> 00:33:25,485
- Uh-oh. Here they come.
- Stop them.

359
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:32,322
- Here, do it yourself.
- Great. Thanks.

360
00:33:32,457 --> 00:33:33,702
Are you okay?

361
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,043
- Okay.
- I'm great.

362
00:33:56,063 --> 00:33:57,687
Come on.

363
00:34:05,822 --> 00:34:07,316
Let's go.

364
00:34:24,173 --> 00:34:25,584
Got it!

365
00:34:39,688 --> 00:34:41,312
Holy shit!

366
00:34:42,315 --> 00:34:44,641
- How about pitching in a little?
- I'm trying.

367
00:34:44,985 --> 00:34:46,977
Try harder, please.

368
00:35:09,925 --> 00:35:11,170
More help?

369
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:17,304
- What are these?
- Well that's sweet.

370
00:35:17,641 --> 00:35:19,883
It's called a hand grenade.
Try throwing one.

371
00:35:25,607 --> 00:35:27,564
- It didn't work.
- Did you pull the pin?

372
00:35:28,068 --> 00:35:29,859
They're useless with the pin.

373
00:35:33,656 --> 00:35:35,150
Hurry up!

374
00:35:39,287 --> 00:35:41,956
- Did you throw it?
- Uh, yeah.

375
00:35:53,467 --> 00:35:55,376
Wooo! Yeah.

376
00:36:01,767 --> 00:36:03,973
- What's happening?
- Oh no.

377
00:36:05,979 --> 00:36:07,888
Please tell me you have something
else back there.

378
00:36:07,981 --> 00:36:09,179
I'm trying.

379
00:36:09,858 --> 00:36:12,265
Hey, what's this thing?

380
00:36:22,244 --> 00:36:24,996
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.

381
00:36:25,122 --> 00:36:26,664
What do you mean
you don't know?

382
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:29,073
Look out!

383
00:36:38,552 --> 00:36:40,343
You've gotta be kidding me.

384
00:36:56,778 --> 00:36:58,854
Come on. Come on.

385
00:37:38,067 --> 00:37:40,854
Start the search.
I want confirmation they're dead.

386
00:38:32,828 --> 00:38:34,986
Let's go inside.

387
00:38:47,342 --> 00:38:49,002
Are you hurt?

388
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:09,810
You've been shot.

389
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,900
That's just a scratch.

390
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:23,411
You better get out
of those wet clothes.

391
00:39:25,003 --> 00:39:26,545
Okay.

392
00:39:27,505 --> 00:39:29,249
Turn around.

393
00:40:12,006 --> 00:40:15,043
Okay,
you can turn around now.

394
00:40:15,968 --> 00:40:17,213
Thanks.

395
00:40:18,638 --> 00:40:20,796
I told you Max is in trouble.

396
00:40:21,974 --> 00:40:23,599
It's my fault he stayed though.

397
00:40:24,351 --> 00:40:26,724
I convinced him I could take
the story public.

398
00:40:26,854 --> 00:40:28,681
It was his decision to stay.

399
00:40:32,985 --> 00:40:34,265
What do we do now?

400
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:37,737
That's easy.
Get off this island.

401
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,612
I told you, I'm not leaving
without finding Max.

402
00:40:42,327 --> 00:40:45,612
You can get us into the mill
to look for him

403
00:40:45,747 --> 00:40:48,867
No. You hired me
as a water captain.

404
00:40:48,958 --> 00:40:51,449
Shore excursions aren't
part of the deal.

405
00:40:52,045 --> 00:40:54,084
Don't you ever think
about anybody...

406
00:40:54,172 --> 00:40:55,998
except yourself and money.

407
00:40:57,717 --> 00:40:59,341
Did I mention you owe me a boat.

408
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:08,350
Oh, it's cold.

409
00:41:11,814 --> 00:41:13,771
I think I'm getting hypothermia.

410
00:41:17,736 --> 00:41:19,444
Can I come in?

411
00:41:22,157 --> 00:41:23,699
Okay.

412
00:41:23,825 --> 00:41:29,199
Good. I have to take off
my wet pants, you know.

413
00:41:29,998 --> 00:41:31,540
Turn around.

414
00:42:02,028 --> 00:42:04,566
This bed's very uncomfortable,

415
00:42:04,698 --> 00:42:08,113
- itchy.
- Sorry, the Hyatt was booked out.

416
00:42:13,414 --> 00:42:16,285
- It's cold.
- Yeah.

417
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:26,667
You know what we used
to do in the military?

418
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:29,968
No. What?

419
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:36,593
It was called shared body heat.

420
00:42:39,898 --> 00:42:41,273
Like spooning?

421
00:42:42,859 --> 00:42:46,643
- You could say so.
- Okay.

422
00:43:00,209 --> 00:43:02,665
Much better.

423
00:43:06,924 --> 00:43:08,299
Is that your gun.

424
00:43:11,345 --> 00:43:15,674
Well I never
go to bed without it.

425
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,011
Gone.

426
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:42,414
So, how was I?

427
00:43:44,543 --> 00:43:45,872
Where are we headed?

428
00:43:47,254 --> 00:43:49,543
There's a dock by the mill
on the other side of the island.

429
00:43:49,673 --> 00:43:50,871
We're going to grab a boat there.

430
00:43:51,008 --> 00:43:52,751
I told you,
I'm not leaving without Max.

431
00:43:52,843 --> 00:43:54,385
Don't start again.

432
00:43:54,511 --> 00:43:56,753
We're going to get a boat
and leave this island.

433
00:44:01,142 --> 00:44:02,637
You didn't answer my question.

434
00:44:03,395 --> 00:44:04,557
What do you mean?

435
00:44:04,896 --> 00:44:06,059
What do I mean?

436
00:44:06,731 --> 00:44:09,304
On a scale from one to ten,
how would you rate me?

437
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:14,775
Two.

438
00:44:15,156 --> 00:44:17,528
Two? A two?

439
00:44:17,867 --> 00:44:19,112
What?

440
00:44:26,166 --> 00:44:27,661
Am I seeing this?

441
00:44:32,756 --> 00:44:34,215
I'm gonna check it out.

442
00:44:45,185 --> 00:44:46,465
Get your hands up.

443
00:44:51,816 --> 00:44:53,275
Get 'em up.

444
00:44:56,404 --> 00:44:57,946
You're coming back
to base camp.

445
00:45:08,457 --> 00:45:09,916
Undress.

446
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:24,007
I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to her.

447
00:45:28,685 --> 00:45:31,354
You wish, huh? I was kidding.

448
00:45:33,523 --> 00:45:34,898
Keep going.

449
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,394
I was really only a two.

450
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:41,904
Okay, a three.

451
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:48,947
Hat.

452
00:46:12,101 --> 00:46:14,010
Yes sir.

453
00:46:16,189 --> 00:46:17,980
Parker,
we need two of your trucks.

454
00:46:18,232 --> 00:46:21,352
Yeah? Well I heard
what happened last night.

455
00:46:21,694 --> 00:46:24,101
Why don't you leave
island security to us

456
00:46:24,196 --> 00:46:26,402
and you just stick
to what you're good at,

457
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:29,658
- whatever that is.
- Just give me those trucks.

458
00:46:30,786 --> 00:46:33,075
- I need a word with you.
- Oh.

459
00:46:33,413 --> 00:46:35,869
Being cannon fodder for mutants
was never part of the deal

460
00:46:35,999 --> 00:46:37,743
and there have been
a lot of us dying lately.

461
00:46:38,251 --> 00:46:40,043
We compensate you well enough,

462
00:46:40,378 --> 00:46:42,371
so you'll whatever
we tell you to do.

463
00:46:42,505 --> 00:46:46,088
And if we're dead,
you won't have to pay us at all.

464
00:46:46,468 --> 00:46:47,796
You don't like it you can leave.

465
00:46:47,927 --> 00:46:50,216
Yeah? Well I'll take
what I know with me.

466
00:46:54,517 --> 00:46:56,556
You'll be sorry for this.

467
00:47:05,361 --> 00:47:07,021
Anymore complaints?

468
00:48:21,517 --> 00:48:23,095
Come on. It's clear.

469
00:48:27,523 --> 00:48:29,729
- Oww.
- You're my prisoner.

470
00:48:55,424 --> 00:48:57,382
Okay. Inside.

471
00:49:00,805 --> 00:49:02,762
You wait here
and I'll get us a boat.

472
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:04,218
I told you, I'm not going.

473
00:49:04,516 --> 00:49:07,090
Your ride is leaving now, whether
you're on it or not.

474
00:49:07,436 --> 00:49:08,716
I mean it.

475
00:49:08,896 --> 00:49:10,176
Not without Max.

476
00:49:11,857 --> 00:49:13,268
I'm going to bring the boat here

477
00:49:13,358 --> 00:49:15,102
and you better be
here when I'm back.

478
00:49:17,404 --> 00:49:19,527
You better be
here when I'm back.

479
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,130
Dr. Krieger,

480
00:49:44,221 --> 00:49:45,550
you might want to see this.

481
00:49:49,017 --> 00:49:50,476
Look at this.

482
00:49:55,107 --> 00:49:56,649
Is that her?

483
00:49:57,067 --> 00:49:58,395
Yes.

484
00:50:00,237 --> 00:50:02,028
I thought she was dead.

485
00:50:02,322 --> 00:50:04,647
- She soon will be.
- Chernov,

486
00:50:05,909 --> 00:50:07,533
I want to speak to her.

487
00:50:07,911 --> 00:50:09,654
Yes, sir.

488
00:50:16,377 --> 00:50:17,836
Up.

489
00:50:39,941 --> 00:50:42,064
Take her to the cell
until the doctor's ready.

490
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:50,277
Why couldn't they load
this up on the main dock,

491
00:50:50,368 --> 00:50:53,452
huh? Tell me that. Then we
could have used the forklift.

492
00:50:53,788 --> 00:50:57,204
Now we have to hump
all these ourselves.

493
00:50:57,291 --> 00:50:58,750
This is ridiculous!

494
00:51:01,045 --> 00:51:02,753
Oh, my back.

495
00:51:03,088 --> 00:51:07,038
Oh, my back.
I think I compressed a disc.

496
00:51:08,135 --> 00:51:09,677
Forget this.

497
00:51:10,512 --> 00:51:12,090
I'm taking a break.

498
00:51:13,098 --> 00:51:19,017
Oh. Oh.

499
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:22,806
I wouldn't be sitting down
if I were you.

500
00:51:22,899 --> 00:51:24,773
You don't want the commandant
to catch you. Come on.

501
00:51:25,068 --> 00:51:29,480
What the hell do I care?
Because of that tight-ass?

502
00:51:29,614 --> 00:51:32,947
- What, am I a soldier?
- No!

503
00:51:33,284 --> 00:51:35,822
- Whatever, man.
- Whatever, man.

504
00:51:35,953 --> 00:51:37,910
Oh, shit.

505
00:51:50,843 --> 00:51:56,963
I've been thinking about
you all day, all day.

506
00:52:02,854 --> 00:52:04,478
That's good.

507
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:14,524
Okay?

508
00:52:14,907 --> 00:52:17,445
Okay? Okay?

509
00:52:28,629 --> 00:52:31,464
Oh, my back! Oh, my back! Oh.

510
00:52:33,008 --> 00:52:34,467
I was a goner.

511
00:52:34,634 --> 00:52:37,552
Oh my god. You saved my life!
You saved my life!

512
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:40,170
- Oh my god. I was...
- It's okay.

513
00:52:40,682 --> 00:52:41,595
Who the hell are you anyway?

514
00:52:41,683 --> 00:52:43,474
What are you doing sneaking up
on me like that?

515
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,644
Hey! What are you two doing?

516
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:50,311
Who are you?

517
00:52:51,442 --> 00:52:53,649
Answer me.
I said who are you?

518
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:58,233
I'm the food guy.
I'm the food guy

519
00:52:58,532 --> 00:53:01,699
- I came for a friend, one of yours.
- Who?

520
00:53:01,785 --> 00:53:03,030
Max Cardinal.

521
00:53:03,329 --> 00:53:05,570
He's a good man, but he's gone.

522
00:53:05,706 --> 00:53:07,117
What do you mean he's gone?

523
00:53:07,791 --> 00:53:10,282
He got caught spying
and he's as good as dead.

524
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:13,415
Get back.

525
00:53:15,298 --> 00:53:17,836
Oh, my back. Oh. My back.

526
00:53:18,593 --> 00:53:20,301
- Get him off the boat.
- Hey,

527
00:53:20,428 --> 00:53:23,050
there's someone down here!
He's got Parker!

528
00:53:27,894 --> 00:53:29,008
Oh my god!

529
00:53:32,815 --> 00:53:35,851
Where are we going?

530
00:55:32,472 --> 00:55:33,882
Keep going!

531
00:55:40,104 --> 00:55:42,392
- We got him.
- Oh, no.

532
00:56:02,083 --> 00:56:04,206
Hold! Stop the boat!

533
00:56:14,553 --> 00:56:17,757
- What's your name?
- Jack.

534
00:56:18,182 --> 00:56:19,724
I'm Emilio.

535
00:56:20,768 --> 00:56:22,013
Nice to meet you.

536
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:24,928
You owe me a meatball sandwich.

537
00:56:36,449 --> 00:56:38,608
So, you are the cause
of our recent troubles.

538
00:56:38,952 --> 00:56:41,739
Tell you what. Replace my boat
and we'll call it even.

539
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,325
Who sent you?

540
00:56:44,332 --> 00:56:45,791
I'm just a driver.

541
00:56:45,917 --> 00:56:48,918
I see.
You're just a simple boatman.

542
00:56:49,212 --> 00:56:50,706
Is that your story?

543
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,122
I haven't said anything
about being simple.

544
00:56:53,216 --> 00:56:54,330
Whatever.

545
00:56:54,675 --> 00:56:55,790
We have your colleague

546
00:56:55,885 --> 00:56:58,091
and I'm sure
she will have much more to say.

547
00:56:58,471 --> 00:57:01,258
That's great. So you won't
be needing me then.

548
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:03,383
That's correct. I don't need you,

549
00:57:03,726 --> 00:57:06,726
but as you're here
I may as well use you

550
00:57:07,062 --> 00:57:09,434
to be part of my new experiment.

551
00:57:09,565 --> 00:57:10,845
See you then.

552
00:57:18,448 --> 00:57:20,939
Well I think that went quite well,
don't you?

553
00:57:21,076 --> 00:57:23,033
He wasn't looking at me,
was he?

554
00:57:23,369 --> 00:57:25,409
He was just talking
about you, right?

555
00:57:33,796 --> 00:57:36,750
You mind if we sit?

556
00:57:37,133 --> 00:57:39,588
I have a feeling this
is going to take a while.

557
00:57:39,677 --> 00:57:40,922
Sure.

558
00:57:41,303 --> 00:57:44,138
On three. I used to do this
in dance camp.

559
00:57:44,306 --> 00:57:47,177
One, two, three.

560
00:57:50,979 --> 00:57:53,731
Except we weren't cuffed
in dance camp.

561
00:58:03,324 --> 00:58:04,866
So, uh...

562
00:58:07,161 --> 00:58:09,569
you ever have anything
like this ever happen

563
00:58:09,664 --> 00:58:12,581
to you and you get out
of the situation or

564
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:16,582
anything remotely like this?

565
00:58:21,759 --> 00:58:25,756
I wanted to die fast, you know,
like by a shark.

566
00:58:32,602 --> 00:58:34,013
Get up.

567
00:58:35,981 --> 00:58:37,641
Take her to Dr. Krieger's office.

568
00:59:04,049 --> 00:59:05,543
Leave us.

569
00:59:17,604 --> 00:59:19,727
Sorry about the rough treatment,

570
00:59:23,401 --> 00:59:27,066
but these people only know
one way to deal with intruders.

571
00:59:29,198 --> 00:59:30,574
Sit down.

572
00:59:35,871 --> 00:59:37,413
Dr. Krieger,
you should know that

573
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:38,950
the newspaper
is aware that I'm here

574
00:59:39,041 --> 00:59:40,666
and will be alerting
the authorities.

575
00:59:40,834 --> 00:59:42,377
It's all been taken care of.

576
00:59:43,796 --> 00:59:47,330
The coast guard reported
you lost at sea.

577
00:59:47,549 --> 00:59:48,878
What you don't know
is my bodyguard

578
00:59:48,967 --> 00:59:50,759
is on his way to the mainland
in a boat.

579
00:59:51,053 --> 00:59:52,298
Strange.

580
00:59:52,804 --> 00:59:55,426
He told me that
he was just your driver.

581
00:59:56,725 --> 00:59:59,429
You know, if he wouldn't
have turned around,

582
01:00:00,687 --> 01:00:02,644
we would have never caught him.

583
01:00:02,981 --> 01:00:06,729
Us being without
a helicopter these days.

584
01:00:07,568 --> 01:00:10,142
You know that you
owe me a helicopter.

585
01:00:10,279 --> 01:00:11,524
Where's Max?

586
01:00:12,573 --> 01:00:16,950
Looking at you, you don't look
at all like your Uncle Max.

587
01:00:17,244 --> 01:00:20,779
I want to see him
or I'm not saying another word.

588
01:00:21,874 --> 01:00:25,823
You will see him
and you will say another word,

589
01:00:26,170 --> 01:00:27,913
when the time has come.

590
01:00:41,768 --> 01:00:43,476
Applying the foundation?

591
01:00:45,939 --> 01:00:50,018
Sit down.
Go back and sit down.

592
01:01:01,036 --> 01:01:02,945
You ever play I spy?

593
01:01:03,455 --> 01:01:07,868
- Nah. You wanna play I spy?
- Yeah, let's play I spy.

594
01:01:08,543 --> 01:01:11,710
Well, now, we can if you want.

595
01:01:11,797 --> 01:01:13,374
Let's play I spy.

596
01:01:13,965 --> 01:01:15,625
Okay. I'll go first.

597
01:01:16,301 --> 01:01:18,792
- Okay. You got it?
- Yeah.

598
01:01:18,887 --> 01:01:23,928
Okay. Is it a freaky doctor?

599
01:01:26,352 --> 01:01:27,977
My creations.

600
01:01:28,646 --> 01:01:30,639
You are looking at
the deadliest ground troop...

601
01:01:30,731 --> 01:01:32,107
to ever walk the planet.

602
01:01:32,233 --> 01:01:33,775
Have a look for yourself.

603
01:01:41,533 --> 01:01:44,949
You won't find a more technically

604
01:01:45,079 --> 01:01:46,621
advanced facility anywhere
in the world.

605
01:01:50,625 --> 01:01:52,333
Max!

606
01:01:57,257 --> 01:02:00,922
He can't hear you.
He just finished his treatment.

607
01:02:01,010 --> 01:02:03,217
He's still coming out
of his sedation.

608
01:02:03,346 --> 01:02:04,461
What have you done to him?

609
01:02:04,806 --> 01:02:07,261
Made him a better soldier
than he ever was before.

610
01:02:08,184 --> 01:02:12,051
Max is right. You're a sick,
egotistical maniac.

611
01:02:12,438 --> 01:02:14,312
Let's not go over the top.

612
01:02:14,482 --> 01:02:16,190
I'm just greed.

613
01:02:16,525 --> 01:02:17,936
You can't imagine
how much money...

614
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:20,476
the government is paying
for research like that.

615
01:02:20,613 --> 01:02:22,320
How can you live like that?

616
01:02:22,406 --> 01:02:25,407
I live fine, thank you.

617
01:02:25,576 --> 01:02:27,533
Let's continue the tour.

618
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:38,576
Jack!

619
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:41,124
Are you okay?

620
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:46,844
- Make them pay.
- Happy reunions.

621
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:49,301
He turned Max into one
of his creatures.

622
01:02:50,057 --> 01:02:52,429
We like to refer
to them as genetically

623
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,309
modified soldiers around here.

624
01:02:54,478 --> 01:02:57,681
Your two friends will be
undergoing the same process.

625
01:02:57,773 --> 01:03:00,809
Your friend Jack
has real potential.

626
01:03:00,901 --> 01:03:04,104
Did he say friends? Yeah, hi.
...

627
01:03:04,196 --> 01:03:06,023
I don't know these people.

628
01:03:06,114 --> 01:03:08,237
I've never even seen her before.

629
01:03:08,575 --> 01:03:10,698
Then why did you try
to help them escape?

630
01:03:10,827 --> 01:03:12,820
Escape? No, no, no.

631
01:03:13,163 --> 01:03:15,072
He hijacked the boat,
and then he hijacked me.

632
01:03:15,373 --> 01:03:17,449
I don't like him.
I don't even know him.

633
01:03:21,963 --> 01:03:23,956
My process
will be a waste on you.

634
01:03:24,048 --> 01:03:26,088
Yeah, that's right.
I'm covered in flab.

635
01:03:26,217 --> 01:03:27,332
What should we do with him, sir?

636
01:03:28,261 --> 01:03:29,459
May be just kill him.

637
01:03:29,804 --> 01:03:32,674
No. No. No. No.
You don't want to kill me!

638
01:03:32,765 --> 01:03:34,556
Come on.
I'll be your personal valet.

639
01:03:34,642 --> 01:03:38,971
I can help you in many ways.
I'm the food guy! Oh,

640
01:03:39,104 --> 01:03:42,473
Oh! No! Goddammit.

641
01:03:42,816 --> 01:03:45,141
Come on! Will you shut up?

642
01:03:45,277 --> 01:03:48,728
We've gotta escape.
Stop choking, you big baby.

643
01:03:49,114 --> 01:03:53,361
Come on. Spit it out. Spit it out.

644
01:03:56,538 --> 01:03:58,530
- Pick it up.
- Pick up what?

645
01:03:59,290 --> 01:04:01,698
- What does it look like?
- Holy tomato.

646
01:04:01,793 --> 01:04:03,121
Where'd you get that?

647
01:04:03,294 --> 01:04:06,461
Come on. Let me get it.
Let me get it. That's pretty good.

648
01:04:06,923 --> 01:04:09,129
That's very good. Buddy...

649
01:04:09,258 --> 01:04:12,793
I... I got it.

650
01:04:13,137 --> 01:04:16,340
Okay. Okay. Open the cuffs.

651
01:04:16,474 --> 01:04:21,052
There it goes.
Now I missed it. You do it.

652
01:04:22,229 --> 01:04:23,344
Okay up.

653
01:04:23,439 --> 01:04:24,637
- Up like dance camp.
- One!

654
01:04:24,731 --> 01:04:26,439
- Up like dance camp.
- Two! Three!

655
01:04:31,613 --> 01:04:34,234
Okay. You do it. I can't do it.

656
01:04:34,324 --> 01:04:35,902
You do it. You got it?

657
01:04:36,993 --> 01:04:38,487
Come on. Just do it.

658
01:04:38,787 --> 01:04:41,538
- Where is it?
- It's right there. Got it?

659
01:04:45,877 --> 01:04:49,292
Okay, good. Nice. Nice.

660
01:04:49,422 --> 01:04:51,747
- Hey, what about me?
- Come on.

661
01:05:06,355 --> 01:05:09,391
Let's see if my work
on Max has been successful.

662
01:05:15,238 --> 01:05:17,397
Release GMS nine.

663
01:05:18,033 --> 01:05:19,443
Yes, doctor.

664
01:05:20,785 --> 01:05:23,241
This room is making me
claustrophobic.

665
01:05:29,794 --> 01:05:33,293
Whatever happens, I got your
back you got mine, okay?

666
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:37,879
Max.

667
01:05:38,636 --> 01:05:42,254
You know this guy?
Man, he looks rough.

668
01:05:42,431 --> 01:05:44,720
Good thing he doesn't know
you're banging his niece.

669
01:05:44,808 --> 01:05:47,643
Hey, he used to be a nice guy,
okay?

670
01:05:50,731 --> 01:05:53,186
- Max?
- I don't know, man.

671
01:05:53,275 --> 01:05:55,018
He doesn't look so nice.

672
01:05:55,610 --> 01:05:58,018
If I've done my job correctly,

673
01:05:58,154 --> 01:06:01,155
your Uncle Max won't rip
the arms off your friends yet,

674
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:03,532
unless I give the command.

675
01:06:05,411 --> 01:06:09,076
Max, remember me? I'm Jack.

676
01:06:10,583 --> 01:06:13,038
I'm going to let you two sort
this out, okay?

677
01:06:21,343 --> 01:06:22,718
Max,

678
01:06:23,929 --> 01:06:27,179
- execute.
- Max, no! Don't do it.

679
01:06:27,266 --> 01:06:29,424
Let's not get carried away,
please.

680
01:06:29,559 --> 01:06:31,885
Max, remember me?
I'm Jack.

681
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:34,593
- Remember?
- Max!

682
01:06:35,065 --> 01:06:38,149
Max! Kill them!

683
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:45,188
- Max.
- It's a dead end.

684
01:06:46,701 --> 01:06:48,195
Max,

685
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:52,950
tischtennis. Remember?
Tischtennis

686
01:07:04,843 --> 01:07:07,168
There's Valerie, up there.

687
01:07:07,304 --> 01:07:09,380
Max, kill them!

688
01:07:30,534 --> 01:07:32,278
Come on. Come on

689
01:07:34,455 --> 01:07:37,206
- What are you doing?
- He wised up.

690
01:07:37,333 --> 01:07:39,705
Release GMS 7 and 8.

691
01:09:41,368 --> 01:09:43,657
Go! Go! Go!

692
01:10:07,435 --> 01:10:09,308
Same team. Same team.

693
01:10:09,895 --> 01:10:12,433
That's it? That's your plan,
stay here and paint?

694
01:10:42,343 --> 01:10:44,751
- I can't get a clean shot!
- Get him! Take him down!

695
01:11:05,824 --> 01:11:07,235
Stop.

696
01:11:21,589 --> 01:11:23,249
We still looking for that broad?

697
01:11:24,926 --> 01:11:27,464
Holy shit. They must
do a lot of humping here,

698
01:11:27,595 --> 01:11:29,089
because those things
breed like rabbits.

699
01:11:34,977 --> 01:11:36,056
Go.

700
01:11:36,145 --> 01:11:37,639
Where are we going?

701
01:11:45,237 --> 01:11:46,779
Run, hide.

702
01:11:46,905 --> 01:11:48,945
I'm just a food guy.

703
01:13:33,174 --> 01:13:35,000
Asshole.

704
01:13:38,137 --> 01:13:41,091
Everybody, drop down!
Be aware!

705
01:13:42,224 --> 01:13:44,382
Remember, eyes and mouth!

706
01:14:17,549 --> 01:14:20,883
Mr. Masaki, it's Dr. Krieger.

707
01:14:21,386 --> 01:14:22,715
I'm ready to deliver.

708
01:14:22,971 --> 01:14:24,382
Are you still interested?

709
01:14:25,474 --> 01:14:28,889
Good. We agree to the terms?

710
01:14:29,895 --> 01:14:31,353
Wonderful.

711
01:14:31,438 --> 01:14:34,308
I'll see you in Shanghai.
What day?

712
01:14:35,734 --> 01:14:37,643
See you then.

713
01:14:41,447 --> 01:14:44,567
- What is it?
- Doctor, the perimeter is overrun.

714
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:46,907
We are sustaining
heavy casualties.

715
01:14:47,453 --> 01:14:49,196
I'm going to sound
an evacuation.

716
01:14:49,330 --> 01:14:51,951
Let's make one thing clear.

717
01:14:52,792 --> 01:14:54,998
You're holding your position.

718
01:14:55,085 --> 01:14:58,620
My men are getting slaughtered.
I'm going to order a fallback.

719
01:14:58,756 --> 01:15:00,463
You're not falling back.

720
01:15:00,591 --> 01:15:03,508
You are holding your position.
Is that clear?

721
01:15:03,635 --> 01:15:06,007
Sir, with all due respect...

722
01:15:06,263 --> 01:15:10,260
go shove your civilian orders...
up your civilian ass.

723
01:15:13,311 --> 01:15:14,971
Cover me!

724
01:15:17,232 --> 01:15:18,477
Chernov.

725
01:15:19,359 --> 01:15:21,517
- Doctor.
- Some problems.

726
01:15:22,070 --> 01:15:25,189
- Eliminate Parker.
- Yes, doctor.

727
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:27,021
Chernov.

728
01:15:28,409 --> 01:15:31,114
I need an escort to the pier.

729
01:15:31,537 --> 01:15:33,826
- Copy that.
- Get back! Come on!

730
01:15:42,965 --> 01:15:46,084
Sir, Dr. Krieger's personal
boat is readying for launch.

731
01:15:46,176 --> 01:15:49,841
Of course. The biggest rat
is first off the sinking ship.

732
01:15:51,264 --> 01:15:53,387
We sure as hell ain't
going to cover his retreat.

733
01:15:53,725 --> 01:15:56,726
If we get there first,
we take his boat.

734
01:15:57,061 --> 01:15:58,306
Get all remaining units...

735
01:15:58,605 --> 01:16:00,396
to rendezvous
at rally point bravo.

736
01:16:01,316 --> 01:16:04,020
All units, this is Claw Zero Six.

737
01:16:04,318 --> 01:16:08,446
All claw units rendezvous at rally
point bravo. Confirm. Over.

738
01:16:08,531 --> 01:16:10,358
Copy. Rally point bravo.

739
01:16:10,491 --> 01:16:13,243
Come on. Pull back.
Pull back!

740
01:16:49,403 --> 01:16:53,946
- We lost him, sir.
- We're going to have to leave him.

741
01:17:18,723 --> 01:17:22,092
You are one persistent son
of a bitch.

742
01:17:22,268 --> 01:17:25,388
Yes I am. Let me pass.

743
01:17:25,479 --> 01:17:29,429
We're leaving.
Why don't you come with us?

744
01:17:29,608 --> 01:17:31,435
Krieger still has my colleague.

745
01:17:31,527 --> 01:17:33,105
Well Krieger's about to leave.

746
01:17:33,946 --> 01:17:35,985
I won't let him leave with her.

747
01:17:37,616 --> 01:17:39,194
I admire your loyalty.

748
01:17:40,577 --> 01:17:42,866
It's something
in short supply around here.

749
01:17:43,872 --> 01:17:46,078
But once Krieger gets
on that boat,

750
01:17:46,792 --> 01:17:49,579
he's no longer our concern.

751
01:17:51,338 --> 01:17:55,003
Okay. I'm going to put
my weapon down.

752
01:18:03,724 --> 01:18:05,302
How do I find his boat?

753
01:18:05,685 --> 01:18:07,511
Passageway,
back the way you came.

754
01:18:07,937 --> 01:18:11,637
Follow it, the stairs down
to the ground floor

755
01:18:11,982 --> 01:18:14,308
and head straight to the far
end of the building.

756
01:18:16,987 --> 01:18:18,529
Thanks.

757
01:18:18,614 --> 01:18:23,525
Wait a second.
Your gun is empty.

758
01:18:27,414 --> 01:18:28,956
Take that.

759
01:18:31,793 --> 01:18:33,287
Happy hunting.

760
01:18:33,670 --> 01:18:36,706
Remember, aim for the eyes
or the mouth.

761
01:18:37,173 --> 01:18:38,584
Thank you.

762
01:18:50,936 --> 01:18:52,347
Parker.

763
01:18:55,107 --> 01:18:57,479
Get everyone back to the boats
and leave immediately.

764
01:18:57,985 --> 01:19:02,148
- But, sir.
- It's okay. Now move.

765
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:10,864
Where are they going?

766
01:19:10,956 --> 01:19:13,363
They're withdrawing,
on my orders.

767
01:19:21,674 --> 01:19:25,173
Traitor. Get out.

768
01:19:25,303 --> 01:19:27,591
Parker! Parker!

769
01:19:30,891 --> 01:19:32,718
Oh, shit.

770
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,584
Bitch.

771
01:20:44,003 --> 01:20:45,711
Chernov.

772
01:20:47,882 --> 01:20:49,755
- Chernov.
- Yes, sir.

773
01:20:49,842 --> 01:20:51,301
What's going on down there?

774
01:20:51,594 --> 01:20:53,752
- I'm on it.
- I'm waiting.

775
01:20:54,054 --> 01:20:55,714
Give me two minutes.

776
01:20:56,056 --> 01:20:58,013
I'm waiting!

777
01:21:16,659 --> 01:21:18,652
- I'm waiting!
- Good.

778
01:21:19,287 --> 01:21:21,030
You first.

779
01:21:31,674 --> 01:21:33,298
Chernov,

780
01:21:34,051 --> 01:21:35,842
let's go to the boat.

781
01:21:50,317 --> 01:21:52,605
Tell your men to hold exactly
where they are.

782
01:21:52,944 --> 01:21:55,400
Don't move.
Stay exactly where you are.

783
01:21:57,532 --> 01:21:59,323
Let her go.

784
01:22:02,161 --> 01:22:04,035
Let the girl go.

785
01:22:04,747 --> 01:22:07,320
Chernov, let the girl go!

786
01:22:07,875 --> 01:22:10,033
- Gun down.
- Dream on.

787
01:22:12,087 --> 01:22:13,498
Let her go.

788
01:22:14,048 --> 01:22:15,458
Gun down.

789
01:22:22,472 --> 01:22:23,717
Kill him.

790
01:23:46,428 --> 01:23:48,136
Max!

791
01:23:50,724 --> 01:23:52,384
Max.

792
01:24:01,192 --> 01:24:02,520
Let's go.

793
01:24:21,712 --> 01:24:25,543
Jack! Jack! Jack!

794
01:24:26,591 --> 01:24:28,833
Come on. Come on. Come on.

795
01:24:29,177 --> 01:24:30,802
Those freaky things
are following you.

796
01:24:30,929 --> 01:24:33,846
- Come on. Let's go.
- Can anybody hear me?

797
01:24:34,599 --> 01:24:36,223
Can anybody hear me?

798
01:24:38,144 --> 01:24:40,599
Captain, where's the boat?!

799
01:24:56,328 --> 01:24:58,321
You must be joking.

800
01:25:03,585 --> 01:25:04,996
Step back!

801
01:25:42,956 --> 01:25:44,699
As my editor expected, we got...

802
01:25:44,791 --> 01:25:47,199
a visit from the men
in black suits.

803
01:25:47,669 --> 01:25:50,836
No story can run that
jeopardizes national security.

804
01:25:50,964 --> 01:25:52,506
So what are you going to do?

805
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:55,128
I'll keep working on it.

806
01:25:55,969 --> 01:25:59,918
That's good.
So, here she is.

807
01:26:00,890 --> 01:26:02,301
Where'd you get that?

808
01:26:02,433 --> 01:26:03,892
Insurance bought it for me.

809
01:26:05,436 --> 01:26:08,009
- Wait a minute. Is that Emilio?
- Yeah.

810
01:26:09,857 --> 01:26:12,264
He's my new deckhand
and my new cook.

811
01:26:13,193 --> 01:26:15,565
- A pretty decent cook.
- Wow.

812
01:26:17,823 --> 01:26:20,148
Well, I should probably
get back to work.

813
01:26:24,663 --> 01:26:26,287
Hey, uh...

814
01:26:27,165 --> 01:26:30,581
the day when you rated me two
out of ten you were joking, right?

815
01:26:36,424 --> 01:26:38,084
Will I see you tomorrow?

816
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,135
Yes.

817
01:26:44,599 --> 01:26:47,089
Two points.
She wouldn't see me...

818
01:26:47,393 --> 01:26:49,432
if I was only two points.

819
01:26:55,275 --> 01:26:58,976
Jack,
we got our first customers.

820
01:26:59,404 --> 01:27:01,029
That's great.

821
01:27:01,490 --> 01:27:03,067
Hey, Jack.

822
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:04,480
I think you owe
us some whales, Jack.

823
01:27:04,618 --> 01:27:06,278
Yeah, we wanna see whales.

824
01:27:06,703 --> 01:27:08,446
You hear that? The little lady
wants to see some whales.

825
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:10,407
They wanna see whales.

826
01:27:11,708 --> 01:27:13,332
Come on, Jack.
This is boat looks like...

827
01:27:13,418 --> 01:27:14,876
it's faster than your last one.

828
01:27:14,961 --> 01:27:17,119
Where?

829
01:27:17,255 --> 01:27:19,247
Wait...
Where are you going, Jack?

830
01:27:19,382 --> 01:27:20,378
Jack?

831
01:27:20,508 --> 01:27:23,081
- Jack?
- You do it, Emilio.

832
01:27:23,177 --> 01:27:24,458
- What? I don't know...
- It's all yours.

833
01:27:24,553 --> 01:27:26,297
- Anything about the whales!
- I don't care.

834
01:27:26,430 --> 01:27:28,423
He's just having a little hissy-fit.
He'll come right back.

835
01:27:28,766 --> 01:27:33,262
Just shut up.
You're scaring him. Jack! Jack!

836
01:27:33,354 --> 01:27:35,476
He's German. He's emotional.

837
01:27:35,564 --> 01:27:37,853
Come on.
I'm making franks and beans!
