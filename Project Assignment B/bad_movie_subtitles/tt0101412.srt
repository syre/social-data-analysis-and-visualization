1
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,500
The man named Dar
has been found guilty

2
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,500
of complicity with the rebels

3
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,500
to overthrow the holy
power of Lord Arklon.

4
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The accused has also exhibited
knowledge of witchcraft

5
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,000
in his ability to control
the beasts of the field.

6
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,500
The sentence...

7
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,500
is death.

8
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,500
So this is the Beastmaster.

9
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,000
The one who defeated
our high priest Maox

10
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,500
and now challenges my authority.

11
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:35,000
Did you actually believe that
you and your flock of peasants

12
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,500
could over throw my kindgom?

13
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,000
Did you?

14
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,000
Now... where are these rebels?

15
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,000
Speak!

16
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,750
No?

17
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Then die.

18
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,500
In the name of Lord Arklon,

19
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,500
I hereby condemn you
to eternal damnation.

20
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
May the vultures feast upon his flesh.

21
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,500
[ roar ]

22
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,500
Aah!

23
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,500
Seize him!

24
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,500
Death to all if he escapes!

25
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,500
Ha ha ha ha!

26
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,000
Master of the beast.

27
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,500
Ha ha!

28
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,000
The vultures shall have
their feast after all.

29
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Perhaps you're right.

30
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,500
[ imitates eagle ]

31
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,000
Come on, my friends.

32
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Let us depart...

33
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
before somebody really gets hurt.

34
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
[ imitates tiger ]

35
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,500
I don't like it.

36
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,000
Bring the witch.

37
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,000
The leader wishes to
speak with you, Witch.

38
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Move it!

39
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,000
Witch, speak.

40
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Where is Arklon's army?

41
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,500
Lord Arklon rests in the
Foothills of Analos,

42
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,000
some two days' journey from here.

43
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Take care you speak the truth, Witch.

44
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,500
One act of betrayal

45
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
and I'll cleave your
black heart from your bosom.

46
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,500
Surely such a valiant
warrior such as you

47
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,500
can think of a better use for my bosom.

48
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,000
Away with her!

49
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,000
Well, I guess he got the point.

50
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Guards!

51
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,000
[ shouting ]

52
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Behold the key of Magog.

53
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,500
Death to Arklon!

54
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,500
You have won this battle, Arklon.

55
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
But the flames of freedom

56
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
will not be extinguished so easily.

57
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,500
They'll be coming,

58
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,000
more and more, from all over the land.

59
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,500
And we both know, Arklon,

60
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,000
the power of the key is not eternal.

61
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,500
Whore...

62
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,500
who are you to address me by name?

63
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,500
Who am I?

64
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,500
Honey, I'm the best thing
that's happened to you

65
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,000
since you donned that
great-looking mask.

66
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,500
And why should I...

67
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,500
Lord Arklon...

68
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
maximum ruler of Arok...

69
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
be any concern of yours?

70
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,500
Chill out, lord dude.

71
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,500
You know, you're a hard man
to take a meeting with.

72
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,500
That's why I arranged this
scene with the rebels.

73
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,500
What is this strange tongue
in which you speak?

74
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,500
It's all part of what I want to show you,

75
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,500
for it is I, the beautiful,

76
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,500
sensuous, Mysterious Lyranna,

77
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:07,000
who can make you the most
powerful man on Earth.

78
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
My dear, I am the most
powerful man on Earth.

79
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,500
Not for long...

80
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
unless you allow me to
make your power eternal.

81
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You... you are but a witch.

82
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,500
Maybe...

83
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,000
but a very uncommon one, my liege.

84
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Silence!

85
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,500
You don't wish to hear my secret?

86
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,500
You want to know what will
make you equal to the gods?

87
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,500
The ultimate power awaits you, my lord.

88
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Then I shall let you live...

89
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,000
only until I witness such sorcery.

90
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
But you hear me well,

91
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
if you try to deceive me--

92
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,500
I know.

93
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,000
You shall cleave my black heart
from my bosom, hmm?

94
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Take her.

95
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,500
So... you think he likes me?

96
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,500
Split up.

97
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,500
Aah!

98
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,000
Aah! Aah!

99
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Aah!

100
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
[ caw ]

101
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,000
Go... back.

102
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,720
Rrawr!

103
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:33,000
[ gasp ] You... are Dar, son of Zed.

104
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You are of my blood.

105
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I was sister to your father Zed.

106
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,000
In my youth,

107
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I practiced the forbidden rituals...

108
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,000
and eventually evolved

109
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:57,500
into this wretched creature
that stands before you.

110
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Yes... come closer.

111
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:17,500
I have seen... the past and the future,

112
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,500
and I must tell you before I expire.

113
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,500
In years past, the evil high priest Maox

114
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,500
ordered King Zed's unborn child
withdrawn from its mother's womb

115
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
and transplanted inside
a beast of burden.

116
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,500
That child possesses the ability

117
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
to communicate with all creatures

118
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,500
from the fields and the skies.

119
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,500
They call him...

120
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,000
the Beastmaster.

121
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:00,000
But this was not the
only child taken from him.

122
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Zed's firstborn was stolen
by Zhun priests,

123
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,000
and the grief from losing two sons

124
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,000
eventually eroded his great mind.

125
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
You say I have an older brother?

126
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,500
He is evil, Dar!

127
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,500
If you do not find Zed's firstborn

128
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,000
by the time of the autumn equinox,

129
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:29,000
life in this world shall cease to exist.

130
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
If you do find him...

131
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,000
and destroy him...

132
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:38,000
peace and justice shall prevail.

133
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I must kill my brother?

134
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,000
Dar...

135
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:48,000
the fate of the world
rests on your shoulders.

136
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,000
Now, begone.

137
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,500
I do not want you to see me die.

138
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,000
Wait...

139
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:01,000
how will I know him?
Where will I find him?

140
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,000
Search the western region.

141
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,000
The western region...

142
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,000
What sorcery is this?

143
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
A dimensional portal.

144
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
The doorway to your
ulitmate triumph, my lord.

145
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
A world that exists on a
parallel plane with our own.

146
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
And what do they call this place?

147
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
The natives call it LA.

148
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,500
Al ay?

149
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,000
I've been studying their ways.

150
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,500
Oh... what marvels they possess.

151
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,000
Indeed.

152
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And one in particular
should interest you.

153
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,500
It is housed at one of
their military fortresses.

154
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:23,500
Their men of science call it
a neutron detonator.

155
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,000
It's compact enough to carry,

156
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,500
yet powerful enough to destroy all life

157
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,000
in an area the size of a continent.

158
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,500
With the threat of such a weapon,

159
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,500
I could rule unstopposed.

160
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,500
Exactly.

161
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,500
Exactly.

162
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,000
Their political structure

163
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
is based on such weapons.

164
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
They refer to it as the balance of terror.

165
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,000
What a brilliantly barbarous concept.

166
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Ah...

167
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,000
Why do you show me such things?

168
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,500
These are nothing but
illusions and pictures.

169
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,500
Have her drawn and quartered.

170
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,000
Ha ha ha ha!

171
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Fool! Fool!

172
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,500
Laugh in the face of death?

173
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,000
I laugh at any fool

174
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,500
who would throw away
the key to ultimate power.

175
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,000
We are made for each other.

176
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,500
The key of Magog and I--

177
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,000
together, and only together--

178
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,500
can we come and go
through the portal at will

179
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,500
and make these pictures reality.

180
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,500
The neutron detonator will be yours.

181
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,500
You'll rule the world.

182
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,500
With me at your side.

183
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,000
Really?

184
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,720
You...

185
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,500
the mother of beauty...

186
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,000
would be at my side?

187
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,500
You...

188
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,000
the queen of radiance,

189
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,500
would grace my lonely existence?

190
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,500
You...

191
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
would cast your sparkling eyes

192
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,500
upon this tattered face

193
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,000
and shine your aura upon my throne?

194
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,220
Ohh...

195
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Burn her!

196
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Ha ha ha ha!

197
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,000
Arklon, you need me!

198
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,500
The key will get you in,

199
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,000
but only I can get you out.

200
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,500
Arklon, read my lips--

201
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,500
only I can get you out!

202
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,000
Let haste not be the ruler,

203
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,000
lest we forget the purpose.

204
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Come...

205
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:56,500
let us discover more
about this place you call...

206
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,000
LA.

207
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,500
Al ay.

208
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
[ honk honk ]

209
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,000
Hello?

210
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Hi, Daddy, this is Jackie!

211
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
My daughter?

212
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,500
Yes, your daughter.

213
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,500
I've been searching
the entire pacific coast--

214
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:26,000
Stop yelling, Daddy.
You'll have another asthma attack.

215
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,000
Unit baker 5-0, high-speed pursuit.

216
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,500
Request assistance.

217
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,000
Roger, baker 5-0. 86 responding.

218
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
[ siren ]

219
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,500
Can you give me a make on that vehicle?

220
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
A red porsche.

221
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,500
Senator Trent's daughter.

222
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,500
The crazy one.

223
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,500
I was at this great party in Ensenada.

224
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,500
How long?

225
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,000
Five or six days.

226
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,000
it's really hard to remember.

227
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I'm on the 5 heading
north towards downtown.

228
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I hope you're not speeding.

229
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Of course I'm not speeding, Daddy.

230
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
You only have 20--

231
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I know Pam's getting
married in 20 minutes.

232
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,000
I'm not going to miss
my own sister's wedding.

233
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
You missed your brother's bar mitzvah.

234
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
What?

235
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
[ sirens ]

236
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,500
You're going to have to speak up,

237
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,500
there's a lot of noise.

238
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Sounds like a police siren.

239
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,500
It does. Let me check.

240
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,500
It is a siren, Daddy.

241
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,000
I'll call you back.

242
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Are these any problems?

243
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,000
No, there won't be any problems.

244
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I'll see you at the church, OK?

245
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,000
Ciao, Daddy. I love you.

246
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,500
# You're such an expensive girl #

247
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,500
# Ooh, so hard to please #

248
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,500
# Livin' in such a crazy world #

249
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,000
# Just move over and gimme the keys #

250
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Uh-oh.

251
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,500
# Another night #

252
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,000
# You kiss the mornin' #

253
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
# Slip away without a trace #

254
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,500
Whoo! I am so cool.

255
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,500
# Without a warning #

256
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,500
# You got me, girl, between
a rock and a hard place #

257
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,500
# Rapture #

258
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,000
# Heartbreak #

259
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
# You're a reckless little girl #

260
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
# But that's all right #

261
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:22,000
# Satisfaction guaranteed tonight #

262
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,500
# Keep on, keep on rockin' me #

263

# Keep on, keep on rockin' me #

264

# Keep on, keep on rockin' me #

265
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,000
# All night long #

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
# All night long #

267
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,500
# Every time I see you, babe #

268
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,000
# It breaks my heart with pain #

269
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
# Like a sultry summer day #

270
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
# Holding on, brave the rain #

271
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,500
[ gasp ] Oh, shit!

272
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Oh... aah!

273
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,000
Well, this is nice.

274
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,500
This is very, very nice.

275
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,500
You write the report this time.

276
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,000
I'm not doing the--

277
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
So, uh, where's the camera?

278
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:46,500
Yo, Darth Vader, what is
this, some kind of movie set?

279
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,000
OK, drop your weapons.

280
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
You're under arrest!

281
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,500
You have the right to remain silent.

282
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,000
You shall remain silent.

283
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,500
Shit!

284
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,500
I want them alive!

285
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Since when did the governor
pardon mental patients?

286
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,500
Exeter, Zavic!

287
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,500
Unit 86 to headquarters--
officers under fire.

288
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,000
Immediate assistance requested.

289
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
A 10-28 at the intersection of...

290
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,500
Where the hell are we?

291
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,500
How should I know?
This isn't my neighborhood.

292
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,000
It's going to blow!

293
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
- Aah!
- Aah!

294
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Marcellus, are we dreaming?

295
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,500
If we were dreaming,

296
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,000
we couldn't have to
explain to the captain

297
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,500
what happened to our patrol cars.

298
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,000
Get her!

299
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
These guys don't give warning shots.

300
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Oh... oh, come on.

301
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,500
Ohh!

302
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,000
Exeter, bring me the outsider.

303
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,500
Yes, my lord.

304
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,500
Alive!

305
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,000
Yes, my lord.

306
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,500
Now!

307
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,000
Get the outsider!

308
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
What an incredible
instrument of destruction

309
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,500
this beast would make.

310
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,500
I could roll over the entire armies.

311
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,000
It's called a car.

312
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,500
A dar.

313
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,500
A car.

314
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,500
A car.

315
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,000
Let's cross over to the other world now.

316
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,500
I know many other
wonders of their world.

317
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:38,000
Put yourselves in the hand
of your future queen.

318
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,000
So, my little dove,

319
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
you wish to be my queen.

320
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I certainly don't wish to be your maid.

321
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,000
First we interrogate the outsider...

322
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,500
my witch.

323
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,500
[ engine dies ]

324
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,000
[ engine won't start ]

325
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,000
Damn!

326
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Where's the auto club
when you need them?

327
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,500
Well, there's got to be a main road

328
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,500
around here somewhere.

329
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,000
You know that middle of nowhere

330
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,500
you always heard about...

331
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,000
I'm here.

332
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,500
Hello...

333
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,000
hello...

334
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
PJ, close the blinds.

335
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
PJ, go away.

336
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,500
Your breath smells worse
than a dead iguana.

337
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:41,000
PJ, that's disgusting.

338
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Uh-oh.

339
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Nice-- nice kitty.

340
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,000
Nice-- nice baby.

341
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,500
That's right. That-that's good.

342
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,000
Isn't there maybe a ball of string

343
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,500
you'd like to go play with?

344
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:12,000
Mommy will get you
a nice can of 9 lives.

345
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Who is this PJ?

346
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
There is no cause to be alarmed.

347
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,000
I don't know about you,

348
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
but I'd rather eat breakfast
than be breakfast.

349
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,000
The beast is my friend.

350
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I see through his eyes.
He sees through mine.

351
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Enough, enough.

352
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,000
I know his thoughts. He knows mine.

353
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Sounds like you have a great,
meaningful relationship,

354
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
but just make him go away.

355
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Ruh... over.

356
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,000
Feel better now?

357
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Not really.

358
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Hey, are you one of
those crazed bikers,

359
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
you know, with the crossbows...

360
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,000
Do you have any idea where we are?

361
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,500
The western region.

362
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,500
Oh. Well, that's enlightening.

363
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:07,000
Would you mind being a
little bit more specific?

364
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Look, is there a telephone
around that I could use

365
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,500
or-- or a 7-eleven even?
Something like that?

366
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,500
7-eleven?

367
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,500
[ squealing ]

368
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Whoa. Your bag's full of rats.

369
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,500
No. These are my ferrets.

370
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,000
This is Kodo and Podo.

371
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
They still look like rats to me.

372
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,500
Oh. How was the trip?

373
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,500
Hey, I get it now.

374
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
You're with the circus.

375
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,500
We're on a quest.

376
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,500
Sure.

377
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,000
Right.

378
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Well, you know, hey,
I'm on a quest, too.

379
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,500
For gas.

380
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,000
See, my porsche ran out
of gas 10 miles back.

381
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I know Daddy would pay a lot of money

382
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
if you'd just help me get back to LA.

383
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,500
You are welcome to join us
on our journey westward.

384
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,000
Perhaps there you will
find the land you seek.

385
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Well, all right.

386
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,000
It's the best offer I've gotten all day.

387
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Hey, is that cat going to come with us?

388
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,500
His name is Ruh.

389
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,500
We travel everywhere together.

390
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,500
Must make it really difficult
checking into a hotel.

391
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,000
Wait a minute.

392
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Hey, wait up, Hercules.

393
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I'm coming.

394
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,500
Hey, if you're not with the circus,

395
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,000
maybe a zoo?

396
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Zoo?

397
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,500
You know, where they keep animals.

398
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,500
The animals are free.

399
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,500
This is their land.

400
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,000
I'm their friend.

401
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,500
OK, OK. Not again.

402
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,840
[ caw ]

403
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,500
[ caw ]

404
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:28,000
By the way, I'm Jackie Trent.

405
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
And you?

406
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,000
Dar.

407
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,500
Dar what?

408
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Dar, do you understand
anything I say to you?

409
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,750
No.

410
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,500
Just like Daddy.

411
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,500
Roots.

412
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,500
Euell Gibbon in a Lioncloth.

413
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,000
Delicious.

414
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,500
It will keep us alive.

415
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,000
No, thanks.

416
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I'll just stick with the salad bar.

417
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,000
You know, that vulture's
been circling above us

418
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,500
for about an hour.

419
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,500
That's no vulture.

420
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,500
That's my eagle.

421
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,500
Magnificent bird.

422
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,500
Sharak!

423
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
[ caw ]

424
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,500
A boy and his bird.

425
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,000
How touching.

426
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,000
I send him to scout for me.

427
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,500
He is my eyes.

428
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,000
A seeing-eye bird.

429
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:34,000
You know, this isn't half
bad when it's cooked.

430
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,000
You really do all right for yourself.

431
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
You live off the land,

432
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
you get along great with animals.

433
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Totally self-sufficient.

434
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,000
Look, Dar, I have to ask--

435
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,000
were you raiser by wolves or what?

436
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,000
So, Dar, tell me,

437
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
what's with you and these animals?

438
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,500
They're the only family I have.

439
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,500
They sure do love you.

440
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,000
What are their names again?

441
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,000
This one's Kodo, and this one's Podo.

442
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,500
Can I hold them?

443
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,500
They're squirmy.

444
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,500
Wait. Which one's Kodo
and which one's Podo?

445
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,500
Guess.

446
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:38,500
I can't tell the difference.

447
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,000
They're adorable.

448
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,500
Do not be decieved by appearances.

449
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,500
They are both very shrewd thieves.

450
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,500
Thieves?

451
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,000
Mmm. They have cunning

452
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,500
to get me out of very rocky situations.

453
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,500
It looks like they love you, too.

454
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,500
[ growling ]

455
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,500
More of your friends?

456
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,500
Those are the lost hounds.

457
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,500
That's bad, right?

458
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,500
They stalk the night

459
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,500
searching for souls to
drag down into the abyss.

460
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:33,500
Sounds like a couple of guys
I met in Tijuana last night.

461
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,000
Wait.

462
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Where are you going?

463
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,500
To stand guard with Ruh.

464
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Don't worry. Kodo and Podo
will stay with you.

465
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,500
You will be safe.

466
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,000
I promise.

467
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,500
You'll take care of me, won't you?

468
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,500
Sleep.

469
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:14,500
I don't know what that
cat has that I don't.

470
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:32,500
Strange, this newcomer, huh?

471
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,000
What do you think?

472
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Well...

473
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,500
[ squeaking ]

474
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,000
[ squeaking ]

475
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,500
Take the outsider.

476
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,000
The Beastmaster.

477
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,500
Who are those geeks?

478
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,000
[ coughing ]

479
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,500
I can't breathe.

480
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:57,500
Get him.

481
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,500
We encountered the Beastmaster.

482
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,000
And you let him escape?

483
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,500
Idiot!

484
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:56,500
Two of my best man are
fast upon his heels, my lord.

485
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,000
Appealing little thing...

486
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
in a plain sort of way.

487
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:09,500
Dar?

488
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,500
Where's Dar?

489
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,500
He rots with his beast.

490
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Do you know where you are?

491
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
The Twilight Zone.

492
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Where's rod serling?

493
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,500
You are in a parallel world.

494
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,500
Lord Arklon opened
the dimensional portal

495
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,000
that you came through.

496
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,500
Way rad!

497
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,000
So, uh, listen...

498
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Leatherface...

499
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
how do you supposed I get
back through this, uh, portal?

500
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:11,500
Ha ha ha.

501
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,000
"Leatherface."

502
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,500
I shall be happy to take you

503
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:18,000
in exchange for certain information.

504
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Information?

505
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,500
Yes.

506
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,500
Hell, I'm loaded with information.

507
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:25,000
I watch Jeopardy! Every night.

508
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,500
I seek a weapon known as
the neutron detonator.

509
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,500
Neutron detonator.

510
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:31,500
Yes.

511
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,000
Right.

512
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Well, once we're back in Los Angeles,

513
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,500
I'll get one for you at K-Mart.

514
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,500
Beware of treachery, my lord.

515
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,500
Look, Daddy's good friends
with Admiral Benz.

516
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
He's the chief of pacific operations.

517
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,000
I'm sure he probably has a warehouse

518
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,500
full of neutron detonators...

519
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,000
somewhere.

520
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,500
[ caw ]

521
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,500
Few people have been foolish enough

522
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,500
to betray me, little one.

523
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,000
Girl scout's honor.

524
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,500
We'll just hop back
through that rabbit hole

525
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,500
and grab a neutron detonator,

526
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,000
and you'll be back by lunch.

527
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Promise.

528
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,500
We go.

529
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,500
The Beastmaster.

530
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:28,000
No.
I shall kill him with my own hand.

531
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,500
No. Come on. You can kill him
anytime. Our time is limited.

532
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,000
Arklon...

533
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,500
Zavic, Exeter, if you wish
to live, he must die.

534
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Yes, my lord.

535
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Ruh!

536
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,000
Arklon!

537
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:00,000
Arklon, not now. Time is fleeting.

538
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,500
Brother?

539
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,500
You are the one.

540
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
I should have known.

541
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Till death do us part.

542
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,000
Not now, Arklon!

543
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,500
You creep, you're breaking my arm.

544
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,500
You killed your own brother.

545
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,000
No. Not yet.

546
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I merely detained him until
a more propitious moment,

547
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,500
althrough I understand
why he's so hard to kill.

548
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,500
He's from my own blood.

549
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:06,000
Well, I bet your mom
always liked him best.

550
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,500
You know, I've got friends in this town.

551
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,500
You'll never get away with this.

552
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,500
Lord Arklon can get away with anything.

553
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,500
My sweet little child,

554
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,500
if you value your health,

555
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:19,500
you'll lead us to the
neutron detonator now.

556
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:22,000
OK, OK. Lighten up.

557
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Good.

558
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,500
Whoa.
Check out the radical rags, man.

559
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,000
Hey, wow...

560
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:45,500
Whoa, whoa.

561
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,500
Why are they looking at me like this?

562
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
They're digging your royal attire, sire.

563
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,500
Of course.

564
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:55,500
You got to get yourself
some fresh threads.

565
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,500
See, apparently the suspects

566
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,500
have fired some gas lines.

567
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:03,000
The guys down here took care of that,

568
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
but this jerk won't come out of the alley.

569
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
We've tried talking to the guy.

570
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,500
He won't say a thing.

571
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,500
What?

572
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,500
What the hell is that doing here?

573
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Good question.

574
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,500
There are many of them...

575
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,000
and few of us.

576
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
We called the zoo biologist.

577
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,500
He has tranquilizer darts.

578
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:29,000
Did he bring one for Mr. Loincloth?

579
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,000
That's why God invented taser guns.

580
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,500
You know how I feel about tasers.

581
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,500
Look, you try rushing him.

582
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,500
OK, go ahead.

583
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:51,000
Holy shit...

584
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,500
Aah!

585
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,000
Fire the taser!

586
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,500
Well, there you have it, chief.

587
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,000
No muss, no fuss.

588
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
What about tabby back there?

589
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,500
The zoo's keeping him.

590
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:12,000
They're sure he's not
one of theirs, though.

591
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,500
Find out everything you
can about the weirdo.

592
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:18,000
Have somebody run a query
on all Loincloth freaks.

593
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
There can't be that many.

594
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,500
Have the whole thing on
my desk tomorrow morning.

595
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:25,000
Whoa, uh, chief. Tomorrow's Sunday.

596
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:31,000
You think this can wait
till Monday, Bendowski?

597
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:32,500
I hear you.

598
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,500
I thought you would.

599
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,000
Loincloths...

600
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
And what can we do to you?

601
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:54,500
My associates, they're looking
for a more corporate look.

602
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,500
I should say.

603
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,000
Cultural exchange students.

604
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Of course.

605
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:00,500
Marian?

606
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,000
Yes, Mr. Miller.

607
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Would you help this lady?

608
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:08,000
Arklon, we must go now.

609
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Today, darling.

610
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,500
Look. Just in from Paris.

611
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:14,500
It's the rage.

612
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:18,500
I-- I think we've got
a couple of minutes...

613
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,500
or so.

614
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:27,000
And, sir, if you will follow me...

615
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:31,500
Ow!

616
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Where are you going?

617
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
I was going to try it on, too.

618
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Can I go look at the skirts?

619
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,000
No.

620
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:40,000
Can I go to the bath--

621
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Quiet.

622
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
room?

623
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Now, sir,

624
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,500
here is something just
screams your name, hmm?

625
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
No.

626
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Uh...

627
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,500
Sir--

628
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:05,000
haven't you anything
more befitting my station?

629
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:09,500
Sir, I assure you this is
the Finest Virgin Wool.

630
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:12,000
Virgins.

631
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,500
My dear boy,
from where I come from,

632
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
the only thing a virgin is good for

633
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,000
is sacrifice.

634
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:26,000
Well, I have sacrificed
a few in my time, too.

635
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:28,500
Ah.

636
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,500
If you were in my kingdom,

637
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:35,500
I would slit you open
and disembowel you.

638
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,500
You know,

639
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,000
you should really meet

640
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,000
my stress management therapist.

641
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
He's done wonders for me.

642
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,500
Um, sir...

643
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,500
if... if--

644
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:49,500
Uh.

645
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,500
Now, uh, sir...

646
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,500
if you'll just try this on,

647
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,500
I'm sure you'll be quite pleased.

648
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
We've had three oil sheiks

649
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,000
and one ethiopian potentate

650
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,500
purchase this exact suit.

651
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Uh, please. Come this
way if you will, please.

652
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,500
This way.

653
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,000
You will stay.

654
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,000
The neutron detonator
itself couldn't move me.

655
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,500
If you will...

656
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:38,500
What?

657
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,500
Why did she do that?

658
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Oh! What's up?

659
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:06,000
What did I tell you, sir?

660
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
A perfect fit.

661
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,000
And if I may say,

662
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:10,500
the Phantom of the Opera look

663
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
is quite chic.

664
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,500
Where is she?

665
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,000
To whom are you referring, sir?

666
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,000
Where is she?

667
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,000
If you're referring to a woman

668
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,500
whom you arrived with,

669
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:23,000
I believe she stepped outside.

670
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Shall I wrap this, or would
you like to wear it home?

671
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,500
Aah!

672
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:33,500
Yes. I think I'm beginning
to like this... LA.

673
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,500
Hey, hey!

674
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,000
Wait a min--

675
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,500
What's going on?

676
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:37,000
Preston, come back here.

677
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,500
He who defies Arklon

I missed you, too, Wendel.

You were gone so long,

we considered renting out your room.

Oh, Wendel, it's a long story.

For your sake, I hope it's a best-seller.

Your father mentioned something
about disinheriting you.

Then he leaved without even paying.

So we come down and investigate.

everything's destroyed.

What you're trying to
tell me, Bendowski,

699
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,500
is that there's some
stranger running around

brassieres off mannequins.

How come a clean-cut

847
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
always.

848
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Dar, in here.

849
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Let's eat.

850
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:15,500
Mmm.

851
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,500
Does it speak?

852
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,500
Usually to animals.

853
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,000
This is Dar.

854
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
He's my friend.

855
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Not another surfer?

856
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:35,500
No. I'd say he's more
of an animal trainer.

857
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Oh. Ohh.

858
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:40,000
Your father will be overjoyed.

859
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:44,500
Is this to eat or to look upon?

860
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:45,500
Good question.

861
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:47,000
Eat.

862
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:52,500
Mmm!

863
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:56,000
What?

864
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,500
I haven't eaten anything but roots

865
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:01,500
for the last few days, OK?

866
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:05,000
Another of your exotic diets?

867
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:10,000
Is he housebroken?

868
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,500
Caw!

869
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Miss Jackie,

870
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,500
I think this may be going too far.

871
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:25,500
Don't worry, Wendel.

872
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:27,500
This is Sharak, Kodo, and Podo.

873
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,000
They won't hurt you.

874
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
My God...

875
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,500
he is an animal trainer.

876
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Your food...

877
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:37,500
very colorful.

878
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:39,000
Well, colorants and preservatives

879
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,500
are our main source of nutrition.

880
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:43,000
Shorten life, but...

881
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
mmm...

882
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,500
they taste good.

883
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:48,500
Miss Jackie, this has gone far enough.

884
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:51,000
Uh, I'm calling your father.

885
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:52,000
Good, because, Wendel,

886
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,500
we really need to talk to him.

887
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:56,500
Arklon-- we must find him.

888
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:58,000
Come on, Dar.

889
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Let's watch the 6:00 news.

890
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,500
Uh, is Senator Trent there?

891
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:11,000
Yes, I know he's in a meeting.

892
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,500
But this is an emergency.

893
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:17,000
Tell him I will not be responsible.

894
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
For what?

895
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,500
For a-- a pterodactyl
and a bunch of rats

896
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,500
loose in the house.

897
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:25,000
Where's the remote control?

898
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:32,000
What are these images?

899
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,500
These are pictures.

900
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:38,500
See, that's one of Daddy and me,

901
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:41,000
and this is Daddy and my mom.

902
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,000
She's not with us any longer.

903
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,500
She is...

904
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,500
away on a journey?

905
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:51,500
No. She died a couple of years ago.

906
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:54,000
You must miss her.

907
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,500
I do.

908
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:59,000
Come on. Let's watch the news.

909
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Oh, Harry.

910
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Harry.

911
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Gloria.

912
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Harry, Harry!

913
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Gloria.

914
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Harry.

915
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Gloria.

916
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
What is this?

917
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:16,000
This is television, Dar.

918
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:18,500
Pictures of our world.

919
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:21,000
Doctors say that Former
President Reagan

920
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,500
will be able to dress himself again

921
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:24,500
in no time.

922
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:26,000
Nobody admits that they watch it,

923
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:28,500
but everybody has at least two of them.

924
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:31,500
...is about to test a nuclear device

925
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:33,500
known as the neutron detonator.

926
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:35,000
What are you doing here?

927
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,500
I'm singing.

928
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:40,500
I study music.

929
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
See, it's real important to me

930
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:44,500
to convey emotion.

931
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:48,000
You know, like laughs or tears.

932
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,500
According to an article

933
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:51,000
in the National Enquirer,

934
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,500
this weapon is capable...

935
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:53,500
Arklon.

936
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:55,000
within a 1000-miles radius.

937
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
The government has
given no official word

938
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
of its existence.

939
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,500
Neutron detonator.

940
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:02,000
This geek's really trying to get the bomb!

941
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Naval research center at Long Beach.

942
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,500
Can you find him?

943
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:09,500
My pedal is already to the metal.

944
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:11,500
We can't go dressed like this.

945
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:13,000
Daddy's thing will fit you.

946
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,500
Go, birdie, please.

947
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:17,500
Go away. Fly away home.

948
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,000
Here. Put this on.

949
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Yee-ha!

950
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,500
You look great.

951
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,500
Let's get out of here.

952
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Wendel, tell Daddy that I'm going

953
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,000
to stop World War III.

954
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Come on.

955
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Uh, don't forget your bird!

956
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Go, go!

957
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:40,750
Ah!

958
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:43,000
Bye-bye, birdie.

959
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:16,000
Pardon me, sir.

960
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,500
I'll be your liaison here on the base,

961
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:19,500
Lieutenant Colonel.

962
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:21,500
You again.

963
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:23,000
At your service.

964
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,500
[ chuckling ]

965
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,500
Somehow I expected to
find you here, Lyranna.

966
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Great minds think alike.

967
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:31,500
I suppose you know

968
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,500
where the neutron detonator is located?

969
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Well, of course.

970
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:37,000
I even have the security badges

971
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:38,500
to get us inside.

972
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Badges? I don't need badges!

973
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:53,500
I'm sorry, sir,

974
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,500
but I cannot allow you inside.

975
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:59,500
Would you care to explain that, Sergeant?

976
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:00,500
Your papers are correct,

977
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:03,500
but your badges only give
you E-2 clearance.

978
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:05,000
This is an E-1 security area.

979
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:07,500
You want me to tell General Binns

980
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,000
that we were refused entry

981
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:11,000
because security made some error

982
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,500
and gave us the wrong badges?

983
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
That won't be necessary
I'll call security.

984
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,000
I'm sure we can clear this up immediately.

985
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:28,250
OK.

986
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,000
That should do it.

987
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:33,500
Does it check out?

988
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:34,500
Yeah.

989
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:42,500
Got to disarm this thing.

990
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:44,500
Now cease all resistance.

991
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:49,500
You can't take that!

992
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,500
[ alarm sounds ]

993
01:14:58,500 --> 01:14:59,500

Red alert, Sector "B".

Don't you hate when that happens?

997
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:10,500
One of my former partners

998
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,500
had the same problem.

999
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:21,000
No! Wait!

1000
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,500
The detonator's armed!

1001

Hey, stop!

So, my lovely lovely.

1017

You intended to kill me

so you could rule my kingdom by yourself?

01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:51,500
No! You need me to get out!

1020
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:53,000
Uhh!

1021
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:59,000
[ chuckling ]

1022
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,500
The portal opens only on a full moon.

1023
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:07,000
And that's tonight.

1024
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Bye-bye.

1025
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,500
[ gears grind ]

1026
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Arklon! Scum of the swamp!

1027
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,500
May tarantulas grow in your mouth!

1029
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Cursed witch!

1030
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Yes, sir.

1031
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
This is a red alert.

1032
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,500
Yes, sir!

1033
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:08,000
Red alert.

1034
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Right.

1035
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,500
Is that clear?

1036
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:12,500
This is a red alert!

1037
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:14,500
I know what a red alert is.

1038
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:17,500
Hi.

1039
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:19,500
We're here to see General Binns.

1040
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:20,500
My father's senator--

1041
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:22,000
Senator or not, lady,

1042
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,000
nobody's getting in during a red alert.

1043
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,500
This is absolutely ridiculous.

1044
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:32,000
Aah!

1045
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,500
Arklon!

1046
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,500
Stop! Stop!

1047
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Don't you know the vulcan death grip

1048
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,500
or something a little less violent?

1049
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,500
What, you again?

1050
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:50,500
At your service.

1051
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,500
Get out of my car!

1052
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:59,500
What do you wish me to do, fly?

1053
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:02,000
You are a witch, aren't you?

1054
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Now, get out!

1055
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,500
You need me to help you find him.

1056
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:07,500
I thought you were on Arklon's side.

1057
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:09,500
I'm on my side, kid.

1058
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:12,500
In your world, I'd be an arbitrage.

1059
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Arklon is going to the portal.

1060
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
That alley that we came through.

1061
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,500
He has two hours after
sundown to pass through,

1062
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:23,500
or it closes on him.

1063
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:25,500
It'll take us that long to get there.

1064
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,500
You better be telling the truth, Witch, or--

1065
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:31,500
I know.
You've cleave my black heart

1066
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,000
from my bosom.

1067
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:35,000
Why does everyone want
to cleave my bosom?

1068
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:36,000
If you ask me,

1069
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:39,000
it cleaves just fine by itself.

1070
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:58,000
We lost the jeep. Inform headquarters.

1071
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,500
Get General Binns

1072
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:01,000
to coordinate with the police.

1073
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Head back to base.

1074
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,500

If you hadn't let him go
in the first place...

1077
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,500
Yeah? I know you lost him.

1078
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:19,000
Well, we're here with General Binns now

1079
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,500
working out a plan.

1080
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:21,500
Uh-huh.

1081
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:22,500
Right?

1082
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,500
Huh? Oh! Yeah.

1083
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:27,000
I'd say, uh...

1084
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,500
oh, about a half hour,

1085
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:32,000
and the whole world, kablooey.

1086
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:36,000
Oh, boy. OK, General.

1087
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,500
OK, the point is,

1088
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:41,000
will you be able to stop the damn thing

1089
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,500
once we find it?

1090
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:43,500
Yeah. Yeah.

1091
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:45,500
Half an hour...

1092
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:48,500
and then, kablooey.

1093
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:50,000
Ohh, jeez.

Look, chief, we're checking the alley

1095
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:53,500
where we found him.

1096
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,500
What are you doing here?
Get down there.

1097
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Move!

1098
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000

You again.

1102

In the name of our father King Zed,

1103
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:44,500
leave this weapon,

1104

The things I could have taught you.

Unfortunately, I don't have the time.

and without you.

to the dusty old desert,

Lyranna, do me a favor, OK?

1125
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:39,500
You have to reach my father Senator Trent.

Ooh, a senator.

OK?

I tell you the truth.

Somebody grab him.

I can't see a thing!

Give me some more light over here!

1142

All right! I want you, you!
Come with me.

Stop firing!

Stop! Stop it!

up the fire escape. Now! Go!

1150
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:41,000
Take him alive!

1151
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:43,000
Do not use your weapons.

1152

Take him alive!

Do not use your weapons.

Do not use your weapons.

No need to panic.

It's just another car.

Uh!

01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,500
What did I tell you?

Hope you've enjoyed
flying Jackie airlines.

Who taught you to operate this thing?

Me.

We lost him.

I want all available choppers

to the north side.

This is a code six. I repeat. Code six.

Let's get out of here. Come on!

01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:27,500
Now...

1181
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:30,000
let us make haste.

Arklon must not be allowed to escape.

01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:52,500
Sounds like Griffith Park to me.

1189
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:54,000
We're on our way.

1190
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
[ rawk ]

1191
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:10,000
[ birds chirping ]

1192
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:18,500
Wait a minute.

1193
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Something's happening.

1194
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:27,000
Animals.

1195
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,500
[ grrr ]

1196
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:34,500
Bingo! It's the zoo.

1197
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:08,000
Oh, Gods of War and Thunder!

1198
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:12,500
Show me the way to my kingdom!

1199
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:15,000
My kingdom!

1200
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,000
[ thunder ]

1201
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,500
You've been spying on
me again, haven't you?

1202
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:42,000
You and I have a score
to settle, little beast.

1203
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Oh, yes.

1204
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Look at these scars you gave me.

1205
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:50,500
Look!

1206
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,500
Sharak was my true brother.

1207
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:16,500
You've followed me for
too long, little brother.

1208
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,500
I think it's time we separate.

1209
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:22,000
He was my friend.

1210
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,500
Ha ha ha!

1211
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Stay here!

1212
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,000
Now it's time to learn

1213
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:22,000
the real power of Arklon, brother.

1214
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,500
Sword to sword, man to man,

1215
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:27,000
for the possession of the device.

1216
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,500
A flair for the dramatics,

1217
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:31,000
I like that.

1218
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,000
Uh!

1219
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,500
Uhh!

1220
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,500
You realize this key

1221
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,000
still has enough power

1222
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:44,500
to ignite the weapon.

1223
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Then we both die.

1224
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:48,500
Yes.

1225
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:49,500
How glorious.

1226
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,000
What a glorious death.

1227
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,500
Think of the multitudes of souls

1228
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:56,000
who we will take to hell with us.

1229
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:56,750
Uh!

1230
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:03,000
It's good to see you again, friend.

1231
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,000
I'd feel better if you'd hold that.

1232
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Now...

1233
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:15,000
shall we continue?

1234
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:20,000
Kodo, Podo.

1235
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,500
[ drum roll ]

1236
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Ladies and gentlemen!

1237
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:35,000
Boys and girls.

1238
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Presenting the two great
beasts of the jungle--

1239
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:43,000
the noblie lion and
the tasmanian hedgehog.

1240
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:46,000
Mortal enemies in the wild,

1241
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:48,000
but here at adventure island,

1242
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:50,500
living in complete harmony.

1243
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:55,000
It's the most exciting live animal act

1244
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:57,000
west of the serengeti.

1245
01:31:57,500 --> 01:31:59,500
Our trainers have worked
long and hard

1246
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:02,500
to overcome their natural animosity.

1247
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:03,500
See how they...

1248
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Aah!

1249
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:06,500
One of us must die.

1250
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,500
It's such a pity it must be you.

1251
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:11,500
We're of the same blood.

1252
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:14,000
Ah, my little brother.

1253
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:20,000
Watch them crawling together
in the center ring.

1254
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,500
Adventure island's most engaging couple.

1255
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:27,000
Let's see if we can get them to kiss.

1256
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:31,500
I cannot believe we come
from the same blood!

1257
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:33,000
Aah!

1258
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:36,000
The hedgehog hasn't had dinner yet.

1259
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,000
I was separated from Zed at birth.

1260
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,500
You were kidnapped by the terrible Zhuns.

1261
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:43,000
I am a Zhun.

1262
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:48,500
I have no brother, only enemies!

1263
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:49,500
Aah!

1264
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
All my enemies have perished.

1265
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:58,500
Dar!

1266
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,500
Now you join them.

1267
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Look down and cast your eyes

1268
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,500
upon death itself.

1269
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:12,500
Uh!

1270
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,500
For the father of death

1271
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:16,000
opens his arms

1272
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,000
and beckons for you to--

1273
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Aah!

1274
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,500
Aah!

1275
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,000
What poetry.

1276
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,500
Perhaps you'd like to recite it again.

1277
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:29,500
Aah!

1278
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:32,000
A little higher this time?

1279
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,500
Aah!

1280
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:40,000
It's not too late to make peace.

1281
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:43,000
Peace is for the weak!

1282
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Aah!

1283
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:46,500
Aah!

1284
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Crawl back with your beasts

1285
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
into the depths of hell!

1286
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:02,000
Don't get--

1287
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Aah!

1288
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:08,500
The world is mine!

1289
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:11,000
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1290
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:28,000
Asshole.

1291
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:39,500
Dar.

1292
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:49,500
Follow me. Let's go.

1293
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:51,000
Move, move, move.

1294
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Got a pretty big cloud forming.

1295
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Check for toxicity.

1296
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:08,500
The bomb.

1297
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:27,500
You worried me, friend.

1298
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:34,000
Halt!

1299
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:35,000
General Binns,

1300
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:36,500
the detonator is here.

1301
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
We have to hurry.

1302
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:51,000
Take care of those animals.

1303
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:52,500
Watch where you step.

1304
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:06,000
Come on. Come on.

1305
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,500
Yeah. Uh-huh.

1306
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,500
See? 30 seconds.

1307
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:16,000
The whole world...

1308
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:18,000
kablooey.

1309
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:20,500
I remember...

1310
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:21,250
Aw.

1311
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
I remember this.

1312
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,500
What are these?

1313
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:32,500
Which one?

1314
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Oh...

1315
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,500
I remember.

1316
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,000
He remembers.

1317
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,500
I think.

1318
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:46,000
He thinks.
He thinks he remembers.

1319
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,000
It's, uh...

1320
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:48,250
ah!

1321
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:52,000
[ beeper ]

1322
01:36:57,500 --> 01:36:58,500
Do something!

1323
01:36:58,500 --> 01:37:01,000
Not a sound.

1324
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:03,250
Oh.

1325
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:13,500
[ beeper stops ]

1326
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:14,500
Yep.

1327
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:15,500
See?

1328
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:17,500
Stopped it.

1329
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,500
Thank you.

1330
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:34,500
You ought to learn a little patience.

1331
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:40,500
I knew this weekend
would turn out like this.

1332
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:43,000
Dar?

1333
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:48,500
Dar?

1334
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:51,000
Bendowski!

1335
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:11,500
Dar?

1336
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:28,500
You have to go back to your world?

1337
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:33,000
This is a great responsibility.

1338
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
It's time someone used it

1339
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,500
for the benefit of my people.

1340
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:46,000
Thank you...

1341
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
for being my friend.

1342
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
More than that.

1343
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:08,000
I almost forgot to give
you your little thieves.

1344
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:09,250
Oh.

1345
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,500
No. I want them to stay with you.

1346
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:17,500
Somebody to keep you out of trouble.

1347
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:20,500
Oh, come on. Me get into trouble?

1348
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:25,000
I guess they don't look
much like rats after all.

1349
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
And you.

1350
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,000
You're just a big pussycat, aren't you?

1351
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,500
Say goodbye.

1352
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,500
Bye, Sharak.

1353
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,500
- I--
- You--

1354
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:50,500
Will you...

1355
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,500
I mean, after you
straighten things out

1356
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:55,500
in your world,

1357
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
think you might come back sometime?

1358
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:01,500
I would like that very much.

1359
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,000
And...

1360
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
I have the key.

1361
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:41,500
Wait!

1362
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:03,000
Oh, Kodo and Podo!

1363
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,500
Talk about your wild weekends.

1364
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:08,500
This one goes down in the record book.

1365
01:41:08,500 --> 01:41:10,500
A sword fight to the death,

1366
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:13,500
thermonuclear destruction,

1367
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:15,000
time travel to a land

1368
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:18,500
that doesn't have gas stations.

1369
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:22,000
I mean, how much fun can a girl take?

1370
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,000
I know.

1371
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:30,000
I'm going to miss him, too.

1372
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:35,000
He was really something special.

1373
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:57,500
Good day, brother.

1374
01:41:57,500 --> 01:42:00,500
It seems you've
travelled a long distance.

1375
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:02,500
You'll never know.

1376
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:06,000
What brings you to this forsaken desert?

1377
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,500
My brothers and I are on a pilgrimage.

1378
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:14,000
We've come to worship the
sacred object left by the gods.

1379
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:22,000
No one knows what it is

1380
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,500
or how it works,

1381
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:27,000
but everyone wants to possess it.

1382
01:42:30,500 --> 01:42:32,500
[ rock 'n' roll plays ]

1383
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Rock 'n' roll.

1384
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Rock 'n' roll.

1385
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:43,500
Rock 'n' roll.

1386
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:49,000
Rock 'n' roll.

1387
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
- Rock 'n' roll.
- Rock 'n' roll.

1388
