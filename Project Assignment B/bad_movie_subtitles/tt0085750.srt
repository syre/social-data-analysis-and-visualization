1
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,409
(Crunch)

2
00:03:10,831 --> 00:03:13,118
(Highest girl) Come on, slow poke!

3
00:03:13,164 --> 00:03:16,499
Don't lean forward!
Don't lean forward!

4
00:03:16,543 --> 00:03:19,498
(Laughing)

5
00:03:27,845 --> 00:03:31,629
(Man) Come on, Overman.
Give us a break, will you?

6
00:03:32,641 --> 00:03:35,013
Look at the clown
in the jockey shorts!

7
00:03:35,059 --> 00:03:36,886
Kelly, come on. Pay attention.

8
00:03:36,936 --> 00:03:38,894
Hey, girls!

9
00:03:40,482 --> 00:03:42,972
Do it like this! Ooh!

10
00:03:49,823 --> 00:03:52,824
(Man) Damn it, Kelly! Do the job!

11
00:03:52,868 --> 00:03:55,655
Next time we're goin'
right into the lagoon.

12
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:58,194
The lagoon is my favourite! (Laughs)

13
00:04:02,294 --> 00:04:06,291
Damn boat.
I flooded the... Damn boat!

14
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,209
(Girl) Come on, Richie.
I got a date tonight!

15
00:04:09,258 --> 00:04:11,085
(Skier) Through the gate!

16
00:04:13,262 --> 00:04:15,549
(Richie) Come on, baby.

17
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:22,059
OK, guys, here we go.

18
00:04:24,272 --> 00:04:26,477
Oh! That's right. Good.

19
00:04:38,367 --> 00:04:41,865
(Woman) You've been chosen
for your neatness,

20
00:04:41,912 --> 00:04:45,364
courtesy toward others
and your Southern grace.

21
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:49,993
We enforce our dress code here,
so keep your hair and nails trimmed.

22
00:04:50,044 --> 00:04:52,714
And, please,
don't alter your costumes.

23
00:04:52,755 --> 00:04:55,876
Once you've got your Sea World
guide apparel,

24
00:04:55,925 --> 00:04:58,296
the shorts are short enough.

25
00:04:58,344 --> 00:04:59,541
(Girl giggles)

26
00:04:59,595 --> 00:05:03,178
Show any cheek and you'll be back
shovellin' french fries.

27
00:05:03,223 --> 00:05:04,255
(Girls giggling)

28
00:05:04,307 --> 00:05:09,431
Now, let's continue with our welcome
speech again. All together now.

29
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:11,685
(All) Welcome to Sea World,

30
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,851
the world's largest marine life park.

31
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,396
Above and below the surface
of our unique Undersea Kingdom...

32
00:05:21,031 --> 00:05:23,070
(Man) The park opens on Saturday.

33
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:26,864
All this week has been,
and continues to be, preview week,

34
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,955
during which family and friends
attend Sea World as our guests.

35
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:33,241
This is the Undersea Kingdom,

36
00:05:33,293 --> 00:05:37,503
four years under construction,
at a cost of more than $34 million.

37
00:05:37,547 --> 00:05:41,330
Four pressurised viewing tunnels
radiate out into the lagoon.

38
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:45,427
There's the Sunken Spanish Galleon,
Jonah's Marine Fun House,

39
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:49,717
the Deepwater Coral Forest,
all connected to Central Control.

40
00:05:49,765 --> 00:05:54,013
And a deluxe restaurant and lounge,
all 4O feet below the surface.

41
00:05:54,061 --> 00:05:56,731
The complex is built
in our manmade lagoon,

42
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,559
which connects to the ocean
by a deep channel.

43
00:05:59,608 --> 00:06:02,727
The new additions to Sea World
are the brainchild

44
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:05,399
of entrepreneur Calvin Bouchard.

45
00:06:10,368 --> 00:06:12,159
(Kelly) Hi, guys!

46
00:06:12,203 --> 00:06:14,409
(Girl) Now you can close the gate.

47
00:06:19,543 --> 00:06:21,500
(Gate motor whirring)

48
00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:36,381
(Thud)

49
00:06:36,433 --> 00:06:37,594
(Man) Jesus!

50
00:06:38,936 --> 00:06:42,350
Overman, I thought you said
those tracks were secure.

51
00:06:42,397 --> 00:06:44,721
Hey, I welded
the damn thing myself.

52
00:06:44,774 --> 00:06:47,098
(Worker) Something's
hung the gate up.

53
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:50,020
(2nd worker) Better get Brody.
He'll be pissed.

54
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,565
Whoo!

55
00:06:51,613 --> 00:06:54,364
(Guy) Here's the lagoon.
Set up for the turn.

56
00:06:54,408 --> 00:06:57,776
(PR man) I call your attention
to the Sea World skiers,

57
00:06:57,827 --> 00:06:59,452
who are entering the lagoon

58
00:06:59,495 --> 00:07:02,069
in a preview
of the opening day ceremonies.

59
00:07:02,123 --> 00:07:04,661
(Reporters chattering, indistinct)

60
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:06,748
Here come my pride and joy.

61
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:10,915
(Female reporter)
Can we talk to Mr Bouchard?

62
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:14,168
- Beautiful. Just beautiful!
- (Girl skier) Hi!

63
00:07:14,217 --> 00:07:16,174
(Man)... this exciting complex.

64
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:20,715
We WOULD like to avoid
references to his colourful past.

65
00:07:20,765 --> 00:07:24,098
(Woman) Did the Undersea Kingdom
really cost $30 million?

66
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:26,017
Aren't those kids great?

67
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:29,893
Mr Bouchard, is there anything
special goin' on openin' day?

68
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:34,268
Well, this afternoon, at the main
gate, we'll be pleased to announce...

69
00:07:34,318 --> 00:07:36,940
the welcomin' of Mr Philip FitzRoyce.

70
00:07:36,987 --> 00:07:39,027
Oh, really? Is that true?

71
00:07:39,073 --> 00:07:42,655
No lie, he gonna be here.
Now, we got drinks at the bar.

72
00:07:42,701 --> 00:07:44,492
They free. Come on, follow me.

73
00:07:44,536 --> 00:07:45,651
(Reporters laugh)

74
00:07:51,043 --> 00:07:53,961
- What's it look like?
- It's off the track.

75
00:07:54,004 --> 00:07:57,753
- How'd that happen?
- I can't tell, but she is jammed.

76
00:07:57,799 --> 00:07:59,626
Just wouldn't close, Mike.

77
00:07:59,675 --> 00:08:01,419
(Overman) Now what do we do?

78
00:08:01,469 --> 00:08:04,920
Somethin' knocked the
son-of-a-bitch right off the track.

79
00:08:04,972 --> 00:08:07,178
Just secure the damn gate, all right?

80
00:08:07,225 --> 00:08:10,225
- Think you can handle that?
- On overtime, maybe.

81
00:08:10,267 --> 00:08:12,261
You got enough overtime.

82
00:08:12,313 --> 00:08:14,850
- Your party.
- You buy the beer, Brody.

83
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:16,641
Well, look, you're in charge.

84
00:08:16,691 --> 00:08:19,857
See you guys later.
I got more important things to do.

85
00:08:19,902 --> 00:08:24,195
- No overtime.
- OK. See you, Mike.

86
00:08:24,239 --> 00:08:26,909
(Shouting) No overtime!

87
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,987
(All shouting, laughing) No overtime!

88
00:08:31,288 --> 00:08:34,454
(Dolphins clicking)

89
00:08:41,296 --> 00:08:43,622
(Clicking loudly)

90
00:08:47,553 --> 00:08:49,710
(Clicking continues)

91
00:08:52,348 --> 00:08:56,726
(Dolphins clicking, cage rattling)

92
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,725
Hi, Mike.

93
00:09:02,607 --> 00:09:04,896
- Oh. Ah. Hey, Dan.
- Hey.

94
00:09:04,943 --> 00:09:06,402
Havin' gate problems?

95
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:08,770
The dolphins tried
to open them again.

96
00:09:08,822 --> 00:09:11,147
- Where's the boss?
- Up with Shamu.

97
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:12,478
Thanks.

98
00:09:13,784 --> 00:09:16,110
(Woman) Come on, Cindy.

99
00:09:16,162 --> 00:09:19,531
Come on, Sandy. Come on.

100
00:09:19,582 --> 00:09:22,996
- Hey, Liz.
- Hey. Come on.

101
00:09:23,042 --> 00:09:25,913
It's the boss hard hat.
Where's your boots?

102
00:09:25,962 --> 00:09:28,370
I only wear 'em to bed
and in the shower.

103
00:09:28,424 --> 00:09:30,996
- Where's Kay?
- She's down that way.

104
00:09:41,184 --> 00:09:45,264
Yee-hah! Ride 'em, cowgirl.

105
00:09:46,481 --> 00:09:48,390
- Hi, Mike!
- Hey!

106
00:09:48,441 --> 00:09:51,810
- I'll be with you in a minute.
- All right.

107
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,734
Use your spurs.

108
00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:56,235
Hey, Liz!

109
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:05,788
Good boy. That was nice!

110
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,369
- Hey.
- Hey!

111
00:10:10,168 --> 00:10:15,508
Liz, he did that great. I don't wanna
do it again. Do me a favour.

112
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:18,384
Put Cindy and Sandy
in the lagoon for a run.

113
00:10:18,426 --> 00:10:20,253
OK.

114
00:10:20,305 --> 00:10:22,592
- How you doin'?
- Great.

115
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:24,631
Hey, you. Come here.

116
00:10:24,682 --> 00:10:26,390
(Shamu squeaks)

117
00:10:26,433 --> 00:10:30,218
Come here, kiddo.
That's the feeding place.

118
00:10:33,274 --> 00:10:35,847
- Is this whale house-broken yet?
- Nope.

119
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,234
- Then he can't come to dinner.
- You takin' me to dinner?

120
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,986
Soon as we pick up my brother.

121
00:10:41,031 --> 00:10:42,489
When's Sean coming?

122
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:44,940
We're gonna meet him
at the main gate.

123
00:10:44,992 --> 00:10:46,272
(Dan) Kathy.

124
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,828
Cindy and Sandy don't wanna go.

125
00:10:49,873 --> 00:10:52,790
Am I gonna lose you
to a couple of neurotic fish?

126
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,956
- Mammals.
- Mammals. Mammals.

127
00:10:55,002 --> 00:10:56,958
(Dan) Something's bugging 'em.

128
00:10:57,003 --> 00:11:01,214
It's play time. They'll be
beggin' us tomorrow. Put 'em up.

129
00:11:01,257 --> 00:11:02,668
You got it.

130
00:11:02,716 --> 00:11:05,753
- I'm begging you tonight.
- You don't have to beg.

131
00:11:05,802 --> 00:11:07,179
Take me to dinner!

132
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,177
All right. Let's try sushi.

133
00:11:09,222 --> 00:11:11,547
- Mike!
- I'll change.

134
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,089
Come here. Who's a good boy?

135
00:11:14,143 --> 00:11:16,848
Are you a good boy?
Yes, you're a good boy.

136
00:11:16,896 --> 00:11:17,975
(Shamu gurgles)

137
00:11:18,022 --> 00:11:21,023
And you get a fish.

138
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:24,270
(Calvin) Ladies and gentlemen,
here he is now.

139
00:11:27,572 --> 00:11:32,199
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Philip
FitzRoyce, with a capital R,

140
00:11:32,244 --> 00:11:37,237
is here to film us, meet our resident
day scientific staff.

141
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,501
- Hey, what's this?
- Oh, no.

142
00:11:43,545 --> 00:11:45,703
Philip the Great.

143
00:11:45,755 --> 00:11:48,793
I am able to combine
business with pleasure,

144
00:11:48,843 --> 00:11:52,460
which, they tell me, is the secret
to a long and happy life.

145
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:55,428
- What, FitzRoyce?
- Mmm.

146
00:11:55,472 --> 00:11:57,714
Sure is.

147
00:11:57,767 --> 00:12:01,101
Any further questions,
in the bar, if you please.

148
00:12:01,145 --> 00:12:02,936
For the first one who buys.

149
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,728
- Look at Calvin. Best of buddies.
- Ah, best of friends.

150
00:12:06,817 --> 00:12:09,023
(Mike) A regular Barnum and Bailey.

151
00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:12,104
(Kay) I'm sure they'll
be very happy together.

152
00:12:12,156 --> 00:12:15,274
Perfect.
Into the Undersea Kingdom they go.

153
00:12:15,324 --> 00:12:16,949
(Chuckle)

154
00:12:16,993 --> 00:12:18,737
Hey, Mikey!

155
00:12:18,786 --> 00:12:21,407
- Hey, hey! Hey!
- Oh!

156
00:12:21,455 --> 00:12:23,578
- How you doin'?
- All right!

157
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:26,790
- My brother, the cowboy.
- Hey! Hug me, huh?

158
00:12:26,834 --> 00:12:28,460
- Oh, OK.
- Hey.

159
00:12:28,502 --> 00:12:30,459
(Kay shrieks)

160
00:12:30,504 --> 00:12:34,336
You put on weight, you need a shave
and you're too tall.

161
00:12:34,384 --> 00:12:36,590
Well, two out of three I can fix.

162
00:12:36,635 --> 00:12:39,802
(Laughs) Get that gear
and let's go. Come on.

163
00:12:39,848 --> 00:12:43,346
- So, nice boots.
- Thanks! Aw, gee.

164
00:12:43,392 --> 00:12:45,468
How'd you do on your finals?

165
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,219
Great. A gentleman's "C,"
an incomplete, but I aced Phys Ed.

166
00:12:49,272 --> 00:12:50,932
- (Kay) A real Einstein.
- Glad you're here.

167
00:14:08,594 --> 00:14:10,835
(Thud)

168
00:14:14,475 --> 00:14:16,383
(Thud)

169
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:29,816
There you go, Charlene.

170
00:14:29,863 --> 00:14:33,648
- (Man) Shelby showed up yet?
- (2nd man) Haven't seen him.

171
00:14:33,701 --> 00:14:35,443
(Woman) What are they doing?

172
00:14:35,493 --> 00:14:38,244
(Man) Kelly's really
gettin' this one down.

173
00:14:38,288 --> 00:14:42,368
(Woman) See that big guy? He gets
knocked on his ass every time.

174
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,374
(Woman laughs)

175
00:14:45,628 --> 00:14:47,952
- All right, Charlene.
- All right!

176
00:14:48,005 --> 00:14:51,540
Here, let me help you out.
Work with me, work with me.

177
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:52,919
Let's go.

178
00:14:52,967 --> 00:14:55,637
- There we go.
- Wait. One more.

179
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:57,587
- Hey, Mike.
- All right. Yeah?

180
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:59,796
Is Shelby workin' overtime?

181
00:14:59,849 --> 00:15:02,766
Not on my say-so.
He was supposed to knock off.

182
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,636
Have you met my kid brother?

183
00:15:04,686 --> 00:15:07,853
If he's messin' with that bitch
at the souvenir stand,

184
00:15:07,898 --> 00:15:09,440
it's gonna be his ass.

185
00:15:09,482 --> 00:15:12,816
- You tell him.
- Charlene, I'm not his mother.

186
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,815
- You're his boss.
- Yeah, ask Woodbury, OK?

187
00:15:20,535 --> 00:15:22,609
(Man) Come on, Kelly. You can do it!

188
00:15:23,413 --> 00:15:25,737
- They're playing stand-off.
- Uh-oh.

189
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:30,368
My brother considers himself the
stand-off champion of New England.

190
00:15:30,418 --> 00:15:32,291
And the western states.

191
00:15:32,336 --> 00:15:35,087
- Go get 'em.
- (Growls)

192
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:37,836
(Whooping, laughter)

193
00:15:37,883 --> 00:15:40,635
Hey, I wasn't ready!

194
00:15:42,512 --> 00:15:46,723
I tell you, it's a game of balance.
I told you he'd fall on his ass.

195
00:15:46,767 --> 00:15:49,851
(Man) Hey, who's this guy?

196
00:15:54,065 --> 00:15:56,022
This is for beers. You buyin'?

197
00:15:56,067 --> 00:15:57,976
Ready?

198
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:16,165
My fly's open. (Chuckles)

199
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,996
(Bystanders gasping)

200
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:22,167
- No fair!
- (Guy) Whooo!

201
00:16:22,216 --> 00:16:24,458
Well, it's, uh...

202
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:28,293
not only a game of balance,
it's a game of deception.

203
00:16:28,347 --> 00:16:32,806
Come on, I'll buy you two
and the one you owe me.

204
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:35,092
- OK.
- All right.

205
00:16:35,145 --> 00:16:38,310
(Bystander) All right.
(Girl) See you later, Kelly.

206
00:16:38,354 --> 00:16:41,189
Hey, I want you.
Come on, right now! Let's go.

207
00:16:43,151 --> 00:16:45,820
- Kathryn, Mike.
- (Mike) Hi.

208
00:16:45,862 --> 00:16:48,945
- You know each other?
- I see my brother nailed you.

209
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,780
- Your brother?
- Yeah.

210
00:16:50,824 --> 00:16:54,159
Without that old crotch trick,
he'd never have won.

211
00:16:54,204 --> 00:16:57,121
- That's his best move.
- Runs in the family.

212
00:16:57,165 --> 00:16:58,823
Well, it worked.

213
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:02,409
- What are we drinkin'?
- Champagne of the working classes.

214
00:17:02,461 --> 00:17:05,875
- Beer. You owe me a couple.
- That's right. Comin' up.

215
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,922
Two beers.
So, you work at the park, huh?

216
00:17:08,966 --> 00:17:11,801
- Mm-hmm. I'm a water skier.
- Oh.

217
00:17:11,845 --> 00:17:14,798
(Laughs) Your brother's cute.

218
00:17:14,847 --> 00:17:19,757
Yeah. Him and Kathryn have, uh, been
together for a year and a half.

219
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,636
How about you?

220
00:17:22,938 --> 00:17:25,510
Desperately unattached.

221
00:17:25,564 --> 00:17:28,137
Lonely, confused.

222
00:17:29,235 --> 00:17:33,101
Generous and loving to a fault.
It's all in my eyes.

223
00:17:35,782 --> 00:17:36,897
(Man) Come on.
(2nd man) OK.

224
00:17:36,951 --> 00:17:39,239
We'll cop a lot of
good stuff tonight.

225
00:17:39,285 --> 00:17:41,657
- I've got the tanks.
- Shh!

226
00:17:41,705 --> 00:17:44,408
- Is the van OK here?
- Yes, it's OK.

227
00:17:44,457 --> 00:17:48,502
We're off Sea World property.
Nobody uses this road.

228
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,916
Shh!

229
00:17:54,966 --> 00:17:56,626
Yeah.

230
00:17:57,885 --> 00:17:59,794
Yeah.

231
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:03,297
Climb over the fence,
and take it easy with the raft.

232
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:04,677
(Clatter)

233
00:18:04,726 --> 00:18:06,350
(Whispering) Damn it!

234
00:18:07,394 --> 00:18:09,304
You asshole.

235
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:12,225
Now we gotta drag it
all the way down to the water!

236
00:18:12,899 --> 00:18:16,482
- Ready to go?
- OK. Who's payin'?

237
00:18:23,201 --> 00:18:24,659
Ah.

238
00:18:35,503 --> 00:18:39,832
- Watch out. Snakes.
- Oh, come on. Don't bullshit me.

239
00:18:39,882 --> 00:18:41,792
Chicken, huh?

240
00:18:49,641 --> 00:18:51,051
- (Croaks)
- (Man gasps)

241
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,888
All right, steady.

242
00:18:53,935 --> 00:18:56,723
- Steady.
- Got it.

243
00:18:56,772 --> 00:18:58,848
OK. Here we go.

244
00:18:58,899 --> 00:19:01,307
- Come on, paddle!
- I am.

245
00:19:02,653 --> 00:19:04,894
Let's go out to the centre.

246
00:19:04,947 --> 00:19:07,070
I sure hope this is worth it.

247
00:19:12,871 --> 00:19:15,622
- (Laughing)
- (Mike groaning)

248
00:19:15,664 --> 00:19:19,080
- Hey, Kelly, is this your car?
- Sure is.

249
00:19:19,126 --> 00:19:21,332
Hey. Get off of there!

250
00:19:21,378 --> 00:19:23,537
(Moaning, groaning)

251
00:19:23,588 --> 00:19:25,794
- You wanna take a walk?
- Yeah.

252
00:19:25,841 --> 00:19:28,509
Hey, what about baby brother?

253
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,839
- Aww!
- Aww!

254
00:19:30,887 --> 00:19:32,880
Little baby brother.

255
00:19:32,931 --> 00:19:36,631
Kelly, can you give him a ride home,
or shall I call his mommy?

256
00:19:36,685 --> 00:19:40,551
- Nah, if he'll come quietly.
- No way. I scream and shout.

257
00:19:40,604 --> 00:19:43,225
Oh, God, it stinks out here.
Let's get away!

258
00:19:43,273 --> 00:19:46,273
- See ya.
- Hey, let's go swimming.

259
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:50,944
- N-no, I hate the ocean.
- Aww! Hey, I've got a better idea.

260
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:54,274
- Like lagoons?
- Lagoons?

261
00:19:54,324 --> 00:19:56,946
- Lagoons.
- (She laughs)

262
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:58,239
(Engine starts)

263
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:07,292
Oh. How come Sean
doesn't visit more?

264
00:20:07,338 --> 00:20:09,377
- He hates the water.
- What?

265
00:20:09,422 --> 00:20:15,505
Yeah. Remember that shark attack I
told you about when we were in Amity?

266
00:20:15,553 --> 00:20:18,969
Well, that's why he goes
to school in Colorado.

267
00:20:19,015 --> 00:20:22,549
If our parents didn't live
on an island, he'd never get wet.

268
00:20:22,601 --> 00:20:25,305
- (She laughs)
- My dad, he's the same way.

269
00:20:27,896 --> 00:20:29,889
God, I love this place.

270
00:20:30,901 --> 00:20:33,936
I hated it when we first came here.

271
00:20:33,987 --> 00:20:35,943
What's the matter?

272
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,482
Did you get a telephone call?

273
00:20:43,245 --> 00:20:45,153
Venezuela?

274
00:20:46,706 --> 00:20:49,824
Guess I'm gonna have to start
learning Spanish.

275
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:53,210
- Ooh, baby.
- Yeah. Yeah.

276
00:20:53,254 --> 00:20:57,038
That's wonderful. That's wonderful.

277
00:20:57,091 --> 00:20:59,048
Oh, shit.

278
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:02,424
Reality.

279
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:05,762
How long?

280
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:08,381
Just a short year and a half.

281
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,893
I'd love you to come, you know.

282
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,898
Yeah.

283
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:23,810
But what about the six months
I've got left here

284
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:27,149
and the job opening up
at the Scripps Institute?

285
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,119
What about that? Huh?

286
00:21:30,162 --> 00:21:34,325
Simple. Just give up your life
and follow me.

287
00:21:34,374 --> 00:21:35,998
(She laughs)

288
00:21:37,835 --> 00:21:42,413
- Oh, I'm happy for you. I am.
- I know you are.

289
00:21:43,883 --> 00:21:45,959
What are we gonna do?

290
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:54,430
- Aha.
- Mm-hmm.

291
00:22:02,484 --> 00:22:04,392
(Both chuckling)

292
00:22:14,244 --> 00:22:16,152
- Ooh!
- (Laughs)

293
00:22:22,417 --> 00:22:24,327
(Chuckles)

294
00:22:25,212 --> 00:22:27,170
Come on.

295
00:22:27,214 --> 00:22:31,378
- Oh, I don't go in the water.
- You don't swim?

296
00:22:31,426 --> 00:22:33,835
Not even with friends?

297
00:22:33,887 --> 00:22:38,464
Oh, uh, I swim.
I just, uh, I... I...

298
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:43,141
(Sighs) It's something that happened
when I was a kid.

299
00:22:43,187 --> 00:22:46,105
I don't go in the water.
(Laughs awkwardly)

300
00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:47,940
Hmm.

301
00:22:47,983 --> 00:22:51,185
I bet I can overcome
your childhood fears.

302
00:22:58,493 --> 00:23:00,531
I bet you can.

303
00:23:02,871 --> 00:23:04,780
Come on.

304
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:07,914
My boots!

305
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:10,664
Kick 'em off, cowboy.

306
00:23:18,469 --> 00:23:23,546
- Kelly!
- Come on in, Sean. It's fun.

307
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,390
Come on.

308
00:23:29,229 --> 00:23:31,187
- Here?
- Yeah, OK.

309
00:23:31,231 --> 00:23:34,147
Somewhere down there
is the best coral.

310
00:23:34,191 --> 00:23:38,355
A guy in Miami will give us
$200 for the good stuff.

311
00:23:38,403 --> 00:23:41,154
Put it in the basket.
I'll pull it up.

312
00:23:54,126 --> 00:23:57,043
(Kelly laughing in distance)

313
00:24:03,176 --> 00:24:05,050
Come on, hurry, Randy.

314
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:22,267
I love this park at night.
It's so deserted.

315
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:23,777
Yeah. So quiet.

316
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,441
Wait a second.
Isn't that Kelly's car?

317
00:24:26,489 --> 00:24:28,363
Stop, stop, stop. Shh! Wait a second.

318
00:24:28,408 --> 00:24:30,862
Stop.

319
00:24:35,831 --> 00:24:37,740
Shh.

320
00:24:48,426 --> 00:24:50,334
(Giggling)

321
00:25:04,441 --> 00:25:06,563
I don't believe it.

322
00:25:06,609 --> 00:25:08,981
She got him in the water.

323
00:25:09,028 --> 00:25:11,732
Never underestimate the power, huh?

324
00:25:26,836 --> 00:25:31,544
Attention. You, in the water. You are
trespassing on Sea World property.

325
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:35,835
Come out of the water with your hands
raised high above your head.

326
00:25:35,885 --> 00:25:37,924
I'm OK. My brother works here.

327
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:42,548
Uh, I'm Kelly Ann Bukowski,
from the ski team.

328
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:44,842
You turkeys have any ID?

329
00:25:44,893 --> 00:25:47,645
Wait a minute.

330
00:25:47,688 --> 00:25:49,931
- Mike? Kay?
- Brother?

331
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:52,733
Mr Bullhorn sees all, knows all!

332
00:25:52,776 --> 00:25:54,567
Dead is what you are!

333
00:25:54,611 --> 00:25:57,611
You keep your hands
to yourself, young m...

334
00:25:57,654 --> 00:26:00,276
- (Kelly screeches)
- Here, take this.

335
00:26:00,324 --> 00:26:02,400
(Mike) Yell for mother!

336
00:26:04,536 --> 00:26:06,909
(Mike, Sean shouting, indistinct)

337
00:26:06,955 --> 00:26:09,410
Finish up down there, damn it!

338
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:12,161
Come on, Randy.
We gotta get outta here!

339
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:14,582
- (Muffled thud)
- Now what?

340
00:26:18,091 --> 00:26:19,998
Ow!

341
00:26:29,476 --> 00:26:31,099
(Shouts)

342
00:26:32,311 --> 00:26:34,185
(Kelly) Mike!

343
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,646
(Girls screeching)

344
00:26:37,693 --> 00:26:39,649
(Kelly yelling, indistinct)

345
00:26:39,692 --> 00:26:42,564
(Yelling, screaming)

346
00:26:44,489 --> 00:26:46,814
- (Kay) You cheater!
- (Screams)

347
00:26:51,997 --> 00:26:54,486
(Sean) That's what you are! Dead!

348
00:26:58,085 --> 00:27:01,204
Some guys can sleep in
in the morning.

349
00:27:01,255 --> 00:27:04,505
Some of us have to
be at work early. Good morning.

350
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:09,045
Some of us don't have to baby-sit a
park full of slugs and fishes either.

351
00:27:09,095 --> 00:27:11,799
Yes, we just live
like slugs and fishes.

352
00:27:11,848 --> 00:27:15,132
The dog does not
eat on the counter.

353
00:27:15,183 --> 00:27:19,477
(Groans) I put your wet clothes
in the dryer, sweetie.

354
00:27:19,523 --> 00:27:22,523
- Thanks.
- Mmm. What are we eating?

355
00:27:22,566 --> 00:27:24,642
Mmm. Thank you.

356
00:27:26,069 --> 00:27:29,022
Hey, is this my beeper
or your beeper?

357
00:27:29,071 --> 00:27:32,523
- I dunno. I'll use this beeper.
- Use that beeper.

358
00:27:32,575 --> 00:27:33,985
Talk to you later.

359
00:27:34,034 --> 00:27:36,359
I'll have my beeper
beep your beeper.

360
00:27:36,411 --> 00:27:39,247
I'll have my beeper
beep your beeper back.

361
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,698
- Bye.
- See you later.

362
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:44,120
Aye.

363
00:27:45,169 --> 00:27:46,248
Coffee?

364
00:27:46,295 --> 00:27:49,380
Just throw it in my eyes,
it'll work faster.

365
00:27:49,424 --> 00:27:52,176
That's what happens
when you stay up all night

366
00:27:52,218 --> 00:27:54,212
workin' out childhood phobias.

367
00:27:54,262 --> 00:27:56,931
That's right.
Make fun of your baby brother.

368
00:27:56,973 --> 00:28:00,388
I was this close to doing it
in the water last night,

369
00:28:00,433 --> 00:28:01,762
and that's a first.

370
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:04,810
- This close, huh?
- Shut up!

371
00:28:04,853 --> 00:28:06,811
(Laughs)

372
00:28:06,856 --> 00:28:09,642
Sorry. I didn't know it was therapy.

373
00:28:09,692 --> 00:28:11,731
Just admit it. You messed me up.

374
00:28:11,777 --> 00:28:15,146
I admit it. I messed you up.

375
00:28:15,197 --> 00:28:18,151
Is everything all right
with you and Kathryn?

376
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:19,859
(Phone)

377
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:22,234
Hello? Yes, sir.

378
00:28:26,499 --> 00:28:29,417
Calvin, I had my crew
on that yesterday.

379
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,543
Well, I know.
I don't want that to happen either.

380
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:34,415
(Sighs) Tomorrow.

381
00:28:35,924 --> 00:28:39,174
OK, OK. Calvin, I'll be right there.

382
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:42,883
- The boss, right?
- I gotta go to work.

383
00:28:45,475 --> 00:28:48,925
- Yeah, can't do better than that!
- Really.

384
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,682
(Squeaking)

385
00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:54,351
Yeah. Yeah!

386
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,103
Who's a good girl? That's my baby.

387
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,109
(Dan) Kay?

388
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,727
(Kay) How are Cindy and Sandy?

389
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:05,065
Well, Cindy's OK,
but Sandy's still nervous.

390
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:11,110
(Kay) Don't quit, Danny.
He can go higher.

391
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:15,999
(Kay) That's it!

392
00:29:19,214 --> 00:29:21,171
OK, girls. There are my girls.

393
00:29:21,216 --> 00:29:24,916
Thank you. Come on. Ready... and go!

394
00:29:24,969 --> 00:29:26,842
That's it.

395
00:29:28,222 --> 00:29:31,839
What is this?
You ready? I said go!

396
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:36,933
If those are the best behaviours,
I'd hate to see the worst.

397
00:29:38,273 --> 00:29:40,181
May I help you?

398
00:29:40,233 --> 00:29:42,273
Are you looking for somebody?

399
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:46,481
No, I don't think you can.
I'm looking for someone in authority.

400
00:29:46,529 --> 00:29:49,734
Well, I'm Dr Morgan,
the senior biologist.

401
00:29:49,783 --> 00:29:52,024
Oh.

402
00:29:52,077 --> 00:29:53,405
Really?

403
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:59,246
Charming. Philip FitzRoyce.

404
00:29:59,292 --> 00:30:01,165
I know you. I know your work.

405
00:30:01,211 --> 00:30:04,910
We were at that Law of the Sea
Conference together last summer.

406
00:30:04,963 --> 00:30:07,170
Right. Helsinki. Save the Whales.

407
00:30:07,216 --> 00:30:09,172
They made a hero out of me.

408
00:30:09,217 --> 00:30:13,961
You know what I never understood?
Why did you ram that Japanese whaler?

409
00:30:14,013 --> 00:30:18,306
(Chuckles) Because he got in my way,
ruined my best shot.

410
00:30:18,351 --> 00:30:21,351
Yeah. I was impressed.

411
00:30:23,771 --> 00:30:28,480
Good. Then perhaps we can have
a drink and some dinner tonight?

412
00:30:29,777 --> 00:30:34,523
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr FitzRoyce, but...
that's a behaviour I just don't do.

413
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,859
Nice spins, Danny.
I'll meet you at the holding tank.

414
00:30:42,456 --> 00:30:44,366
Hey, aqua girl!

415
00:30:44,416 --> 00:30:47,831
- Hi, Mike!
- Five.

416
00:30:59,263 --> 00:31:00,544
(Grunts)

417
00:31:00,597 --> 00:31:03,469
He don't sleep in, he don't live in.

418
00:31:03,518 --> 00:31:06,222
Tell Shelby Overman
he can take a flyin' leap

419
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:09,601
at a rollin' doughnut on a gravel
driveway, you hear?

420
00:31:09,647 --> 00:31:12,221
Hold it.
Didn't he come home last night?

421
00:31:12,274 --> 00:31:14,730
- No.
- He didn't show up here either.

422
00:31:14,777 --> 00:31:18,691
- I figure he's home hung over.
- I don't want him around my place!

423
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,566
He's gone. You take his stuff.

424
00:31:20,616 --> 00:31:22,571
Charlene, what's goin' on, huh?

425
00:31:22,618 --> 00:31:26,696
- Shelby Overman's AWOL again.
- Oh, no. I'm sorry.

426
00:31:26,746 --> 00:31:29,913
- What, is this all his stuff?
- Yeah. Doesn't figure.

427
00:31:29,957 --> 00:31:33,623
He left his passport and his...
and his credit cards.

428
00:31:33,669 --> 00:31:36,706
Driver's licence, pawn tickets.

429
00:31:36,755 --> 00:31:40,205
I don't think he could have been
planning to go too far.

430
00:31:40,258 --> 00:31:43,211
You don't think
something happened to him?

431
00:31:43,261 --> 00:31:46,759
No. No, look.
He is curled up, drunk someplace.

432
00:31:46,805 --> 00:31:49,095
When I find him,
he's in deep trouble.

433
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:51,928
We'll let you know
as soon as we hear anything.

434
00:31:51,978 --> 00:31:55,063
- Wanna help me out?
- Yeah. Take care, Charlene.

435
00:31:55,106 --> 00:31:57,561
- Help me look in the lagoon?
- You bet.

436
00:31:57,607 --> 00:32:01,106
Hey, I'm mad at that old boy,
but I don't mean him any harm.

437
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:03,560
You hear me?
I don't mean him any harm!

438
00:32:10,786 --> 00:32:13,111
Down a little more.

439
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:15,121
Turn it.

440
00:32:18,584 --> 00:32:20,791
Batteries are fully charged, Mike.

441
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:23,327
- Thank you, Danny.
- Thanks, Danny.

442
00:32:25,175 --> 00:32:28,589
Control room, submersible
is now entering the lagoon.

443
00:32:28,636 --> 00:32:32,005
- Roger.
- I can monitor it from here.

- OK, Dr Morgan.

470
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:11,945
'Grab your ABS bottles, Kay.
Let's go.'

471
00:35:11,994 --> 00:35:13,700
'OK, sweetie.'

472
00:36:05,499 --> 00:36:07,456
(Squeaks excitedly)

473
00:36:12,381 --> 00:36:14,291
(Squeaks)

474
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,641
(Muffled scream)

475
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:36,981
(Muffled exchange)

476
00:36:48,163 --> 00:36:51,163
(Mike, Kay, muffled) 'Go! Go! '

477
00:37:13,521 --> 00:37:16,437
(Kay) Mike! Quick! Mike!

478
00:37:32,912 --> 00:37:34,988
- The gate! Get the gate!
- Shark!

479
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:36,829
- God!
- What's happening?

480
00:37:42,129 --> 00:37:44,369
(Dan) Close, damn it! Close!

481
00:37:46,049 --> 00:37:47,709
Shit!

482
00:37:47,759 --> 00:37:50,463
- Oh, God! Are you OK?
- What the hell was that?

483
00:37:50,511 --> 00:37:52,837
- Yeah! What is that?
- You OK?

484
00:37:52,889 --> 00:37:55,759
My guv'nor's
the 16th Earl of Haddenfield.

485
00:37:55,808 --> 00:37:59,259
Shake hands with the first Calvin
of Sea World.

486
00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:01,885
- Enchanté.
- He know French too, huh?

487
00:38:01,939 --> 00:38:03,681
Excuse me, Mr Bouchard...

488
00:38:03,732 --> 00:38:06,435
Wait a minute.
We're havin' dinner here.

489
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:09,485
- This better be important.
- It is, sir.

490
00:38:09,528 --> 00:38:13,029
(Whispers) Mike and Dr Morgan
were pursued by a shark.

491
00:38:13,073 --> 00:38:15,113
It is important. Come with me.

492
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:23,620
(Kay) Calvin, it was a great white.

493
00:38:23,666 --> 00:38:26,667
Ten feet long, exhibiting
a typical feeding pattern.

494
00:38:26,712 --> 00:38:29,665
On us, Calvin!
The damn thing tried to feed on us.

495
00:38:29,714 --> 00:38:32,170
- Where is it?
- Right here.

496
00:38:36,219 --> 00:38:37,845
- Huh?
- (Whistles)

497
00:38:37,889 --> 00:38:41,720
You know, Cal, this
could be a stroke of luck.

498
00:38:41,767 --> 00:38:44,340
If we kill this beastie on camera...

499
00:38:45,644 --> 00:38:48,895
I can guarantee you media coverage.

500
00:38:50,191 --> 00:38:53,144
Lure him into a staging area,

501
00:38:53,194 --> 00:38:56,811
and at the precise moment,
slit his belly wide open.

502
00:38:58,281 --> 00:39:01,117
- Can you do that?
- You try and stop 'im, mate.

503
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:03,864
(Chuckles)
That's how we earn our bread.

504
00:39:05,913 --> 00:39:09,496
Well, Jack is oversimplifying
matters, as is usual.

505
00:39:09,541 --> 00:39:13,040
But... yeah, I can do that.

506
00:39:13,086 --> 00:39:15,163
(Kay) No!
(Mike) No?

507
00:39:15,214 --> 00:39:17,501
What do you mean, no?

508
00:39:17,548 --> 00:39:20,502
I don't know
if it's occurred to any of you-all,

509
00:39:20,552 --> 00:39:24,335
but there isn't a great white alive
in captivity anywhere.

510
00:39:24,388 --> 00:39:27,306
Now, we're unique here, Calvin,
you know that.

511
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:30,101
If any facility can
maintain a white, it's us.

512
00:39:30,144 --> 00:39:34,852
If we could dart him, w-we could get
him in a holding tank...

513
00:39:34,898 --> 00:39:38,433
Hold it! This is crazy, this is nuts.

514
00:39:38,485 --> 00:39:41,190
White sharks are killers.
I know 'em.

515
00:39:41,237 --> 00:39:44,024
My father, my brother, myself.

516
00:39:44,074 --> 00:39:46,361
They're murderers. No, Kay.

517
00:39:46,408 --> 00:39:51,035
Calvin, they die magnificently.

518
00:39:52,498 --> 00:39:54,122
(Laughs)

519
00:39:54,166 --> 00:39:58,293
That would really be a spectacular
event. No doubt about that, huh?

520
00:40:00,922 --> 00:40:05,215
What are we doing, Calvin,
planning a network special?

521
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:11,131
We could be the first people on the
planet to have a great white alive.

522
00:40:11,181 --> 00:40:14,764
Not if my guv'nor
gets it first, miss.

523
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:18,641
OK. Say he kills it.
Well, that's it.

524
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:21,179
It's one shot, over, gone.

525
00:40:21,232 --> 00:40:25,893
But a live great white...
You think about that, Calvin!

526
00:40:25,945 --> 00:40:30,108
Nightly bulletins on the progress
of the killer shark.

527
00:40:30,157 --> 00:40:32,943
Pictures of us nursing it
back to health

528
00:40:32,993 --> 00:40:35,531
and lowering it into a holding tank.

529
00:40:35,578 --> 00:40:37,203
Now, that's world news!

530
00:40:37,247 --> 00:40:39,535
Think of the lines at the gate.

531
00:40:39,582 --> 00:40:42,369
Then you miss the sport of the kill.

532
00:40:42,418 --> 00:40:45,537
Now, wait up, Jack. Wait up.

533
00:40:45,587 --> 00:40:48,339
(Philip) Killing is guaranteed press.

534
00:40:48,381 --> 00:40:52,331
But this other is much,
much more interesting.

535
00:41:03,104 --> 00:41:05,594
OK, this is MS-2-22.

536
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:09,976
This is quinaldine, but I had to
guesstimate the dosage.

537
00:41:10,025 --> 00:41:13,608
- Kathy?
- Right. Thanks, Danny.

538
00:41:14,822 --> 00:41:18,025
All right, we're ready in Control.
You all set?

539
00:41:18,076 --> 00:41:19,818
'We're ready down here.'

540
00:41:19,868 --> 00:41:22,276
(Kay clears throat)

541
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:24,486
With those TV monitors rolling,

542
00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:27,908
you're gonna have more coverage
than a space launch.

543
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,751
Good. Just the way I like it.

544
00:41:29,794 --> 00:41:32,711
The colour of your wet suit's
one hell of a choice.

545
00:41:32,755 --> 00:41:35,245
- The shark's gonna love you.
- Exactly.

546
00:41:35,299 --> 00:41:38,551
- It helps me get the close-ups.
- You're the showman.

547
00:41:38,595 --> 00:41:41,084
Honey, is this suit
gonna protect you?

548
00:41:41,138 --> 00:41:42,300
Have you felt?

549
00:41:42,348 --> 00:41:45,930
It won't bite through,
but it will yield to pressure.

550
00:41:45,976 --> 00:41:48,846
So she might just get
a little... squeeze.

551
00:41:48,895 --> 00:41:53,557
Oh, that's great news.
Look, why do you have to do this?

552
00:41:53,607 --> 00:41:57,474
Why don't you let Her Majesty's
number one son take care of it?

553
00:41:57,528 --> 00:41:59,604
Because it's my job, remember?

554
00:41:59,655 --> 00:42:02,738
Yeah, but I just don't
want it to be you.

555
00:42:02,782 --> 00:42:07,325
You build the stuff, I swim around
in it. That was the deal. Right?

556
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:08,745
Hmm?

557
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:11,740
I love you, too.

558
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:22,543
If we get into any trouble,
all we have to do is pull the pin.

559
00:42:22,592 --> 00:42:25,344
- What are those?
- (Jack) Mills bombs.

560
00:42:25,386 --> 00:42:27,462
- What?
- Mills bombs, sonny.

561
00:42:27,512 --> 00:42:31,842
Grenades. A chap in Her Majesty's
ordinance makes them up for me.

562
00:42:31,892 --> 00:42:34,892
(Philip) 'Baby claymores.
Good dispersion.

563
00:42:34,936 --> 00:42:37,641
'Some concussion
but they do the trick.'

564
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:40,358
Well, not in my water. Take 'em off.

565
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,687
You tend to your knitting,
my dear, and I tend to mine.

566
00:42:43,736 --> 00:42:45,610
(Mike) Hold on a second there.

567
00:42:45,654 --> 00:42:47,731
There's no explosives underwater.

568
00:42:47,782 --> 00:42:51,731
There's acrylic down there,
a very fragile environment. No bombs.

569
00:42:51,785 --> 00:42:53,908
(Philip) 'Brody, this is insur... '

570
00:42:53,954 --> 00:42:56,659
(Mike) 'No, I don't think
you understood me!

571
00:42:56,706 --> 00:43:01,664
'I built this park, and I'm not gonna
see some visiting fireman blow it up

572
00:43:01,711 --> 00:43:03,916
'because he wants to kill a fish! '

573
00:43:03,962 --> 00:43:08,125
Calvin, are you listening
to all this?

574
00:43:08,175 --> 00:43:11,045
No grenades.

575
00:43:13,387 --> 00:43:16,804
For Christ's sake, guv'nor.
Remember Australia?

576
00:43:16,849 --> 00:43:21,806
Oh, don't worry, Jack.
After all, it's only a little fish.

577
00:43:21,854 --> 00:43:23,728
Son of a...

578
00:43:23,773 --> 00:43:26,013
The pin has to be pulled.

579
00:43:26,066 --> 00:43:31,357
Right. Get rid of this stuff.
Everybody aboard here? Let's go.

580
00:43:34,115 --> 00:43:35,609
Shove off.

581
00:43:51,424 --> 00:43:54,378
(Kay) 'I need one clean belly shot.

582
00:43:54,426 --> 00:43:59,633
'Lf I miss, I'm gonna have to reload
and hope I get him with the second.'

583
00:43:59,681 --> 00:44:02,350
(Philip)
This is a good place to start.

584
00:44:05,269 --> 00:44:06,514
(Engines stop)

585
00:44:06,563 --> 00:44:08,933
(Mike) Hit the lights.

586
00:44:12,067 --> 00:44:13,525
Shall we dance?

587
00:44:13,569 --> 00:44:18,110
Why not? I'm beginning to feel like
King Richard going to the Crusades.

588
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:26,490
(Philip) Ready, Jack? Get the gear.

589
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:31,200
(Jack) Brown bread, guv'nor.

590
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:36,038
You all right?

591
00:44:36,089 --> 00:44:38,081
Good luck.

592
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:31,471
You only get one shot.

593
00:45:31,513 --> 00:45:33,590
(Mike) Yeah, I know. I know.

594
00:45:34,683 --> 00:45:36,391
(Mike exhales)

595
00:45:36,435 --> 00:45:39,221
What about Kathryn?

596
00:45:39,271 --> 00:45:43,564
It'll stick in the shark.
Hit her, and it'll go right through.

597
00:45:43,608 --> 00:45:46,644
Just buoy him up,
slow him down, right?

598
00:45:48,071 --> 00:45:50,195
Dorsal fin, middle of the back.

599
00:45:55,912 --> 00:45:57,986
Seen anything yet?

600
00:45:58,038 --> 00:46:00,824
We'll get him on the monitors.

601
00:46:20,517 --> 00:46:22,924
(Kay grunting)

602
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:25,978
(Kay screams)

603
00:46:47,416 --> 00:46:51,034
Quick! Mike, He's making a run!

604
00:46:53,296 --> 00:46:55,288
Quick, shoot him!

605
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:57,248
(Philip) He's getting away!

606
00:46:57,299 --> 00:46:59,091
Damn it!

607
00:47:02,429 --> 00:47:04,589
(Mike) Get outta the way, Kay!

608
00:47:04,641 --> 00:47:06,218
(Kay) Now!

609
00:47:30,162 --> 00:47:32,156
Come on.

610
00:47:32,208 --> 00:47:34,414
Right. There you go.

611
00:47:34,458 --> 00:47:36,535
You did it, baby.

612
00:47:36,586 --> 00:47:38,792
Here's the ladder. Hold on.

613
00:47:38,838 --> 00:47:40,712
Come on. Give me your fins.

614
00:47:40,756 --> 00:47:44,089
- Give me your fins.
- Let's go!

615
00:47:44,134 --> 00:47:45,795
(Dan) Up you go.

616
00:47:47,136 --> 00:47:49,593
You all right?

617
00:47:51,057 --> 00:47:52,516
(Gasps)

618
00:47:52,558 --> 00:47:55,264
- Close one.
- (Mike) Get this stuff off her.

619
00:47:55,311 --> 00:47:58,845
- (Liz) That was great!
- What am I, a bloody porter?

620
00:47:58,898 --> 00:48:02,064
- How about a hand with this?
- First things first.

621
00:48:02,109 --> 00:48:05,359
- Mustn't ignore the ladies.
- Don't ignore the help.

622
00:48:05,405 --> 00:48:09,401
(Mike) Looked hairy down there.
(Liz) You OK? I was worried.

623
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:12,319
You sure know how
to scare the hell outta me.

Oh! Oh, God.

779
00:58:17,585 --> 00:58:20,123
Can this hold two people?

780
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:22,958
Oh. Push. Push.

781
00:58:23,007 --> 00:58:25,961
Oh, my God.
Are you steering this, or am I?

782
00:58:26,009 --> 00:58:28,169
(People laughing, chattering)

783
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:30,627
Go! Go! Get away! Get away!

784
00:58:40,104 --> 00:58:43,972
(PA) 'We invite you to enter
the magical world of the Coral Forest

785
00:58:44,025 --> 00:58:48,354
'where you may observe the wonders
of the deep without ever getting wet.

786

'The Spanish Galleon plays host
to many colourful fish

788
00:58:59,372 --> 00:59:01,615
- Look at all of them!
- Oh, yeah!

789
00:59:01,667 --> 00:59:06,162
(Girl) That looks like a butterfly.
(2nd Girl) You're right.

790
00:59:14,929 --> 00:59:17,004
(Man) Oh, my God! Look at that!

791
00:59:22,311 --> 00:59:24,432
Kay, you don't want to see this.

792
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,647
Everybody is assuming
this was a shark attack.

793
00:59:27,691 --> 00:59:30,775
- Now, I wanna make sure.
- OK. All right.

794
00:59:30,818 --> 00:59:32,893
Did you guys pull him out?

795
01:00:02,889 --> 01:00:04,383
(Mike gasps)

796
01:00:07,769 --> 01:00:09,975
That's Shelby Overman.

797
01:00:14,776 --> 01:00:16,602
- Kay, I told...
- Miss...

798
01:00:16,652 --> 01:00:18,858
Mike. Ray.

799
01:00:19,945 --> 01:00:25,569
If this was a shark attack,
I've seen it before.

800
01:00:25,618 --> 01:00:27,361
OK?

801
01:00:38,088 --> 01:00:39,996
Oh, Mike.

802
01:00:41,342 --> 01:00:43,666
Oh, my God!

803
01:00:45,845 --> 01:00:48,715
Let's go find Calvin.
Come on! Come on!

804
01:00:48,764 --> 01:00:52,927
(Man) I'm getting contradictory
readings from the filtration pumps.

805
01:00:52,975 --> 01:00:56,392
(Leonard) Such as?
- High pump rate, low outflow

806
01:00:56,438 --> 01:00:59,770
and a pressure build-up
on the inboard tunnel valve.

807
01:00:59,815 --> 01:01:03,316
- That's number two.
- Could be an obstruction.

808
01:01:03,361 --> 01:01:05,438
Well, that's not my department.

809
01:01:05,487 --> 01:01:08,821
See if you can locate Brody
or Calvin, will you?

810
01:01:10,492 --> 01:01:12,650
(Calvin) Very posh.

811
01:01:12,703 --> 01:01:14,909
Yes, it's quite a display.

812
01:01:14,954 --> 01:01:19,118
Tell me. How do you contain the
sharks in this part of the lagoon?

813
01:01:19,166 --> 01:01:22,167
It's that old shark screen,
that bubble screen.

814
01:01:22,212 --> 01:01:24,665
You know, sharks don't like that.

815
01:01:24,712 --> 01:01:28,461
It's what they call, uh...
marine segregation.

816
01:01:28,508 --> 01:01:31,000
Dr Bouchard. Telephone.

817
01:01:31,053 --> 01:01:34,254
Ah, excuse me, gentlemen.
Be comfortable now.

818
01:01:35,306 --> 01:01:36,884
Here you go, sir.

819
01:01:38,059 --> 01:01:39,932
Bouchard here.

820
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:44,011
What about the pumps?

821
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:47,647
Ah, nah, nah, nah.
Don't wait for Brody.

822
01:01:47,692 --> 01:01:52,069
Just, uh... shut down number two pump
and switch over to number one.

823
01:01:52,113 --> 01:01:54,071
Simple as that.

824
01:01:54,116 --> 01:01:58,066
Because it costs too much to replace
and they burn out!

825
01:01:58,119 --> 01:02:02,449
Tell Brody to get down here
to the Neptune Room on the double!

826
01:02:03,625 --> 01:02:06,079
- Thank you.
- (Man) You're welcome.

827
01:02:16,635 --> 01:02:18,295
Well, gentlemen.

828
01:02:18,345 --> 01:02:20,054
Chin-chin.

829
01:02:20,097 --> 01:02:23,762
- Oh, cheers.
- Cheers.

830
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:25,843
(Kay) There they are.

831
01:02:27,563 --> 01:02:31,975
- Calvin, I've got bad news.
- Keep your voices down, sit down.

832
01:02:33,234 --> 01:02:35,227
Sit down!

833
01:02:35,278 --> 01:02:37,271
Was it the shark?

834
01:02:41,533 --> 01:02:43,942
It was a shark.

835
01:02:43,994 --> 01:02:46,533
It was a shark...

836
01:02:46,581 --> 01:02:49,912
with a bite radius
about a yard across.

837
01:02:49,957 --> 01:02:54,500
Don't be silly. That would indicate
a shark of some 35 feet in length.

838
01:02:54,545 --> 01:02:56,502
You said it exactly.

839
01:03:01,761 --> 01:03:04,964
- Our shark still has all its teeth.
- Yeah.

840
01:03:05,013 --> 01:03:07,005
That means it was a baby.

841
01:03:07,056 --> 01:03:11,006
Our shark couldn't
have killed Overman.

842
01:03:11,060 --> 01:03:13,053
Its mother did.

843
01:03:13,103 --> 01:03:15,725
You talkin' about
some damn shark's mother?

844
01:03:15,772 --> 01:03:17,811
Don't you hear what she's sayin'?

845
01:03:17,857 --> 01:03:19,187
I'm listening!

846
01:03:19,235 --> 01:03:22,437
Well, she gave birth way out to sea,
and the baby swam

847
01:03:22,529 --> 01:03:25,613
through the sea gate
that you left open, Brody!

848
01:03:25,656 --> 01:03:30,234
No! Overman was killed
inside the park.

849
01:03:30,285 --> 01:03:33,785
The baby was caught
inside the park.

850
01:03:33,831 --> 01:03:37,449
Its mother is inside the park.

851
01:03:50,764 --> 01:03:54,097
(Echoing) She's right there!

852
01:03:54,141 --> 01:03:56,014
(Screaming)

853
01:04:02,273 --> 01:04:04,846
(Woman) How did that thing
get in there?

854
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:08,601
- The animals are in the lagoon!
- Ski show!

855
01:04:08,655 --> 01:04:11,572
Control, this is Bouchard.
Listen carefully!

856
01:04:11,615 --> 01:04:15,908
Clear the tunnel, let the people out,
close the gate and seal the park!

857
01:04:15,952 --> 01:04:18,360
Seal the park!
I'll be down in a minute.

858
01:04:21,666 --> 01:04:23,575
(Man) Hey! Hey! Watch it!

859
01:04:23,626 --> 01:04:26,710
(Woman) Who is that guy?
(Man) Watch out!

860
01:04:37,972 --> 01:04:41,388
Hey, bring it over here! Hey!

861
01:04:48,149 --> 01:04:51,398
All right. I've had enough fun.
Let's go in now.

862
01:04:51,442 --> 01:04:53,482
Come on. You're enjoying this.

863
01:04:53,529 --> 01:04:56,944
No. Look, don't you
have to be at work or something?

864
01:04:56,990 --> 01:04:59,906
I don't have to be back
till the second half.

865
01:04:59,951 --> 01:05:01,991
- Oh.
- Come on.

866
01:05:04,078 --> 01:05:05,278
Gotcha, lovers.

867
01:05:05,331 --> 01:05:06,575
- Shit!
- God.

868
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:10,992
- Get out! Get out!
- Hey, what the?!

869
01:05:11,044 --> 01:05:13,250
Hey, what are ya doin'?!

870
01:05:14,507 --> 01:05:15,835
Brody!

871
01:05:15,882 --> 01:05:18,004
Get out of the water. Get out!

872
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:21,716
Get out of the water, please.
Please, come in from the water.

873

01:05:52,999 --> 01:05:55,122
Uh-huh.

880
01:05:55,167 --> 01:05:57,493
Yes. I got him right here.

Come take a bow.

No! Get up here! '

- Get me down!
- What are you saying?

897
01:06:46,923 --> 01:06:49,544
There's something back there!
A shark!

898
01:06:49,593 --> 01:06:51,833
Bring your boat in!

899
01:06:58,226 --> 01:06:59,849
There's a shark!

01:07:15,282 --> 01:07:18,947
- Get out!
- Up. Turn.

01:07:20,912 --> 01:07:24,198
Oh, my God! Shark!

(Brody) Get outta the water!

907
01:07:33,298 --> 01:07:37,248
(Man in boat)
We're coming! We're coming!

908
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:39,295
It's gonna eat us!

909
01:07:39,347 --> 01:07:40,840
They'll die!

- Gimme your hand. Come on!
- Pull me out!

Hang on!

01:07:58,446 --> 01:08:01,364
(Sean) Needs a choke or something.
Pull it.

913
01:08:02,951 --> 01:08:04,658
(Both gasp)

914
01:08:15,045 --> 01:08:16,706
(Sean) Hold my hand.

(Sean) Kelly!

916
01:08:20,341 --> 01:08:22,251
Shark!

917
01:08:22,302 --> 01:08:23,961
Kelly!

918
01:08:29,349 --> 01:08:30,927
Kelly!

- What the hell is that?
- Shit! Hang on!

920
01:08:57,876 --> 01:08:59,500
(Girl) What happened?

921
01:08:59,544 --> 01:09:02,248
(Girl) She's drowning!
She's drowning!

922
01:09:02,297 --> 01:09:05,747
Swim! Swim, kid, swim!

923
01:09:08,551 --> 01:09:10,878
(People gasping)

924
01:09:17,310 --> 01:09:19,302
(Philip) Call an ambulance.

925
01:09:19,353 --> 01:09:21,891
Quickly. Come on.
Get out of the way!

926
01:09:21,938 --> 01:09:23,683
Get a paramedic!

927
01:09:25,233 --> 01:09:27,143
Look out, Mommy!

928
01:09:33,658 --> 01:09:37,489
- Did you call an ambulance?
- Yeah, the paramedics.

929
01:09:37,537 --> 01:09:41,913
(Mike) Twist that tourniquet tight
and hold it there.

930
01:09:41,956 --> 01:09:43,866
(Sean) I'm here. You're OK.

931
01:09:43,917 --> 01:09:48,045
(Man) They're bringin' in the
wounded. The ambulance is on the way.

932
01:09:48,088 --> 01:09:51,704
Shall I leave the gate open?
Cindy and Sandy are out there.

933
01:09:51,758 --> 01:09:53,336
Shit.

934
01:09:54,845 --> 01:09:57,513
No. They'll have to
take care of themselves.

935
01:09:57,556 --> 01:10:00,472
We can't take our chance
on that big bitch gettin' in.

936
01:10:03,143 --> 01:10:05,682
- Hey, you all right?
- Yeah. Yeah. Fine.

937
01:10:05,729 --> 01:10:08,480
Uh, I'm gonna go with Kelly.

938
01:10:08,524 --> 01:10:10,930
I think you should.

939
01:10:10,983 --> 01:10:14,566
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

940
01:10:18,990 --> 01:10:22,774
Hello out there.
This is Calvin Bouchard.

941
01:10:22,828 --> 01:10:25,828
May I please
have your kind attention.

942
01:10:25,872 --> 01:10:27,995
Due to technical difficulties,

943
01:10:28,041 --> 01:10:31,409
it has become necessary for us
to temporarily close

944
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:34,033
the Undersea Kingdom now.

945
01:10:34,088 --> 01:10:37,955
For those of you all still in
the underwater portion of this park,

946
01:10:38,008 --> 01:10:42,716
please follow your guides,
and they will point out

947
01:10:42,762 --> 01:10:45,633
the most convenient
and accessible exits.

948
01:10:45,682 --> 01:10:49,928
Where the hell is the nearest
accessible exit? We're underwater!

949
01:10:49,978 --> 01:10:51,851
- Is this off?
- Uh-huh.

950
01:10:51,895 --> 01:10:54,601
- Gimme some lights down there!
- OK.

951
01:10:54,648 --> 01:10:58,514
Can't see shit down there!
Get me some medical attention, quick!

952
01:10:58,568 --> 01:11:01,735
OK, ladies and gentlemen,
please follow me

953
01:11:01,779 --> 01:11:05,991
in an orderly fashion, and remember -
walk, do not run.

954
01:11:10,747 --> 01:11:14,364
Daddy, Daddy! Look at the fish!

955
01:11:14,416 --> 01:11:16,741
- Look!
- Holy shit!

956
01:11:16,793 --> 01:11:18,834
(Panicked screams)

957
01:11:21,548 --> 01:11:24,465
(Screaming)

958
01:11:36,854 --> 01:11:38,929
(Technician) Tunnel six failure.

959
01:11:40,439 --> 01:11:42,350
It's Jonah and the Whale.

960
01:11:42,401 --> 01:11:47,226
Tube integrity has been compromised.
We've got leakage and pressure loss.

961
01:11:51,325 --> 01:11:54,741
We have to seal the section
or we'll lose the whole complex.

962
01:11:54,787 --> 01:11:57,786
- Watertight doors. Hit it.
- On automatic.

963
01:11:57,831 --> 01:12:01,875
They're all on go status.
Activated. Now!

964
01:12:01,918 --> 01:12:03,542
(People screaming)

965
01:12:08,841 --> 01:12:10,750
I need my wallet!

966
01:12:11,802 --> 01:12:13,675
(Screaming continues)

967
01:12:39,077 --> 01:12:41,745
Quiet! Quiet! Please!

968
01:12:42,955 --> 01:12:45,446
I need your attention, please. Quiet!

969
01:12:45,499 --> 01:12:49,331
Now the water is not going
any higher, so calm down, OK?

970
01:12:49,377 --> 01:12:52,048
It's stopped.
It's stopped, so calm down.

971
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:58,048
(Guide) 'The oxygen that we have
in here is all we have,

972
01:12:58,093 --> 01:13:02,173
'so let's not panic, but let's try
to take shallow breaths, OK? '

973
01:13:17,612 --> 01:13:19,404
- Hey, Mike.
- Yeah!

974
01:13:19,447 --> 01:13:23,064
This is our last cut. I think
our tunnel patch is ready to go.

975
01:13:23,117 --> 01:13:26,034
Good. Rig the winch
on that work boat up there.

976
01:13:26,077 --> 01:13:27,785
You got it.

977
01:13:29,498 --> 01:13:32,203
- How much longer, sweetie?
- I don't know.

978
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:33,411
No?

979
01:13:33,459 --> 01:13:36,960
We're gonna have to nudge these
tunnel sections together.

980
01:13:37,005 --> 01:13:39,756
Then we'll patch it
and weld the whole thing.

981
01:13:39,799 --> 01:13:40,997
Then we evacuate?

982
01:13:41,049 --> 01:13:44,003
No, then we put pressure back
into the tunnels,

983
01:13:44,053 --> 01:13:47,920
then the watertight doors
will open up, then people go home.

984
01:13:47,972 --> 01:13:51,341
Hey, watch how you're
cuttin' that. It's critical!

985
01:13:51,393 --> 01:13:54,227
Relax.
You're doin' everything you can.

986
01:13:54,271 --> 01:13:56,311
Come on. Come over here.

987
01:13:58,816 --> 01:14:00,892
Listen.

988
01:14:00,943 --> 01:14:03,018
I've been thinking.

989
01:14:03,069 --> 01:14:07,565
Maybe Venezuela
can use some trained whales.

990
01:14:07,616 --> 01:14:09,903
- What? Are you serious?
- Yeah.

991
01:14:09,950 --> 01:14:11,659
I think this one's on me.

992
01:14:11,702 --> 01:14:14,408
- But next year...
- I'll follow you anywhere.

993
01:14:14,455 --> 01:14:15,998
- Yeah!
- I love you!

994
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:18,115
(Chattering)

995
01:14:22,796 --> 01:14:24,456
Ah, Mr Glass.

996
01:14:24,505 --> 01:14:26,795
Is Mr Bouchard going to be here?

997
01:14:26,842 --> 01:14:29,841
Please, please.
I have a statement to make.

998
01:14:29,885 --> 01:14:33,135
- Was there an explosion?
- How many people are missing?

999
01:14:33,181 --> 01:14:35,801
Late today,
due to a minor disturbance,

1000
01:14:35,849 --> 01:14:39,184
there was a pressure failure
in one of the tunnels -

1001
01:14:39,228 --> 01:14:41,267
a major attraction at the park.

1002
01:14:41,312 --> 01:14:44,265
We estimate that 30 to 40 people

1003
01:14:44,315 --> 01:14:47,101
were in the process
of being evacuated

1004
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:51,694
when the watertight safety doors
temporarily delayed their exit.

1005
01:14:51,740 --> 01:14:54,526
We're working right now
to release them

1006
01:14:54,575 --> 01:14:57,244
under the safest
possible circumstances.

1007
01:14:57,286 --> 01:15:00,535
Seven visitors were also injured
in our beach area.

1008
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:03,997
- That's all. Give me a break.
- What about a shark?

1009
01:15:04,042 --> 01:15:07,825
- I'll let you know as I know more.
- A very large shark...

1010
01:15:07,879 --> 01:15:10,583
That's all. There is no more.

1011
01:15:10,631 --> 01:15:12,540
(Woman) When will this be fixed?

1012
01:15:12,592 --> 01:15:15,260
(Guide)
I'm sure they're working on it.

1013
01:15:15,303 --> 01:15:18,670
Stay together to keep warm.
I know you're cold.

1014
01:15:18,721 --> 01:15:23,964
Stay together, take shallow breaths
and concentrate on your breathing.

1015
01:15:41,201 --> 01:15:43,571
Well, any sign of mother?

1016
01:15:44,954 --> 01:15:46,234
OK, then.

1017
01:15:46,288 --> 01:15:49,989
Where did the animal
hide the first time?

1018
01:15:51,584 --> 01:15:52,914
Uh...

1019
01:15:54,755 --> 01:15:56,961
filtration pipe.

1020
01:15:57,006 --> 01:15:58,998
Opposite side of the lagoon.

1021
01:15:59,048 --> 01:16:03,711
Brody, is there an access hatch,
a backwash gate?

1022
01:16:04,764 --> 01:16:09,804
Heavy grillwork. Keeps the pumps
clear when we back-flush that system.

1023
01:16:09,852 --> 01:16:13,185
Why? What do you want to do?
Get that thing back in?

1024
01:16:13,229 --> 01:16:15,186
He's a bright lad.

1025
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:19,977
Yes. Jack and I are going to lure him
back into the pipe,

1026
01:16:20,027 --> 01:16:24,025
close the gates and then dispose
of him at our leisure.

1027
01:16:24,073 --> 01:16:28,367
Meanwhile, you can weld your patch
and then evacuate the civilians.

1028
01:16:28,409 --> 01:16:31,695
What if she doesn't want
to go back in?

1029
01:16:31,747 --> 01:16:36,041
I think we can pretty much
guarantee she'll want to go back in.

1030
01:16:36,083 --> 01:16:38,241
- Right, Jack?
- Sure.

1031
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:40,963
Just how are you
going to guarantee that?

1032
01:16:42,590 --> 01:16:44,582
Live bait.

1033
01:16:44,633 --> 01:16:48,251
(Man) We're ready to move
out over the tunnel now.

1034
01:16:48,302 --> 01:16:50,261
(Mike) Let's go.

1035
01:17:00,898 --> 01:17:03,020
L-I'll be in the Control Room.

1036
01:17:03,066 --> 01:17:05,474
I'll go with you.

1037
01:17:07,237 --> 01:17:09,609
(Man) Give me that.
I'll store it over here.

1038
01:17:09,655 --> 01:17:11,115
(Man) No, I got it.

1039
01:17:13,827 --> 01:17:14,905
(Technician)
Yeah, we're on top of it.

1040
01:17:14,951 --> 01:17:17,075
OK. Thanks.

1041
01:17:25,337 --> 01:17:27,329
Now, where's that damn fish?

1042
01:17:30,090 --> 01:17:32,048
There. I've got him.

1043
01:17:32,093 --> 01:17:34,630
(Technician)
Sorry, it's the dolphins.

1044
01:17:37,389 --> 01:17:40,095
Babies, stay out of it, please.

1045
01:17:40,142 --> 01:17:43,095
...and I've rigged a lifeline.

1046
01:17:43,145 --> 01:17:47,272
Just let the pumps push you out and
use the rope to pull yourself back.

1047
01:17:47,315 --> 01:17:48,691
Right.

1048
01:17:50,068 --> 01:17:53,684
And why don't I do all the filming?

1049
01:17:53,738 --> 01:17:57,651
I want both cameras.
We need the coverage. Come on, Jack!

1050
01:17:57,699 --> 01:17:59,656
This isn't a picnic.

1051
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:03,699
This film is a bloody
retirement annuity.

1052
01:18:03,747 --> 01:18:06,581
I'd feel better
if you did just the one thing.

1053
01:18:06,624 --> 01:18:08,581
(Laughs) What's the matter?

1054
01:18:08,626 --> 01:18:10,619
Getting cold feet?

1055
01:18:18,218 --> 01:18:21,135
OK, Bob. Hold it about right there.

1056
01:18:21,179 --> 01:18:24,798
- We're right over the tunnel.
- OK, we're all set.

1057
01:18:24,849 --> 01:18:27,341
(Mike)
'Tell FitzRoyce we're in position.'

1058
01:18:27,393 --> 01:18:29,801
FitzRoyce, you can go now.

1059
01:18:55,043 --> 01:18:59,751
(Technician) They're testing
the lifeline to see if it's secure.

1060
01:19:19,483 --> 01:19:23,527
(Calvin) 'They're spreadin' some
chum. You know, fish oil and blood.

1061
01:19:23,570 --> 01:19:26,487
'Then Jack's gonna make
some metallic sounds

1062
01:19:26,530 --> 01:19:29,946
'to attract her right down
into that filtration pipe.'

1063
01:19:29,991 --> 01:19:31,819
Start the pumps.

1064
01:19:31,870 --> 01:19:33,991
You got it.

1065
01:19:39,209 --> 01:19:41,913
(Metal clanging)

1066
01:19:59,184 --> 01:20:01,511
(Clanging)

1067
01:21:03,368 --> 01:21:06,950
(Technician) It's in!
(Calvin) He's got it!

1068
01:21:06,997 --> 01:21:09,072
All right. It's locked.

1069
01:21:11,124 --> 01:21:13,248
It's safe, Brody. Go for it.

1070
01:21:13,294 --> 01:21:15,204
OK, let's go.

1071
01:22:07,092 --> 01:22:08,504
(Muffled scream)

1072
01:22:42,792 --> 01:22:46,126
(Technician) 'This is Control.
Is that patch in place? '

1073
01:22:46,169 --> 01:22:47,915
Easy.

1074
01:22:57,806 --> 01:23:00,511
Let me help you with that,
Dr Morgan.

1075
01:23:00,558 --> 01:23:02,466
Got it!

1076
01:23:04,770 --> 01:23:06,893
Now weld the son-of-a-bitch...

1077
01:23:08,149 --> 01:23:10,686
(Calvin) Kathryn, what are you doin'?

1078
01:23:10,734 --> 01:23:12,811
I'm going down there.

1079
01:23:15,531 --> 01:23:16,988
You crazy?

1080
01:23:17,031 --> 01:23:19,604
He needs eyes
in the back of his head.

1081
01:23:24,621 --> 01:23:26,910
- Thanks, Fred.
- All right.

1082
01:23:26,957 --> 01:23:29,115
Watch the tanks.

1083
01:23:29,167 --> 01:23:30,793
OK.

1084
01:23:34,422 --> 01:23:36,711
- Here are your fins.
- Thanks.

1085
01:23:36,757 --> 01:23:39,213
Be careful down there now.

1086
01:23:53,856 --> 01:23:56,062
(Hinges creaking)

1087
01:24:25,634 --> 01:24:27,544
(Sighs) You all right?

1088
01:24:28,637 --> 01:24:30,547
Where's Mr FitzRoyce?

1089
01:24:30,597 --> 01:24:32,555
I have no idea.

1090
01:24:36,020 --> 01:24:37,644
(Man) What's goin' on?

1091
01:24:40,315 --> 01:24:41,514
Guv'nor!

1092
01:24:41,776 --> 01:24:43,566
Guv'nor!

1093
01:24:43,818 --> 01:24:46,440
Guv'nor!

1094
01:24:46,530 --> 01:24:48,237
There's no other way out?

1095
01:24:48,281 --> 01:24:50,521
You don't understand. This is it!

1096
01:24:50,574 --> 01:24:52,531
Have you looked?

1097
01:24:52,576 --> 01:24:55,363
He didn't come up.

1098
01:24:55,412 --> 01:24:58,828
Guv'nor, you bloody bastard.
Answer me!

1099
01:25:05,213 --> 01:25:08,131
We'll suffocate the bitch.
Shut down the pumps.

1100
01:25:08,174 --> 01:25:09,455
Are you sure?

1101
01:25:09,509 --> 01:25:12,674
- Why don't we blow it up?
- Listen, nephew.

1102
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:16,799
A $2.5 million turbine's not going up
in smoke cos of a damn fish!

1103
01:25:16,848 --> 01:25:19,469
Now shut the pumps down!

1104
01:25:20,853 --> 01:25:23,141
(Mechanical whirring)

1105
01:25:23,188 --> 01:25:25,514
What's happened?

1106
01:25:25,566 --> 01:25:28,055
(Man) They've shut the pumps off.

1107
01:25:28,110 --> 01:25:32,937
(Sighs) That's all she needs.
The gates can't hold much longer.

1108
01:25:35,031 --> 01:25:39,112
(Sobbing) Philip, pull the pin!
Pull the pin, Philip.

1109
01:26:05,267 --> 01:26:07,759
(Metallic clanking on monitor)

1110
01:26:14,067 --> 01:26:16,440
(Clanking)

1111
01:26:40,425 --> 01:26:42,582
(Clanking continues)

1112
01:27:01,819 --> 01:27:03,526
(Woman) Look at that!

1113
01:27:10,494 --> 01:27:13,281
(Woman) Jesus!

1114
01:27:13,329 --> 01:27:15,368
(Fred) Oh, my God!

1115
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:17,781
We gotta warn 'em.
We gotta tell 'em!

1116
01:27:17,833 --> 01:27:20,703
Get 'em up! It's coming back.
Get 'em up quick!

1117
01:27:20,752 --> 01:27:22,911
- Come on! Hurry up!
- Come on!

1118
01:27:22,963 --> 01:27:24,126
Get 'em up!

1119
01:27:38,185 --> 01:27:40,260
- Come on, Mike.
- Get out of there!

1120
01:27:47,027 --> 01:27:50,111
- Come on, Mike!
- (Calvin) 'Get 'em up! '

1121
01:28:18,973 --> 01:28:21,179
(Muffled) Come on!

1122
01:28:29,065 --> 01:28:31,224
(Squeaking)

1123
01:28:36,530 --> 01:28:38,357
(Squeaking)

1124
01:29:32,164 --> 01:29:33,955
(Muffled) Pull the door!

1125
01:30:03,233 --> 01:30:06,022
How the hell did it get loose?

1126
01:30:10,490 --> 01:30:12,945
Open the hatch!

1127
01:30:16,955 --> 01:30:19,196
(Fred) Come on up, Mike. I gotcha.

1128
01:30:25,213 --> 01:30:27,583
Are you all right?

1129
01:30:27,631 --> 01:30:30,334
Do we have pressure
in those tunnels yet?

1130
01:30:30,383 --> 01:30:33,469
- Affirmative.
- Then get those people out.

1131
01:30:36,139 --> 01:30:39,056
Feel the air!
Can you feel the air?

1132
01:30:39,101 --> 01:30:42,054
The water's going down.
The water's going down!

1133
01:30:46,856 --> 01:30:49,643
Try to be calm.
Don't rush to the door.

1134
01:31:00,702 --> 01:31:02,612
(Man) We're saved!

1135
01:31:02,664 --> 01:31:04,785
(All talking and cheering)

1136
01:32:06,554 --> 01:32:09,009
(Muffled yelling, crunching)

1137
01:34:22,220 --> 01:34:24,128
Oh! We did it!

1138
01:34:24,180 --> 01:34:26,849
The others, Mike.
What about the others?

1139
01:34:26,890 --> 01:34:28,966
Calvin made it. Lisa.

1140
01:34:29,017 --> 01:34:32,553
Mike. Mike! The dolphins!

1141
01:34:33,688 --> 01:34:35,147
(Kay) Cindy!

1142
01:34:35,190 --> 01:34:37,597
(Mike) Cindy!
(Kay) Sandy!

1143
01:34:37,650 --> 01:34:41,184
- Come on! Cindy!
- Cindy!

1144
01:34:41,236 --> 01:34:44,404
Oh, good girl. Sandy!

1145
01:34:44,447 --> 01:34:45,728
(Squeaks)

1146
01:34:45,782 --> 01:34:50,740
Sandy, come on, baby.
Sandy, where are you?

1147
01:34:50,787 --> 01:34:52,696
(Mike) Sandy!

1148
01:34:53,956 --> 01:34:55,866
I hope she made it.

1149
01:34:57,877 --> 01:34:59,785
- Cindy, stay.
- Sandy.

1150
01:34:59,837 --> 01:35:01,794
(Squeaks)

1151
01:35:03,382 --> 01:35:05,754
Sandy!

1152
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:08,042
All right!

1153
01:35:19,855 --> 01:35:21,763
All right!
