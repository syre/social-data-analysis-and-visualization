1
00:02:36,843 --> 00:02:38,902
Excuse me sir, can I interrupt you?

2
00:02:40,647 --> 00:02:41,773
It's about Karan.

3
00:02:41,848 --> 00:02:43,577
I said, not today.

4
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,981
But he is already here sir.

5
00:02:45,118 --> 00:02:46,642
Then send him back.

6
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:49,717
15 years, and you don't
know how to make an excuse.

7
00:02:49,922 --> 00:02:54,222
I can't stop my 60 million dollar
takeover for his silly weekend trip.

8
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,018
Alba, I don't care how
you do it! But avoid him!

9
00:02:59,532 --> 00:03:00,590
Sorry about that!

10
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,258
Karan!

11
00:03:02,535 --> 00:03:04,230
You must know he didn't mean it.

12
00:03:16,616 --> 00:03:20,074
Hey Karan, we had a great holiday.
And missed you a lot.

13
00:03:21,754 --> 00:03:23,585
How was your Europe trip?

14
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,155
You already know it, friend.

15
00:03:25,558 --> 00:03:27,856
What happened, did your
dad turn you down you again.

16
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,689
The story of my life!

17
00:03:29,762 --> 00:03:31,093
See you Karan!

18
00:03:31,164 --> 00:03:32,631
Let's go boys!

19
00:03:39,706 --> 00:03:43,904
'I can't stop my 60 million dollar
takeover for his silly weekend trip. '

20
00:03:54,854 --> 00:03:56,947
He has taken your car.

21
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,648
Doesn't matter. It's okay.

22
00:04:00,526 --> 00:04:01,550
Not the M. G!

23
00:04:13,606 --> 00:04:14,664
God.

24
00:04:14,941 --> 00:04:16,101
Dad could have killed me.

25
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,541
Excuse me!

26
00:04:22,548 --> 00:04:24,140
What are you doing with my car?

27
00:04:25,551 --> 00:04:27,018
That's my favorite car, Karan!

28
00:04:27,086 --> 00:04:28,144
I know, dad.

29
00:04:28,221 --> 00:04:29,279
That's why I took it.

30
00:04:29,355 --> 00:04:31,152
Come back to the office, now!

31
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,282
I did come to the office, dad!

32
00:04:32,558 --> 00:04:33,650
I was busy at that time.

33
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,984
Now I am!

34
00:04:35,061 --> 00:04:36,824
Well, sometime later
we will plan this trip.

35
00:04:36,896 --> 00:04:38,488
I am on a trip, dad.

36
00:04:38,698 --> 00:04:40,689
Not a scratch on my car, Karan!

37
00:04:40,767 --> 00:04:43,201
Don't worry dad, there
won't be a single scratch.

38
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:55,570
Not a single scratch.

39
00:04:59,585 --> 00:05:01,246
'Not a scratch on my car, Karan! '

40
00:05:01,521 --> 00:05:03,113
'Not a scratch on my car, Karan! '

41
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:21,123
Honestly, I am tired of you Karan!

42
00:06:21,601 --> 00:06:23,865
I am tired of shouting!

43
00:06:25,605 --> 00:06:27,266
Why do you always shout dad?

44
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:29,735
Why don't you ever talk to me!

45
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,669
Talk! What do you want me to do?

46
00:06:33,679 --> 00:06:34,805
Tell you stories?

47
00:06:35,147 --> 00:06:36,546
You are not a child anymore Karan!

48
00:06:40,086 --> 00:06:41,144
Excellent dad!

49
00:06:41,621 --> 00:06:43,885
At least you know how
old this trouble maker is!

50
00:06:43,923 --> 00:06:45,220
Don't change the topic!

51
00:06:46,525 --> 00:06:51,224
My M. G! My favorite car!
Custom made pars!

52
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:53,230
It hasn't been
even three months yet!

53
00:06:53,566 --> 00:06:55,090
And the car is a wreck!

54
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:56,225
Isn't it funny dad!

55
00:06:57,837 --> 00:07:02,137
You have more feelings for a car
than for your 23 year old son?

56
00:07:02,241 --> 00:07:03,765
What do you care for?

57
00:07:03,843 --> 00:07:05,902
This house! The cars! Companies!

58
00:07:07,046 --> 00:07:08,775
One day, it will all be yours.

59
00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:12,511
But you will only realize
the value of everything...

60
00:07:12,585 --> 00:07:13,779
...when you will lose it.

61
00:07:14,587 --> 00:07:17,522
And when will you
realize the value of your son...

62
00:07:17,556 --> 00:07:19,524
...when you will lose me?

63
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:21,221
Karan!

64
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:31,127
Good night dad!

65
00:07:36,876 --> 00:07:40,642
Mom! No mom, this is not fair!

66
00:07:41,881 --> 00:07:44,008
Today, I won't let
you take dad's side.

67
00:07:49,922 --> 00:07:51,480
I feel very lonely, mom.

68
00:07:53,092 --> 00:07:54,491
I really miss you.

69
00:07:56,963 --> 00:07:59,488
When I go out, no one says...

70
00:07:59,565 --> 00:08:02,090
...'Son, take care of yourself. '

71
00:08:04,036 --> 00:08:07,096
When I come home,
no one says to me...

72
00:08:08,574 --> 00:08:09,632
...Karan, have you come...

73
00:08:12,111 --> 00:08:15,638
No one ever says, eat
on time, sleep on time.

74
00:08:17,116 --> 00:08:18,174
Don't watch the T.V.

75
00:08:19,585 --> 00:08:20,847
Don't shake your leg!

76
00:08:22,254 --> 00:08:24,119
Get a hair cut, for Christ sake!

77
00:08:25,925 --> 00:08:27,222
No one says anything at all!

78
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,061
I really miss you mom!

79
00:08:44,877 --> 00:08:46,003
Hey Karan!

80
00:08:48,147 --> 00:08:49,205
My man!

81
00:08:50,216 --> 00:08:51,478
What's up!

82
00:08:52,084 --> 00:08:53,142
What is the matter?

83
00:08:53,219 --> 00:08:54,481
Did uncle...

84
00:08:54,754 --> 00:08:56,051
Leave it. It's okay!

85
00:08:57,723 --> 00:08:58,815
Okay, forget about it.

86
00:08:58,891 --> 00:09:01,485
We have brought something for you...

87
00:09:01,527 --> 00:09:03,552
...which you will not want to miss.

88
00:09:03,696 --> 00:09:04,754
Guess what?

89
00:09:04,964 --> 00:09:08,695
Tickets for the
Adelaide X-treme Sports Event!

90
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:09,892
Yeah baby!

91
00:09:09,969 --> 00:09:11,027
And let's see what it says!

92
00:09:13,572 --> 00:09:16,507
1 week of certified fun
for Mr. Karan Malhotra...

93
00:09:16,575 --> 00:09:20,136
...starting tomorrow at 9 A. M!

94
00:10:39,558 --> 00:10:42,823
Sana, come here.

95
00:10:52,605 --> 00:10:53,663
Just a second.

96
00:11:40,052 --> 00:11:41,519
Sunny, Please!

97
00:11:41,587 --> 00:11:42,645
Sheena, I don't want you here!

98
00:11:42,721 --> 00:11:43,745
Just go!

99
00:11:43,856 --> 00:11:46,051
...the car racing starts in an hour.

100
00:11:46,158 --> 00:11:48,922
...the grand bike.

101
00:11:48,961 --> 00:11:51,521
The first is Streets...

102
00:11:51,597 --> 00:11:55,590
Sana, I am going to
have another breakup!

103
00:11:56,001 --> 00:11:58,128
But you just had one last
month, didn't you Sheena?

104
00:11:58,204 --> 00:11:59,262
No!

105
00:11:59,538 --> 00:12:01,733
That was with Shekar!
Now it's with Sandy!

106
00:12:02,074 --> 00:12:04,167
Sandy is a very cool guy!

107
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:07,135
But, I am bad luck for him.

108
00:12:07,613 --> 00:12:08,807
We have gone on two dates.

109
00:12:08,881 --> 00:12:10,678
And everything
possible has gone wrong.

110
00:12:10,749 --> 00:12:12,683
Who told you that you
are responsible for this?

111
00:12:12,751 --> 00:12:13,809
Sandy!

112
00:12:14,186 --> 00:12:17,280
And, today he is
taking part in a race.

113
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:21,185
And what if he lost because of me.

114
00:12:21,594 --> 00:12:22,959
No Sheena, don't worry!

115
00:12:23,062 --> 00:12:24,154
Don't worry!

116
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,288
I will talk to him!

117
00:12:25,564 --> 00:12:27,623
Either he won't take
part in this race.

118
00:12:27,766 --> 00:12:29,825
And if he does, he will have to win.

119
00:12:30,769 --> 00:12:31,827
Where is he?

120
00:12:31,904 --> 00:12:33,303
Come on! There! There!

121
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,098
There he is! There he is!

122
00:12:36,175 --> 00:12:37,574
Where?
- There!

123
00:12:38,043 --> 00:12:40,978
Near the bike. - Don't tell
him that I have sent you, okay!

124
00:12:41,046 --> 00:12:42,513
Actually tell him!

125
00:12:42,581 --> 00:12:43,639
And, you will handle
it, right! - Yes, yes.

126
00:12:43,716 --> 00:12:45,581
Fine, handle everything.
- But where are you going?

127
00:12:45,718 --> 00:12:49,154
What's in that place?

128
00:12:49,722 --> 00:12:52,156
Damn easy.

129
00:12:53,058 --> 00:12:54,719
Alright buddy, you be careful.

130
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,921
Alright mate, you have a good one.
- This is Karan. You are Billy.

131
00:12:57,196 --> 00:12:59,664
This is a hard one, you
have a really nice one.

132
00:12:59,732 --> 00:13:01,597
Take care of yourself.
- Alright.

133
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:02,725
Excuse me!

134
00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:12,068
Hi, I am Sana!

135
00:13:12,745 --> 00:13:13,803
Me too!

136
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,548
I mean you too! I mean...

137
00:13:17,683 --> 00:13:19,014
I am Sheena's friend.

138
00:13:19,151 --> 00:13:23,019
Sheena! Yes, of course!

139
00:13:23,689 --> 00:13:26,283
You believe in fate, correct?

140
00:13:26,592 --> 00:13:29,254
Well, we're meeting like
this, isn't this fate?

141
00:13:30,129 --> 00:13:31,221
No!

142
00:13:31,297 --> 00:13:33,288
It's not because of fate,
it's because of love.

143
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:37,895
Well, only fortunate ones find love!

144
00:13:38,237 --> 00:13:41,502
Yes! But love can change fates too!

145
00:13:41,907 --> 00:13:43,568
It doesn't destroy your fate!

146
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:48,505
For the sake of love, you
will have to win today! - Race.

147
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,639
Because if you lose.,
- No problem!

148
00:13:50,849 --> 00:13:52,578
And what if I win?

149
00:13:54,787 --> 00:13:57,255
Then we will celebrate
this victory together.

150
00:13:57,723 --> 00:14:00,214
Promise!
- All the best.

151
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,056
Where were you?

152
00:14:06,131 --> 00:14:07,189
We were searching all over for you!

153
00:14:07,266 --> 00:14:08,733
I need a bike
- You want to race!

154
00:14:08,801 --> 00:14:09,859
Yes!

155
00:14:09,935 --> 00:14:10,993
You found him cute!

156
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,128
Why, are you feeling jealous?

157
00:14:12,204 --> 00:14:15,139
No! But for the first time
you liked one of my boyfriends.

158
00:14:15,274 --> 00:14:17,742
Either you have changed,
or my taste.

159
00:14:17,876 --> 00:14:20,071
Your taste hasn't changed,
it has improved.

160
00:14:20,212 --> 00:14:22,009
Well done Sheena, I am proud of you.

161
00:14:22,948 --> 00:14:25,143
Who told you that
you can win this race?

162
00:14:25,217 --> 00:14:27,276
Sana did.

163
00:14:27,553 --> 00:14:28,679
Sana! - Really!

164
00:14:29,154 --> 00:14:31,884
Who is Sana?
- Sheena's friend!

165
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,781
And who is Sheena?

166
00:14:33,859 --> 00:14:35,258
'Back to the pit, big pretty... '

167
00:14:35,561 --> 00:14:36,550
I don't know?

168
00:14:36,628 --> 00:14:38,755
Hey, come on. Watch me.

169
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:41,496
Sunny will win.

170
00:14:46,739 --> 00:14:50,800
Karan. Come on karan.

171
00:14:53,178 --> 00:14:54,236
Karan.

172
00:15:06,558 --> 00:15:11,188
Come on, come on you can do it.
- Yes. - Come on.

173
00:15:16,135 --> 00:15:17,193
Karan.

174
00:15:45,898 --> 00:15:50,801
Oh no
- Go. Go. Go. - Yes.

175
00:16:02,514 --> 00:16:04,675
Come on. Yes. Yes.

176
00:16:19,798 --> 00:16:23,564
Come on.
- Do it.

177
00:16:38,984 --> 00:16:41,782
Yes.
- Come on.

178
00:16:46,492 --> 00:16:47,516
Come on.

179
00:16:49,795 --> 00:16:51,023
They are going towards the pitch.

180
00:16:59,705 --> 00:17:01,696
Come on Sandy.

181
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,546
The one who has won is not Sandy...
- He is Sandy.

182
00:17:17,656 --> 00:17:18,918
What's wrong with you?
- Sandy has lost, Sana.

183
00:17:20,626 --> 00:17:22,025
Come let's go from here.

184
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,688
Hey Karan, cheer up dude. You won.

185
00:17:24,763 --> 00:17:26,162
Yeah, I know but where is she?

186
00:17:26,231 --> 00:17:28,256
There you go champ, you have won.

187
00:17:29,134 --> 00:17:30,931
Now he is the champion,
he is become arrogant.

188
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:32,828
Karan! What are you looking for?

189
00:17:33,138 --> 00:17:34,264
Don't ask what?

190
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,201
Ask, Karan whom are you looking for?

191
00:17:36,275 --> 00:17:37,799
Sheena, it's just a race.

192
00:17:37,876 --> 00:17:39,070
Someone wins and someone loses.

193
00:17:39,645 --> 00:17:40,703
But Sandy wins this race every year.

194
00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:42,474
For the last time,
it's not your fault!

195
00:17:42,548 --> 00:17:43,606
Then whose fault is it?

196
00:17:44,016 --> 00:17:45,074
I don't know!

197
00:17:45,651 --> 00:17:47,482
Come on, let's go sit on
that roller coaster! - No, no!

198
00:17:47,553 --> 00:17:48,679
...Come on!
- No, no!

199
00:17:49,154 --> 00:17:50,212
Guys! Guys! Guys! Guys!

200
00:17:50,622 --> 00:17:51,714
I think that was Sana!

201
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:52,814
Sana!

202
00:17:52,925 --> 00:17:53,983
Yes she is!

203
00:17:54,026 --> 00:17:55,084
Listen, has he gone mad...

204
00:18:05,003 --> 00:18:06,061
Where did he go?

205
00:18:09,074 --> 00:18:10,234
What the hell are you doing here?

206
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:13,569
Of course not.

207
00:18:13,645 --> 00:18:14,703
Have you gone mad?

208
00:18:16,582 --> 00:18:17,640
Not until now.

209
00:18:17,716 --> 00:18:19,013
But seems like your friend
is going to drive me crazy!

210
00:18:19,518 --> 00:18:20,985
Anyway! Place and time!

211
00:18:22,187 --> 00:18:23,245
Shit!

212
00:18:23,555 --> 00:18:25,113
Operator, can you
get him off please!

213
00:18:25,157 --> 00:18:26,818
I can't stop it before
it takes a full round.

214
00:18:27,659 --> 00:18:29,627
Oh God! This is so embarrassing,
everyone is watching...

215
00:18:29,661 --> 00:18:31,561
...can you please get off?
- Okay!

216
00:18:34,633 --> 00:18:36,794
Oh my god. - Karan!

217
00:18:36,935 --> 00:18:37,993
Come on!

218
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,128
All I am asking for is a date!

219
00:18:39,471 --> 00:18:42,463
You had told me, if I
win we will celebrate.

220
00:18:42,741 --> 00:18:44,174
All in the name of love.

221
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,737
You asked him to win
the race and not sandy!

222
00:18:46,878 --> 00:18:47,970
What difference does it make?

223
00:18:48,046 --> 00:18:49,604
If Sandy had to win the race,
then he would have won it!

224
00:18:49,681 --> 00:18:52,707
How can Sandy win, when
my lady luck is with me?

225
00:18:52,884 --> 00:18:53,942
Excuse me!

226
00:18:54,019 --> 00:18:55,953
I am not your lady, and I
am definitely not your luck!

227
00:18:56,521 --> 00:18:57,715
Of course, you are his lady luck.

228
00:18:57,823 --> 00:18:59,484
That's why he win the race, and me...

229
00:18:59,591 --> 00:19:00,785
...I am just unlucky!
Unlucky! Unlucky!

230
00:19:00,892 --> 00:19:01,916
Sheena! Please behave yourself!

231
00:19:02,094 --> 00:19:03,118
I am not talking to you!

232
00:19:03,195 --> 00:19:04,594
I am not talking to you!
- Girls! Girls! Girls!

233
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,593
Calm down! I am hanging!

234
00:19:07,199 --> 00:19:08,666
So Sana, where would you like to go?

235
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,800
Excuse me, I don't
go out with strangers!

236
00:19:11,103 --> 00:19:12,161
Alright then!

237
00:19:12,237 --> 00:19:13,898
Karan! Age 23! From Sydney!

238
00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:17,007
Current status single, and waiting!

239
00:19:17,576 --> 00:19:19,908
Say yes, Sana! He is so adorable.

240
00:19:19,978 --> 00:19:21,036
Are you out of your mind?

241
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:25,107
Please say yes Sana, he will
fall down, die... turn into a ghost...

242
00:19:25,183 --> 00:19:26,241
...and will come and scare us!

243
00:19:26,518 --> 00:19:31,046
...Just say yes...
- Oh sorry.

244
00:19:31,123 --> 00:19:32,647
Relax! Relax!

245
00:19:32,924 --> 00:19:34,016
We will go out okay!

246
00:19:34,126 --> 00:19:35,150
Don't worry about it!

247
00:19:35,227 --> 00:19:36,524
We are on for a date!

248
00:19:37,729 --> 00:19:38,787
So, when and where?

249
00:19:38,864 --> 00:19:40,559
Shall I pick you up or
will you come by yourself?

250
00:19:40,699 --> 00:19:41,825
First dinner or straight partying!

251
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,060
So, how would you like to
spend the evening with me Sana?

252
00:19:44,036 --> 00:19:45,094
Not with you Mr. Karan!

253
00:19:45,671 --> 00:19:47,070
Hey! Hey! Hey! That's not fair!

254
00:19:47,139 --> 00:19:48,697
And what you did
with me, what was that?

255
00:19:49,007 --> 00:19:50,531
You put me in an
embarrassing situation...

256
00:19:50,609 --> 00:19:51,769
...and then blackmailed me!

257
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,168
All you get is a big no!

258
00:19:53,612 --> 00:19:54,670
Listen...

259
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,141
Sheena!

260
00:19:59,618 --> 00:20:00,676
We will meet again!

261
00:20:01,953 --> 00:20:03,011
Definitely meet again.

262
00:20:04,756 --> 00:20:06,690
She put your
entire heroism to shame!

263
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,787
Karan, that's the last samosa left!

264
00:20:09,928 --> 00:20:11,020
Pick it up!

265
00:20:11,096 --> 00:20:16,659
He doesn't want samosa, he
wants Sana! - He wants Sana! Okay...

266
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:19,569
It's not funny guys! I am stressing!

267
00:20:19,638 --> 00:20:20,866
I can see her everywhere!

268
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,898
See that poster there!

269
00:20:23,108 --> 00:20:24,166
That's Sana!

270
00:20:24,643 --> 00:20:25,735
These girls that you can see!

271
00:20:26,178 --> 00:20:27,236
Both of them are Sana!

272
00:20:27,312 --> 00:20:28,973
What?
- These flowers...

273
00:20:29,681 --> 00:20:31,774
I can see Sana in every petal.

274
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,208
God!

275
00:20:33,285 --> 00:20:34,582
That bus that you see!

276
00:20:34,653 --> 00:20:36,086
I can see Sana in that too!

277
00:20:36,188 --> 00:20:37,553
God! Sana! Sana! Sana!

278
00:20:38,557 --> 00:20:39,649
All of you are laughing!

279
00:20:39,725 --> 00:20:41,022
I am suffering! It's not funny!

280
00:20:41,126 --> 00:20:44,527
Hey lover boy, Sana
really is in that bus.

281
00:20:44,596 --> 00:20:45,654
What?

282
00:20:58,143 --> 00:21:00,873
Oh no
- I am sorry, guys. - Idiot.

283
00:21:00,979 --> 00:21:03,743
I am sorry. - Idiot sorry.
- Stop it, she is my car.

284
00:21:03,815 --> 00:21:05,646
You are in a hurry to go somewhere.

285
00:21:05,717 --> 00:21:09,551
Get you.

286
00:21:15,694 --> 00:21:17,127
Stephen.
- Hang on.

287
00:21:19,931 --> 00:21:21,091
Take him.

288
00:21:27,973 --> 00:21:29,031
Come on. Come on.

289
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,088
Please guys, sorry.

290
00:22:54,926 --> 00:22:56,018
Here I come Sana.

291
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,258
Yes.

292
00:23:22,554 --> 00:23:25,887
Hello. Hello.

293
00:23:26,191 --> 00:23:27,249
What are you doing here?

294
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,984
Sorry.

295
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:32,788
You, here...

296
00:23:33,064 --> 00:23:34,224
I was following your bus.

297
00:23:35,066 --> 00:23:37,000
Battling the traffic,
escaping the wrestlers.

298
00:23:37,535 --> 00:23:39,560
From the port, to the top of the
bridge, and then on top of your bus.

299
00:23:39,638 --> 00:23:40,696
And then, finally here
on top of your house.

300
00:23:41,573 --> 00:23:44,508
I mean Outside! Inside! Whatever...

301
00:23:44,576 --> 00:23:45,634
Okay! Okay! Okay!

302
00:23:46,711 --> 00:23:48,076
What do you want?

303
00:23:50,949 --> 00:23:52,007
Water!

304
00:23:54,586 --> 00:23:55,644
Thank you!

305
00:24:00,926 --> 00:24:02,826
Karan, what do you really want?

306
00:24:04,596 --> 00:24:05,654
Karan!

307
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:08,527
I want you to fulfill your promise!

308
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,125
I won the race, for you!

309
00:24:11,569 --> 00:24:12,627
I know!

310
00:24:12,704 --> 00:24:13,762
But you shouldn't have won!

311
00:24:14,272 --> 00:24:15,762
It was a mistake!
- Mistake!

312
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:18,168
You asked me to win,
that's why I won!

313
00:24:18,576 --> 00:24:20,567
If you would have asked me to
lose, I would have easily lost.

314
00:24:20,879 --> 00:24:23,541
But you asked me to win,
so what am I supposed to do?

315
00:24:23,615 --> 00:24:24,673
I don't know!

316
00:24:24,749 --> 00:24:25,807
I thought you were Sandy!

317
00:24:25,951 --> 00:24:27,009
But you are not Sandy!

318
00:24:27,719 --> 00:24:29,118
Hi, I am Sandy!

319
00:24:29,621 --> 00:24:31,088
Kalidas has said,
what's in the name?

320
00:24:31,189 --> 00:24:32,884
Not Kalidas, Shakespeare!

321
00:24:33,191 --> 00:24:34,749
What's in the name Saba?

322
00:24:34,793 --> 00:24:37,159
Not Saba, Sana!
- Exactly!

323
00:24:37,228 --> 00:24:38,490
Listen!

324
00:24:39,497 --> 00:24:42,864
Since I've seen you, I can only see
in you in everything and everyone.

325
00:24:43,168 --> 00:24:46,660
When I look into the mirror,
I see your face not mine!

326
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,572
Hello. Say something.

327
00:24:53,144 --> 00:24:56,204
Karan! Are you free this evening?

328
00:24:56,514 --> 00:24:57,879
I am free right now,
shall we go now?

329
00:25:00,585 --> 00:25:01,643
Don't push your luck!

330
00:25:03,254 --> 00:25:07,918
Yes. Yes.

331
00:25:08,026 --> 00:25:09,152
Yes. Yes. She said yes.

332
00:25:10,228 --> 00:25:11,695
Life is good. Life is great.
Life is good. Life is great.

333
00:25:11,763 --> 00:25:14,732
Romeo and Juliet!

334
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,900
Romeo and Juliet!
- Yes.

335
00:25:17,535 --> 00:25:19,264
Do you remember the balcony
scene in Romeo and Juliet?

336
00:25:20,005 --> 00:25:22,997
Where Romeo risks his life
to give a rose to Juliet!

337
00:25:23,608 --> 00:25:24,666
It's so romantic.

338
00:25:24,776 --> 00:25:26,175
There should be
something special in the boy!

339
00:25:27,145 --> 00:25:29,045
There is always something special in
every boy, isn't it Sana? - Karan!

340
00:25:30,015 --> 00:25:32,745
I know what special quality
you Romeo should have? - What?

341
00:25:33,651 --> 00:25:35,812
One, he should be smart and sexy!

342
00:25:36,721 --> 00:25:39,622
Two, he should have muscles, or
else how will he climb the balcony?

343
00:25:39,891 --> 00:25:40,983
He should be able to make you laugh!

344
00:25:41,793 --> 00:25:45,490
And he should have a
lot of love for you!

345
00:25:45,563 --> 00:25:46,621
Correct!

346
00:25:46,965 --> 00:25:48,694
So basically I know
what you are looking for!

347
00:25:49,768 --> 00:25:50,826
Me!

348
00:25:51,669 --> 00:25:54,001
I am smart, I am definitely sexy.

349
00:25:54,672 --> 00:25:56,606
I can make you laugh, I am strong.

350
00:25:56,708 --> 00:25:58,903
There's a little
problem about love! .

351
00:25:59,511 --> 00:26:00,944
But I'll come along.
- Stop it Karan!

352
00:26:01,012 --> 00:26:02,070
Come on, it's the truth!

353
00:26:02,147 --> 00:26:03,910
Stop it.
- This is the truth, you know it.

354
00:26:04,716 --> 00:26:05,774
"Say the truth!"

355
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,578
"Say the truth!"

356
00:26:31,543 --> 00:26:34,535
"Say the truth! Say, Say the truth!"

357
00:26:34,612 --> 00:26:37,479
"Say the truth. Say the truth."

358
00:26:38,483 --> 00:26:41,782
"Say the truth. Say the truth."

359
00:26:42,053 --> 00:26:45,614
"Looking at me,
doesn't your heart say?"

360
00:26:45,924 --> 00:26:49,690
"One that loves you and
always stays close to you!"

361
00:26:49,794 --> 00:26:52,888
"Should be like me...
or should be it me!"

362
00:26:53,098 --> 00:26:54,895
"Should be me, yes it should be me."

363
00:26:55,033 --> 00:26:56,864
"Should be like me...
or should be it me!"

364
00:26:57,001 --> 00:26:58,992
"Or should be it me."

365
00:27:03,174 --> 00:27:04,232
"Say the truth!"

366
00:27:04,976 --> 00:27:06,034
"Say the truth!"

367
00:27:06,578 --> 00:27:09,877
"Whether you accept it or not!"

368
00:27:10,515 --> 00:27:14,178
"You desire to find someone!"

369
00:27:18,123 --> 00:27:21,615
"Whether you accept it or not!"

370
00:27:21,926 --> 00:27:25,191
"You want someone to
be crazy for you!"

371
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:27,259
"One that sings only for you!"

372
00:27:27,532 --> 00:27:29,090
"One who forgets
himself in your presence."

373
00:27:29,267 --> 00:27:30,734
"One that only loves you!"

374
00:27:31,136 --> 00:27:32,797
"Only you."

375
00:27:33,071 --> 00:27:34,834
"One that only looks at you."

376
00:27:35,006 --> 00:27:36,997
"Only you."

377
00:27:37,075 --> 00:27:38,702
"Say the truth!"
- "Say the truth!"

378
00:27:38,776 --> 00:27:40,710
"Say the truth!"
- "Say the truth!"

379
00:27:40,812 --> 00:27:44,475
"Say the truth!"
- "Say the truth!"

380
00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:48,076
"Looking at me,
doesn't your heart say?"

381
00:27:48,553 --> 00:27:52,182
"The one that loves you,
always stays close to you!"

382
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:55,516
"Should be like me...
or should it be me!"

383
00:27:55,693 --> 00:27:57,490
"It Should be me,
yes it should be me!"

384
00:27:57,662 --> 00:28:00,153
"It should be me,
yes it should be me!"

385
00:28:00,231 --> 00:28:03,200
"It should be me,
yes it should be me!"

386
00:28:09,908 --> 00:28:11,034
"Say the truth!"

387
00:28:12,644 --> 00:28:14,043
"Say the truth!"

388
00:28:28,826 --> 00:28:30,885
Karan, what are you doing
here so early in the morning?

389
00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:32,087
Waiting for sunshine!

390
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:33,997
But it was dawn a long time back!

391
00:28:34,165 --> 00:28:35,223
It is just now.

392
00:28:38,536 --> 00:28:39,730
What do you want now Karan?

393
00:28:40,672 --> 00:28:44,472
Nothing! I just, came
to give you this flower!

394
00:28:45,743 --> 00:28:48,644
You didn't come so far, so early
in the morning, to give me a flower.

395
00:28:48,913 --> 00:28:50,642
So you might as well
tell me what you want.

396
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:54,145
One more day,
please! Just one more day.

397
00:28:54,219 --> 00:28:55,550
Karan, I can't!

398
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,611
Please, I promise I
won't disturb you at all!

399
00:28:57,989 --> 00:28:59,616
I will just look at you from far!

400
00:28:59,991 --> 00:29:01,015
No! Now go!

401
00:29:01,192 --> 00:29:02,887
Come on Sana, say yes sometimes.

402
00:29:03,127 --> 00:29:05,493
It is such a simple word!
It is such a nice word!

403
00:29:05,597 --> 00:29:06,825
Y E S, yes!

404
00:29:06,998 --> 00:29:08,158
Is your name Sana? Yes!

405
00:29:08,233 --> 00:29:09,598
Do you live here? Yes!

406
00:29:09,667 --> 00:29:11,498
Will you go out with Karan? Yes!

407
00:29:11,569 --> 00:29:12,934
Are you leaving?
- Yes!

408
00:29:13,171 --> 00:29:14,229
No! No! No! No!

409
00:29:15,506 --> 00:29:17,167
Come on, please say yes.

410
00:29:17,575 --> 00:29:18,940
Karan, you and I don't
have anything in common.

411
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:20,534
We are completely different.

412
00:29:20,912 --> 00:29:22,504
Rubbish! We are just the same.

413
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,241
Two arms, two ears,
two eyes, one nose.

414
00:29:24,649 --> 00:29:26,549
Now, even my face
resembles you slightly.

415
00:29:27,619 --> 00:29:28,677
You won't give up!

416
00:29:32,657 --> 00:29:34,625
Is that a yes?
- Yes!

417
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:37,853
Yes. Yes. Yes.

418
00:29:39,864 --> 00:29:42,059
She said yes again.
- You are my lucky charm.

419
00:29:44,535 --> 00:29:45,729
I love hot dogs.

420
00:29:45,937 --> 00:29:50,033
Not like you, I mean,
like true love.

421
00:29:50,275 --> 00:29:51,537
If hot dog would have been a bitch...

422
00:29:51,609 --> 00:29:52,871
...I would have been married by now.

423
00:29:52,944 --> 00:29:54,775
I can see, true love.

424
00:29:56,147 --> 00:29:57,273
You know what I feel.

425
00:29:57,815 --> 00:29:58,941
Your life is...

426
00:29:59,817 --> 00:30:01,682
Is like a hotdog without a sausage.

427
00:30:01,886 --> 00:30:04,548
I am sure you haven't done
anything exciting in your life.

428
00:30:04,589 --> 00:30:05,681
Of course I have.

429
00:30:06,157 --> 00:30:07,181
Like what?

430
00:30:07,258 --> 00:30:10,125
Like painting, like poetry,
like gardening.

431
00:30:11,029 --> 00:30:12,291
I said something exciting!

432
00:30:12,563 --> 00:30:14,554
Painting, poetry, blah-blah!

433
00:30:14,632 --> 00:30:15,690
What do you mean then?

434
00:30:15,767 --> 00:30:17,234
I mean, today you
should do something...

435
00:30:17,302 --> 00:30:18,826
...that you have never done
ever before in your life.

436
00:30:18,903 --> 00:30:20,063
Right here, right now.

437
00:30:20,138 --> 00:30:23,699
Something crazy, something
wild, something, naughty.

438
00:30:23,775 --> 00:30:26,300
Excuse me! - No, no, no I
don't mean that naughty.

439
00:30:26,811 --> 00:30:29,177
Well like, a little naughty,
I mean something crazy!

440
00:30:29,247 --> 00:30:32,774
Like, robbery!
- Robbery!

441
00:30:34,252 --> 00:30:35,844
You mean stealing!
- No, I mean eating.

442
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,114
Obviously!

443
00:30:38,623 --> 00:30:39,954
I am not asking you to rob a bank.

444
00:30:40,658 --> 00:30:43,752
Something small, so
like something very small.

445
00:30:43,828 --> 00:30:45,989
Like a mini-skirt, like that one.
- Are you crazy?

446
00:30:46,731 --> 00:30:48,198
Come on, it's just for fun!

447
00:30:48,266 --> 00:30:49,597
What difference will
it make to anyone here?

448
00:30:50,535 --> 00:30:53,003
Look, I have never done
anything like this before...

449
00:30:53,071 --> 00:30:54,629
That's why it's important to do it.

450
00:30:55,206 --> 00:30:57,071
Otherwise, accept it. All your
life you will live like this.

451
00:30:57,542 --> 00:30:58,941
Like this hotdog without sausage.

452
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:00,204
Are you trying to challenge me?

453
00:31:00,278 --> 00:31:01,540
Nope!

454
00:31:01,612 --> 00:31:02,943
Actually yeah,
because you can't do it!

455
00:31:03,147 --> 00:31:04,205
Sana can't do it!

456
00:31:04,282 --> 00:31:05,749
There is no way in the world
that you can do it! - Stop it!

457
00:31:05,817 --> 00:31:06,875
You don't have a chance.
- Stop it!

458
00:31:06,951 --> 00:31:08,009
You don't have a scope.

459
00:31:08,086 --> 00:31:09,144
Stop it Karan, I will do it fine.

460
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,744
You will do it!
- Yes.

461
00:31:11,289 --> 00:31:13,086
Excellent! Great, done!

462
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:16,549
Which shop, take your pick.

463
00:31:17,762 --> 00:31:18,820
Come on.

464
00:31:19,163 --> 00:31:20,221
That one.

465
00:31:23,668 --> 00:31:25,192
What's up!
- Hi!

466
00:31:27,905 --> 00:31:29,566
Come on Sana, you can do it.

467
00:31:37,115 --> 00:31:38,173
Excuse me!

468
00:31:38,249 --> 00:31:39,807
How much is that for?

469
00:31:39,884 --> 00:31:41,784
The price is written on it!
- Excellent!

470
00:32:04,876 --> 00:32:06,707
Karan! I stole it! I stole it!

471
00:32:07,612 --> 00:32:08,738
Why are you getting so excited?

472
00:32:08,813 --> 00:32:11,611
You didn't win the Olympics.
It's just stealing!

473
00:32:11,682 --> 00:32:13,206
Yeah, but look he is so cute!

474
00:32:13,284 --> 00:32:15,650
Winkydinks says hi
to Karan! Hi Karan!

475
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,086
Hi Winkydinks!

476
00:32:18,156 --> 00:32:19,180
Yes, nice name isn't it?

477
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:21,656
Winkydinks, do you
want to kiss Karan? Yes!

478
00:32:24,128 --> 00:32:25,186
How sweet!

479
00:32:25,263 --> 00:32:27,595
Winkydinks, time to go home.

480
00:32:27,665 --> 00:32:29,155
Why but, no! Karan! Karan, no!

481
00:32:29,734 --> 00:32:31,725
Sana, it's stolen,
we have to return it!

482
00:32:31,803 --> 00:32:33,566
Yes! But Winkydinks
doesn't want to go home.

483
00:32:33,638 --> 00:32:35,230
Winkydinks, do you
want to go back home?

484
00:32:35,306 --> 00:32:37,570
No ma'am, see so sad.

485
00:32:38,509 --> 00:32:39,567
How sad!

486
00:32:39,644 --> 00:32:40,702
Hey you! Stop there!

487
00:32:40,778 --> 00:32:41,836
Oh damn!
- Bye!

488
00:32:41,913 --> 00:32:43,744
Bloody shoplifters!

489
00:32:46,751 --> 00:32:48,150
Okay, now it's your turn.

490
00:32:48,219 --> 00:32:50,244
My turn! What turn! U-turn!

491
00:32:50,521 --> 00:32:53,615
Karan! To do something
you have never done before.

492
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:56,787
Well come to think of it,
I have done everything.

493
00:32:56,861 --> 00:32:58,192
I have done it all.

494
00:32:58,262 --> 00:32:59,593
Okay, what about poetry.

495
00:33:00,565 --> 00:33:02,533
Poetry! Please Sana!

496
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,068
Come on, it's lot of fun
and it's really easy. - No!

497
00:33:05,136 --> 00:33:06,194
For example.

498
00:33:06,571 --> 00:33:10,598
You say, there is mischief,
there is love in your eyes.

499
00:33:10,675 --> 00:33:14,975
And, I'll say, there is allurement,
there is acceptance in your eyes.

500
00:33:15,046 --> 00:33:18,277
I will live in your eyes,
what's the big deal!

501
00:33:18,716 --> 00:33:19,774
Poetry is useless.

502
00:33:23,221 --> 00:33:24,279
One second!

503
00:33:24,689 --> 00:33:29,251
Excuse me ladies and gentlemen, can
you please come closer, come closer.

504
00:33:29,594 --> 00:33:30,686
Not you!

505
00:33:31,162 --> 00:33:32,220
Why?

506
00:33:32,296 --> 00:33:33,854
People, listen to me.

507
00:33:34,298 --> 00:33:36,562
This gentlemen here, is going to
recite some meaningful poetry...

508
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:42,037
Karan Malhotra, age 23 from Sydney.

509
00:33:42,106 --> 00:33:45,166
Current state is single
and finally fluttering.

510
00:33:47,578 --> 00:33:49,512
I can't do this. Have
you lost your marbles?

511
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:53,812
"Why has the
ambience changed suddenly?"

512
00:33:54,752 --> 00:33:55,810
This is so unfair!

513
00:33:55,887 --> 00:33:57,855
I am going to Winkydinks.
- Karan, it's really easy!

514
00:33:57,922 --> 00:33:58,946
No Sana!
- Come on. - No.

515
00:33:59,524 --> 00:34:03,756
"Why has the weather
changed so suddenly?"

516
00:34:16,941 --> 00:34:21,207
"Why has the weather
changed so suddenly?"

517
00:34:21,979 --> 00:34:26,279
"It's the nature of life,
what else do I say?"

518
00:34:26,617 --> 00:34:31,281
"This breeze, what
does it say to you?"

519
00:34:31,556 --> 00:34:36,653
"It says, you continue to sing."

520
00:34:36,727 --> 00:34:41,528
"Where does road take us?"

521
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:45,897
"Come, let us see."

522
00:34:47,038 --> 00:34:51,168
"Do these flowers
always smell so good?"

523
00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:56,241
"They have a good heart,
what else do they say?"

524
00:35:02,053 --> 00:35:06,251
"Why has the weather
changed so suddenly?"

525
00:35:07,024 --> 00:35:11,654
"It's the nature of life,
what else do I say?"

526
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:36,543
"Since the past few days, I feel."

527
00:35:37,521 --> 00:35:41,719
"This world... is
such a beautiful place."

528
00:35:42,193 --> 00:35:46,994
"If there is a heaven,
it's right here."

529
00:35:47,064 --> 00:35:51,057
"Why? Why do I feel that?"

530
00:35:52,503 --> 00:35:56,837
"When life is
filled with happiness."

531
00:35:57,608 --> 00:36:01,908
"When every moment is joyful."

532
00:36:02,513 --> 00:36:06,916
"Then everything looks lovely."

533
00:36:06,984 --> 00:36:10,943
"It may be a sign of love."

534
00:36:12,123 --> 00:36:16,526
"Why are the petals so delicate?"

535
00:36:17,028 --> 00:36:21,692
"They are shy, and what do I say."

536
00:36:57,601 --> 00:37:01,697
"The birds on the trees,
what are the lyrics?"

537
00:37:02,673 --> 00:37:06,700
"They are repeating."

538
00:37:07,511 --> 00:37:12,005
"It seems they are
trying to tell us something."

539
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:15,780
"Why do I feel so?"

540
00:37:17,555 --> 00:37:22,117
"The birds singing all they know."

541
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:27,259
"The true meaning of
living life is to fly high."

542
00:37:27,631 --> 00:37:32,068
"They want us to
believe in this too."

543
00:37:32,136 --> 00:37:35,936
"That's how it is."

544
00:37:37,074 --> 00:37:41,511
"Why is this ray of
light so goldenish?"

545
00:37:41,979 --> 00:37:46,541
"It's becoming evening,
what else do I say?"

546
00:37:56,727 --> 00:37:57,921
I love the rain!

547
00:37:58,496 --> 00:38:00,487
The rain is so romantic,
isn't it? - Yup!

548
00:38:01,031 --> 00:38:03,499
You know what's the
best part of rain? - What?

549
00:38:03,567 --> 00:38:04,625
Mud!

550
00:38:04,869 --> 00:38:06,496
When someone steps in the
puddle and gets splattered...

551
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:08,003
...it's so fun to watch it.

552
00:38:08,105 --> 00:38:09,163
Like when we play football.

553
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,674
One kick after another,
and another, and another.

554
00:38:11,742 --> 00:38:15,234
If you come out of the mud, you
will realize how romantic rains are.

555
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,047
Karan! Karan!

556
00:38:19,683 --> 00:38:21,674
Karan! Stop it, come here!

557
00:38:23,087 --> 00:38:25,715
Tell me Karan, you know
almost everything about me!

558
00:38:26,123 --> 00:38:27,556
Won't you tell me
anything about yourself?

559
00:38:27,625 --> 00:38:29,525
Karan Malhotra, Age 23, from Sydney!

560
00:38:29,627 --> 00:38:32,755
Current status single and
splattering! Splattering!

561
00:38:32,963 --> 00:38:34,089
Seriously!

562
00:38:34,999 --> 00:38:37,194
About yourself! About your family!

563
00:38:40,538 --> 00:38:41,835
Mummy used to love me a lot.

564
00:38:42,506 --> 00:38:46,135
I felt as if, she showered
all her love in 10 years.

565
00:38:47,645 --> 00:38:48,907
My dad, he is great.

566
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,204
But God has been
very unjust with him!

567
00:38:52,216 --> 00:38:55,708
He gave such a big man only 24
hours, like any other ordinary man.

568
00:38:55,786 --> 00:38:56,810
But he manages.

569
00:38:57,621 --> 00:39:00,522
At least, he does
manage his business.

570
00:39:00,925 --> 00:39:01,983
And the only one left is me.

571
00:39:02,092 --> 00:39:04,026
I have all the time, all
the time in the world.

572
00:39:04,094 --> 00:39:05,527
Fast cars, bikes, sports.

573
00:39:05,596 --> 00:39:06,654
Anything with an edge.

574
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:08,220
The more dangerous
it is, the better.

575
00:39:10,501 --> 00:39:11,763
Why do you like danger Karan?

576
00:39:15,005 --> 00:39:18,099
Maybe I want to see, the
limits I can push myself too.

577
00:39:21,178 --> 00:39:22,770
And if someday I do stray far away.

578
00:39:24,515 --> 00:39:25,641
No one will miss me.

579
00:39:31,055 --> 00:39:33,523
So, will I have to
show you another movie.

580
00:39:33,557 --> 00:39:35,821
...or will you spare me for a day?

581
00:39:37,561 --> 00:39:40,052
No Karan! I am going
back home tomorrow.

582
00:39:41,131 --> 00:39:42,530
I came here to study.

583
00:39:43,133 --> 00:39:45,260
And it has been 3 days
since my holidays started.

584
00:39:45,536 --> 00:39:47,265
Everyone is waiting for me at home.

585
00:39:49,106 --> 00:39:52,542
I had forgotten, you
have a real family.

586
00:39:54,011 --> 00:39:56,809
My train will leave at 10 o'clock
tomorrow from Central Station!

587
00:39:57,548 --> 00:39:58,810
If you want...
- No Sana!

588
00:40:00,117 --> 00:40:01,277
I won't come see you off!

589
00:40:03,687 --> 00:40:04,779
I hate goodbyes.

590
00:40:05,556 --> 00:40:10,255
Won't you even ask, when
will I return? Where I am going?

591
00:40:12,296 --> 00:40:13,558
What's the use?

592
00:40:14,064 --> 00:40:15,292
I'm going back to Sydney too!

593
00:40:16,233 --> 00:40:17,564
But there's no one waiting for me.

594
00:40:19,236 --> 00:40:20,567
But I will return next year.

595
00:40:20,638 --> 00:40:22,572
And I am sure that a
boring girl like you...

596
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,301
...won't have a boyfriend even then.

597
00:40:27,611 --> 00:40:29,169
Oh! I have got you something!

598
00:40:29,914 --> 00:40:30,972
Winkydinks.

599
00:40:31,649 --> 00:40:34,049
I didn't steal it!
I have bought them!

600
00:40:34,985 --> 00:40:37,613
Because we can't
live without you, ma'am.

601
00:40:39,023 --> 00:40:40,047
Thanks!

602
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:56,130
Either my luck is bad,
or your timing!

603
00:40:58,542 --> 00:40:59,600
Bye Karan!

604
00:41:17,895 --> 00:41:19,123
Take care of yourself Karan!

605
00:41:22,066 --> 00:41:28,835
Don't go too far, because
there's someone who'll miss you.

606
00:41:31,742 --> 00:41:32,800
Will miss you a lot!

607
00:41:35,312 --> 00:41:36,574
Bye.

608
00:41:52,763 --> 00:41:54,526
God knows, why hasn't
Karan arrived till now?

609
00:41:54,598 --> 00:41:55,656
We will miss our flight!

610
00:41:55,733 --> 00:41:57,257
Hey Karan! Where are you?

611
00:41:58,769 --> 00:41:59,827
You aren't coming, what?

612
00:42:01,038 --> 00:42:02,096
I am going to the railway station!

613
00:42:02,172 --> 00:42:04,265
The flight takes off from the
airport not the railway station!

614
00:42:04,942 --> 00:42:06,000
I know!

615
00:42:07,211 --> 00:42:08,269
I am going to stop Sana!

616
00:42:12,549 --> 00:42:16,076
So you are in love!
- Yes, yes I am!

617
00:42:16,153 --> 00:42:17,177
So, we will stay back too.

618
00:42:17,287 --> 00:42:18,686
We will leave only
after getting you married.

619
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:20,757
And I will dance.
- Shut up!

620
00:42:28,165 --> 00:42:29,962
So much traffic. I am late.
It's already 10 o'clock.

621
00:42:30,034 --> 00:42:31,899
Can you tell me what the fare is?
- It's 50 dollars.

622
00:42:31,969 --> 00:42:33,231
Hey, hey best of luck.

623
00:42:34,238 --> 00:42:36,172
I don't need luck I have love.

624
00:42:40,177 --> 00:42:41,235
'Don't be a fool, Sana! '

625
00:42:43,047 --> 00:42:44,105
'He won't come! '

626
00:42:51,021 --> 00:42:52,921
Ma'am board in. It's time to leave.

627
00:43:06,637 --> 00:43:07,695
Hang on.

628
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:33,819
"The Heart cannot endure the
separation... even for a moment."

629
00:43:33,897 --> 00:43:44,000
"Still I don't know why...
I couldn't express it."

630
00:43:44,074 --> 00:43:50,104
"You are my destiny!"

631
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:54,913
"Our love story is so strange!"

632
00:43:55,786 --> 00:43:58,118
"Like the dreams..."

633
00:43:58,155 --> 00:43:59,622
Excuse me.
- Yes.

634
00:44:00,023 --> 00:44:03,117
The train from platform
number 6, where does it go.

635
00:44:03,694 --> 00:44:06,060
Over there. All of the four
stations on the monitor there.

636
00:44:09,099 --> 00:44:10,157
Thanks.
- Fine.

637
00:44:45,702 --> 00:44:48,000
Strath Alybyn! Here I come.

638
00:44:51,241 --> 00:44:53,607
Hello. Ms. Alba. Karan.

639
00:44:53,777 --> 00:44:55,836
Karan. How are you?

640
00:44:55,913 --> 00:44:57,540
I am doing well.
How's dad? Is he around?

641
00:44:57,614 --> 00:44:59,582
No, he is in a meeting.

642
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:02,983
Great. Tell dad I will
spend time with uncle Ya.

643
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,544
Uncle Ya!

644
00:45:04,655 --> 00:45:08,022
Uncle Ya, Ms. Alba. My uncle.
The greatest scientist in the world.

645
00:45:18,202 --> 00:45:19,260
Uncle Ya.

646
00:45:19,536 --> 00:45:20,594
So what brings you here?

647
00:45:21,538 --> 00:45:24,735
Uncle, I just felt like
meeting you so I came here.

648
00:45:24,808 --> 00:45:25,934
What is her name?

649
00:45:28,111 --> 00:45:29,169
Whose?

650
00:45:29,246 --> 00:45:32,044
Look, your uncle can read
the movement of the planets.

651
00:45:32,583 --> 00:45:33,914
Reading your face is not big deal?

652
00:45:34,851 --> 00:45:37,115
Who is it? Who has
formatted your hard disk...

653
00:45:37,221 --> 00:45:39,212
...and put a virus in it.

654
00:45:42,192 --> 00:45:43,489
Sana!

655
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:44,754
And where is Sana?

656
00:45:44,828 --> 00:45:46,557
What is her address?
- I don't know?

657
00:45:46,997 --> 00:45:48,692
I mean... maybe she must
be around here somewhere?

658
00:45:48,765 --> 00:45:49,993
Maybe! What do you mean by maybe?

659
00:45:50,867 --> 00:45:52,494
Someone told me?
- Who?

660
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:56,100
A butterfly!

661
00:45:56,673 --> 00:45:57,731
Butterfly...

662
00:45:58,742 --> 00:46:00,835
You are in love,
baby! You are in love.

663
00:46:17,027 --> 00:46:20,121
'I feel that I have lost something! '

664
00:46:24,668 --> 00:46:29,264
'You know diary, Winky dinks says
that Karan had come to the station. '

665
00:46:30,607 --> 00:46:32,734
'Winky dinks is crazy. Isn't it? '

666
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:35,541
'But why doesn't my heart agree? '

667
00:46:36,713 --> 00:46:39,477
'It absolutely stupid...
like Winky dinks...

668
00:46:39,549 --> 00:46:41,642
...like Karan... like everyone. '

669
00:46:41,718 --> 00:46:42,776
'Everyone is crazy. '

670
00:46:44,488 --> 00:46:45,682
'Or am I the one that's gone crazy. '

671
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:47,982
'I am the one that's crazy. '

672
00:46:49,126 --> 00:46:51,617
'Lost the most
beautiful thing in the world. '

673
00:46:52,763 --> 00:46:54,128
'Lf you would have
been here with me. '

674
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,029
'You wouldn't have let this happen. '

675
00:46:58,502 --> 00:47:01,596
'Just once! I want to
see him just once more! '

676
00:47:02,005 --> 00:47:03,131
'Just once. '

677
00:47:04,007 --> 00:47:05,907
'Then I will never let
her go away from me. '

678
00:47:06,109 --> 00:47:09,567
'I will just ask,
Karan are you fine? '

679
00:47:09,646 --> 00:47:11,238
'Do you miss me?

680
00:47:11,815 --> 00:47:14,181
'Do you get sleep at
night? ' 'Do you feel hungry? '

681
00:47:15,852 --> 00:47:17,149
'Will you have a hotdog, Karan? '

682
00:47:18,522 --> 00:47:19,546
'I miss you. '

683
00:47:20,223 --> 00:47:21,520
Will you have some coffee?

684
00:47:21,558 --> 00:47:22,923
Okay, let me make you some coffee.

685
00:47:22,959 --> 00:47:26,861
You know, when I returned from
NASA, people thought I am insane.

686
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:28,192
Except for your dad.

687
00:47:28,265 --> 00:47:30,256
He was the only guy
who didn't laugh at me.

688
00:47:31,034 --> 00:47:32,092
Sugar!

689
00:47:33,003 --> 00:47:34,265
One teaspoon.
- Yeah, one.

690
00:47:34,705 --> 00:47:35,763
Okay.

691
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:37,966
You know, he
helped me with this lab.

692
00:47:38,041 --> 00:47:39,099
He helped me with this lab.

693
00:47:39,176 --> 00:47:41,474
Although he didn't
know what I was making.

694
00:47:44,648 --> 00:47:47,879
You really don't know
what you are making.

695
00:47:49,753 --> 00:47:50,913
Coffee, finally!

696
00:47:52,823 --> 00:47:54,586
Sometimes a man gets stuck.

697
00:47:54,624 --> 00:47:56,888
On the coffee?
- No!

698
00:47:57,561 --> 00:47:59,051
On the machine.
- Machine!

699
00:48:00,797 --> 00:48:03,493
For the past 15 years, I have
been working on a machine Karan.

700
00:48:05,001 --> 00:48:06,161
A time machine!

701
00:48:06,236 --> 00:48:07,498
A time machine!

702
00:48:08,805 --> 00:48:10,500
I know what you are thinking.

703
00:48:11,041 --> 00:48:12,508
A man who can't even
make two cups of coffee...

704
00:48:12,576 --> 00:48:14,601
...how can he ever
make a time machine.

705
00:48:14,678 --> 00:48:18,239
But a time machine can be made.
We can travel into the future.

706
00:48:18,682 --> 00:48:19,740
Are you serious uncle?

707
00:48:19,816 --> 00:48:21,113
I am so close Karan.

708
00:48:21,184 --> 00:48:22,242
I am this close.

709
00:48:22,786 --> 00:48:24,651
All I need is a little bit of luck.

710
00:48:25,522 --> 00:48:26,546
Luck!

711
00:48:26,757 --> 00:48:28,725
Good luck uncle, good luck.

712
00:48:30,827 --> 00:48:31,885
Love you. Love you.

713
00:48:32,529 --> 00:48:33,587
Good luck to you too.

714
00:48:34,698 --> 00:48:37,462
I don't need luck. I have love.

715
00:49:17,574 --> 00:49:19,235
'The rain is so romantic, isn't it? '

716
00:49:19,509 --> 00:49:20,567
'I love the rain. '

717
00:49:21,511 --> 00:49:23,741
'You know what the best
part of rain is? - What? '

718
00:49:23,814 --> 00:49:24,872
'Mud! '

719
00:49:24,948 --> 00:49:27,508
'When someone steps in the
puddle and gets splattered. '

720
00:50:46,596 --> 00:50:51,795
"We were miles apart."

721
00:50:52,035 --> 00:50:57,029
"The journey would take centuries."

722
00:50:57,541 --> 00:51:02,274
"The heart was unaware."

723
00:51:02,913 --> 00:51:13,187
"But I still felt... we
were destined to meet."

724
00:51:13,657 --> 00:51:18,287
"We were miles apart."

725
00:51:19,129 --> 00:51:23,964
"The journey would take centuries."

726
00:51:24,634 --> 00:51:29,571
"The heart was unaware."

727
00:51:29,906 --> 00:51:40,111
"But I still felt... we
were destined to meet."

728
00:51:40,717 --> 00:51:45,814
"We were miles apart."

729
00:52:06,977 --> 00:52:17,148
"My passion has brought me so far."

730
00:52:17,787 --> 00:52:28,095
"My dreams have come true."

731
00:52:28,732 --> 00:52:34,568
"Don't love me so much,
don't cherish me so much."

732
00:52:34,638 --> 00:52:39,234
"What if we separate tomorrow?"

733
00:52:39,609 --> 00:52:45,514
"Never... say that again."

734
00:52:45,582 --> 00:52:49,712
"Never go away from me again."

735
00:52:51,154 --> 00:52:56,114
"We were miles apart."

736
00:52:56,726 --> 00:53:01,857
"The journey would take centuries."

737
00:53:01,931 --> 00:53:06,994
"The heart was unaware."

738
00:53:07,637 --> 00:53:17,877
"But I still felt we
were destined to meet!"

739
00:53:18,281 --> 00:53:24,277
"We were miles apart!"

740
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,018
So friends.

741
00:53:34,564 --> 00:53:36,293
Mrs. Bedi, you are amazing.

742
00:53:36,566 --> 00:53:38,227
Always. Always. Always.

743
00:53:38,501 --> 00:53:39,729
Very good. Too much. Isn't it?

744
00:53:39,803 --> 00:53:40,861
What's the matter?

745
00:53:40,937 --> 00:53:42,700
You are slimming down these days.

746
00:53:43,106 --> 00:53:45,506
What can I do Mrs. Kapoor,
I am worried about my daughter...

747
00:53:45,575 --> 00:53:47,668
...I can't find a
suitable boy for him.

748
00:53:47,744 --> 00:53:48,802
Yes.

749
00:53:48,878 --> 00:53:50,004
But Mrs. Bhalla was saying that...

750
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:51,513
you have already
selected a boy for Sana.

751
00:53:51,581 --> 00:53:53,173
Mrs. Bhalla...

752
00:53:53,249 --> 00:53:55,012
She can select any stupid, fool.

753
00:53:57,153 --> 00:54:00,520
But don't you think, Sana
has become a bit too choosy.

754
00:54:00,724 --> 00:54:05,093
It's also possible, that Sana
doesn't have any interest in boys.

755
00:54:05,795 --> 00:54:06,853
Who knows what?

756
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:08,588
Oh God!

757
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:12,191
Mrs. Chaddha, what have you done?

758
00:54:12,268 --> 00:54:14,862
Oh God, please send a
boy that Sana will like.

759
00:54:14,938 --> 00:54:16,064
However, stout, short!

760
00:54:16,139 --> 00:54:18,767
Then If I ever ask for anything
ever again, then you can slap me.

761
00:54:30,053 --> 00:54:33,648
Lord, You are very fast and furious.

762
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:35,658
I made a request, you've
already sent me a boy.

763
00:54:35,759 --> 00:54:36,987
You are like me only.

764
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:38,220
Very good. Too much.

765
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,665
Where did the boy go?
- Karan, here.

766
00:54:46,236 --> 00:54:47,828
Whatever you say.
- It's more private.

767
00:54:48,238 --> 00:54:49,500
After you.

768
00:54:50,507 --> 00:54:53,237
So, you and me... what next?

769
00:54:58,982 --> 00:55:00,244
So cute.

770
00:55:01,117 --> 00:55:02,516
Karan, let go off my hand... this is
my neighbor's hotel...

771
00:55:02,585 --> 00:55:04,246
No one will see us.
- Sana.

772
00:55:04,754 --> 00:55:06,722
So fast and furious, Lord.

773
00:55:06,823 --> 00:55:07,915
Sana, I know what you are thinking?

774
00:55:08,024 --> 00:55:10,219
Karan, come closer.
Quench my thirst.

775
00:55:10,527 --> 00:55:11,858
Karan. Stop it! Stop it, Karan!

776
00:55:11,928 --> 00:55:13,520
Don't stop. Don't stop. Don't stop.

777
00:55:14,063 --> 00:55:15,121
Douse his craving.

778
00:55:15,198 --> 00:55:16,256
He is right.

779
00:55:16,533 --> 00:55:17,591
Mom. Mom.

780
00:55:17,667 --> 00:55:19,635
This is Karan. Karan
Malhotra from Sydney, age 23...

781
00:55:19,702 --> 00:55:22,193
...current status single
and sitting. - Standing.

782
00:55:22,272 --> 00:55:24,001
Sitting is fine, son.

783
00:55:24,574 --> 00:55:27,839
Black shirt and
brown hair... so cute.

784
00:55:28,545 --> 00:55:31,878
Dave! Two cappuccino...
on this table... in me.

785
00:55:31,948 --> 00:55:33,540
Mom! Not in me, on me.

786
00:55:33,616 --> 00:55:35,709
He will write it in my account,
so it will be in me.

787
00:55:36,052 --> 00:55:37,781
Karan, when are you coming home?

788
00:55:37,821 --> 00:55:39,516
Yeah Karan, come home for coffee.

789
00:55:39,722 --> 00:55:41,121
He is drinking coffee here already.

790
00:55:41,191 --> 00:55:42,488
Come home on dinner.

791
00:55:42,525 --> 00:55:44,152
Mom, not on dinner, for dinner.

792
00:55:44,227 --> 00:55:46,161
First in became on, and
now you change it to for.

793
00:55:46,229 --> 00:55:47,491
You don't know anything, shut up.

794
00:55:47,664 --> 00:55:50,224
Karan dear, what time
will you come, tell me?

795
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:51,758
Anytime you tell me, auntie!

796
00:55:51,968 --> 00:55:53,833
It's 6 o'clock!
Will you come at 6: 30?

797
00:55:53,903 --> 00:55:54,961
Mom, dad is not at home today.

798
00:55:55,038 --> 00:55:57,233
Unimportant detail...
yes, fine, okay.

799
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,073
Come on brunch tomorrow.

800
00:55:59,676 --> 00:56:01,576
Mom...
- Just a minute. Just a minute,

801
00:56:01,644 --> 00:56:02,770
I want to ask you
something important.

802
00:56:02,846 --> 00:56:05,508
Karan, I like you a lot...
I am all ready...

803
00:56:05,582 --> 00:56:08,710
...but if Sana's papa too sees you,
then it will be better. - Mom.

804
00:56:08,785 --> 00:56:10,844
Aunt, I will
surely come... I promise.

805
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,912
You are so sweet. Why won't
you be sweet... God has sent him.

806
00:56:15,058 --> 00:56:16,821
Okay. Okay.

807
00:56:17,126 --> 00:56:18,184
You enjoy.

808
00:56:18,761 --> 00:56:19,819
Cappuccino.

809
00:56:20,697 --> 00:56:22,028
You are sweet.

810
00:56:23,032 --> 00:56:24,090
My mom!

811
00:56:24,167 --> 00:56:25,532
She is very good, too much.

812
00:56:26,202 --> 00:56:31,265
God has sent him, I swear I
never saw such a handsome boy.

813
00:56:31,808 --> 00:56:33,537
If you ask me, I will get
all the rites and rituals...

814
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:35,544
...marriage and honeymoon...

815
00:56:35,612 --> 00:56:36,601
...all done tomorrow itself.

816
00:56:36,679 --> 00:56:37,737
So cute.

817
00:56:37,814 --> 00:56:39,975
Rahul, did you hear?

818
00:56:45,488 --> 00:56:46,512
He's come.

819
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:47,914
He's come.

820
00:56:47,991 --> 00:56:49,083
Switch off the X-Box, and
switch on the camera vision.

821
00:56:49,125 --> 00:56:50,183
Okay. Okay.

822
00:57:20,023 --> 00:57:22,150
God! Man, what's up?

823
00:57:29,132 --> 00:57:30,622
You are so pretty, I love you Sana.

824
00:57:30,867 --> 00:57:31,925
I am lucky seat.

825
00:57:32,268 --> 00:57:35,601
Karan! Son! You have arrived.
- Hello!

826
00:57:36,139 --> 00:57:37,902
What happened?
- Nothing, auntie.

827
00:57:38,141 --> 00:57:39,199
It's just water.

828
00:57:39,876 --> 00:57:42,572
Did it rain only on one leg?

829
00:57:42,712 --> 00:57:43,838
Come on. Come in.

830
00:57:44,013 --> 00:57:47,972
Tell me the truth, were you
feeling nervous while coming here?

831
00:57:48,084 --> 00:57:50,518
No auntie, how can I be scared
coming here when you are there.

832
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:51,814
How cute?

833
00:57:51,921 --> 00:57:53,115
Take a seat, son.

834
00:57:54,924 --> 00:57:55,982
There.

835
00:57:56,092 --> 00:57:58,026
Children say, that's the
lucky seat. Sit there.

836
00:57:59,162 --> 00:58:00,220
What happened?

837
00:58:02,031 --> 00:58:03,089
Take a seat aunt.

838
00:58:03,866 --> 00:58:05,493
He is polite too too.

839
00:58:05,902 --> 00:58:09,133
Sana, you sit here I
have to make the snacks too.

840
00:58:09,505 --> 00:58:10,563
What happened?

841
00:58:10,673 --> 00:58:12,072
Lucky seat, yeah rite.

842
00:58:12,709 --> 00:58:14,074
This is Rahul and Thia.

843
00:58:14,177 --> 00:58:16,805
Darling, where are you going?

844
00:58:16,913 --> 00:58:17,971
Karan, mom!

845
00:58:18,081 --> 00:58:19,139
Sana, Karan!

846
00:58:19,549 --> 00:58:20,607
Got you.

847
00:58:20,883 --> 00:58:22,942
Got you. Got you.

848
00:58:23,019 --> 00:58:24,611
Rahul! Thia! What are you doing?

849
00:58:24,721 --> 00:58:25,745
Give the camera to me.

850
00:58:26,022 --> 00:58:27,114
Say sorry to Karan bhaiyya.

851
00:58:27,824 --> 00:58:28,950
I should be the one saying sorry.

852
00:58:31,127 --> 00:58:32,185
I'll speak to them.

853
00:58:33,863 --> 00:58:34,921
I am sorry.

854
00:58:36,566 --> 00:58:39,194
I am sorry that I am taking
your sister Sana away from you.

855
00:58:39,869 --> 00:58:40,927
But what can I do?

856
00:58:41,037 --> 00:58:42,561
Your sister Sana is so adorable.

857
00:58:43,873 --> 00:58:45,670
And there is no one to love me.

858
00:58:46,142 --> 00:58:48,076
That's why God has sent
your sister Sana to me.

859
00:58:48,144 --> 00:58:49,202
So that she can
shower her love on me.

860
00:58:50,013 --> 00:58:51,844
Now, I cannot give
you anything in return.

861
00:58:52,548 --> 00:58:54,209
But, I can promise
you guys one thing.

862
00:58:54,817 --> 00:58:57,217
I will love you more
than your sister Sana.

863
00:58:58,021 --> 00:58:59,113
Deal!

864
00:58:59,989 --> 00:59:01,013
Deal!

865
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:02,182
Come on, deal!

866
00:59:02,525 --> 00:59:04,083
So Karan, what are your hobbies?

867
00:59:04,894 --> 00:59:05,952
I have a lot of hobbies uncle.

868
00:59:06,129 --> 00:59:10,225
Like X-treme sports, mountain
biking, tap dancing, hip-hop.

869
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:12,231
Don't you have a serious hobby?

870
00:59:12,935 --> 00:59:14,698
How can a hobby be serious?

871
00:59:16,839 --> 00:59:19,239
I mean, I do
everything seriously sir.

872
00:59:19,809 --> 00:59:22,903
In fact, I have won the FIFA
world cup three times, on the Xbox.

873
00:59:23,012 --> 00:59:24,070
Yes!

874
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:27,809
In Mortal Kombat, at every level I
have broken every fighter's bones.

875
00:59:27,917 --> 00:59:29,509
Do you have any
constructive hobby or

876
00:59:29,585 --> 00:59:31,246
...do you only
believe in breaking things?

877
00:59:32,555 --> 00:59:33,715
He has papa.

878
00:59:34,524 --> 00:59:36,014
Karan is a fine art critic.

879
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:38,218
And he loves poetry.

880
00:59:38,895 --> 00:59:40,089
And... he loves to read.

881
00:59:40,196 --> 00:59:41,254
What do you read?

882
00:59:41,697 --> 00:59:46,691
I... sir... Archie's, GQ, Playboy...

883
00:59:48,137 --> 00:59:49,900
Plays for boys. Plays for boys.

884
00:59:50,006 --> 00:59:51,735
Plays, papa. Like Shakespeare.

885
00:59:52,642 --> 00:59:54,041
Which is your favorite play?

886
00:59:55,144 --> 00:59:59,581
The one in which the hero
climbs the... the balcony...

887
01:00:01,584 --> 01:00:02,915
Polio and... Romeo and Juliet!

888
01:00:03,019 --> 01:00:04,077
Exactly!

889
01:00:04,187 --> 01:00:05,245
Sana's favorite play too.

890
01:00:05,588 --> 01:00:07,556
If you have finished asking
him about old and boring books...

891
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:08,750
...then can I match their horoscopes.

892
01:00:08,891 --> 01:00:10,984
Son, what is your
date of birth and time.

893
01:00:12,161 --> 01:00:14,026
13th November, 1984.

894
01:00:14,130 --> 01:00:17,122
8: 25 in the evening,
131 Baker Street...

895
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,100
Not the address, I don't
want to write a letter.

896
01:00:19,969 --> 01:00:22,199
I will send the
details to Bhatinda tomorrow.

897
01:00:22,605 --> 01:00:23,970
The priest will match
both the horoscopes.

898
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,098
By the way, aunt.

899
01:00:25,208 --> 01:00:26,675
My uncle sees horoscopes too. Yes.

900
01:00:26,776 --> 01:00:28,300
I mean, he is not a
professional astrologer.

901
01:00:28,644 --> 01:00:30,612
But astrology is his serious hobby.

902
01:00:30,713 --> 01:00:32,010
Very good, too much.

903
01:00:32,115 --> 01:00:33,810
My courier money is saved too.

904
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:35,247
Son, give me your uncle's address.

905
01:00:35,318 --> 01:00:37,752
Tell me.
- Mom, let Karan eat peacefully.

906
01:00:37,854 --> 01:00:38,912
I didn't stop him from eating?

907
01:00:39,021 --> 01:00:40,215
Tell me as you are eating.

908
01:00:46,062 --> 01:00:47,723
Very good, too much.

909
01:00:47,897 --> 01:00:50,730
Quickly place all the planets
in their houses and tell me...

910
01:00:51,701 --> 01:00:53,100
Relax Mrs. Bedi, please relax.

911
01:00:53,202 --> 01:00:55,170
If the constellations get mixed
up, everything will be ruined.

912
01:00:55,271 --> 01:00:57,899
Nothing should go wrong.

913
01:00:58,174 --> 01:00:59,835
It is the question of
the children's life.

914
01:01:00,042 --> 01:01:03,569
Oh, Saba. Saba.
- Wow!

915
01:01:13,556 --> 01:01:14,580
Karan!

916
01:01:16,058 --> 01:01:17,855
It's just a lab. Come.

917
01:01:29,972 --> 01:01:34,068
Khanna sir, you are a scientist
still you know all this. How?

918
01:01:34,177 --> 01:01:36,111
I know, and I believe in it too.

919
01:01:36,312 --> 01:01:38,507
The movement of the planet makes a
difference in the lives of human's.

920
01:01:38,881 --> 01:01:41,042
It contains the rewards for
the deeds. Reincarnation too.

921
01:01:41,951 --> 01:01:43,816
Oh God! Reinc...

922
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:49,719
That's why Khanna sir, whenever
I see high walls I feel giddy.

923
01:01:49,959 --> 01:01:51,517
How many times have I
thought... that in my...

924
01:01:51,594 --> 01:01:54,256
...past birth I must
surely been Anarkali.

925
01:01:55,898 --> 01:01:57,525
Yeah, of course. You
must have been Anarkali.

926
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:00,164
If you would have been Anarkali,
then I must have been Saleem.

927
01:02:02,205 --> 01:02:03,263
Oh!
- Wow!

928
01:02:06,809 --> 01:02:10,677
All that's fine, but,,
what's the big secret?

929
01:02:11,013 --> 01:02:12,071
Secret!

930
01:02:12,582 --> 01:02:15,551
There is a time machine here.

931
01:02:16,886 --> 01:02:17,944
What?

932
01:02:18,054 --> 01:02:19,078
Don't you know what
a time machine is?

933
01:02:19,555 --> 01:02:21,250
In which you can
travel through time.

934
01:02:21,691 --> 01:02:27,186
A time machine... using
which we can go into any era.

935
01:02:27,597 --> 01:02:28,791
We can go anywhere.

936
01:02:28,965 --> 01:02:30,865
In the past, in the future.

937
01:02:30,967 --> 01:02:32,628
I know that.

938
01:02:32,735 --> 01:02:34,293
But is it for real?
Of course it's real.

939
01:02:34,704 --> 01:02:36,797
Uncle Ya is the coolest
scientist in the world.

940
01:02:37,006 --> 01:02:40,237
15 years back he left NASA...
so that he can come here.

941
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:42,678
So that he can do
research on the time machine.

942
01:02:42,845 --> 01:02:43,903
He can construct it.

943
01:02:44,013 --> 01:02:45,503
There is nothing
interesting in my hand...

944
01:02:45,581 --> 01:02:47,014
...you are just staring at my face.

945
01:02:47,683 --> 01:02:51,050
Remember. Try to remember the
time, when you were Anarkali...

946
01:02:51,153 --> 01:02:53,815
And you were Saleem.
Forget it Khanna sir.

947
01:02:53,923 --> 01:02:55,015
I am too clever.

948
01:02:55,524 --> 01:02:58,891
Even if I was Anarkali... how
could you have recognized me now.

949
01:02:58,995 --> 01:03:01,623
Wouldn't my face look different now?

950
01:03:01,731 --> 01:03:02,823
No! No! No!

951
01:03:03,199 --> 01:03:05,531
Whenever a person
lives his life peacefully...

952
01:03:05,601 --> 01:03:09,628
...and dies, then in the next
birth he assumes a new form.

953
01:03:10,273 --> 01:03:13,970
But... if he dies
before time... like Anarkali.

954
01:03:14,944 --> 01:03:17,742
Then he assumes the same form
as he did in his last birth.

955
01:03:18,114 --> 01:03:19,843
Anarkali!

956
01:03:21,183 --> 01:03:22,707
You are scaring me.

957
01:03:22,885 --> 01:03:25,649
Karan! Will you show it to me once?

958
01:03:26,956 --> 01:03:27,980
What?

959
01:03:28,090 --> 01:03:29,148
Time machine Karan.

960
01:03:29,258 --> 01:03:30,555
No, no, no you can't be,, no.
- Please, please, please...

961
01:03:30,626 --> 01:03:33,117
...No, no way. - Please Karan,
I will do whatever you say.

962
01:03:34,563 --> 01:03:35,621
Anything I say.

963
01:03:36,232 --> 01:03:39,497
Open sesame. Stop!

964
01:03:40,002 --> 01:03:41,230
You cheat.

965
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:47,873
Oh my god, Karan! What will
uncle say if he sees this?

966
01:03:47,977 --> 01:03:49,638
Oh no. What have I done?

967
01:03:49,879 --> 01:03:51,540
Uncle won't remember anything.

968
01:03:52,715 --> 01:03:54,080
I remember.
- What?

969
01:03:55,584 --> 01:04:01,147
You are too sexy.

970
01:04:01,524 --> 01:04:02,923
Oh! This wasn't written here.

971
01:04:03,926 --> 01:04:05,621
I can't remember it.

972
01:04:05,895 --> 01:04:08,728
You are thinking as if
you used to tutor Einstein.

973
01:04:09,031 --> 01:04:10,089
Come on.

974
01:04:22,945 --> 01:04:26,073
What's the matter
astrologer cum scientist, you are...

975
01:04:26,148 --> 01:04:27,206
Is there any problem?

976
01:04:28,017 --> 01:04:29,177
No! Sana has a very nice horoscope.

977
01:04:29,285 --> 01:04:31,651
My child is so nice.

978
01:04:31,754 --> 01:04:33,654
Her constellations will be the best.

979
01:04:33,889 --> 01:04:35,254
Match the horoscope with Karan's.

980
01:04:36,158 --> 01:04:37,147
I will do it in a day or two.

981
01:04:37,226 --> 01:04:39,558
Shall I leave the horoscope here?
Yes, leave it back here.

982
01:04:39,895 --> 01:04:41,055
Leave Sana back here too.

983
01:04:41,664 --> 01:04:42,790
Karan will drop her.

984
01:04:42,898 --> 01:04:44,695
Goodbye, good luck.

985
01:04:45,835 --> 01:04:48,235
"He came to match the horoscope.
To get them married."

986
01:05:05,521 --> 01:05:08,115
I never tell lies. Trust me.

987
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:12,828
This machine really works, Sana.

988
01:05:36,185 --> 01:05:37,174
Oh my God!

989
01:05:42,892 --> 01:05:44,086
That is so unreal.

990
01:05:49,799 --> 01:05:50,857
Does it work.

991
01:05:50,966 --> 01:05:52,024
I don't know.

992
01:05:52,134 --> 01:05:53,965
Depends. On what?

993
01:05:58,140 --> 01:05:59,232
It does work?

994
01:06:00,709 --> 01:06:02,233
Welcome to the time machine.

995
01:06:02,511 --> 01:06:03,569
I am nervous.
- Don't be.

996
01:06:03,746 --> 01:06:06,943
After you sunshine.

997
01:06:10,052 --> 01:06:11,110
Wow!

998
01:06:11,153 --> 01:06:13,053
How does it start?

999
01:06:13,522 --> 01:06:14,546
Can you press that button?

1000
01:06:16,025 --> 01:06:17,117
Sorry.

1001
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:18,918
Start!

1002
01:06:20,663 --> 01:06:22,563
So sunshine, what time, what place?

1003
01:06:22,898 --> 01:06:24,695
Mumbai. Where I was born!

1004
01:06:24,967 --> 01:06:26,025
Mumbai! 1986!

1005
01:06:26,135 --> 01:06:27,193
Excellent choice.

1006
01:06:27,269 --> 01:06:29,965
Finally I will be
able to see you naked.

1007
01:06:30,072 --> 01:06:31,130
High... hopes!

1008
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:34,767
We have already seen the past.
Now we will see the future.

1009
01:06:35,044 --> 01:06:36,841
We will see whether the
world has changed or not?

1010
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:38,538
Type it!

1011
01:06:39,048 --> 01:06:44,714
M U M B A I! Mumbai!

1012
01:06:47,490 --> 01:06:48,514
What happened?

1013
01:06:49,859 --> 01:06:50,951
I am scared.

1014
01:06:51,494 --> 01:06:52,552
Trust me Sana.

1015
01:06:52,828 --> 01:06:53,886
Nothing will happen.

1016
01:06:53,996 --> 01:06:55,088
There is nothing to be scared of.

1017
01:06:55,531 --> 01:06:56,793
Mumbai, and the year.

1018
01:06:56,899 --> 01:06:57,991
Type the year.

1019
01:06:59,568 --> 01:07:03,698
20... I am feeling
very strange Karan.

1020
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:04,897
Give me your hand.

1021
01:07:05,508 --> 01:07:06,566
Close your eyes.

1022
01:07:06,876 --> 01:07:08,707
I promise. I won't do anything.

1023
01:07:10,546 --> 01:07:13,606
Type wherever you feel like.

1024
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:18,744
What did I type?

1025
01:07:19,855 --> 01:07:21,220
Mumbai 2050!

1026
01:07:24,126 --> 01:07:25,718
2050!
- Yes.

1027
01:07:26,529 --> 01:07:28,190
So want to go to Mumbai 2050.

1028
01:07:30,032 --> 01:07:32,967
Yeah! I guess.

1029
01:07:33,068 --> 01:07:34,126
Should I lock it?

1030
01:07:35,538 --> 01:07:36,732
Let's go to 2050.

1031
01:07:43,145 --> 01:07:45,670
Oh!

1032
01:07:46,515 --> 01:07:48,483
What's happening, Karan?

1033
01:07:48,584 --> 01:07:50,518
This actually works. It works!

1034
01:07:51,487 --> 01:07:53,478
What do you mean it works,
you said it works.

1035
01:07:53,923 --> 01:07:55,982
I just said it, for the kiss.

1036
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:59,218
Uncle Ya!

1037
01:07:59,595 --> 01:08:00,892
Have we reached the future?

1038
01:08:00,996 --> 01:08:02,122
Am I still handsome?

1039
01:08:02,531 --> 01:08:03,862
Welcome to the future, uncle?

1040
01:08:04,099 --> 01:08:05,589
Get out.

1041
01:08:07,036 --> 01:08:09,527
We are still in 2008.

1042
01:08:09,838 --> 01:08:11,100
No uncle. I don't know why
I gave you all the access codes...

1043
01:08:11,173 --> 01:08:12,606
...to the time machine.

1044
01:08:13,842 --> 01:08:14,900
Get out of my lab.

1045
01:08:15,044 --> 01:08:16,602
Uncle Ya, you should be happy.

1046
01:08:16,879 --> 01:08:18,813
The time machine worked,
you are a genius.

1047
01:08:18,914 --> 01:08:20,939
The time machine has not worked.

1048
01:08:21,550 --> 01:08:24,246
For the last time,
we are still in 2008.

1049
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:27,819
Uncle Ya, the light,
the smoke... the machine.

1050
01:08:27,957 --> 01:08:31,085
You have short circuited the machine,
that's why all the smoke here.

1051
01:08:31,193 --> 01:08:32,956
And the sound is of
the exhaust machine.

1052
01:08:33,529 --> 01:08:34,655
Get out or I will give you one.

1053
01:08:34,930 --> 01:08:35,988
Out!

1054
01:08:36,131 --> 01:08:40,033
Uncle. It's not Karan's fault,
it's entirely my fault.

1055
01:08:40,102 --> 01:08:43,560
I had asked him... I am really
sorry. I am sorry. - It is my fault.

1056
01:08:43,973 --> 01:08:45,565
I vented my anger on someone else.

1057
01:08:45,975 --> 01:08:48,569
What kind of anger?
- No. No. No.

1058
01:08:50,045 --> 01:08:52,104
Tell that fool, that I
am not angry with him.

1059
01:08:52,181 --> 01:08:54,911
And tell him, that I love him.

1060
01:09:00,489 --> 01:09:01,513
And I love you too.

1061
01:09:04,093 --> 01:09:06,118
Yeah. Yeah. That's the key.

1062
01:09:06,228 --> 01:09:08,560
You stick around, enjoy the lab.

1063
01:09:08,664 --> 01:09:11,792
No, no, no darling stick around,
enjoy the lab. I will send Karan.

1064
01:09:12,034 --> 01:09:14,935
Karan! Karan!

1065
01:09:15,004 --> 01:09:16,164
You write a diary too.

1066
01:09:16,238 --> 01:09:17,500
Sometimes.

1067
01:09:17,573 --> 01:09:18,631
What do you write in the diary?

1068
01:09:18,707 --> 01:09:21,005
No, that's personal.
- Personal.

1069
01:09:21,076 --> 01:09:22,907
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
- What?

1070
01:09:22,978 --> 01:09:24,570
Pull over.
- Why?

1071
01:09:24,647 --> 01:09:26,012
Pull over.
- What for?

1072
01:09:26,081 --> 01:09:27,139
I'll just tell you.

1073
01:09:27,916 --> 01:09:28,974
What?
- Ice cream.

1074
01:09:29,051 --> 01:09:30,109
Ice cream.

1075
01:09:30,152 --> 01:09:31,619
No way. No.

1076
01:09:31,654 --> 01:09:33,121
It's so cold, are you crazy?

1077
01:09:33,155 --> 01:09:35,623
Yes! I want ice cream right now.

1078
01:09:35,724 --> 01:09:37,123
Sana, you will fall sick!

1079
01:09:37,192 --> 01:09:38,250
I don't care.

1080
01:09:38,327 --> 01:09:39,851
I am eating ice cream, you want one?

1081
01:09:39,928 --> 01:09:41,919
No way, I don't want to fall sick?

1082
01:09:43,999 --> 01:09:45,694
Why are you laughing? What's funny?

1083
01:09:46,235 --> 01:09:48,601
You portray yourself
to be such a daredevil.

1084
01:09:48,804 --> 01:09:50,863
Living on the edge, and all.

1085
01:09:50,939 --> 01:09:52,099
And you are scared of an ice cream.

1086
01:09:54,243 --> 01:09:55,540
Yes, I am scared.

1087
01:09:56,679 --> 01:09:58,044
It was different before, Sana...

1088
01:09:59,248 --> 01:10:00,647
Now I am scared.

1089
01:10:01,183 --> 01:10:02,810
I want to take care of myself.

1090
01:10:06,155 --> 01:10:07,645
I want to live, Sana!

1091
01:10:07,690 --> 01:10:08,850
I want to have a long life.

1092
01:10:09,591 --> 01:10:12,151
I want to grow old
and die in your arms.

1093
01:10:13,228 --> 01:10:14,752
No, correction.

1094
01:10:15,564 --> 01:10:16,826
I don't want to die at all.

1095
01:10:18,133 --> 01:10:19,225
I want to live forever with you.

1096
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:27,072
That's by far the most romantic
thing you have ever said to me.

1097
01:10:28,610 --> 01:10:30,305
Are you going to kiss me?

1098
01:10:32,614 --> 01:10:33,672
Maybe.

1099
01:10:33,749 --> 01:10:36,240
But only after eating the
ice cream, with my cold lips.

1100
01:10:36,652 --> 01:10:37,846
My first cold kiss.

1101
01:10:37,953 --> 01:10:39,511
Well, Mr. Malhotra.

1102
01:10:39,555 --> 01:10:40,817
You just wait right here.

1103
01:10:41,123 --> 01:10:44,524
You are going to be
kissed very shortly.

1104
01:10:44,827 --> 01:10:46,590
With my cold lips.

1105
01:10:52,601 --> 01:10:53,659
Hi.
- Hi!

1106
01:10:53,736 --> 01:10:55,203
One strawberry ice cream please.
- Yes!

1107
01:10:55,871 --> 01:10:56,929
Karan!

1108
01:10:57,005 --> 01:10:58,939
Are you sure you
don't want ice cream.

1109
01:10:59,007 --> 01:11:00,065
No!

1110
01:11:00,142 --> 01:11:01,803
Just a kiss will be fine.

1111
01:11:01,877 --> 01:11:04,004
Sure! I won't share my ice cream.

1112
01:11:04,079 --> 01:11:05,944
We are going to
share our entire life.

1113
01:11:06,014 --> 01:11:07,538
Who cares about an ice cream?

1114
01:11:07,616 --> 01:11:08,674
Come on.

1115
01:11:12,588 --> 01:11:14,954
Come on. Waiting for my cold kiss.

1116
01:11:26,568 --> 01:11:28,900
Sana! Sana!

1117
01:11:28,971 --> 01:11:30,029
Sana! Sana!

1118
01:11:34,243 --> 01:11:35,301
What happened?

1119
01:11:35,577 --> 01:11:36,566
Oh god!

1120
01:11:36,645 --> 01:11:37,976
Sana. Oh no.

1121
01:11:38,046 --> 01:11:39,104
Is she alright? Can we help?

1122
01:11:39,181 --> 01:11:40,512
I will call the ambulance.
- Sana!

1123
01:11:40,582 --> 01:11:41,640
Nothing will happen to you Sana!

1124
01:11:41,717 --> 01:11:42,775
Nothing will happen to you.

1125
01:11:42,918 --> 01:11:44,613
Nothing will happen to you Sana!

1126
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:46,117
Ambulance is coming.

1127
01:11:46,155 --> 01:11:48,146
Nothing will happen.

1128
01:11:49,124 --> 01:11:50,785
Sana. Sana. Oh god!

1129
01:11:50,859 --> 01:11:53,123
Stop Karan.

1130
01:11:55,964 --> 01:11:57,022
Sana.

1131
01:11:58,033 --> 01:11:59,227
Nothing will happen to you, Sana.

1132
01:12:00,135 --> 01:12:01,625
Nothing will happen to you.

1133
01:12:01,937 --> 01:12:04,735
Nothing will happen to you.
Nothing will happen to you.

1134
01:12:04,807 --> 01:12:05,865
God, somebody help!

1135
01:12:05,941 --> 01:12:07,238
Somebody help!

1136
01:12:10,212 --> 01:12:12,976
I will take you to the hospital.

1137
01:12:14,616 --> 01:12:15,674
You will be fine!

1138
01:12:15,751 --> 01:12:17,184
Come on, for Christ sake!

1139
01:12:18,053 --> 01:12:19,680
Somebody... Sana!

1140
01:12:19,988 --> 01:12:22,855
Today, destiny and time
both have not favoured.

1141
01:12:22,958 --> 01:12:24,016
No.

1142
01:12:24,092 --> 01:12:27,255
No. Nothing will happen, Sana.

1143
01:12:27,863 --> 01:12:29,057
Stay with me, Sana!

1144
01:12:29,898 --> 01:12:31,024
I am sorry Karan.

1145
01:12:32,901 --> 01:12:35,165
I love you!

1146
01:12:35,237 --> 01:12:36,295
I love you, too!

1147
01:12:37,739 --> 01:12:41,175
I love you, Karan.

1148
01:12:42,010 --> 01:12:43,204
I love you, Sana!

1149
01:12:45,514 --> 01:12:46,572
I love you!

1150
01:12:53,155 --> 01:12:54,816
Stay with me, Sana!

1151
01:13:12,608 --> 01:13:14,075
Today I met a boy.

1152
01:13:14,610 --> 01:13:15,668
Karan.

1153
01:13:15,744 --> 01:13:17,041
He is fully mad.

1154
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:20,180
I am turning mad along with him.

1155
01:13:21,617 --> 01:13:23,744
Maybe this madness is called love.

1156
01:13:25,587 --> 01:13:28,579
Karan and Sana in
love forever and ever.

1157
01:13:41,503 --> 01:13:43,562
Karan! Karan, look at me.

1158
01:13:45,073 --> 01:13:46,131
Look at me. Look at me.

1159
01:13:47,609 --> 01:13:49,167
Look at me.

1160
01:13:50,145 --> 01:13:52,045
She's gone, Karan. She's gone.

1161
01:13:53,615 --> 01:13:55,048
Life is a cycle, Karan.

1162
01:13:56,752 --> 01:14:00,119
First it gives happiness, then
sorrows, then happiness again.

1163
01:14:02,224 --> 01:14:07,594
First comes the day
and then night, then...

1164
01:14:09,665 --> 01:14:11,257
My Sana is no more, uncle Ya.

1165
01:14:16,872 --> 01:14:18,237
Is it the truth?

1166
01:14:19,942 --> 01:14:21,739
My Sana is no more, uncle Ya.

1167
01:14:23,879 --> 01:14:25,642
My Sana is no more, uncle Ya.

1168
01:14:27,215 --> 01:14:28,910
My Sana is no more, uncle Ya.

1169
01:14:30,585 --> 01:14:32,177
She is no more with me.

1170
01:14:33,789 --> 01:14:35,256
I cannot see her anymore.

1171
01:14:36,258 --> 01:14:39,159
I cannot feel her. I cannot
even hear her voice, uncle Ya.

1172
01:14:40,595 --> 01:14:45,157
It is not fair, uncle Ya. It
is not fair. It is not fair.

1173
01:14:48,170 --> 01:14:50,661
I cannot live without her, uncle Ya.

1174
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:53,030
Return my Sana to me, uncle Ya.

1175
01:14:54,576 --> 01:14:57,909
I don't want anything else.

1176
01:14:59,214 --> 01:15:00,738
Do something. Do something.

1177
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:10,652
"Death or Life..."

1178
01:15:12,627 --> 01:15:18,930
"Whatever be the barrier."

1179
01:15:20,202 --> 01:15:25,265
"It doesn't wait."

1180
01:15:27,642 --> 01:15:33,205
"This kind of love."

1181
01:15:33,915 --> 01:15:41,117
"It will melt God's heart."

1182
01:15:41,523 --> 01:15:47,894
"How is our love story?"

1183
01:15:49,765 --> 01:15:56,000
"It's like a dream, our love story."

1184
01:16:04,513 --> 01:16:06,037
Ms. Chalk. Come on please.

1185
01:16:35,210 --> 01:16:36,973
Infinity!

1186
01:16:40,816 --> 01:16:43,478
You fool. You are a lousy fool.

1187
01:16:43,518 --> 01:16:45,884
You wasted 15 years.

1188
01:16:47,889 --> 01:16:49,857
Where is my chalk, Chalk?

1189
01:16:59,067 --> 01:17:04,505
I have got it. I have
got it. I have got it.

1190
01:17:09,811 --> 01:17:12,939
It works. It works.

1191
01:17:13,014 --> 01:17:14,504
I can't believe it yes it works.

1192
01:17:14,583 --> 01:17:15,914
It works Karan, it works.

1193
01:17:17,919 --> 01:17:20,820
My time machine works.

1194
01:17:20,922 --> 01:17:21,946
Good uncle Ya.

1195
01:17:22,557 --> 01:17:23,649
I am happy for you.

1196
01:17:23,725 --> 01:17:24,919
Brother Karan.

1197
01:17:24,993 --> 01:17:26,051
Brother Karan.

1198
01:17:27,796 --> 01:17:29,195
You don't look happy.

1199
01:17:29,598 --> 01:17:31,532
Look, I can't see you like this.

1200
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:35,531
If by bringing Sana back I
can put a smile to your face...

1201
01:17:35,604 --> 01:17:38,129
...then we will bring back Sana.

1202
01:17:39,808 --> 01:17:41,469
Bring back Sana.

1203
01:17:42,644 --> 01:17:44,544
From the past.

1204
01:17:45,547 --> 01:17:48,141
We just have to go 4
days back, that's it.

1205
01:17:48,216 --> 01:17:51,617
All you have to do is
avoid the accident, that's all.

1206
01:17:51,686 --> 01:17:53,017
Uncle Ya.
- Yes.

1207
01:17:55,790 --> 01:17:57,018
Is it possible, uncle Ya?

1208
01:17:57,592 --> 01:18:00,152
Can Sana... is it possible, uncle Ya.

1209
01:18:00,729 --> 01:18:02,492
Not until yesterday,
but it is possible now...

1210
01:18:02,564 --> 01:18:04,657
...thanks to the time machine!

1211
01:18:04,733 --> 01:18:05,927
Are you ready?

1212
01:18:06,635 --> 01:18:08,000
Come with me boy.

1213
01:18:12,073 --> 01:18:13,836
Oh no, this can't
happen to me now? No.

1214
01:18:15,110 --> 01:18:16,577
What happened, uncle Ya.
- It's hung.

1215
01:18:16,645 --> 01:18:17,703
The time code has been locked.

1216
01:18:17,779 --> 01:18:19,041
It's stuck in one place.

1217
01:18:19,514 --> 01:18:21,709
It's says Mumbai 2050. I
can do nothing to change it.

1218
01:18:23,518 --> 01:18:24,849
Mumbai 2050, uncle?

1219
01:18:25,954 --> 01:18:27,012
Yes!

1220
01:18:28,023 --> 01:18:29,752
Uncle, Sana wanted to go there.

1221
01:18:30,091 --> 01:18:32,855
That night when we came
inside the time machine.

1222
01:18:33,528 --> 01:18:35,052
She typed this with her own hands!

1223
01:18:36,531 --> 01:18:37,793
She typed this with her own hands!

1224
01:18:38,466 --> 01:18:39,524
Strange.

1225
01:18:39,935 --> 01:18:41,664
That means...
- She knew, uncle.

1226
01:18:42,470 --> 01:18:43,528
I can feel it uncle.

1227
01:18:44,072 --> 01:18:48,008
I don't know why but I can feel
that Sana is waiting for me, uncle.

1228
01:18:48,076 --> 01:18:49,475
She's waiting for me, uncle.

1229
01:18:49,544 --> 01:18:51,478
She is there! Trust me, uncle!

1230
01:18:51,546 --> 01:18:53,013
I can feel it uncle.

1231
01:18:53,081 --> 01:18:55,549
Just take me there!

1232
01:18:55,617 --> 01:18:57,482
No, no, no, no!
- Mumbai 2050!

1233
01:18:57,519 --> 01:18:58,679
Karan, it's easier
to go in the past...

1234
01:18:58,720 --> 01:18:59,982
...because we know what has occurred.

1235
01:19:00,088 --> 01:19:01,521
There is a risk in
going into the future.

1236
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:02,682
How will people... be?

1237
01:19:02,724 --> 01:19:04,692
Will we be able to come back?
You understand what I am saying?

1238
01:19:04,759 --> 01:19:05,885
I don't care uncle!

1239
01:19:07,495 --> 01:19:10,692
Just take me to her once! Please!

1240
01:19:11,032 --> 01:19:14,900
Anyway... anyway, there is
no one here who misses me.

1241
01:19:16,504 --> 01:19:17,903
That's right, who will miss you?

1242
01:19:19,507 --> 01:19:21,702
Actually the one who will
miss you... is coming with you!

1243
01:19:22,510 --> 01:19:23,568
I am coming with you!

1244
01:19:25,647 --> 01:19:27,706
2050, Mumbai here we go!

1245
01:19:27,782 --> 01:19:29,579
Come on, sit. Here we go!

1246
01:19:29,651 --> 01:19:30,709
In the box... in the box... c'mon!

1247
01:19:30,752 --> 01:19:33,516
Time is not linear, just like
there is a difference of 8...

1248
01:19:33,555 --> 01:19:36,524
...and half hours in New York...

1249
01:19:36,591 --> 01:19:39,526
...and in Bombay... you
know it's not like...

1250
01:19:39,594 --> 01:19:42,188
It's time travel, it's instant.

1251
01:19:42,597 --> 01:19:45,725
We will land in Mumbai at
6: 15 p. M. In the evening.

1252
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:46,926
It will be a Friday, okay?

1253
01:19:47,002 --> 01:19:49,527
23rd September, 2050!

1254
01:19:49,604 --> 01:19:51,936
We will get only 30
days in the future.

1255
01:19:52,007 --> 01:19:53,531
You got to do your job in 30 days.

1256
01:19:53,608 --> 01:19:56,543
Now, on 22nd October at
12 o'clock in the night...

1257
01:19:56,611 --> 01:19:58,738
...we will have to come back.

1258
01:19:59,881 --> 01:20:00,939
30 days?

1259
01:20:01,016 --> 01:20:02,074
30 days!

1260
01:20:02,150 --> 01:20:03,742
And what if I don't find
Sana in 30 days, then?

1261
01:20:03,785 --> 01:20:05,946
I am sorry Karan, the
machine is auto-locked.

1262
01:20:05,987 --> 01:20:09,047
30 days later, this machine
will return with or without us.

1263
01:20:10,558 --> 01:20:11,616
Good luck!

1264
01:20:11,693 --> 01:20:14,753
I don't need luck,
uncle, I have love.

1265
01:20:14,829 --> 01:20:16,558
Good luck boy!

1266
01:20:49,864 --> 01:20:52,594
We have reached! We have reached!

1267
01:20:54,869 --> 01:20:55,927
Okay!

1268
01:21:05,547 --> 01:21:07,071
Uncle Ya, looks like
we are in some ruins!

1269
01:21:07,148 --> 01:21:08,740
Are you sure we are in 2050?

1270
01:21:08,817 --> 01:21:09,875
I am checking! I am checking!

1271
01:21:10,552 --> 01:21:12,543
This board looks old... quite old.

1272
01:21:12,587 --> 01:21:20,084
This property is under dispute. By
order Mumbai High Court. September...

1273
01:21:23,098 --> 01:21:24,963
...2039... oh my God!

1274
01:21:25,166 --> 01:21:28,101
Uncle Ya, we are in the
future, check this out!

1275
01:21:28,169 --> 01:21:29,227
We are! We are!

1276
01:21:29,304 --> 01:21:32,102
We are in front of Marine Drive!

1277
01:21:32,173 --> 01:21:35,301
Mumbai 2050, we have made it!

1278
01:21:37,846 --> 01:21:38,904
That's right!

1279
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:40,845
We are in Walkeshwar,
in a run down property.

1280
01:21:40,915 --> 01:21:41,973
No one comes here anymore.

1281
01:21:42,851 --> 01:21:43,909
Rahul! Thia!

1282
01:21:43,952 --> 01:21:45,749
What were you doing in the machine?

1283
01:21:46,121 --> 01:21:48,555
Sorry!
- Sorry!

1284
01:21:48,623 --> 01:21:51,524
When we heard, that you
are going to meet Sana...

1285
01:21:51,593 --> 01:21:53,060
...we couldn't stop ourselves.

1286
01:21:53,128 --> 01:21:55,255
We want to meet Sana too!

1287
01:21:55,530 --> 01:21:56,588
We miss her.

1288
01:22:02,871 --> 01:22:05,066
Okay, okay, but you will
have to behave yourselves.

1289
01:22:07,675 --> 01:22:09,142
Thank you! - Thank you!

1290
01:22:30,098 --> 01:22:31,156
I am here, Sana!

1291
01:22:32,033 --> 01:22:33,295
I am here to take you back!

1292
01:22:44,078 --> 01:22:45,978
What happened,
Andy? I can't find it.

1293
01:22:46,947 --> 01:22:48,073
Come on Andy!

1294
01:22:48,148 --> 01:22:51,049
You don't know how important it
is to find them for Dr, Hoshi!

1295
01:22:51,752 --> 01:22:53,014
Some people must be aboard it!

1296
01:22:53,087 --> 01:22:54,577
Where are they? Find them?

1297
01:22:59,093 --> 01:23:01,084
Police! Are they looking for us?

1298
01:23:01,161 --> 01:23:03,721
We will have to hide! Yes, we
will have to hide. C'mon! Let's go.

1299
01:23:08,502 --> 01:23:09,526
Just find it!

1300
01:23:09,637 --> 01:23:12,105
Don't try! Just do or die!

1301
01:23:13,607 --> 01:23:14,699
Come on, quickly!

1302
01:23:15,876 --> 01:23:17,002
Come on, come on.

1303
01:23:17,077 --> 01:23:18,738
Close the door uncle!
- Close it.

1304
01:23:20,915 --> 01:23:22,849
Switch on the light!

1305
01:23:33,127 --> 01:23:34,185
Wow!

1306
01:23:43,871 --> 01:23:44,895
What is this uncle Ya?

1307
01:23:45,005 --> 01:23:46,870
I think it is a
robot recycling yard.

1308
01:23:46,907 --> 01:23:48,898
All the old and inactive
robots are kept here to be fixed.

1309
01:23:48,976 --> 01:23:50,876
Like a robot hospital, you know!

1310
01:23:52,479 --> 01:23:55,744
Look at this one.
She is quite pretty!

1311
01:23:55,816 --> 01:23:57,113
Help! Help! Karan!

1312
01:23:57,184 --> 01:24:00,711
Karan! Are you okay, Karan?
- Damn! Oh God!

1313
01:24:00,888 --> 01:24:03,186
Help! Help me please.

1314
01:24:03,557 --> 01:24:06,924
Help! Help! Help me Karan!

1315
01:24:06,994 --> 01:24:08,689
It's a humanoid robot.

1316
01:24:08,762 --> 01:24:11,162
The robot in which artificial
intelligence has been used.

1317
01:24:11,231 --> 01:24:13,927
Technically, this robot can feel.

1318
01:24:14,101 --> 01:24:15,591
Jesus Christ!

1319
01:24:15,669 --> 01:24:18,137
Uncle Ya, this
robot can help us too.

1320
01:24:18,505 --> 01:24:19,529
You think you can repair it?

1321
01:24:20,507 --> 01:24:21,531
Why not!

1322
01:24:21,742 --> 01:24:25,041
Great.
- Thank you Karan! Thank you Karan!

1323
01:24:25,112 --> 01:24:27,137
You are welcome! Thank you Karan!

1324
01:24:28,115 --> 01:24:29,173
Thank you...

1325
01:24:39,126 --> 01:24:42,186
Wake up princess!

1326
01:24:43,530 --> 01:24:45,862
Thank you! Thank you! What...

1327
01:24:46,066 --> 01:24:47,192
It is a very old model, uncle!

1328
01:24:47,468 --> 01:24:49,095
It's not old, it's a smart model.

1329
01:24:49,169 --> 01:24:50,466
I spoke the last sentence in Hindi...

1330
01:24:50,504 --> 01:24:51,698
...so she replied in Hindi!

1331
01:24:51,805 --> 01:24:54,672
If I would have asked in English,
how are you doing young lady!

1332
01:24:56,710 --> 01:24:58,803
I am fine, thank you!

1333
01:25:03,951 --> 01:25:05,612
Who are you exactly?

1334
01:25:05,753 --> 01:25:08,051
My ID is, Q. T!

1335
01:25:08,122 --> 01:25:09,714
Quintessential Terrestrial!

1336
01:25:09,790 --> 01:25:11,121
An artificial human being.

1337
01:25:11,191 --> 01:25:12,658
Artificial what...

1338
01:25:13,761 --> 01:25:16,559
No. No... I think Q. T is better.

1339
01:25:16,764 --> 01:25:19,494
A cute one... Q. T! Correct?
- Yeah.

1340
01:25:19,633 --> 01:25:22,830
You have given me a new life,
you are my new master.

1341
01:25:22,936 --> 01:25:25,097
Master! What is all this crap?

1342
01:25:25,706 --> 01:25:26,730
We are friends, Q. T!

1343
01:25:26,807 --> 01:25:31,767
You can call me buddy,
partner, dude... - Sec C!

1344
01:25:32,112 --> 01:25:33,739
Section C is right here!

1345
01:25:34,581 --> 01:25:36,515
Q. T's permanent memory chip!

1346
01:25:36,750 --> 01:25:38,877
Anything that's here,
can never be erased.

1347
01:25:39,119 --> 01:25:40,780
From today you are Sec C!

1348
01:25:41,789 --> 01:25:42,778
Sec C!

1349
01:25:42,856 --> 01:25:44,983
Specifications!
Quintessential Terrestrial!

1350
01:25:47,861 --> 01:25:49,453
Weight 52 kilos!

1351
01:25:49,530 --> 01:25:51,657
Control unit, wireless transmission!

1352
01:25:51,732 --> 01:25:53,666
The three standard laws of robots.

1353
01:25:53,734 --> 01:25:55,565
We don't harm humans!

1354
01:25:55,636 --> 01:25:56,796
We love humans!

1355
01:25:57,471 --> 01:25:58,699
We serve humans!

1356
01:25:58,772 --> 01:25:59,966
And we love kids too.

1357
01:26:04,545 --> 01:26:07,480
Sorry Sec C, I can't find your ID!

1358
01:26:07,548 --> 01:26:08,981
Have you come from another world!

1359
01:26:09,083 --> 01:26:12,610
Not from a different world Q. T,
but from a different time.

1360
01:26:13,754 --> 01:26:16,552
But we don't know anything
about this time, or place.

1361
01:26:17,758 --> 01:26:21,489
We have come from the year 2008,
to search for someone.

1362
01:26:27,768 --> 01:26:30,794
The police can arrest you
anytime for having no ID.

1363
01:26:30,904 --> 01:26:32,838
You cannot stay here
for long, like this.

1364
01:26:41,115 --> 01:26:42,173
Q. T, what's that?

1365
01:26:42,516 --> 01:26:45,610
The City Centre, this is
where all the youngsters hangout!

1366
01:26:45,853 --> 01:26:47,844
Wow! Let's go Q. T, please!

1367
01:26:47,921 --> 01:26:48,979
Then, where are we going Q. T?

1368
01:26:49,790 --> 01:26:50,848
Home.

1369
01:26:50,924 --> 01:26:51,982
Home!

1370
01:26:59,466 --> 01:27:00,524
Whose house is this Q. T?

1371
01:27:00,934 --> 01:27:04,165
Dr. Kolatkar! We are
absolutely safe here!

1372
01:27:04,505 --> 01:27:07,668
I have the access codes
to all the areas here.

1373
01:27:07,708 --> 01:27:09,903
After all, I was born here.

1374
01:27:11,078 --> 01:27:13,478
I love this place.

1375
01:27:15,616 --> 01:27:16,674
Look at it.

1376
01:27:17,751 --> 01:27:18,809
Welcome. Greetings.

1377
01:27:18,886 --> 01:27:19,944
I am Kanta!

1378
01:27:20,020 --> 01:27:21,544
I'm the housemaid of this house.

1379
01:27:22,089 --> 01:27:24,023
You have come to our
house for the first time.

1380
01:27:24,091 --> 01:27:26,491
If you need anything,
then just say Kanta...

1381
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:28,050
...and I will come instantly!

1382
01:27:30,764 --> 01:27:31,822
Kanta!

1383
01:27:32,166 --> 01:27:34,760
Yeah?
- Nothing Kanta, you leave!

1384
01:27:35,502 --> 01:27:36,526
Kanta.

1385
01:27:36,737 --> 01:27:38,534
Kanta, you can go!
- Ok.

1386
01:27:39,139 --> 01:27:40,197
Kanta!

1387
01:27:40,908 --> 01:27:41,932
Sorry Kanta!

1388
01:27:42,142 --> 01:27:43,166
Will you guys stop it?

1389
01:27:43,443 --> 01:27:45,001
No one is going to say Kanta! Kanta!

1390
01:27:47,047 --> 01:27:48,674
I am sorry Kanta, that... it's okay.

1391
01:27:49,783 --> 01:27:52,650
Q. T, I am seeing you
after such a long time.

1392
01:27:53,453 --> 01:27:55,785
Dr. Kolatkar would have
been so happy to see you!

1393
01:27:56,456 --> 01:27:58,947
Right now, he has gone to
Tokyo along with his family...

1394
01:28:05,065 --> 01:28:06,123
What happened?

1395
01:28:06,466 --> 01:28:07,524
What happened?

1396
01:28:07,868 --> 01:28:11,599
If Kanta informs Dr.
Kolatkar that I am here...

1397
01:28:11,705 --> 01:28:14,970
...then he'll activate the sound
alert and all of us will be caught.

1398
01:28:15,475 --> 01:28:18,501
So I've removed the
problem from the roots.

1399
01:28:19,079 --> 01:28:20,137
What?

1400
01:28:20,614 --> 01:28:21,911
This is a first generation robot.

1401
01:28:23,016 --> 01:28:25,177
It's good that you
have Australian dollars!

1402
01:28:25,485 --> 01:28:27,476
Now they are collector's items!

1403
01:28:27,554 --> 01:28:29,647
You're rich. Let's go down now.

1404
01:28:42,102 --> 01:28:43,831
Fake ID activated!

1405
01:28:46,540 --> 01:28:48,440
Fake ID activated!

1406
01:28:49,710 --> 01:28:53,703
Fake ID activated!

1407
01:28:53,780 --> 01:28:55,645
Now there is a ID chip
in everyone's wrist!

1408
01:28:55,716 --> 01:28:57,513
You will be fortunate if
this works even for a month!

1409
01:28:57,718 --> 01:28:59,015
No bill, no guarantee!

1410
01:28:59,453 --> 01:29:00,511
Yeah.

1411
01:29:24,611 --> 01:29:27,512
Tell me Sec C!

1412
01:29:27,714 --> 01:29:28,908
What are you thinking?

1413
01:29:30,083 --> 01:29:31,846
We don't have much time Q. T!

1414
01:29:33,487 --> 01:29:34,613
I have to look for Sana!

1415
01:29:35,622 --> 01:29:36,680
Sana?!

1416
01:29:37,557 --> 01:29:42,517
Sana, the one who has left
her memories in my Section C!

1417
01:29:44,831 --> 01:29:45,889
And has come here

1418
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:58,140
2050 is so beautiful, I feel
like embracing every passerby!

1419
01:29:58,912 --> 01:30:00,004
Hey! Watch out!

1420
01:30:01,515 --> 01:30:04,450
Uncle Ya, this is not
Australia. It's Mumbai!

1421
01:30:05,519 --> 01:30:08,010
Honeymoon packages,
starting at 17 million IN R!

1422
01:30:08,088 --> 01:30:10,079
Now have your honeymoon on the moon.

1423
01:30:10,157 --> 01:30:13,615
Tour the moon, spend
your holidays on the moon.

1424
01:30:13,794 --> 01:30:14,920
See you on the moon.

1425
01:30:16,063 --> 01:30:17,690
A beauty of a car.

1426
01:30:19,933 --> 01:30:21,992
But its strength lies in its style.

1427
01:30:28,075 --> 01:30:29,099
Ceat tires!

1428
01:30:33,146 --> 01:30:35,546
Celebrating 100 years of Ceat Tires.

1429
01:30:36,750 --> 01:30:38,547
Are you eating it
yourself or giving others?

1430
01:30:38,618 --> 01:30:39,676
Give it to madam.

1431
01:30:39,886 --> 01:30:40,944
Which one do you want ma'am?

1432
01:30:41,021 --> 01:30:42,215
Kolkata, or Benarsi!

1433
01:30:42,489 --> 01:30:44,423
And you? Chhotu, give
them their betel-leaf!

1434
01:30:53,433 --> 01:30:56,459
Tip!
- Forget it!

1435
01:31:10,017 --> 01:31:13,043
What kind of a snake is this?
- It's a robot! - Robot?!

1436
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:14,747
Seems like there are no more
real snakes left in the world.

1437
01:31:20,727 --> 01:31:22,991
So Sec C, how did
you find our world?

1438
01:31:24,531 --> 01:31:25,589
It's the same world, Q. T!

1439
01:31:26,733 --> 01:31:27,825
Only the time has changed.

1440
01:31:39,146 --> 01:31:40,477
I had told you!

1441
01:31:40,547 --> 01:31:43,414
In such a big city,
amongst so many people...

1442
01:31:43,483 --> 01:31:46,475
...it is impossible to
search for one girl!

1443
01:32:01,568 --> 01:32:02,626
Sana!

1444
01:32:06,873 --> 01:32:08,636
That's Zeisha!

1445
01:32:09,843 --> 01:32:11,105
That's Sana, Q. T!

1446
01:32:12,446 --> 01:32:13,504
That's my Sana!

1447
01:32:17,050 --> 01:32:18,517
I have come here for her!

1448
01:32:19,853 --> 01:32:24,085
That's Zeisha! Pop star,
rock star, superstar Zeisha!

1449
01:32:24,157 --> 01:32:26,557
The world's most famous singer.

1450
01:32:27,060 --> 01:32:28,118
Zeisha!

1451
01:32:30,464 --> 01:32:31,522
That's my Sana, Q. T!

1452
01:32:32,065 --> 01:32:33,464
Where can I find her, Q. T?

1453
01:32:34,734 --> 01:32:35,792
In the sky.

1454
01:32:36,470 --> 01:32:37,494
In the sky?

1455
01:33:36,796 --> 01:33:40,789
"Hey you, lover boy!"

1456
01:33:41,535 --> 01:33:45,471
"Will you be my toy?"

1457
01:33:45,705 --> 01:33:49,732
"Hey you, lover boy!"

1458
01:33:49,876 --> 01:33:54,108
"Will you be my toy?"
- I've to get there now.

1459
01:33:54,181 --> 01:33:55,671
"Hey you, lover boy!"

1460
01:33:56,483 --> 01:33:58,144
"Will you be my toy?"

1461
01:33:58,752 --> 01:34:00,219
"Hey you, lover boy!"

1462
01:34:00,887 --> 01:34:02,718
"Will you be my toy?"

1463
01:34:03,156 --> 01:34:05,522
"Hey you, lover boy!"

1464
01:34:05,625 --> 01:34:07,752
"Will you be my toy?"

1465
01:34:07,827 --> 01:34:09,920
Drive faster.

1466
01:34:09,996 --> 01:34:12,487
"Will you be my toy?"

1467
01:34:12,766 --> 01:34:17,100
"I play with toys
and then shatter them!"

1468
01:34:17,137 --> 01:34:21,506
"I can accept you and
then choose to leave you!"

1469
01:34:21,608 --> 01:34:25,669
"I play with toys
and then shatter them."

1470
01:34:26,112 --> 01:34:29,878
"I can accept you and
then choose to leave you!"

1471
01:34:30,083 --> 01:34:34,042
"Hey you, lover boy!"

1472
01:34:34,187 --> 01:34:38,521
"Will you be my toy?"

1473
01:35:06,086 --> 01:35:10,182
"It's a new evening,
it's a new night!"

1474
01:35:10,757 --> 01:35:14,158
"Let something new happen!"

1475
01:35:14,227 --> 01:35:16,491
"Life is now!"

1476
01:35:16,563 --> 01:35:18,690
"This is life!"

1477
01:35:18,765 --> 01:35:23,532
"Without it, life is meaningless."

1478
01:35:23,737 --> 01:35:27,935
"Dance away, live
life to your fullest!"

1479
01:35:28,108 --> 01:35:31,839
"What will you get
by being sorrowful?"

1480
01:35:31,911 --> 01:35:35,540
"Hey you, lover boy!
Will you be my toy?"

1481
01:35:36,516 --> 01:35:38,541
"Hey you, lover boy!"

1482
01:35:38,652 --> 01:35:40,916
"Will you be my toy?"

1483
01:35:41,521 --> 01:35:45,685
"I play with toys
and then shatter them!"

1484
01:35:45,792 --> 01:35:49,888
"I can accept and leave you!"

1485
01:35:50,063 --> 01:35:54,124
"I play with toys
and then shatter them!"

1486
01:35:54,734 --> 01:35:58,067
"I can accept and leave you!"

1487
01:35:58,104 --> 01:35:59,662
"Hey you, lover boy!"

1488
01:36:00,507 --> 01:36:02,475
"Will you be my toy?"

1489
01:36:02,876 --> 01:36:05,071
"Hey you, lover boy!"

1490
01:36:05,145 --> 01:36:07,545
"Will you be my toy?"

1491
01:36:07,614 --> 01:36:11,516
"Hey you, lover boy!"

1492
01:36:11,885 --> 01:36:15,844
"Will you be my toy?"

1493
01:36:31,104 --> 01:36:32,503
Q. T, we don't have much time!

1494
01:36:37,510 --> 01:36:42,038
"Hey you!"

1495
01:36:46,119 --> 01:36:49,179
Zeisha!

1496
01:36:49,456 --> 01:36:53,449
Zeisha!

1497
01:36:53,526 --> 01:36:58,463
Zeisha!

1498
01:37:00,734 --> 01:37:08,163
Okay!
- Q. T!

1499
01:37:18,551 --> 01:37:20,883
Hey Zeisha, are you coming tonight!

1500
01:37:20,954 --> 01:37:22,012
Yeah, I am coming!

1501
01:37:24,758 --> 01:37:26,157
Now I will have to go.

1502
01:37:39,139 --> 01:37:40,197
Hi!

1503
01:37:42,709 --> 01:37:43,767
Hi!

1504
01:37:46,579 --> 01:37:47,637
Sana!

1505
01:38:12,705 --> 01:38:15,071
No, please step back! I said, no.

1506
01:38:19,946 --> 01:38:22,540
Oh God! We will have to go
to the rehearsal! C'mon!

1507
01:38:22,615 --> 01:38:24,173
Excuse me, thank you.

1508
01:38:38,498 --> 01:38:42,127
Sana, I have come to
steal some fate from time.

1509
01:38:43,670 --> 01:38:44,864
I will take you along with me!

1510
01:38:47,073 --> 01:38:48,563
System overloaded.

1511
01:38:49,075 --> 01:38:53,478
Boo stop eating power!

1512
01:38:57,450 --> 01:38:59,714
So what?
- I work so hard too!

1513
01:39:00,453 --> 01:39:01,715
Zeebelle doesn't tell me anything!

1514
01:39:03,690 --> 01:39:04,918
Activate the mirrors please!

1515
01:39:07,460 --> 01:39:08,518
Boo!

1516
01:39:09,062 --> 01:39:10,120
Boo!

1517
01:39:10,196 --> 01:39:11,458
Coming Zeebelle?

1518
01:39:11,731 --> 01:39:14,529
Bring my blue-T, Boo! So late!

1519
01:39:14,734 --> 01:39:15,894
What Zebelle?

1520
01:39:16,503 --> 01:39:18,801
Blue T! Blue T!

1521
01:39:18,872 --> 01:39:20,464
Where is the Blue T?

1522
01:39:20,507 --> 01:39:22,532
What would you like today? Touch!

1523
01:39:23,476 --> 01:39:25,137
Blue T! Touch!

1524
01:39:26,546 --> 01:39:28,480
There is the blue T, out.

1525
01:39:28,548 --> 01:39:30,209
Have a good day!

1526
01:39:33,486 --> 01:39:34,714
I tore it!

1527
01:39:35,488 --> 01:39:36,614
Now what should I do?
- That's it!

1528
01:39:37,056 --> 01:39:39,786
If you don't get me my top by
the count of 3! You have had it!

1529
01:39:39,859 --> 01:39:40,917
Okay!

1530
01:39:42,662 --> 01:39:44,562
I hid it!
- Zebelle!

1531
01:39:45,698 --> 01:39:50,465
1... 2... 3...
- Snip it Boo, bring me my top!

1532
01:39:50,570 --> 01:39:51,628
It got torn!

1533
01:39:52,071 --> 01:39:53,538
How?

1534
01:39:53,740 --> 01:39:54,832
Turn around! Turn around!

1535
01:39:54,874 --> 01:39:55,932
Turn around!
- No!

1536
01:39:56,009 --> 01:39:57,567
I don't want to be kicked!

1537
01:39:57,644 --> 01:39:59,578
C'mon! - One kick for three mistake
s! That was the deal.

1538
01:39:59,779 --> 01:40:01,508
I have made only one mistake.

1539
01:40:01,581 --> 01:40:03,014
Oh yeah!
- Just one mistake!

1540
01:40:03,449 --> 01:40:05,679
Mistake number 1, you tore my T!

1541
01:40:05,752 --> 01:40:07,811
Boo, Now I will be kicked.

1542
01:40:07,887 --> 01:40:10,048
Mistake number 2,
you have delayed me!

1543
01:40:10,123 --> 01:40:11,181
Flee...
- Mistake number 3...

1544
01:40:11,257 --> 01:40:13,191
...by talking about that
stupid Ricky Martin you have...

1545
01:40:15,061 --> 01:40:16,119
Boo!

1546
01:40:16,629 --> 01:40:17,687
Boo!

1547
01:40:17,830 --> 01:40:19,491
Dirty! Boo's dirty!

1548
01:40:19,566 --> 01:40:21,466
I will be kicked.

1549
01:40:22,101 --> 01:40:23,659
Boo, you have so had it from me.

1550
01:40:24,203 --> 01:40:32,668
Aww! My bummy hurts!

1551
01:40:34,047 --> 01:40:36,015
You are the
naughtiest robot in the world.

1552
01:40:37,150 --> 01:40:40,881
Shell House, the most
beautiful house in the city!

1553
01:40:44,490 --> 01:40:45,548
They are so pretty, Boo!

1554
01:40:46,859 --> 01:40:47,917
It's so strange!

1555
01:40:48,695 --> 01:40:50,595
These Shell houses
are here everyday.

1556
01:40:51,164 --> 01:40:56,568
Yeah. - But it seems like I am
seeing it for the first time today!

1557
01:41:55,695 --> 01:41:57,424
This Dr. Hoshi is quite a dude.

1558
01:41:59,532 --> 01:42:00,624
And so are you!

1559
01:42:00,700 --> 01:42:03,726
And so are you, my boy!

1560
01:42:03,770 --> 01:42:04,862
You want to eat something?

1561
01:42:04,937 --> 01:42:07,030
Yeah. Q. T! Q. T darling!

1562
01:42:07,073 --> 01:42:08,131
Some chow-chow!

1563
01:42:08,741 --> 01:42:09,867
Chow-chow!

1564
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:11,438
Chow-chow? Uncle...

1565
01:42:11,611 --> 01:42:13,442
Q. T, who is this Dr. Hoshi?

1566
01:42:13,713 --> 01:42:15,647
Dr. Hoshi is a powerful scientist!

1567
01:42:16,049 --> 01:42:17,448
He is so powerful, even
the government doesn't...

1568
01:42:17,517 --> 01:42:19,985
...dare to ask him questions!

1569
01:42:20,453 --> 01:42:22,045
He has many powers

1570
01:42:23,456 --> 01:42:25,117
Some nachos?
- Sure, nachos!

1571
01:42:25,858 --> 01:42:28,053
I have heard that he
can teleport himself!

1572
01:42:28,127 --> 01:42:30,459
Using his mind power, he
can go anywhere he desires!

1573
01:42:30,963 --> 01:42:32,453
Everyone is very scared of him!

1574
01:43:00,827 --> 01:43:02,226
Hoshi rules!

1575
01:43:04,731 --> 01:43:05,891
13 years!

1576
01:43:06,132 --> 01:43:08,498
For the past 13 years,
everyday... every moment...

1577
01:43:08,568 --> 01:43:11,036
...Hoshi has dreamt
of only one thing!

1578
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:12,230
Just one!

1579
01:43:15,608 --> 01:43:18,577
And today, it's going to come true!

1580
01:43:18,778 --> 01:43:21,246
The time machine is here!

1581
01:43:22,749 --> 01:43:26,947
Dr. Khanna, who constructed
the time machine in 2008!

1582
01:43:27,153 --> 01:43:28,518
Who eventually, in
the the last 30 years...

1583
01:43:28,588 --> 01:43:30,988
...became the biggest
scientist in the world!

1584
01:43:31,691 --> 01:43:33,124
He had an assistant in his lab!

1585
01:43:33,192 --> 01:43:35,854
Dr. Ya trusted him a lot.

1586
01:43:36,262 --> 01:43:38,253
Horain Shimantho!

1587
01:43:39,098 --> 01:43:40,531
Alas if only his trust of 7 years...

1588
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:43,694
...could have lasted
for 10 more minutes.

1589
01:43:43,770 --> 01:43:47,763
But, on the night
of 27th July, 2037!

1590
01:43:47,874 --> 01:43:51,207
Dr. Ya arrived 10 minutes earlier!

1591
01:43:52,745 --> 01:43:56,806
Dr. Ya lost his life,
and Hoshi lost his dream.

1592
01:43:58,084 --> 01:44:01,576
While dying, Dr. Khanna
destroyed the entire lab.

1593
01:44:01,721 --> 01:44:04,690
So sad, and so stupid!

1594
01:44:04,757 --> 01:44:08,056
If Hoshi would have
acquired the time machine.

1595
01:44:08,161 --> 01:44:09,492
He would have used it so deviously...

1596
01:44:09,562 --> 01:44:13,589
...that the world would
have fallen at his feet.

1597
01:44:13,699 --> 01:44:15,724
But, he will still make
the world fall at his feet.

1598
01:44:15,835 --> 01:44:18,599
And we will begin
with these two faces.

1599
01:44:18,905 --> 01:44:21,897
Take a close look! Find this face!

1600
01:44:22,008 --> 01:44:23,908
Go, Find him!

1601
01:44:26,913 --> 01:44:29,108
Cheer up Karan, buy some clothes!

1602
01:44:29,515 --> 01:44:31,745
Get ready to meet Zeisha!

1603
01:44:36,689 --> 01:44:39,123
Look, you can buy from Lawman.

1604
01:44:39,192 --> 01:44:42,787
Welcome to Lawman shopping.

1605
01:44:43,095 --> 01:44:44,722
You're in the image loading area.

1606
01:44:44,964 --> 01:44:46,522
Okay.
- Stand straight!

1607
01:44:47,466 --> 01:44:48,524
Thank you!

1608
01:44:48,601 --> 01:44:50,660
Welcome, your shopping starts now!

1609
01:44:51,103 --> 01:44:52,968
Rock star, Pret,
Haute couture, Gothic!

1610
01:44:53,072 --> 01:44:54,096
Haute couture!

1611
01:44:54,173 --> 01:44:55,663
Right, loading site!

1612
01:44:57,877 --> 01:44:59,003
Jackets!

1613
01:44:59,078 --> 01:45:00,136
Jackets, it is.

1614
01:45:02,048 --> 01:45:03,106
Number 7!

1615
01:45:03,182 --> 01:45:05,480
Number 7 loaded, colour!

1616
01:45:05,551 --> 01:45:06,609
Black!

1617
01:45:06,953 --> 01:45:08,545
Try something else.

1618
01:45:09,555 --> 01:45:12,115
No. Fine, different style!

1619
01:45:14,160 --> 01:45:15,218
No.

1620
01:45:17,897 --> 01:45:19,558
Yeah!
- You like it?

1621
01:45:19,832 --> 01:45:20,958
Okay, I will take this silver one!

1622
01:45:21,033 --> 01:45:22,091
Loaded sir!

1623
01:45:22,168 --> 01:45:24,728
Thank you for shopping in Lawman.
- Ok.

1624
01:45:55,668 --> 01:45:58,796
Zeisha's next public
appearance is on Thursday, Q. T!

1625
01:46:00,506 --> 01:46:03,600
She will perform a show
with her selected fans.

1626
01:46:03,943 --> 01:46:05,911
I will be able to take you there!

1627
01:46:05,978 --> 01:46:07,536
You will be able to see her too.

1628
01:46:07,613 --> 01:46:09,945
But talking to her
will be difficult!

1629
01:46:12,551 --> 01:46:13,813
Love is never easy, Q. T!

1630
01:46:22,595 --> 01:46:25,655
Ira presents, Zeisha's challenge.

1631
01:46:25,831 --> 01:46:28,629
The show you wait for every week.

1632
01:46:32,705 --> 01:46:36,835
Who knows her the most!

1633
01:46:49,989 --> 01:46:51,786
Sana! Sana!

1634
01:46:52,124 --> 01:46:56,618
Relax guys! Thank you. Hi!

1635
01:46:56,929 --> 01:46:57,987
Who's going to be on
the hot seat today?

1636
01:46:58,831 --> 01:47:03,791
Who will come on the hot seat today!

1637
01:47:04,870 --> 01:47:05,894
Good evening people!

1638
01:47:05,972 --> 01:47:07,667
Welcome to Zeisha's challenge show...

1639
01:47:07,773 --> 01:47:10,867
...and today, I will challenge... you!

1640
01:47:11,077 --> 01:47:12,135
So let's see.

1641
01:47:12,545 --> 01:47:15,105
How well do you
really know your Zeebelle!

1642
01:47:15,548 --> 01:47:16,640
Are you ready!

1643
01:47:18,017 --> 01:47:19,075
Let's start!

1644
01:47:22,888 --> 01:47:24,719
Thank you! Thank you!

1645
01:47:24,991 --> 01:47:27,824
Al right! So let's see,
who will I question today?

1646
01:47:27,893 --> 01:47:29,861
Me! Me! Me!

1647
01:47:30,963 --> 01:47:33,022
Go for it! Go for it, Sec C!

1648
01:47:33,499 --> 01:47:36,832
Who knows Zeisha better!

1649
01:47:37,837 --> 01:47:38,895
You!

1650
01:47:38,938 --> 01:47:39,996
Hi Zeisha, I am bugs.

1651
01:47:40,106 --> 01:47:41,130
Your question!

1652
01:47:41,207 --> 01:47:43,505
Which is Zeisha's favorite color?

1653
01:47:43,609 --> 01:47:44,667
Favorite color!

1654
01:47:44,844 --> 01:47:45,902
Silver!

1655
01:47:46,512 --> 01:47:48,503
Poor bugs, you are squashed!

1656
01:47:48,581 --> 01:47:51,744
Zeisha's favorite color is black,
that was so last season!

1657
01:47:51,817 --> 01:47:53,444
Yeah!

1658
01:47:53,519 --> 01:47:54,577
Who next?

1659
01:48:00,092 --> 01:48:01,650
Me! Me! Me!
- In the white...

1660
01:48:02,995 --> 01:48:05,623
Hi.
- Hi Zeisha... this is Maira!

1661
01:48:05,698 --> 01:48:06,756
Your question!

1662
01:48:06,832 --> 01:48:09,130
What is Zeisha's favorite pastime?

1663
01:48:10,002 --> 01:48:11,060
Reading!

1664
01:48:11,103 --> 01:48:12,195
Reading!

1665
01:48:12,705 --> 01:48:13,865
How passe!

1666
01:48:14,073 --> 01:48:15,870
You don't know Zeisha at all!

1667
01:48:17,143 --> 01:48:18,201
Sky biking!

1668
01:48:18,577 --> 01:48:20,875
Riding in the high sky!

1669
01:48:20,946 --> 01:48:22,004
Danger!

1670
01:48:22,081 --> 01:48:23,139
That's what I like!

1671
01:48:25,785 --> 01:48:27,980
Hello. Hello.
- Hi

1672
01:48:28,087 --> 01:48:29,213
Help me!

1673
01:48:29,555 --> 01:48:32,023
You are tall. I want to see too!

1674
01:48:32,091 --> 01:48:33,149
Okay!

1675
01:48:34,060 --> 01:48:40,226
Me!

1676
01:48:40,499 --> 01:48:44,765
Zeisha! Me!

1677
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:48,864
You!

1678
01:48:50,876 --> 01:48:53,504
Seems like you don't
know anything about Zeisha!

1679
01:48:53,646 --> 01:48:57,946
Zeisha, I know you more
than you know yourself!

1680
01:48:58,451 --> 01:48:59,679
Oh really!

1681
01:48:59,785 --> 01:49:01,753
Now you will have to come here!

1682
01:49:04,457 --> 01:49:06,550
The boy is quite handsome!

1683
01:49:14,467 --> 01:49:15,866
Hi, welcome to...

1684
01:49:17,903 --> 01:49:18,961
Okay!

1685
01:49:19,572 --> 01:49:20,869
Welcome to Zeisha's challenge!

1686
01:49:20,973 --> 01:49:21,997
Why don't you have a seat!

1687
01:49:22,074 --> 01:49:24,542
Zeisha decides on her choice
on the hot seat for the day.

1688
01:49:24,610 --> 01:49:26,475
Okay, I hope you know the rules!

1689
01:49:26,545 --> 01:49:28,877
The questions will be about
me and only I will ask them!

1690
01:49:28,948 --> 01:49:31,746
I hope you understood what's
your name? - Wrong question!

1691
01:49:31,851 --> 01:49:34,547
The questions should be
only about you, right!

1692
01:49:34,653 --> 01:49:37,121
Yeah!

1693
01:49:37,189 --> 01:49:38,588
But I will still answer it!

1694
01:49:38,958 --> 01:49:40,016
Karan Malhotra!

1695
01:49:40,493 --> 01:49:41,585
Smart!

1696
01:49:41,694 --> 01:49:43,753
Both look good together!

1697
01:49:44,096 --> 01:49:45,495
My first question!

1698
01:49:45,564 --> 01:49:47,589
What is the name of my first album?

1699
01:49:48,601 --> 01:49:49,659
Me!

1700
01:49:49,735 --> 01:49:51,965
Exactly! Me, meaning Zeisha!

1701
01:49:52,071 --> 01:49:54,562
What Zeisha thinks!
What Zeisha desires!

1702
01:49:54,640 --> 01:49:57,541
Who is... Zeisha!

1703
01:49:57,877 --> 01:49:58,935
Wrong question!

1704
01:49:59,044 --> 01:50:01,512
Only I will ask the question,
and you will answer it!

1705
01:50:01,580 --> 01:50:04,549
Minus 500 but, I will answer it!

1706
01:50:04,917 --> 01:50:07,818
Zeisha is tomorrow's woman
that yesterday spoke about!

1707
01:50:07,953 --> 01:50:11,787
She is a mystery! She's an
enigma... she... is a riddle!

1708
01:50:11,857 --> 01:50:12,915
Anyway!

1709
01:50:12,992 --> 01:50:14,619
What kind of films do I like?

1710
01:50:18,531 --> 01:50:20,965
Love sto... Horror!

1711
01:50:21,667 --> 01:50:22,691
Right!

1712
01:50:23,068 --> 01:50:24,592
500 points!

1713
01:50:26,872 --> 01:50:28,772
What's my favorite season?

1714
01:50:28,908 --> 01:50:30,000
That's easy!

1715
01:50:30,943 --> 01:50:32,035
Rain!

1716
01:50:32,111 --> 01:50:33,203
Rain!

1717
01:50:33,779 --> 01:50:35,144
I love the summer!

1718
01:50:35,214 --> 01:50:36,476
In summer, we can do
open air concerts...

1719
01:50:36,549 --> 01:50:38,710
...and, I get to wear my shorts.

1720
01:50:40,586 --> 01:50:42,884
So, why am I lonely tonight Karan?

1721
01:50:45,157 --> 01:50:47,057
Your eyes are waiting for someone!

1722
01:50:48,494 --> 01:50:49,756
You are missing someone!

1723
01:50:50,963 --> 01:50:54,660
You want to... share
your life with someone!

1724
01:50:55,701 --> 01:50:56,759
Why am I lonely tonight!

1725
01:50:57,036 --> 01:50:58,936
Song No. 3! Album Me!

1726
01:51:00,439 --> 01:51:01,838
Less right, more wrong!

1727
01:51:01,941 --> 01:51:02,999
No points.

1728
01:51:04,610 --> 01:51:05,668
I am very happy!

1729
01:51:05,744 --> 01:51:06,802
I feel complete!

1730
01:51:06,879 --> 01:51:09,575
And anyway, Zeisha
doesn't need anyone!

1731
01:51:09,648 --> 01:51:10,706
Right everyone!

1732
01:51:12,585 --> 01:51:14,780
It's so obvious people,
you don't know...

1733
01:51:14,853 --> 01:51:17,583
...Zeisha anymore than
her name and her fame!

1734
01:51:18,791 --> 01:51:20,622
But I have recognized you!

1735
01:51:27,666 --> 01:51:28,724
Relax Karan!

1736
01:51:28,801 --> 01:51:30,200
You need such an upgrade!

1737
01:51:30,469 --> 01:51:32,664
Only then, maybe you will be
able to understand Zeisha!

1738
01:51:33,872 --> 01:51:35,567
Anyway, good luck!

1739
01:51:36,108 --> 01:51:37,973
Thank you!
- Thank you people for coming.

1740
01:51:38,043 --> 01:51:39,135
That was all for today's show!

1741
01:51:39,211 --> 01:51:42,476
And I will see you next
time on Zeisha's challenge!

1742
01:51:42,748 --> 01:51:45,842
Come back next week...

1743
01:51:46,418 --> 01:51:47,544
Friends!

1744
01:51:48,420 --> 01:51:49,512
Keep in touch!

1745
01:51:49,588 --> 01:51:52,648
For invitations for the
next week, check out...

1746
01:51:56,428 --> 01:51:58,760
She looks exactly
like Sana, isn't it?

1747
01:51:58,831 --> 01:52:00,526
It's just that her hair is red!

1748
01:52:00,599 --> 01:52:02,965
Fool, she is Sana!

1749
01:52:03,435 --> 01:52:04,959
But she doesn't know it!

1750
01:52:06,038 --> 01:52:08,563
Then we will tell her,
isn't it brother-in-law?

1751
01:52:09,975 --> 01:52:11,033
No Rahul!

1752
01:52:12,177 --> 01:52:13,644
The world has changed a lot!

1753
01:52:15,514 --> 01:52:16,879
And your sister Sana too!

1754
01:52:16,949 --> 01:52:19,110
So, won't she recognize us too?

1755
01:52:30,729 --> 01:52:32,594
How do I explain
these children, mom?

1756
01:52:35,901 --> 01:52:37,664
She doesn't even
remember who she is!

1757
01:52:39,171 --> 01:52:41,503
How can she
recognize these children?

1758
01:52:45,711 --> 01:52:50,080
How can I make her
believe that she's my Sana?

1759
01:53:04,630 --> 01:53:05,688
Karan!
- Yes.

1760
01:53:05,764 --> 01:53:07,857
Come on, let's have some breakfast!

1761
01:53:09,535 --> 01:53:10,797
I have a message!

1762
01:53:10,936 --> 01:53:12,028
It's from Boo!

1763
01:53:12,237 --> 01:53:13,704
I will switch on the speakerphone!

1764
01:53:13,739 --> 01:53:14,797
Everybody listen.

1765
01:53:14,907 --> 01:53:16,135
Hello Boo!

1766
01:53:16,208 --> 01:53:19,575
Hello Q. T, great news!

1767
01:53:19,645 --> 01:53:24,014
Zeisha was thinking
about Karan last night!

1768
01:53:24,717 --> 01:53:28,915
She didn't even write the new
song! Mana will be very angry!

1769
01:53:28,987 --> 01:53:30,045
Who is Mana?

1770
01:53:30,122 --> 01:53:32,682
Don't ask me who Mana is!

1771
01:53:32,825 --> 01:53:35,259
Have you ever seen a wild cat?

1772
01:53:35,627 --> 01:53:37,891
She is a wild cat!

1773
01:53:37,963 --> 01:53:39,260
Mana is just like that!

1774
01:53:39,631 --> 01:53:42,657
Mana is Zebelle's best
friend and manager too!

1775
01:53:42,768 --> 01:53:44,793
I don't like her!

1776
01:53:45,504 --> 01:53:47,062
Oh, Mana!

1777
01:53:50,476 --> 01:53:51,568
What happened, Boo?

1778
01:53:51,777 --> 01:53:55,907
What can I say Q. T? I am ruined!

1779
01:53:55,981 --> 01:53:58,814
Mana caught me slandering her!

1780
01:53:58,884 --> 01:54:02,786
What else can happen to a
fool like you, foolish teddy!

1781
01:54:02,855 --> 01:54:03,947
Foolish what...

1782
01:54:04,923 --> 01:54:10,225
Boo, what nonsense are you speaking?

1783
01:54:11,830 --> 01:54:12,888
Tell me!

1784
01:54:13,599 --> 01:54:16,625
My ears hurt.
- Okay! Okay!

1785
01:54:16,735 --> 01:54:20,000
I am not talking nonsense,
just clearing my hard disk!

1786
01:54:21,206 --> 01:54:25,700
You are using this regional
language deliberately, to tease me!

1787
01:54:25,811 --> 01:54:26,869
But you know what?

1788
01:54:26,979 --> 01:54:28,844
I don't care!

1789
01:54:28,981 --> 01:54:30,107
Where is Zeisha?

1790
01:54:30,949 --> 01:54:32,883
There!
- Fine!

1791
01:54:34,052 --> 01:54:35,110
What happened Boo!

1792
01:54:35,821 --> 01:54:39,154
Q. T! I will give you such
a wonderful news...

1793
01:54:39,224 --> 01:54:41,158
...that you will jump with joy!

1794
01:54:41,226 --> 01:54:46,129
In the evening, Zebelle will
play Mortal Kombat in Gamers Zone!

1795
01:54:51,703 --> 01:54:52,761
You want another one?

1796
01:54:54,873 --> 01:54:55,965
Want another one!

1797
01:54:56,475 --> 01:54:57,533
Yes! Zeisha rules!

1798
01:54:57,609 --> 01:54:58,667
Get out of here!

1799
01:54:58,744 --> 01:54:59,802
Game over...

1800
01:54:59,878 --> 01:55:00,936
Boo this is so boring.

1801
01:55:01,013 --> 01:55:02,071
I am tired of winning!

1802
01:55:02,147 --> 01:55:03,614
Who is the next loser! Come on!

1803
01:55:03,682 --> 01:55:04,740
Let's go!

1804
01:55:04,817 --> 01:55:05,875
Want to try me!

1805
01:55:09,087 --> 01:55:10,213
What timing!

1806
01:55:11,023 --> 01:55:12,081
Lover boy!

1807
01:55:12,224 --> 01:55:14,215
Is losing your hobby or habit!

1808
01:55:14,827 --> 01:55:16,021
Come, I'll go easy on you!

1809
01:55:16,495 --> 01:55:17,553
Let's go, Sunshine!

1810
01:55:17,896 --> 01:55:18,954
Sunshine!

1811
01:55:19,698 --> 01:55:22,895
Where do you get
these ancient names from?

1812
01:55:23,035 --> 01:55:24,093
From the place I have come from.

1813
01:55:24,736 --> 01:55:25,828
And... that is?

1814
01:55:25,904 --> 01:55:30,034
Well, to be honest with you... 2008!

1815
01:55:32,578 --> 01:55:33,977
That explains it!

1816
01:55:34,580 --> 01:55:36,980
Welcome. And I am from 1937!

1817
01:55:37,049 --> 01:55:38,107
Nice to meet you!

1818
01:55:38,183 --> 01:55:39,650
Why have you come here?

1819
01:55:39,785 --> 01:55:40,843
For love!

1820
01:55:41,653 --> 01:55:42,642
Just a tip!

1821
01:55:42,855 --> 01:55:45,119
There is no such thing
as love in our world!

1822
01:55:45,190 --> 01:55:47,590
So maybe, you will have
to return empty handed!

1823
01:55:49,061 --> 01:55:50,119
Really!

1824
01:55:54,132 --> 01:55:55,656
Enough of this verbal shapang!

1825
01:55:55,868 --> 01:55:57,199
You want to play, let's go!

1826
01:55:58,504 --> 01:55:59,664
Game on!

1827
01:56:15,554 --> 01:56:16,748
Good luck lover boy!

1828
01:56:17,956 --> 01:56:20,220
I don't need luck! I have love!

1829
01:56:20,692 --> 01:56:21,750
Bring it on!

1830
01:56:30,903 --> 01:56:32,234
What a nice shot!

1831
01:56:32,538 --> 01:56:33,596
I've come here to
receive those shots.

1832
01:57:07,673 --> 01:57:08,697
Want another one!

1833
01:57:09,675 --> 01:57:10,869
Come on lover boy

1834
01:57:14,012 --> 01:57:15,070
You!

1835
01:57:17,215 --> 01:57:18,512
Watch me!

1836
01:57:21,620 --> 01:57:23,554
Play on, best of luck!

1837
01:57:24,089 --> 01:57:25,750
I don't need luck! I have...

1838
01:57:27,025 --> 01:57:28,083
Let's go!

1839
01:57:28,694 --> 01:57:29,752
Yes!

1840
01:57:45,043 --> 01:57:46,510
I win!

1841
01:57:47,579 --> 01:57:50,173
Game over. Zeisha wins.

1842
01:57:50,482 --> 01:57:52,177
I told you, you would lose!

1843
01:57:52,451 --> 01:57:53,509
Didn't I tell him, Boo?

1844
01:57:53,986 --> 01:57:55,044
That's what you think!

1845
01:57:59,057 --> 01:58:01,491
But Zebelle, he was good!

1846
01:58:38,030 --> 01:58:40,089
Dr. Yatinder Khanna, Science Centre!

1847
01:58:40,232 --> 01:58:42,223
You will get all
the information here

1848
01:58:44,069 --> 01:58:45,434
Everything here is about me!

1849
01:58:46,938 --> 01:58:48,030
Hello there!

1850
01:58:48,073 --> 01:58:50,507
We have information
about people living in Mars

1851
01:58:50,642 --> 01:58:51,836
Do you want to ask anything?

1852
01:58:53,645 --> 01:58:54,703
Nothing!

1853
01:58:54,913 --> 01:58:55,971
Okay!

1854
01:58:56,848 --> 01:58:58,645
Hello there, were
you looking for me?

1855
01:58:59,051 --> 01:59:00,712
No, time machine,

1856
01:59:00,986 --> 01:59:03,580
Time machine! On your right,
next counter please!

1857
01:59:04,056 --> 01:59:05,114
Thank you!

1858
01:59:12,798 --> 01:59:14,663
Hello there, were
you looking for me?

1859
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:16,062
No, time machine.

1860
01:59:17,703 --> 01:59:19,068
Hey kids, come on I am
asking about myself!

1861
01:59:19,104 --> 01:59:20,162
Yeah, let's go!

1862
01:59:20,772 --> 01:59:21,864
Dr. Yatinder Khanna!

1863
01:59:21,973 --> 01:59:23,497
Good looking! Genius!

1864
01:59:26,678 --> 01:59:29,078
Good morning,
greetings! Welcome to my museum!

1865
01:59:29,147 --> 01:59:30,671
I am Dr. Yatinder Khanna!

1866
01:59:30,882 --> 01:59:33,077
Worlds first time traveler!

1867
01:59:33,218 --> 01:59:35,209
Anything you want to know
about me and my inventions!

1868
01:59:35,554 --> 01:59:37,078
You can ask, you will
get the right answer!

1869
01:59:37,222 --> 01:59:39,747
As they say, from the horses mouth!

1870
01:59:40,826 --> 01:59:41,884
Okay! Okay!

1871
01:59:41,960 --> 01:59:45,088
Other than the time machine,
which other inventions have I done?

1872
01:59:45,831 --> 01:59:47,696
Not you, me!

1873
01:59:47,899 --> 01:59:49,093
Yes, yes, you!

1874
01:59:49,968 --> 01:59:51,162
The list is endless!

1875
01:59:51,470 --> 01:59:52,630
I made humanoid robots
like you, young lady!

1876
01:59:52,738 --> 01:59:53,830
Pretty lady!

1877
01:59:54,072 --> 01:59:55,539
You should be ashamed.

1878
01:59:56,775 --> 01:59:58,037
Color changing wall paint!

1879
01:59:58,110 --> 01:59:59,168
Laser pens!

1880
01:59:59,444 --> 02:00:00,502
Energy stations.

1881
02:00:00,579 --> 02:00:01,637
My God, how will I do all this?

1882
02:00:01,713 --> 02:00:02,771
I haven't even started!

1883
02:00:03,582 --> 02:00:05,174
Excuse me, I have
already invented all this.

1884
02:00:05,584 --> 02:00:07,643
You can see the demonstration
in the right wing of the lobby

1885
02:00:07,986 --> 02:00:09,977
Oh God, I am so nervous.
I can't breathe.

1886
02:00:10,589 --> 02:00:13,490
You can view my medical inventions
on the left wing of the lobby.

1887
02:00:13,658 --> 02:00:14,920
Look, you don't understand.

1888
02:00:15,060 --> 02:00:16,527
You and I, we both are the same.

1889
02:00:16,595 --> 02:00:18,586
I am doctor Yatinder
Khanna, from 2008!

1890
02:00:19,664 --> 02:00:23,464
Tell me one thing, I... I mean... we!
Did we only keep inventing things...

1891
02:00:23,502 --> 02:00:25,197
...or did we get married?

1892
02:00:25,504 --> 02:00:27,699
I don't discuss my personal life!

1893
02:00:28,507 --> 02:00:30,475
Your personal and my
personal life is the same...

1894
02:00:30,542 --> 02:00:31,600
...I told you I am Dr. Khanna!

1895
02:00:31,676 --> 02:00:32,870
Wrong, I am doctor Khanna!

1896
02:00:33,478 --> 02:00:34,877
Fine, then tell me!

1897
02:00:35,013 --> 02:00:39,211
Do you understand the
principles of astrology?

1898
02:00:39,618 --> 02:00:41,210
Principles! Astrology!

1899
02:00:41,553 --> 02:00:42,679
If you are the real Dr. Khanna...

1900
02:00:42,754 --> 02:00:45,154
...then tell me which
is your favorite film?

1901
02:00:45,757 --> 02:00:46,815
Films!

1902
02:00:47,159 --> 02:00:49,491
I am a scientist!
I don't watch films!

1903
02:00:49,628 --> 02:00:52,825
Really! Then who the hell
saw Mogul-E-Azam 17 times!

1904
02:00:52,964 --> 02:00:57,162
By God! I am not against love,
I am a strong follower of my values!

1905
02:00:57,435 --> 02:00:58,959
What was Anarkali's real name?

1906
02:00:59,070 --> 02:01:00,128
Akbar...

1907
02:01:00,672 --> 02:01:01,730
Saleem...

1908
02:01:01,873 --> 02:01:02,965
Anarkali...

1909
02:01:03,441 --> 02:01:04,499
Come, come, come.

1910
02:01:06,912 --> 02:01:08,504
You are the fake Dr. Ya!

1911
02:01:13,518 --> 02:01:14,917
What did you do Dr. Khanna?

1912
02:01:15,053 --> 02:01:16,520
You go the system hanged!

1913
02:01:16,721 --> 02:01:19,189
We needed a lot of
information from him.

1914
02:02:08,940 --> 02:02:10,032
What happened, Zebelle!

1915
02:02:13,845 --> 02:02:14,903
Nothing!

1916
02:02:14,980 --> 02:02:16,174
Did you write the song Zebelle?

1917
02:02:17,048 --> 02:02:18,845
No, I am thinking!

1918
02:02:19,718 --> 02:02:22,778
Please write it, Mana has
given tomorrow's deadline!

1919
02:02:23,121 --> 02:02:24,850
Tell her, I cannot
do it by tomorrow!

1920
02:02:25,457 --> 02:02:26,719
Who, me?

1921
02:02:26,925 --> 02:02:28,119
No way!

1922
02:02:30,061 --> 02:02:31,585
Why are you so scared of her?

1923
02:02:31,730 --> 02:02:32,788
Come here!

1924
02:02:33,865 --> 02:02:35,890
She is my business manager,
not an alien!

1925
02:02:36,902 --> 02:02:37,994
Topic change!

1926
02:02:38,103 --> 02:02:39,900
By the way, Zebelle!

1927
02:02:40,071 --> 02:02:42,596
If you weren't writing the song,
then what were you doing for so long?

1928
02:02:42,874 --> 02:02:44,000
Topic change.

1929
02:02:44,075 --> 02:02:45,872
You were thinking
about Karan, isn't it?

1930
02:02:46,011 --> 02:02:47,069
Topic change!

1931
02:02:49,080 --> 02:02:53,881
By the way Boo, do you think
I should think about Karan?

1932
02:02:53,952 --> 02:02:55,010
Topic change!

1933
02:02:55,620 --> 02:02:58,487
By the way Zebelle, what
else can you do other...

1934
02:02:58,556 --> 02:03:00,615
...than thinking about Karan?

1935
02:03:01,159 --> 02:03:02,558
Topic change!

1936
02:03:03,094 --> 02:03:05,756
By the way Boo, it's
no use talking to you!

1937
02:03:06,031 --> 02:03:07,896
Whatever needs to be done,
Mana will do it!

1938
02:03:09,034 --> 02:03:10,695
Mana won't do anything!

1939
02:03:10,835 --> 02:03:12,234
Mana will only refuse!

1940
02:03:12,504 --> 02:03:13,528
Topic change!

1941
02:03:13,605 --> 02:03:14,697
No!

1942
02:03:14,739 --> 02:03:15,797
Topic change!
- No!

1943
02:03:15,874 --> 02:03:16,966
I said, topic change.

1944
02:03:17,042 --> 02:03:18,100
Topic change! Topic change!

1945
02:03:18,176 --> 02:03:19,700
No, no!

1946
02:03:20,312 --> 02:03:21,540
Stop! Stop! You are tickling!

1947
02:03:22,647 --> 02:03:23,909
Oh Zeisha!

1948
02:03:24,249 --> 02:03:27,150
For the past half an hour you
have been talking about Karan!

1949
02:03:27,519 --> 02:03:28,918
Karan! Karan! Karan!

1950
02:03:29,120 --> 02:03:31,054
Why don't you just get
him out of your system?

1951
02:03:31,823 --> 02:03:33,916
Hit ice and let's go clubbing!

1952
02:03:34,526 --> 02:03:35,584
Good plan!

1953
02:03:35,660 --> 02:03:36,718
And you know what?

1954
02:03:36,795 --> 02:03:37,853
I think you are right!

1955
02:03:38,697 --> 02:03:40,130
I shouldn't meet him again!

1956
02:03:43,001 --> 02:03:44,093
All you people in the house!

1957
02:03:44,169 --> 02:03:45,466
Let's welcome the
international superstar Ziesha!

1958
02:03:45,503 --> 02:03:46,561
For a second I thought he was Karan!

1959
02:03:46,671 --> 02:03:47,695
Just forget him!

1960
02:03:47,772 --> 02:03:48,864
How can I forget him?

1961
02:03:48,907 --> 02:03:49,999
He is everywhere?

1962
02:03:50,075 --> 02:03:51,201
It's affecting your work Zeisha!

1963
02:03:51,509 --> 02:03:54,706
You haven't written a
song in last three days!

1964
02:03:54,846 --> 02:03:56,108
You have cancelled three shows!

1965
02:03:57,482 --> 02:03:58,881
Now don't tell me you
are in love with him!

1966
02:04:00,685 --> 02:04:01,743
Why?

1967
02:04:01,953 --> 02:04:03,011
Why can't I be in love with him?

1968
02:04:03,088 --> 02:04:05,613
Because you are Ziesha!
- C'mon Mana!

1969
02:04:48,500 --> 02:04:50,764
What! The party is over?

1970
02:05:08,219 --> 02:05:09,584
"Whether you come or not...

1971
02:05:10,722 --> 02:05:12,713
...I will come to see you!"

1972
02:05:12,791 --> 02:05:13,883
"Whether you say it or not..."

1973
02:05:14,959 --> 02:05:16,221
"Whether you say it or not...

1974
02:05:17,228 --> 02:05:19,093
...I will say it!"

1975
02:05:19,230 --> 02:05:20,527
"Whether you hear or not...

1976
02:05:21,499 --> 02:05:22,727
...I will make you hear it!"

1977
02:05:23,835 --> 02:05:25,700
"What my heart says!"

1978
02:05:25,737 --> 02:05:30,970
"My heart says to you!"

1979
02:05:31,109 --> 02:05:33,839
"Why is there a
distance between us?"

1980
02:05:34,079 --> 02:05:38,106
"Why should we stay separated?"

1981
02:06:26,931 --> 02:06:30,924
"Whether you take a
look or you don't...

1982
02:06:31,102 --> 02:06:35,596
...there are a hundred
images in them of my dreams."

1983
02:06:35,740 --> 02:06:37,640
"Whether you believe it or not...

1984
02:06:37,775 --> 02:06:44,578
...but both our hands,
have similar fate!"

1985
02:06:46,117 --> 02:06:47,516
"Whether you embark or not...

1986
02:06:48,186 --> 02:06:50,177
...the path calls you!"

1987
02:06:50,455 --> 02:06:51,717
"Whether you hide or not."

1988
02:06:52,657 --> 02:06:54,852
"Whether you hide or not...

1989
02:06:55,059 --> 02:06:56,856
...they stare at you!"

1990
02:06:56,995 --> 02:06:58,485
"Whether you get appeased or not!"

1991
02:06:58,963 --> 02:07:00,794
"Whether you get appeased or not...

1992
02:07:00,932 --> 02:07:03,492
...they try to appease you!"

1993
02:07:03,668 --> 02:07:07,661
"Me and my loyalty!"

1994
02:07:42,907 --> 02:07:44,841
"Whether you accept it or not...

1995
02:07:45,043 --> 02:07:51,607
...but I appear known to you!"

1996
02:07:51,816 --> 02:07:53,647
"Whether you say it or not...

1997
02:07:53,785 --> 02:08:00,657
...through the eyes,
there is a saga being made!"

1998
02:08:01,459 --> 02:08:03,950
"Somewhere!"

1999
02:08:04,596 --> 02:08:06,587
"There had to be a way!"

2000
02:08:06,731 --> 02:08:07,857
"Sometime!"

2001
02:08:08,700 --> 02:08:09,894
"Sometime!

2002
02:08:10,969 --> 02:08:12,960
"Sorrows had to end!"

2003
02:08:13,104 --> 02:08:16,505
"Some day!"

2004
02:08:17,642 --> 02:08:23,603
"The love that had
to blossom, it has!"

2005
02:08:23,881 --> 02:08:25,872
"My heart says to you!"

2006
02:08:26,084 --> 02:08:29,815
"Why is there a
distance between us?"

2007
02:08:29,954 --> 02:08:31,751
"Why should we stay separated?"

2008
02:09:13,031 --> 02:09:14,157
Good morning Zeisha!

2009
02:09:14,532 --> 02:09:15,658
Good morning!

2010
02:09:15,800 --> 02:09:16,994
What would you like today?

2011
02:09:18,102 --> 02:09:20,161
Could I have the
bedroom menu please?

2012
02:09:20,471 --> 02:09:21,495
Sure!

2013
02:09:26,644 --> 02:09:27,702
The color palette!

2014
02:09:27,845 --> 02:09:29,073
Here is the color palette!

2015
02:09:29,514 --> 02:09:30,742
What color would you like?

2016
02:09:30,882 --> 02:09:31,940
Pink!

2017
02:09:32,550 --> 02:09:33,778
I feel pink today!

2018
02:09:37,555 --> 02:09:38,613
Too bright!

2019
02:09:38,890 --> 02:09:39,948
One shade lighter please!

2020
02:09:40,024 --> 02:09:41,082
Sure!

2021
02:09:44,028 --> 02:09:45,154
It's perfect!

2022
02:09:46,497 --> 02:09:47,964
Good morning Zeisha!

2023
02:09:48,533 --> 02:09:50,467
Good morning Boo!

2024
02:09:52,637 --> 02:09:53,729
Pink!

2025
02:09:53,838 --> 02:09:55,430
Why suddenly pink today?

2026
02:09:56,007 --> 02:09:57,474
I like pink now!

2027
02:09:58,443 --> 02:09:59,910
Pink is the color of love.

2028
02:10:00,178 --> 02:10:01,668
Zeisha is in love!

2029
02:10:01,813 --> 02:10:02,905
No, I am not!

2030
02:10:02,980 --> 02:10:04,038
Zeisha is in love!

2031
02:10:04,115 --> 02:10:05,446
No she is not!

2032
02:10:05,516 --> 02:10:06,710
Zeisha is in love!

2033
02:10:06,851 --> 02:10:07,909
Shut up Boo!

2034
02:10:07,985 --> 02:10:10,180
Zeisha is in love!
Zeisha is in love!

2035
02:10:10,455 --> 02:10:11,513
Boo!

2036
02:10:17,462 --> 02:10:18,520
Where are you?

2037
02:10:18,663 --> 02:10:20,597
Zeisha is in love!

2038
02:10:22,467 --> 02:10:23,491
Come down Boo!

2039
02:10:23,601 --> 02:10:24,659
No!

2040
02:10:24,702 --> 02:10:25,794
Come down right now!

2041
02:10:25,870 --> 02:10:26,894
No way!

2042
02:10:26,971 --> 02:10:28,063
Stupid robot!

2043
02:10:35,813 --> 02:10:36,973
Incoming call, do
you want to answer?

2044
02:10:37,048 --> 02:10:38,174
Yeah!

2045
02:10:39,617 --> 02:10:40,743
Hi Karan!

2046
02:10:43,154 --> 02:10:44,519
Karan, you are still dancing?

2047
02:10:45,590 --> 02:10:47,057
How do you know that I am dancing?

2048
02:10:48,793 --> 02:10:52,160
Can you see me Karan? Then
I can see you too Karan!

2049
02:10:52,797 --> 02:10:53,923
What?

2050
02:10:55,433 --> 02:10:56,457
Oh shucks!

2051
02:10:56,968 --> 02:10:58,060
Put the phone down!

2052
02:10:58,136 --> 02:10:59,535
But, when did I pick up the phone?

2053
02:11:01,439 --> 02:11:02,497
You're so funny!

2054
02:11:04,675 --> 02:11:05,801
That's not fair!

2055
02:11:06,077 --> 02:11:07,635
It's supposed to be a private show!

2056
02:11:08,613 --> 02:11:10,046
You feel shy too!

2057
02:11:10,448 --> 02:11:11,608
How sweet!

2058
02:11:11,883 --> 02:11:13,510
Can I talk to you after
I come out of the bathroom?

2059
02:11:13,651 --> 02:11:14,709
Please!

2060
02:11:14,786 --> 02:11:15,844
Absolutely not!

2061
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:17,717
From now on, everyday
we will talk like this!

2062
02:11:17,855 --> 02:11:18,913
Do I have to?

2063
02:11:18,990 --> 02:11:20,048
Of course!

2064
02:11:20,124 --> 02:11:21,182
And if you disapprove!

2065
02:11:21,459 --> 02:11:23,927
Then I will put your
X-rated clip on the net!

2066
02:11:24,462 --> 02:11:25,520
That's not fair!

2067
02:11:26,030 --> 02:11:27,190
Everything is fair in...

2068
02:11:29,467 --> 02:11:30,593
But you don't believe in love!

2069
02:11:30,802 --> 02:11:31,894
Of course I don't!

2070
02:11:32,069 --> 02:11:33,093
Topic change!

2071
02:11:33,171 --> 02:11:35,162
What are you doing
after the shower Karan?

2072
02:12:03,468 --> 02:12:04,662
Do you know how it happens?

2073
02:12:04,936 --> 02:12:08,030
If you take two magnets,
the unlike poles attract!

2074
02:12:08,139 --> 02:12:10,164
Rahul! Thia! Look who is here?

2075
02:12:11,442 --> 02:12:12,500
Come.

2076
02:12:13,778 --> 02:12:15,541
Your house...

2077
02:12:35,132 --> 02:12:37,794
Zeisha, this is my family!

2078
02:12:38,769 --> 02:12:39,895
That's uncle Ya!
- Hello!

2079
02:12:40,771 --> 02:12:42,796
Rahul! Thia!
- Hi!

2080
02:12:43,975 --> 02:12:47,604
I can't believe,
that we are meeting you!

2081
02:12:48,079 --> 02:12:49,876
We missed you a lot!

2082
02:12:52,583 --> 02:12:53,948
Can we hug you?

2083
02:12:55,486 --> 02:12:56,544
Yeah!

2084
02:12:56,821 --> 02:12:58,948
Come, come!

2085
02:13:05,830 --> 02:13:07,991
Have we met before?

2086
02:13:09,700 --> 02:13:11,895
I sorry, but I don't remember!

2087
02:13:13,704 --> 02:13:14,796
Zeisha!

2088
02:13:15,506 --> 02:13:17,098
Everyday you meet so many people?

2089
02:13:18,075 --> 02:13:19,201
How can you recognize them?

2090
02:13:19,577 --> 02:13:20,669
That's right!

2091
02:13:20,912 --> 02:13:22,209
You must have forgotten me too!

2092
02:13:22,713 --> 02:13:23,771
I have met you 7 times,
and out of that...

2093
02:13:23,848 --> 02:13:25,247
...I have forgotten 3
meetings out of that.

2094
02:13:26,684 --> 02:13:27,810
Come on kids, let's go!

2095
02:13:28,052 --> 02:13:29,144
Just a minute, uncle Ya!

2096
02:13:31,022 --> 02:13:37,791
Rahul! Thia! I forgot you both,
I am very sorry for that!

2097
02:13:38,529 --> 02:13:41,555
But I promise, it will
never happen again. Okay!

2098
02:13:43,701 --> 02:13:44,793
And you too, uncle Ya!

2099
02:13:45,803 --> 02:13:47,065
I will remember you!

2100
02:13:47,872 --> 02:13:49,499
But you don't forget me too!

2101
02:13:50,875 --> 02:13:51,933
Promise?

2102
02:13:53,144 --> 02:13:54,202
Promise!

2103
02:13:55,479 --> 02:13:56,673
Come on kids, let's go!

2104
02:13:56,814 --> 02:13:58,213
C'mon kids, let's go!

2105
02:13:58,482 --> 02:14:01,474
Bye kids! Bye!

2106
02:14:01,852 --> 02:14:03,479
They are very sweet children!

2107
02:14:05,823 --> 02:14:06,949
It's your family!

2108
02:14:10,728 --> 02:14:11,854
Forget it!

2109
02:14:12,997 --> 02:14:14,965
Dr. Khanna, can I help you!

2110
02:14:15,833 --> 02:14:16,925
Q. T!

2111
02:14:17,034 --> 02:14:18,092
You are too sweet.

2112
02:14:18,135 --> 02:14:19,500
You are too sweet.

2113
02:14:19,737 --> 02:14:20,795
I love you.

2114
02:14:20,905 --> 02:14:21,929
I love you! I love you!

2115
02:14:22,006 --> 02:14:23,098
I would have...

2116
02:14:23,174 --> 02:14:24,232
...married you! But what
can I do, there is an...

2117
02:14:24,308 --> 02:14:25,502
...age difference between us!

2118
02:14:25,576 --> 02:14:27,703
Not just age, there is a
generation gap between us!

2119
02:14:27,845 --> 02:14:29,107
Uncle Ya!

2120
02:14:31,983 --> 02:14:33,041
Don't call me uncle!

2121
02:14:34,251 --> 02:14:36,515
You didn't tell me!

2122
02:14:36,587 --> 02:14:38,714
How did you feel
after coming in 2050?

2123
02:14:38,856 --> 02:14:40,050
Good!

2124
02:14:40,191 --> 02:14:41,658
But 22nd October is coming close!

2125
02:14:43,127 --> 02:14:44,526
22nd October, I have not time!

2126
02:14:45,896 --> 02:14:47,454
We will have to go on
22nd October, because...

2127
02:14:47,531 --> 02:14:49,658
...if the planets
stand in superstition!

2128
02:14:49,700 --> 02:14:50,792
Then we will be in
trouble, because...

2129
02:14:50,868 --> 02:14:51,994
...the planets will be
in the configuration...

2130
02:14:52,069 --> 02:14:54,560
We have to go on the 22nd October!

2131
02:14:55,673 --> 02:14:59,040
You think Zeisha
will go back with Karan?

2132
02:14:59,176 --> 02:15:02,907
That depends on Karan if he can
persuade her to come back with him!

2133
02:15:03,714 --> 02:15:06,478
Then will you leave Sec C back?

2134
02:15:06,617 --> 02:15:07,675
No!

2135
02:15:07,818 --> 02:15:08,876
No, Sec C cannot stay here!

2136
02:15:09,020 --> 02:15:10,681
If we left him behind...

2137
02:15:10,755 --> 02:15:12,689
...then instantly he will
grow 42 years older and he...

2138
02:15:14,225 --> 02:15:15,624
Karan cannot stay here!

2139
02:15:15,993 --> 02:15:19,485
He cannot stay back here,
Zeisha may not want to go back...

2140
02:15:19,563 --> 02:15:21,224
...then what is this mission for?

2141
02:15:22,533 --> 02:15:24,728
You cannot see gains
and losses in relations!

2142
02:15:24,902 --> 02:15:27,735
Humans only make
relations and try to abide by it.

2143
02:15:27,905 --> 02:15:29,099
Everything else is destiny!

2144
02:15:33,110 --> 02:15:34,771
So this is my studio!

2145
02:15:35,179 --> 02:15:36,703
I compose all my songs here!

2146
02:15:36,847 --> 02:15:37,905
Lights!

2147
02:15:39,183 --> 02:15:41,242
It's got an Alibaba theme?

2148
02:15:41,519 --> 02:15:42,508
You like it?

2149
02:15:42,586 --> 02:15:44,645
Well, then I am your
Alibaba for the night!

2150
02:15:46,057 --> 02:15:47,957
You know a lot about me, Karan!

2151
02:15:48,192 --> 02:15:51,525
Actually, the entire
world knows a lot about me.

2152
02:15:51,829 --> 02:15:53,922
But I don't know anything about you!

2153
02:15:54,131 --> 02:15:55,621
Tell me something about yourself.

2154
02:15:56,100 --> 02:16:00,764
Karan Malhotra, Age
23... from... Mumbai!

2155
02:16:01,105 --> 02:16:04,973
Current status,
PhD in reincarnation!

2156
02:16:06,043 --> 02:16:07,203
Reincarnation!

2157
02:16:08,479 --> 02:16:09,878
You really believe in it?

2158
02:16:11,816 --> 02:16:13,078
A lot!

2159
02:16:14,785 --> 02:16:16,013
That's why I am doing a PhD!

2160
02:16:17,054 --> 02:16:18,112
Of course!

2161
02:16:19,490 --> 02:16:20,548
You don't believe it?

2162
02:16:23,894 --> 02:16:25,020
No!

2163
02:16:25,830 --> 02:16:27,024
Are you crazy?

2164
02:16:27,932 --> 02:16:32,801
I believe, we are only born once,
we live only once, we die once...

2165
02:16:32,903 --> 02:16:33,927
And fall in love only once.

2166
02:16:34,004 --> 02:16:35,096
Correct!

2167
02:16:35,139 --> 02:16:36,629
Wow, poetry.

2168
02:16:36,774 --> 02:16:40,835
That means, you are a
genius in, love, poetry.

2169
02:16:41,545 --> 02:16:42,603
I want to hear poetry!

2170
02:16:42,780 --> 02:16:45,476
Alibaba! Recite a
poetry for Marjina!

2171
02:16:45,883 --> 02:16:48,113
Alibaba, doesn't know poetry!

2172
02:16:48,185 --> 02:16:52,019
Come on, it's very easy! You
just have to rhyme the words. - No!

2173
02:16:52,089 --> 02:16:53,147
And anyways!

2174
02:16:53,457 --> 02:16:54,788
I have made an
entire career out of it!

2175
02:16:55,860 --> 02:16:59,193
If Alibaba cannot do poetry,
then Karan can!

2176
02:16:59,964 --> 02:17:01,022
For me!

2177
02:17:03,467 --> 02:17:04,991
Karan can do poetry!
- See!

2178
02:17:08,773 --> 02:17:11,571
We were miles apart!

2179
02:17:13,611 --> 02:17:15,545
The journey looked
like centuries apart.

2180
02:17:16,881 --> 02:17:19,076
The heart was unsure.

2181
02:17:20,985 --> 02:17:26,617
Still I feel... we were
destined to meet again.

2182
02:17:27,491 --> 02:17:28,549
Wow!

2183
02:17:29,527 --> 02:17:31,722
That was actually
really good, Karan!

2184
02:17:32,062 --> 02:17:33,120
Thanks.

2185
02:17:35,166 --> 02:17:36,531
I will add music to it!

2186
02:17:37,134 --> 02:17:38,499
Maglev key base!

2187
02:17:38,736 --> 02:17:39,828
Wait!

2188
02:18:01,592 --> 02:18:02,650
That was good!

2189
02:18:04,128 --> 02:18:05,652
Karan, sing it!

2190
02:18:06,664 --> 02:18:07,722
I cannot sing!

2191
02:18:07,798 --> 02:18:08,856
Karan can't sing!

2192
02:18:08,933 --> 02:18:10,059
You will have to sing!

2193
02:18:10,501 --> 02:18:11,991
I always sing for the entire world!

2194
02:18:12,570 --> 02:18:13,867
But no one ever sings for me!

2195
02:18:14,672 --> 02:18:17,505
Karan, for me!

2196
02:18:41,765 --> 02:18:46,566
"We were miles apart!"

2197
02:18:46,837 --> 02:18:51,968
"The journey would take centuries."

2198
02:18:52,443 --> 02:18:57,471
"The heart was unaware!"

2199
02:18:57,848 --> 02:19:08,190
"Still I feel... we
were destined to meet!"

2200
02:19:08,692 --> 02:19:13,823
"We were miles apart!"

2201
02:20:01,912 --> 02:20:12,516
"My obsession... has
brought me so far."

2202
02:20:12,790 --> 02:20:23,496
"My dreams have come true!"

2203
02:20:23,701 --> 02:20:31,107
"If I lose her now,
then why should live?"

2204
02:20:31,642 --> 02:20:34,076
"It's better that I die!"

2205
02:20:34,578 --> 02:20:45,147
"Never... say that again!"

2206
02:20:45,889 --> 02:20:49,825
"Never go..."

2207
02:20:50,894 --> 02:20:52,521
Zeisha! Oh no!

2208
02:20:53,430 --> 02:20:54,488
Zeisha!

2209
02:21:19,623 --> 02:21:23,821
Fate and situation is playing
a strange game wit us, Zeisha!

2210
02:21:26,497 --> 02:21:32,902
But you had said, that
true love is biggest of all!

2211
02:21:33,904 --> 02:21:34,962
Bigger than fate!

2212
02:21:38,642 --> 02:21:39,734
I love you!

2213
02:21:49,553 --> 02:21:52,147
All night she has
been blabbering things!

2214
02:21:53,457 --> 02:21:56,483
Strange things, unknown names.

2215
02:21:57,628 --> 02:21:59,493
What has happened to my Zeisha?

2216
02:21:59,763 --> 02:22:03,756
That's why I say grandma,
stay with her.

2217
02:22:03,867 --> 02:22:05,528
I just can't handle her!

2218
02:22:12,042 --> 02:22:13,168
Finally!

2219
02:22:15,913 --> 02:22:16,971
What is all this?

2220
02:22:17,448 --> 02:22:18,506
Mute off!

2221
02:22:18,782 --> 02:22:21,444
Last night, Zeisha was seen
in an unknown boy's arms...

2222
02:22:21,518 --> 02:22:22,678
...in an unconscious state!

2223
02:22:22,753 --> 02:22:24,778
What is this matter after all?

2224
02:22:24,855 --> 02:22:26,049
Who is that boy?

2225
02:22:26,190 --> 02:22:27,657
Is it a case of drug overdose...
- Pause!

2226
02:22:28,792 --> 02:22:30,453
What is all this Zeisha?

2227
02:22:30,794 --> 02:22:31,920
What the hell is this?

2228
02:22:32,062 --> 02:22:33,120
All this is wrong?

2229
02:22:33,197 --> 02:22:35,188
It really is not what it looks like.

2230
02:22:36,500 --> 02:22:39,162
I just wanted to live like a
normal girl just for once.

2231
02:22:39,470 --> 02:22:42,564
Don't you understand,
Zeisha, that you are a star?

2232
02:22:43,040 --> 02:22:45,008
But after what happened last night!

2233
02:22:45,142 --> 02:22:47,007
It's pitiable!
Just look at yourself!

2234
02:22:47,144 --> 02:22:48,202
Just look at this!

2235
02:22:48,479 --> 02:22:49,605
Can you even recognize yourself?

2236
02:22:49,813 --> 02:22:51,144
But last night I was in my senses!

2237
02:22:53,784 --> 02:23:01,122
Even I can't understand
what happened last night!

2238
02:23:03,060 --> 02:23:04,527
I wish I could understand myself!

2239
02:23:05,496 --> 02:23:07,088
I wish I could explain it to you!

2240
02:23:07,231 --> 02:23:09,495
There is nothing to explain Zeisha!

2241
02:23:09,633 --> 02:23:11,624
A boy used you for his own benefit,
for cheap publicity!

2242
02:23:11,735 --> 02:23:16,035
He toyed along with
your feelings, that's it!

2243
02:23:16,840 --> 02:23:17,898
Face it, girl!

2244
02:23:18,142 --> 02:23:19,973
Just me, the entire
world understands it!

2245
02:23:20,177 --> 02:23:21,235
It will be better if
you understand it too!

2246
02:23:21,512 --> 02:23:23,241
The world can be wrong!
You can be wrong!

2247
02:23:23,514 --> 02:23:26,108
But... how can Karan be wrong?

2248
02:23:26,783 --> 02:23:28,250
It is so obvious, Zeisha!

2249
02:23:28,852 --> 02:23:31,116
Karan has hypnotized you!
- Hypnotize!

2250
02:23:31,255 --> 02:23:33,052
Yes! Yes! Yes Zeisha!

2251
02:23:33,123 --> 02:23:34,181
He is a fraud!

2252
02:23:34,258 --> 02:23:35,555
His ID is fake too!

2253
02:23:35,759 --> 02:23:37,920
And who knows whether his
name is Karan or something else!

2254
02:23:38,529 --> 02:23:40,588
Just go away Mana, I can't
deal with you right now!

2255
02:23:40,998 --> 02:23:42,522
Karan is not a fraud!

2256
02:23:43,467 --> 02:23:45,492
He really loves you!

2257
02:23:49,473 --> 02:23:51,065
I've to meet Zeisha.
- You can't go in.

2258
02:23:51,141 --> 02:23:52,199
You can't see her!

2259
02:23:52,476 --> 02:23:53,943
Wait, you can't go in!
Mana, thank God!

2260
02:23:54,545 --> 02:23:56,536
Tell Zeisha that...
- Just go away Karan!

2261
02:23:56,947 --> 02:23:58,471
Stop harassing Zeisha!

2262
02:23:58,615 --> 02:23:59,673
Harass!

2263
02:23:59,750 --> 02:24:01,479
You are mistaken.

2264
02:24:01,552 --> 02:24:03,019
They are saying rubbish on T. V too!

2265
02:24:03,153 --> 02:24:06,020
In fact... if Zeisha sees it...
- She has already seen it!

2266
02:24:06,890 --> 02:24:08,221
She knows everything!

2267
02:24:09,026 --> 02:24:11,688
And this hypnotism that
you are trying to use.

2268
02:24:11,895 --> 02:24:13,089
That will be of no use.

2269
02:24:13,830 --> 02:24:14,888
Hypnotism!

2270
02:24:16,099 --> 02:24:18,727
What are you saying Mana...
- Oh yeah!

2271
02:24:19,503 --> 02:24:21,130
Go back, to wherever
you have come from!

2272
02:24:21,738 --> 02:24:23,706
Or else I will have
to call the police.

2273
02:24:24,975 --> 02:24:26,033
I can see now!

2274
02:24:26,643 --> 02:24:27,701
I got it!

2275
02:24:27,844 --> 02:24:28,902
You have planned all of this!

2276
02:24:28,979 --> 02:24:30,037
Shut up!

2277
02:24:30,113 --> 02:24:31,705
Zeisha doesn't want to meet you.

2278
02:24:32,916 --> 02:24:36,511
You don't know what Ziesha wants!

2279
02:24:37,721 --> 02:24:41,054
Even robots have
more feelings than you!

2280
02:24:41,525 --> 02:24:44,517
That's enough, get out!
- You get out of my way!

2281
02:24:44,595 --> 02:24:45,653
I said get out!
- How dare you

2282
02:24:45,729 --> 02:24:46,787
Karan!

2283
02:24:50,801 --> 02:24:52,962
Zeisha needs rest!

2284
02:24:53,704 --> 02:24:54,762
I promise!

2285
02:24:55,072 --> 02:24:58,599
If Zeisha wants to meet you,
then I won't stop her!

2286
02:24:58,742 --> 02:25:00,141
But I want to meet her!

2287
02:25:00,677 --> 02:25:01,735
But not now!

2288
02:25:02,679 --> 02:25:04,078
Please leave now, son!

2289
02:25:04,815 --> 02:25:06,214
This is not the right time!

2290
02:25:09,620 --> 02:25:10,882
This is not my time!

2291
02:25:13,690 --> 02:25:15,157
That's what I wanted to tell Zeisha!

2292
02:25:41,918 --> 02:25:43,852
Dr. Khanna is in our custody!

2293
02:25:43,987 --> 02:25:45,648
Please identify their clips!
- Show me!

2294
02:25:45,856 --> 02:25:46,914
Beam them!

2295
02:25:50,460 --> 02:25:52,655
Welcome back, Dr. Khanna!

2296
02:25:55,065 --> 02:25:57,465
And we have traced that boy too.

2297
02:25:59,002 --> 02:26:01,470
Pedro, good!

2298
02:26:02,105 --> 02:26:03,800
We have found Dr. Khanna.

2299
02:26:04,474 --> 02:26:07,136
Now track that boy!

2300
02:26:11,148 --> 02:26:12,206
Good evening everyone!

2301
02:26:12,482 --> 02:26:14,006
It was a great
pleasure to have you all here!

2302
02:26:14,151 --> 02:26:15,482
Thank you!

2303
02:26:18,021 --> 02:26:20,546
Couldn't we have avoided
this stupid party, Mana!

2304
02:26:20,891 --> 02:26:22,552
Come on, cheer up! Smile!

2305
02:26:25,028 --> 02:26:27,963
Mr. Oberoi! Your
product launch was a hit!

2306
02:26:28,031 --> 02:26:29,498
- Thank you! Thank you so much.

2307
02:26:29,533 --> 02:26:30,625
Fabulous!

2308
02:26:31,501 --> 02:26:32,525
Zeisha!

2309
02:26:34,504 --> 02:26:35,732
It has been so long, Zeisha!

2310
02:26:36,773 --> 02:26:37,831
I really missed you!

2311
02:26:43,113 --> 02:26:44,171
Just go Karan!

2312
02:26:45,515 --> 02:26:46,641
But why Zeisha?

2313
02:26:50,120 --> 02:26:51,712
Why did you lie to me?

2314
02:26:54,458 --> 02:26:56,050
Mana must have made
you believe that I lied?

2315
02:26:59,863 --> 02:27:01,057
Your ID is fake, isn't it?

2316
02:27:01,131 --> 02:27:02,462
That doesn't matter!

2317
02:27:02,499 --> 02:27:03,591
It matters Karan!

2318
02:27:03,667 --> 02:27:05,862
I love you!
- Yes or no!

2319
02:27:07,070 --> 02:27:10,130
I love you Zeisha!
- Yes or no Karan!

2320
02:27:11,141 --> 02:27:13,871
It's not that easy, Zeisha!
- Yes or no Karan!

2321
02:27:15,479 --> 02:27:16,605
I can explain myself!

2322
02:27:16,680 --> 02:27:17,738
Yes or no Karan!

2323
02:27:17,814 --> 02:27:18,872
Yes!

2324
02:27:21,151 --> 02:27:23,483
Yes! My ID is fake!

2325
02:27:24,488 --> 02:27:25,955
I have lied many times to you!

2326
02:27:26,156 --> 02:27:30,149
But all those lies
lead to one truth, Zeisha!

2327
02:27:32,095 --> 02:27:36,691
But that truth is so strange,
that no one will believe it!

2328
02:27:40,504 --> 02:27:42,096
I don't belong to your world Zeisha!

2329
02:27:43,440 --> 02:27:44,498
I don't belong to your time!

2330
02:27:48,445 --> 02:27:49,707
I have come here from 2008...

2331
02:27:51,782 --> 02:27:53,443
I have time-traveled in the
world's first time machine...

2332
02:27:53,984 --> 02:27:56,646
The first journey, and
that's just because.

2333
02:27:58,054 --> 02:28:00,522
At the other end of time,
I loved a girl very much!

2334
02:28:03,794 --> 02:28:04,852
Sana!

2335
02:28:06,129 --> 02:28:08,461
We promised to spend our
whole life with each other

2336
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:13,458
And then one day...
right in these arms...

2337
02:28:13,503 --> 02:28:17,599
...she broke that promise!

2338
02:28:19,876 --> 02:28:20,934
And came here!

2339
02:28:22,612 --> 02:28:23,670
In this world!

2340
02:28:24,881 --> 02:28:26,815
Time has changed my Sana so much!

2341
02:28:26,883 --> 02:28:27,941
Karan, you are talking rubbish.

2342
02:28:29,753 --> 02:28:32,017
Whether anyone in the
world believes in love or not.

2343
02:28:33,757 --> 02:28:35,691
But lovers meet in every lifetime!

2344
02:28:37,494 --> 02:28:39,018
You will have to
believe it, Sunshine!

2345
02:28:40,964 --> 02:28:42,556
Because, you are my Sana!

2346
02:28:43,633 --> 02:28:44,657
Please Sana!

2347
02:28:45,068 --> 02:28:46,126
Sunshine!

2348
02:28:48,071 --> 02:28:49,902
Just for once, look into my eyes.

2349
02:28:51,441 --> 02:28:53,170
And tell me, don't you
see our love in them!

2350
02:28:54,444 --> 02:28:55,775
You don't see my wait for you.

2351
02:28:57,113 --> 02:29:00,446
Ask your heart, that
if you are not Sana...

2352
02:29:00,517 --> 02:29:05,113
...then why can't you
take your eyes off me?

2353
02:29:07,457 --> 02:29:11,518
Why do you feel, that
there should be no one around...

2354
02:29:12,596 --> 02:29:14,791
...but, just you and me!

2355
02:29:16,867 --> 02:29:18,061
Why do you feel that?

2356
02:29:19,870 --> 02:29:21,963
That you have always
loved me, Sunshine!

2357
02:29:22,939 --> 02:29:23,997
Why?

2358
02:29:24,474 --> 02:29:25,532
Because I love you!

2359
02:29:27,811 --> 02:29:28,869
I love you!

2360
02:29:32,616 --> 02:29:34,140
Great performance!

2361
02:29:34,484 --> 02:29:38,614
Great skit by Karan, and
the ever lovely Zeisha!

2362
02:29:38,688 --> 02:29:40,747
So please put your
hands together for them!

2363
02:29:40,824 --> 02:29:43,691
Everybody! A round
of applause please!

2364
02:29:46,096 --> 02:29:47,563
Come on Zeisha, let's move!

2365
02:29:48,098 --> 02:29:49,156
Zeisha

2366
02:29:50,634 --> 02:29:52,067
Listen to me Zeisha!

2367
02:29:52,669 --> 02:29:54,637
Zeisha, listen to me!
- Leaving so early?

2368
02:29:56,006 --> 02:29:57,769
I want to talk to you!

2369
02:29:58,041 --> 02:29:59,099
Zeisha, listen to me!

2370
02:29:59,442 --> 02:30:00,500
What the hell!

2371
02:30:00,577 --> 02:30:01,635
Zeisha!

2372
02:30:02,445 --> 02:30:03,503
Zeisha!

2373
02:30:05,115 --> 02:30:06,173
Karan!

2374
02:30:09,719 --> 02:30:10,845
Just leave me!

2375
02:30:11,721 --> 02:30:13,586
Just get...

2376
02:30:13,990 --> 02:30:15,048
Zeisha!

2377
02:30:47,824 --> 02:30:50,019
Zeisha, shall we go?

2378
02:30:52,429 --> 02:30:53,487
Yeah.

2379
02:30:59,436 --> 02:31:02,064
Zeisha!

2380
02:31:03,106 --> 02:31:04,505
Hoshi's men.

2381
02:31:05,442 --> 02:31:06,704
Zeisha is leaving!

2382
02:31:06,776 --> 02:31:07,834
Zeisha!

2383
02:31:08,645 --> 02:31:10,169
Come with us to Dr. Hoshi!

2384
02:31:10,447 --> 02:31:11,505
Why?

2385
02:31:11,581 --> 02:31:13,446
Your uncle is waiting for you there!

2386
02:31:13,516 --> 02:31:14,574
What rubbish!

2387
02:31:14,651 --> 02:31:15,777
Zeisha!

2388
02:31:18,455 --> 02:31:20,514
Rahul! Thia! Where are you going?

2389
02:31:20,991 --> 02:31:22,458
We want to talk to our sister!

2390
02:31:23,994 --> 02:31:26,462
Right now Sec C needs us more!

2391
02:31:36,473 --> 02:31:37,531
Oh God!

2392
02:31:44,748 --> 02:31:45,874
Don't worry Sec C!

2393
02:31:46,549 --> 02:31:48,483
That's it! We need him alive!

2394
02:31:48,551 --> 02:31:51,418
Now Dr. Ya will handover the
time machine to Dr. Hoshi!

2395
02:31:55,625 --> 02:31:56,683
Let's go!

2396
02:31:57,427 --> 02:31:58,485
My God!

2397
02:31:58,561 --> 02:32:00,426
Are you fine?

2398
02:32:00,764 --> 02:32:03,426
Karan! Why are
Hoshi's men after you?

2399
02:32:03,633 --> 02:32:04,964
Uncle Ya...
- Karan!

2400
02:32:14,711 --> 02:32:18,647
'You know diary, Winkydinks says
that Karan had come to the station. '

2401
02:32:19,449 --> 02:32:20,973
'But why doesn't my heart agree? '

2402
02:32:22,652 --> 02:32:25,644
'Once! Just once, I
want to meet him. '

2403
02:32:27,457 --> 02:32:30,449
'I will just ask,
Karan are you fine? '

2404
02:32:30,727 --> 02:32:32,456
'Do you miss me?

2405
02:32:39,002 --> 02:32:41,470
Don't waste my time!

2406
02:32:41,504 --> 02:32:42,596
Where is it?

2407
02:32:42,672 --> 02:32:43,730
I won't tell you!

2408
02:32:43,807 --> 02:32:44,865
What will you do?

2409
02:32:44,941 --> 02:32:45,999
You will torture me!

2410
02:32:46,476 --> 02:32:49,070
What can be a bigger
torture than seeing your face!

2411
02:32:49,746 --> 02:32:52,476
Have you seen your face
in the mirror? It's awful!

2412
02:32:53,149 --> 02:32:54,878
You can give me shocks
as much as you want.

2413
02:32:54,951 --> 02:32:56,816
And I am not talking
about the electric shocks.

2414
02:32:56,886 --> 02:32:57,944
Just look, how my
hair has stood up due...

2415
02:32:58,021 --> 02:32:59,488
...all the electric shocks in my lab!

2416
02:33:08,098 --> 02:33:09,531
He won't tell us like this?

2417
02:33:09,733 --> 02:33:11,496
Bring Karan!

2418
02:33:11,534 --> 02:33:12,592
Get him!

2419
02:33:12,902 --> 02:33:14,494
With my hacking...

2420
02:33:14,537 --> 02:33:16,835
...I will show you such a way, that
will take you directly to uncle Ya!

2421
02:33:17,107 --> 02:33:18,165
How is that?

2422
02:33:18,508 --> 02:33:20,032
With Uncle Ya's ID!

2423
02:33:20,176 --> 02:33:22,110
Remember Q. T! I had embedded it!

2424
02:33:22,512 --> 02:33:23,979
And I already tracked it!

2425
02:33:24,047 --> 02:33:25,241
Dhinchak, we don't have much time!

2426
02:33:25,515 --> 02:33:27,039
The time machine
will leave on its own.

2427
02:33:27,517 --> 02:33:30,577
With or without us.

2428
02:33:30,653 --> 02:33:31,711
No problem!

2429
02:33:31,788 --> 02:33:34,780
This is the shortcut
to reach to uncle Ya!

2430
02:33:52,742 --> 02:33:53,800
Karan!

2431
02:33:54,077 --> 02:33:56,068
Karan! I had told you he will come!

2432
02:33:57,947 --> 02:33:59,005
Why are you hitting him?

2433
02:33:59,215 --> 02:34:00,546
What the hell do you want?

2434
02:34:00,617 --> 02:34:02,812
You know what Dr. Hoshi wants!

2435
02:34:05,688 --> 02:34:07,485
Or else we will kill him!

2436
02:34:07,557 --> 02:34:08,615
Stop!

2437
02:34:10,760 --> 02:34:11,818
Stop!

2438
02:34:14,030 --> 02:34:15,622
I will tell you where
the time machine is!

2439
02:34:17,734 --> 02:34:20,931
Off Marine Drive!
Hoshi Park! Section T!

2440
02:34:23,840 --> 02:34:25,637
Dr. Khanna...

2441
02:34:26,242 --> 02:34:29,177
Intruder alert! Intruder alert!

2442
02:34:33,917 --> 02:34:34,975
Karan!

2443
02:34:35,051 --> 02:34:36,109
I am Karan!

2444
02:34:38,922 --> 02:34:42,858
My little baby, he is confused!

2445
02:34:48,598 --> 02:34:50,657
The poor android!

2446
02:35:01,077 --> 02:35:05,810
ZXPD 450, waiting
for your orders, sir!

2447
02:35:06,149 --> 02:35:08,481
That face, is your target!

2448
02:35:09,152 --> 02:35:13,020
Scan it! Search it! Destroy it!

2449
02:35:32,508 --> 02:35:36,035
ZXPD 450 come on, hurry up!

2450
02:35:46,456 --> 02:35:47,650
Uncle Ya!

2451
02:36:37,040 --> 02:36:38,098
Uncle Ya, you okay?

2452
02:36:38,574 --> 02:36:40,508
Karan, why did you come back?

2453
02:36:40,576 --> 02:36:41,634
Come back, I just arrived!

2454
02:36:47,650 --> 02:36:50,642
Machine 7. Lift no. 3. Go!

2455
02:36:52,789 --> 02:36:53,847
Come on, lets go.

2456
02:36:56,592 --> 02:36:58,059
Karan!
- Uncle Ya, take Rahul and Thia...

2457
02:37:00,196 --> 02:37:02,687
Target locked, attack and kill!

2458
02:37:02,799 --> 02:37:03,857
Damn you!

2459
02:37:03,900 --> 02:37:05,458
Block all the exits!

2460
02:37:05,702 --> 02:37:06,964
Get me Dr. Khanna!

2461
02:37:41,504 --> 02:37:42,630
Q. T! Come in, Q. T!

2462
02:37:42,905 --> 02:37:44,099
Q. T! Q. T, where are you?

2463
02:37:44,440 --> 02:37:45,498
Stay there, I am coming!

2464
02:38:22,745 --> 02:38:25,077
I am sorry sir! We
couldn't find the time machine!

2465
02:38:26,082 --> 02:38:27,947
Dr. Khanna!

2466
02:39:49,966 --> 02:39:54,528
I will take care of Dr.
Khanna and the time machine.

2467
02:39:57,440 --> 02:39:59,567
But you... are dead!

2468
02:41:49,952 --> 02:41:52,682
Zebelle! Look at what Q. T gave me!

2469
02:41:52,755 --> 02:41:53,949
It's so cute!

2470
02:41:55,424 --> 02:41:57,085
Winkydinks, do you
want to kiss Karan?

2471
02:41:57,159 --> 02:41:58,558
Yes!

2472
02:42:02,865 --> 02:42:04,765
Come on kids, hurry up!

2473
02:42:05,434 --> 02:42:06,924
But uncle...

2474
02:42:07,937 --> 02:42:10,098
Brother Karan...

2475
02:42:10,906 --> 02:42:13,101
Maybe he has gone to pick up Zeisha!

2476
02:42:13,442 --> 02:42:15,103
But what if he doesn't return?

2477
02:42:19,849 --> 02:42:24,445
Track Karan's air bike, he
will lead us to the time machine!

2478
02:42:26,589 --> 02:42:30,116
'Karan, are you sure you
don't want ice cream? - No. '

2479
02:42:31,060 --> 02:42:33,051
'I won't share my ice cream. '

2480
02:42:33,129 --> 02:42:36,496
'We are going to share our entire
life, who cares about an ice cream! '

2481
02:42:36,666 --> 02:42:37,690
'Come on! '

2482
02:43:10,533 --> 02:43:11,625
Zeisha!

2483
02:43:22,178 --> 02:43:27,582
I had come to
change my fate in time.

2484
02:43:30,519 --> 02:43:33,716
But maybe, my
efforts weren't enough!

2485
02:43:35,057 --> 02:43:37,252
You don't even want to turn
around and look at me, Zeisha!

2486
02:43:42,698 --> 02:43:44,063
I have troubled you a lot, isn't it?

2487
02:43:46,469 --> 02:43:47,493
But what can I do, Zeisha!

2488
02:43:53,609 --> 02:43:54,735
For the last time!

2489
02:43:56,746 --> 02:43:58,611
Let me see you for the last time!

2490
02:43:58,748 --> 02:43:59,806
Just one last time.

2491
02:44:03,552 --> 02:44:04,746
I am going away, Zeisha!

2492
02:44:06,222 --> 02:44:08,622
So far away...
- Don't go far away Karan!

2493
02:44:16,499 --> 02:44:20,128
Because, there is
someone who will miss you!

2494
02:44:23,639 --> 02:44:24,765
Will miss you a lot!

2495
02:44:27,042 --> 02:44:28,100
Zeisha!

2496
02:44:28,844 --> 02:44:29,902
Sana!

2497
02:44:42,992 --> 02:44:44,584
Don't leave me behind, Karan!

2498
02:44:46,729 --> 02:44:51,063
We still we have one
ice cream left to share.

2499
02:44:51,100 --> 02:44:52,192
Yeah!

2500
02:44:53,702 --> 02:44:55,897
A kiss from my cold lips.

2501
02:44:58,474 --> 02:44:59,998
And our entire life!

2502
02:45:01,143 --> 02:45:04,135
Sunshine! Sana!

2503
02:45:11,754 --> 02:45:12,812
Let's go!

2504
02:45:20,496 --> 02:45:21,554
Follow him!

2505
02:45:21,630 --> 02:45:23,621
He will lead us to the time machine!

2506
02:45:29,505 --> 02:45:30,699
We have only 9 minutes left!

2507
02:45:39,648 --> 02:45:41,513
We've traced the time machine.

2508
02:45:41,584 --> 02:45:42,573
Kill Karan!

2509
02:45:42,651 --> 02:45:44,448
Then the time machine is ours.
- Yes, sir.

2510
02:45:49,124 --> 02:45:50,182
Karan!

2511
02:46:04,540 --> 02:46:05,802
Robot, you get him.

2512
02:46:06,609 --> 02:46:07,667
Yes, sir.

2513
02:46:11,614 --> 02:46:12,672
Oh no!

2514
02:46:24,960 --> 02:46:26,894
Q. T how much time do we have?

2515
02:46:26,962 --> 02:46:28,088
3 minutes.
- Damn!

2516
02:46:38,707 --> 02:46:39,765
Careful!

2517
02:46:47,516 --> 02:46:49,040
Hold me! We have to jump!

2518
02:46:50,986 --> 02:46:53,113
Now! Jump!

2519
02:47:05,601 --> 02:47:07,068
Only 90 second left!

2520
02:47:43,439 --> 02:47:46,033
Bye-bye 2050!

2521
02:47:46,108 --> 02:47:48,440
See you later!

2522
02:47:51,447 --> 02:47:52,505
Yeah!

2523
02:47:52,581 --> 02:47:54,446
Karan, Zeisha! Finally!

2524
02:47:54,516 --> 02:47:56,040
Come on, let's go! C'mon Sec C!

2525
02:47:56,185 --> 02:47:58,119
Q. T!
- 4...

2526
02:48:03,125 --> 02:48:06,458
3... 2... 1...

2527
02:48:24,146 --> 02:48:25,204
Q. T!

2528
02:48:25,814 --> 02:48:28,476
Welcome to the future!

2529
02:48:30,486 --> 02:48:31,544
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

2530
02:48:31,620 --> 02:48:34,953
Can anybody watch a
movie without popcorn!

2531
02:48:35,024 --> 02:48:36,082
Wow!

2532
02:48:36,158 --> 02:48:37,489
Stop it!

2533
02:48:46,635 --> 02:48:48,728
Look at this!

2534
02:48:57,046 --> 02:48:58,104
Thank you God!

2535
02:48:59,448 --> 02:49:00,915
You brought my daughter back!

2536
02:49:06,855 --> 02:49:08,516
Only her hair has changed to red.

2537
02:49:09,591 --> 02:49:10,717
But what difference does it make?

2538
02:49:10,859 --> 02:49:12,451
She is my Sana!

2539
02:49:12,594 --> 02:49:14,721
You are very good, too much!

2540
02:49:14,797 --> 02:49:15,855
Just like me!

2541
02:49:16,465 --> 02:49:18,899
Pundit cum scientist, I
am very angry with you!

2542
02:49:19,001 --> 02:49:20,059
Ask why?
- Why?

2543
02:49:20,102 --> 02:49:22,593
When you left, why
didn't you take me along?

2544
02:49:22,871 --> 02:49:24,463
Then come on, let's go
in the time machine!

2545
02:49:24,540 --> 02:49:25,598
Where?

2546
02:49:25,674 --> 02:49:28,541
In the time, where you
were Anarkali and I was Salim!

2547
02:49:28,744 --> 02:49:29,802
Forget it!

2548
02:49:29,878 --> 02:49:31,937
Sana's papa will not spare you!

2549
02:49:33,615 --> 02:49:36,015
I will, but I will
die with happiness!

2550
02:49:37,486 --> 02:49:39,010
I will get so much
freedom once she leaves.

2551
02:49:39,088 --> 02:49:40,680
You are just...

2552
02:49:40,956 --> 02:49:44,756
Listen, now it's time for the
children to be happy! - Why?

2553
02:49:45,694 --> 02:49:46,752
For what?

2554
02:49:46,829 --> 02:49:47,955
Try to understand!
- What?

2555
02:49:48,030 --> 02:49:49,088
Sunshine!

2556
02:49:49,631 --> 02:49:50,655
What say!

2557
02:49:53,435 --> 02:49:54,527
I hardly even know you!

2558
02:49:57,506 --> 02:50:01,772
Well, Karan Malhotra,
age 23 from Sydney! - Okay.

2559
02:50:01,844 --> 02:50:03,436
Current status single.

2560
02:50:07,583 --> 02:50:08,641
And waiting!

2561
02:50:11,453 --> 02:50:12,647
Say yes! Say yes!

2562
02:50:13,789 --> 02:50:15,518
Come on Karan, come on!

2563
02:50:15,657 --> 02:50:16,715
Yes!
