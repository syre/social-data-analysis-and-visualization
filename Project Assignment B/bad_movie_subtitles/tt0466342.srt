1
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:59,951
Idiot. Hell, no, I won't marry you. Gosh!

2
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,255
What would you do if you
were in a situation like this?

3
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:05,297
Gosh! Gosh! Gosh!

4
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,389
Gosh!

5
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:33,355
Dear diary, I had that nightmare again.

6
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,325
I fear I'll never get married.

7
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:41,760
Maybe I am destined to be
a sad old spinster...

8
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:44,666
whose only companionship
comes from an absurd amount of cats.

9
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,584
No, that won't be me.

10
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:05,749
I believe in true love.

11
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,726
My knight in shining armor
is out there somewhere...

12
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:11,023
and I'm gonna find him.

13
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,925
Ooh. Mmm.

14
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:43,115
Oh, shit.

15
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,598
<i>Ow.</i>

16
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:47,578
<i>Ow.</i>

17
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:05,867
- <i>Opah!</i>
- Hi, Dad.

18
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:09,408
<i> Look here, Julia.</i>
<i>When you gonna find a man and get married?</i>

19
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,444
<i>You lookin' old, fat and saggy.</i>

20
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:18,049
And that mole on your forearm,
it's growing a mole.

21
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,951
Let's put some hummus on it.
It cures everything.

22
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,551
Baby, you gotta find a man.

23
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,991
In our race to protect
our Greek heritage-

24
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:32,189
Yes, yes, yes.
And my heritage too.

25
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:35,233
<i>Let us not forget</i>
<i>you are also one-half Indian.</i>

26
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:40,602
- Your mother's right.
- Big sister, we also Japanese.

27
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,834
- And Jewish.
- So you're telling me...

28
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:46,901
I have to marry a guy
who's a Greek Indian Japanese Jew?

29
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,573
Baby, you're actin' like that's hard to find.
Look around.

30
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,479
They everywhere.

31
00:05:56,089 --> 00:06:00,253
Nicky. Nicky!
You're Greek, right?

32
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,922
Yeah. And Indian
and Japanese and a Jew.

33
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,761
Huh? You wanna
go out with my daughter?

34
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:11,428
<i>Nah. I don't like redheads.</i>
<i>Sorry.</i>

35
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:21,336
Dad, I know I'm no beauty,
but I'm not gonna settle.

36
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:26,248
<i>I respect our heritage,</i>
<i>but I believe love is blind.</i>

37
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:30,118
Somewhere out there is my true love.

38
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,292
<i>No! Back to work.</i>

39
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:38,353
<i>Coffee?</i>

40
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,100
- More coffee?
- Excellent.

41
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:46,262
Jolly good.
I quite fancy some...

42
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:53,278
more coffee, actually.

43
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,776
<i>Pick up.</i>

44
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:02,218
- Pick up! Pick up!
- Okay.

45
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:05,290
- Pick up!
- I'm coming.

46
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,252
Oh, hell, no!

47
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:48,060
- You're Hitch?
- You got a problem with that?

48
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:51,034
<i>Please, I'm desperate.</i>

49
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:55,130
Even I can't help you,
and I found Star Jones a husband.

50
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:04,048
Aw, shit.
Come on in.

51
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,551
Thanks for seeing me.
I heard you're the best.

52
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:11,987
You're goddamn right I'm the best.
Look at all the couples I'm responsible for.

53
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:14,355
You got Brad and Jen...

54
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,054
<i>Jessica and Nick,</i>
<i>Ben and Gwyn...</i>

55
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,654
<i>Ben and Jen, Ben and Jen...</i>

56
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:22,165
<i>Ben and Matt,</i>
<i>Whitney and Bobby...</i>

57
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:24,998
<i>Kobe and Shaq,</i>
<i>Ellen and Anne.</i>

58
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:27,538
Yeah, I do them too.

59
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,473
Well, there's this guy
at the diner where I work.

60
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:34,637
- We had this... moment.
- What happened?

61
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:38,308
I turned around, and he was gone.

62
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:42,217
He probably got a good look
at your mug and ran.

63
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:46,985
Why don't we broaden the search
from that one guy to just any nigga?

64
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:50,085
- Okay.
- Eight out of ten guys believe...

65
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:53,359
<i>the first kiss will tell them everything</i>
<i>they need to know about a relationship.</i>

66
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:56,867
<i>So before we get started,</i>
<i>let's see what you got.</i>

67
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:08,079
Ooh, stinky. You got the dragon.

68
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,952
You got a little somethin' in there.

69
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,566
A whole wing?

70
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:35,068
Extra crispy? Goddamn!

71
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:59,123
<i>Good gracious!</i>

72
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,794
Off of me, trick!

73
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:05,268
What, are you hungry?

74
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:13,507
I'm hopeless.

75
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:18,773
<i>I'm never gonna meet</i>
<i>my Prince Charming.</i>

76
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:21,751
I got it!

77
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:28,126
A reality dating show?

78
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,821
Says here you can meet
the man of your dreams.

79
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,694
It also says you have to be beautiful.

80
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,826
Well, you're beautiful-ish.

81
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,802
Oh, come on, Hitch.

82
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:44,638
The only way I could get on that show
is if you magically turn me into a princess.

83
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:48,060
Let's roll.

84
00:10:48,095 --> 00:10:49,008
Let's roll.

85
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,149
Yo, fellas!

86
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,227
Time to pimp her out.

87
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:40,559
Mm-mm-mm.

88
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,189
Oh.

89
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,727
Hey! Hey!

90
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,377
Yeah!

91
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:06,447
<i>Whoa!</i>
<i>You're officially pimped out.</i>

92
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:15,455
All right, girl.
Now you're good to go.

93
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:24,296
Ladies, good evening,
and welcome to...

94
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:27,372
<i>The Extreme Bachelor:</i>
<i>Desperate Edition.</i>

95
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:31,603
<i>By the end of tonight's episode,</i>
<i>one of you lucky ladies...</i>

96
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:35,908
will be chosen by the bachelor
to go on a dream date.

97
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,983
<i>- So let's meet him.</i>

98
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:42,019
He's a doctor with a 12-inch cock.

99
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:47,684
<i>Ladies, may I introduce the bachelor.</i>

100
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:00,936
- Hi. Lovely to meet you.
- Hi.

101
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,871
- Hello. I'm Grant. Hi.
- Hi.

102
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,466
<i>- I'm Grant.</i>
<i>- Hi, Grant.</i>

103
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,409
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>

104
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:13,746
- I'm Julia.
- Pleasure.

105
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:18,547
Now, Grant, the elimination round.

106
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:22,184
<i>Essentially nixing the girls</i>
<i>you don't want to bang.</i>

107
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:24,387
<i>Who's going to be eliminated?</i>

108
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:45,272
Nice aim, Grant.
Good eye.

109
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:02,300
- Julia, will you accept this rose?
- Yes.

110
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,561
Guys, congratulations.

111
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:37,068
You have won a dinner for two
at A Restaurant.

112
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:39,660
A Restaurant!

113
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:44,736
Thanks!

114
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:51,315
Oh, yeah, that's it!

115
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,317
Oh, God!

116
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:58,387
Oh, yeah!

117
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:02,688
Yeah! Yeah.

118
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,754
Yes! Yes!

119
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:08,799
Yes!

120
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,835
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

121
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:14,428
Oh, yes! Oh, yeah!

122
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,100
Yes! Yes! Yes!

123
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:21,703
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes! Yes!

124
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:26,046
Yes! Yes! Yes!

125
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:33,849
<i>Yes! Yes! Y-Yes!</i>

126
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:45,526
Oh, God. Whoo! God.

127
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:49,004
- So you're saying you <i>do</i> want the pork chops?
- Yes, please.

128
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,599
<i>- Okay.</i>
- I'll have what he's having.

129
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,905
So, tell me about you.

130
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,504
Oh, I'm just a waitress.

131
00:16:56,615 --> 00:17:00,574
But I- I want to go to school
to be a pastry chef.

132
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,246
Oh, hi.
My name is Julia Jones.

133
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:07,485
And for my admissions essay,
I'm gonna show all of you at Harvard...

134
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:11,552
why I would make
an amazing pastry chef.

135
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,803
What a coincidence.

136
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:22,840
I love pie. I've got to take you
downtown for the best-

137
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:25,603
- Hummus pie?
- You've been there?

138
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:29,406
That's actually my recipe.

139
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:32,348
<i>But</i>-
<i>But tell me more about you.</i>

140
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:36,353
Like, what's your favorite love song?

141
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,186
- It's kind of corny.
- Oh, come on.

142
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:03,271
You're that waitress.
You've changed.

143
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:07,284
Well, I- I was- I was sort of goin' through-
through a phase.

144
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:12,388
I was downright ugly.

145
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:15,425
I don't remember you ever being ugly.

146
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,125
But I remember you.

147
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:32,368
I can't explain it, but...

148
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:36,175
when I'm with you,
I just feel so alive.

149
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:41,981
- Me too.
- I just wanna scream and shout and-

150
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:45,113
- Roll drunks?
- Huh?

151
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,622
Uh, Julia?

152
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,993
Come on!

153
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:38,807
<i>Yes! Yes!</i>

154
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:41,038
<i>Yes!</i>

155
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:43,114
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

156
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:51,846
- That was... amazing.
<i>- It sure was.</i>

157
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:03,263
<i>She faked it, Grant.</i>

158
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:06,827
But I didn't.

159
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,041
Meow.

160
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,611
<i>Meow.</i>

161
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,641
Oh, no, no, no, no...

162
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,082
<i>no, no...</i>

163
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,154
<i>no, no, no...</i>

164
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,952
<i>no, no, no, no, no!</i>

165
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:04,495
No! No!

166
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,564
Ooh.

167
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,177
Hoo. It's tingly.

168
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:24,079
<i>Grant, how would you feel</i>
<i>about meeting my parents?</i>

169
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:55,178
- So, Grant, ever knock anyone up?
- Mom!

170
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,807
<i>I want many grandkids, and how do I</i>
<i>know if he’s shooting blanks or not?</i>

171
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:05,787
Bathroom's down the hall.

172
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,564
Just leave the sample on the counter.

173
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:35,552
Oh, sorry.

174
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:41,524
That's Jinxers.

175
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,555
Taught him how to do that.

176
00:23:58,036 --> 00:24:00,334
Julia told me your last name.

177
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,067
- How do you pronounce it?
- Just how it's spelled.

178
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:08,110
F-O-C-K-Y-E-R-D-O-D-E-R.

179
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:11,478
- Fockyerdoder?
- Mmm.

180
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:14,780
Mm-hmm.

181
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:17,582
Allergic to cats?

182
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:20,317
Uh, no, no.
I-I-I love cats.

183
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:24,418
<i>In fact, growing up on a farm,</i>
<i>I once milked a cat.</i>

184
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:29,765
I got nipples, Grant.
Can you milk me?

185
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:40,600
May I say that's an exquisite vase.
Ancient artifact, I presume.

186
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:46,378
That's actually an urn containing
the remains of Frank's mother.

187
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:49,215
<i>- Well, I'm sure your mother...</i>

188
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:53,348
would want to celebrate that
Julia finally applied to pastry school.

189
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:56,950
- What? School?
- Don't you want me to better myself?

190
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:59,587
No! I want you to work
at the diner until you die.

191
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:01,928
Grant was just kidding.
Right, Grant?

192
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:06,360
No!

193
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:09,634
<i>No, no, no, no, no!</i>

194
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:14,442
Mama!

195
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:16,480
<i>- Mama!</i>
<i>- Grandma!</i>

196
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:20,017
Jinxers. Jinxers, no.

197
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:23,053
Oh! Grandma Jones! Oh, God!

198
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:25,588
- No! Jinxers, stop it!
- Hey!

199
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,158
<i>Jinxers! Jinxers, no!</i>

200
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,160
<i>Oh, no, no, Jinxers! No!</i>

201
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:32,730
<i>- Jinxers, no! No!</i>
<i>- Mama!</i>

202
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:36,062
- Oh!
- Get off my mama! Stop humpin'!

203
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:38,067
<i>Bad kitty! Please!</i>

204
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:40,399
- Jinxers, no!
- Oh!

205
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:44,032
- I didn't teach him how to do that.
<i>- Jinxers, bad cat!</i>

206
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:47,009
Jinxers, no!

207
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:49,307
<i>- Mama!</i>

208
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:53,611
- That was a disaster.
- It wasn't that bad.

209
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:58,121
You desecrated my grandmother's remains,
and my father hates you.

210
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,384
Why didn't you tell your parents
about pastry school?

211
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:03,120
I'm working my way up to it.

212
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:06,629
- I'm just waiting for the right time.
- Julia, you're a grown woman.

213
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:11,566
If you haven't noticed,
my family is totally controlling.

214
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,969
- Whoo!
- They meddle in every aspect of my life.

215
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,973
Not to mention,
no one in our family...

216
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:20,533
- has ever dated outside of our culture.
- He reminds me of Webster.

217
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:24,638
I just don't see how this
could work between us.

218
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:28,378
Look, so your family's difficult.
Whose isn't?

219
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:31,455
Until I met you, my life was boring.

220
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:34,286
- Oww!
- But you, you're smart...

221
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:39,125
and interesting and beautiful.

222
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:41,755
<i>I just want to be with you.</i>

223
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:45,469
Did you say I was beautiful?

224
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:49,330
- Come with me.
- Ooh-hoo!

225
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,966
It's just a little Jesus juice!
Whoo!

226
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:53,977
Where are you taking me?

227
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:56,047
- What are we-
- You'll see.

228
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:15,329
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

229
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:20,298
Oh, my God.

230
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:24,774
Julia Jones, will you marry me?

231
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:29,771
Yes, Grant Fockyerdoder,
I will marry you.

232
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:43,988
How much will you give me for this?

233
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:46,086
No. No!

234
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:55,231
- Fifty bucks.
- Shit. That's it?

235
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:01,340
But it will destroy all evil!

236
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:03,971
Oh, screw off, wizard!

237
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:12,055
- Come on. Let's go get some wine coolers.
- And some hookers.

238
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:19,119
My precious!

239
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:30,440
Before you set the wedding date,
I wanted to meet your parents...

240
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:35,002
because, frankly, Fockyerdoder,
I don't know much about you.

241
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:40,112
I understand, homeboy.

242
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:49,121
I'll be watching you.

243
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,627
If you do anything
to corrupt my daughter-

244
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,198
You'll bring me down
to Chinatown?

245
00:28:54,299 --> 00:29:00,238
Chinatown?
I'll take your bitch ass to 134th Street...

246
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:02,898
bust you in the head with a pipe.

247
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:08,905
Hi, Little Jack.

248
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:10,913
How come you have Betty's baby?

249
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:14,314
She's at a swingers convention this weekend,
so we said we'd take care of him.

250
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,820
- Oh, how nice.
- And Betty's such a good mother.

251
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,049
She's teaching Little Jack
sign language.

252
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:24,686
Oh, I heard about this.
Real cutting-edge stuff.

253
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:37,741
That's right, Little Jack.
"Keep your pimp hand strong."

254
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:48,410
Right!
"The dealer pinched."

255
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:56,485
"What happens when someone
rats us out to the cops?"

256
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:02,295
"Shiv 'em in the kidney."

257
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:08,330
- "Beotch."
- His first word!

258
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:11,670
- Little Jack, what did you say?
- "Beotch."

259
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,985
Is that your dad?

260
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:32,955
- Uh-huh.
- Figures.

261
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:49,473
Ha!

262
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:54,143
<i>Grant! Ha! My boy!</i>

263
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:57,744
Good to see ya.

264
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,984
This is my fiancée Julia,
and her parents, Linda and Frank.

265
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:03,822
Bernie Fockyerdoder.
Pleased to meet all of ya.

266
00:31:03,928 --> 00:31:08,365
Frank, give me some sugar.
Put her there!

267
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:11,367
- All right, all right.
- And this must be your little girl.

268
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:15,803
- No, that's my wife.
- Wife? So young, so pretty.

269
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:19,274
And you must be Julia.
What a beautiful moment this is.

270
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:22,005
So beautiful.
Just beautiful.

271
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:24,445
- Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!
- Oh!

272
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,517
- Dad. Dad.
- Mmm! Mmm!

273
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:30,520
- What? We're all family now.
<i>- I'll just go get the luggage.</i>

274
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:32,590
So what was that
you were doin' back there?

275
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:35,352
Oh, I was just practicing capoeira.

276
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,587
- Capo-what?
- Capoeira...

277
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:39,788
the Brazilian martial art
of dance fighting.

278
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,799
- Beotch.
- I've been doing it for weeks.

279
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,801
It keeps me level.

280
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,531
Ah!

281
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:49,630
Come on.
Let's go meet Roz.

282
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:53,507
Roz!

283
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:57,775
You're gonna love her.
Everybody, this is Roz.

284
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,383
Oh! I've been <i>kvelling</i> to meet...

285
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:06,821
this meshuggener goyim shiksa all day!

286
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,587
Oh!

287
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,428
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

288
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:16,591
So, Grant tells me
you're a doctor.

289
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:18,726
Uh, I'm a sex therapist.

290
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:20,929
I specialize in teenage impotency.

291
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,666
- Who's thirsty?
- Mom, no.

292
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:29,338
Oh, Grantulla's just embarrassed because
he lost his virginity to the housekeeper.

293
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:39,515
Hey, Eduardo.

294
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,679
<i>Thanks, Eduardo.</i>

295
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:08,718
Ah!

296
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,220
So, is it Harry?

297
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,517
- Is what hairy?
- Your name.

298
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:16,559
- No, no, it's Bernie.
- Oh, no, but it is hairy.

299
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:19,630
- What are you talking about?
- I mean, picture this with four pounds of hair.

300
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:23,690
<i>Oh, stop.</i>
<i>So, when's the big date?</i>

301
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:26,031
Well, we wanted a long engagement...

302
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:28,469
<i>so we're getting married this Sunday.</i>

303
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:30,632
Oh, hell, no.
I'm not paying for that wedding.

304
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:34,200
Aw, don't have a conniption, <i>bubbellah.</i>
We'll pay for it.

305
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:37,406
<i>Of course! What?</i>
<i>I got a great wedding planner.</i>

306
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:40,177
You'll meet her tomorrow morning.
Let's have a toast.

307
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:45,688
- To great big matzo balls! <i>L 'Chaim!</i>
- <i>L 'Chaim.</i>

308
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:49,248
I- I couldn't be happier.

309
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,885
Thanks, Dad.

310
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:54,055
Because Nicky
has agreed to marry you.

311
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:08,979
- Nicky.
- Yeah. Good job.

312
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,844
Lookin' good. Nice.

313
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:14,076
- Dad?
- Hmm?

314
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:18,144
My whole life, I've had this dream...

315
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:20,850
that a prince would someday
come and rescue me.

316
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,253
Grant is that guy.

317
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:29,231
He's my prince,
and he's the one I'm gonna marry.

318
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:31,426
No, you'll never marry Grant.

319
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:35,700
<i>I don't trust him.</i>
<i>You'll marry Nicky.</i>

320
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:39,402
<i>Thinkin' about the honeymoon</i>
<i>makes my sac all quivery and shit.</i>

321
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:50,980
Wow. You seem tense.

322
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,957
- When was the last time
you and Frank were intimate?
- It's been a while.

323
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:01,060
Whoo! It sure has.

324
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:05,898
Well, I could show you a few tricks,
spice things up again.

325
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:09,564
- Like what?
- Like a dirty Sanchez.

326
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:12,108
Like a-

327
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,178
Oh, I don't know.

328
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,940
- Or the Arabian goggles.
- Ohh!

329
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:19,608
<i>Or what about a troll's foot?</i>

330
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:22,618
Where you don't clip your toenails
for eight weeks...

331
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,280
and then you jab it up his ass!

332
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:27,653
Or a Mexican blowtorch...

333
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:31,524
where you take a cotton swab, you dip it
in alcohol, put it on the top of his dick...

334
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,529
and then you light it on fire.

335
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,861
Is that all you got, Fockyerdoder?

336
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,834
Hold on.

337
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:43,636
- How do you think it's going?
- I think it's going really well.

338
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:46,608
- You do?
- Yeah. Everyone's getting along famously.

339
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,611
Even our dads are hitting it off.

340
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:52,547
- You might want to put your shirt back on.
- Nah.

341
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:16,863
Oh, man.

342
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:34,148
The wedding planner will see you now.

343
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:44,229
I'm Jell-O. Fockyerdoder?
Please, have a seat.

344
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:52,201
<i>Now, I'm here to plan</i>
<i>your dream wedding.</i>

345
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,801
<i>So, tell me what you want.</i>

346
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:57,642
Well, uh, we want
a traditional wedding.

347
00:36:57,748 --> 00:37:00,239
Something simple, yet elegant.

348
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:02,444
Yo, I know exactly the place.

349
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,953
Muy romántico.

350
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,422
Think outside my buns.

351
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:11,291
It's... not quite
what we had in mind.

352
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,386
That's the best I can do
on short notice.

353
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:17,593
<i>You got to book the caterer,</i>
<i>pick a piñata, choose your best man.</i>

354
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:19,602
Oh, I've already taken care of that.

355
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:22,468
- My best mate Andy flew in this morning.
- Andy?

356
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,541
Yeah, we'll meet up at the hotel later.

357
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:28,635
- I think you two will hit it off tremendously.
- I can't wait.

358
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,613
And I can't wait till you see
who I booked for the entertainment.

359
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:48,828
No!

360
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,641
So, where is this best man of yours?

361
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:02,679
Andy!

362
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:13,949
Andy's not a guy?

363
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:16,026
A guy?
Heavens, no.

364
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:38,638
It's great we've remained so close,
even after the engagement fell through.

365
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:42,319
You two were engaged?

366
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:55,156
Ages ago. It was more physical
than anything, really.

367
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,466
Just constant...

368
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:04,405
<i>mind-blowing, porno-grade sex.</i>

369
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:09,143
Sex.

370
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:10,975
<i>- It's easy to see</i>
<i>- Sex.</i>

371
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,513
<i>Sex, sex, sex...</i>

372
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:17,018
<i>sex, sex, sex...</i>

373
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:19,919
<i>sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex,</i>
<i>sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex.</i>

374
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:30,600
S-So, you realized
it- it just wasn't right?

375
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:33,363
Well, she realized it wasn't right.

376
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:37,373
She dumped me.
Just wasn't ready to settle down.

377
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:09,305
Why is she in slow motion?

378
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:14,140
- She likes to make an entrance.
<i>- Grant!</i>

379
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:23,651
Oh!

380
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:26,120
This is Julia.
Mmm!

381
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:33,489
Oh, I have heard
so much about you.

382
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:36,657
Now, Grant told me
how attractive you were...

383
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,634
<i>but he never mentioned</i>
<i>you were flat-chested.</i>

384
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:42,797
How cute.

385
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:58,112
Excuse me while I get out
of these wet clothes.

386
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:18,004
- So, how did you two meet?
- We were in Beverly Hills.

387
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:59,844
I'll give you two grand
if I can fuck you in the ass.

388
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:02,544
- Sounds quite reasonable.
<i>- Okay, this is just too weird.</i>

389
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:05,087
<i>Can we dissolve back now?</i>

390
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:07,248
And so, eventually, you got engaged...

391
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,292
and then you broke up ages ago.

392
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:13,056
<i>Sure, if you call three weeks</i>
<i>ages ago.</i>

393
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,894
You were engaged to her
three weeks ago?

394
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,435
<i>Honestly, Julia...</i>

395
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,664
you have nothing
to be jealous about.

396
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:26,903
<i>Just because I see Grant with another woman</i>
<i>doesn't mean I want him back.</i>

397
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:43,824
Finger sandwich?

398
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:45,595
Okay, I'll go first.

399
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:47,262
Okay, I'll go first.

400
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:50,356
Let me say we don't
really need to be here.

401
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:53,925
- See, we've been dating for five days-
- Six.

402
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:58,873
Five, six days,
and this is like a checkup for us.

403
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:01,911
There's this huge space between us...

404
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:05,743
<i>and it keeps getting</i>
<i>bigger and bigger.</i>

405
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:10,443
<i>How honest are you with him?</i>

406
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:13,387
Pretty honest.

407
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:16,425
I mean, it's not like
I lie to him or anything.

408
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:19,990
<i>I just, uh</i>-

409
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:23,999
I mean, I-I have little secrets.

410
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:26,262
Everyone has secrets.

411
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:30,103
I have hepatitis "C."

412
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,473
<i>How does that make you feel?</i>

413
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:42,477
I'm not sure, really.

414
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:47,655
Let me clarify.
I love Julia.

415
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:51,990
I... want her to be happy.

416
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:55,532
I want good things for her.

417
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,430
But there are times-

418
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:18,251
You know, when she's sleeping,
just take a pillow and-

419
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,869
<i>Thanks for helping me pick out my dress.</i>

420
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:39,170
To be honest,
I was surprised you called.

421
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:41,540
Well, you're a part of Grant's life...

422
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:45,581
and that means
you're a part of my life too.

423
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,811
You look like a princess.

424
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:56,982
You don't think it's a bit too much?

425
00:44:57,094 --> 00:44:58,959
Oh, not at all.

426
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:01,327
I'll go get some pins to fit it.

427
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:05,665
Uh-oh.

428
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:31,623
Why do you insist
on dressing me in these fruity outfits?

429
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:36,189
- I'm gonna take this lollipop
and shove it up your ass.

430
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,530
I can hear everyone's thoughts.

431
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:41,934
I love Puerto Rican men. They're spicy.

432
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:45,975
It's like I'm trapped
in a bad Mel Gibson movie.

433
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,976
What the hell was I thinkin'?

434
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:50,444
He's a freakin' backup dancer.

435
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:54,210
Dude, I married Britney Spears!

436
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:58,379
I'm rich! I'm rich, beotch!

437
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:00,923
<i>- Rich!</i>
- Is the bride-to-be ready?

438
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:04,619
Bride-to-be? Shit. Not if I can help it.

439
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:07,629
I've got 24 hours
to break up this wedding.

440
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:10,063
- No.
- Yes!

441
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:14,069
<i> I'll turn Grant against you</i>
<i>and make him love me again.</i>

442
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:16,435
Me, me, me!

443
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,565
- Stay away from me!
- Oh!

444
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:51,060
- What is it now?
- Grant's got an ex-fiancée.

445
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:53,659
And she has a thing for him.
I just know it.

446
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:56,364
<i>And they have this long,</i>
<i>romantic history.</i>

447
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:59,738
How can I measure up to that?

448
00:47:59,843 --> 00:48:03,472
You can't.
She's fine as hell.

449
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:07,781
I would tear that shit up!

450
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:11,321
You know, everything was going so well
until she turns up.

451
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:14,254
Look, he's not with Andy anymore.
He's with you.

452
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:17,725
You gotta put aside your insecurities.
It'll all work out.

453
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:21,127
- Do you really believe that?
- No, but my white customers do.

454
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:24,632
Wow.

455
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:27,761
<i>- Look, I believe in you and Grant.</i>

456
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:30,305
And before you know it,
you'll be walking down the aisle.

457
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:33,467
Oh, and saying our vows.

458
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,772
And our first dance!

459
00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:47,449
You call that dancin'?
No.

460
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:51,493
You see this? This is where you live.

461
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:54,894
Right here.
This is your home. Huh?

462
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:56,989
Well, how about this?

463
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:08,944
That bitch be krumpin'!

464
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:28,698
It's okay. It's okay.

465
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,165
She's never gonna break us up.

466
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:34,294
Grant and I just have to get through
the rehearsal dinner...

467
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:37,134
and then tomorrow's the big day.

468
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:40,641
Once we're married,
everything will be perfect.

469
00:49:40,744 --> 00:49:42,803
Who are you kidding?

470
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:46,440
Grant's never gonna marry you.

471
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:50,008
<i>You're not good enough.</i>
<i>He's meant to be with Andy.</i>

472
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:54,147
- Don't say that!
- This is who you really are.

473
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:56,987
<i>- You're a frump, girl.</i>

474
00:49:57,094 --> 00:50:01,497
You may look different,
but inside you'll always be me.

475
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:07,161
- No, please, stop.
- You'll be stuck in that diner till the end of time.

476
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:10,728
I don't believe you.

477
00:50:12,242 --> 00:50:15,905
True love is a myth.
You better hurry up and marry Nicky...

478
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:18,504
before you end up
a fat, dusty old maid.

479
00:50:18,615 --> 00:50:21,311
- Never!
- You'll see.

480
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:31,920
Quiet, everyone. Quiet.

481
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:34,429
Roz has a few words to say.

482
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,431
Oh, thank you, hon.

483
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,330
Mmm!

484
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:41,933
I would like to make a toast.

485
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,371
To Grant and Julia!

486
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:47,705
Yeah! What?

487
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:50,575
Okay!
Get crunk!

488
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,170
Get crunked!

489
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:15,104
You like it?

490
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:18,933
You look... ravishing.

491
00:51:21,211 --> 00:51:23,236
What? What's wrong?

492
00:51:23,346 --> 00:51:28,249
Grant, your whole courtship
has been rocky, to say the least.

493
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:34,117
I just hope you're not rushing
into this marriage with Julia...

494
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:38,452
<i>as a way of getting over me.</i>

495
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:40,894
I-

496
00:51:57,547 --> 00:52:01,176
Oh, dear God.
A carousel.

497
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:07,119
I, uh- I'd better get back.

498
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:19,165
Grant, this is our rehearsal dinner.

499
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:21,430
We're getting married tomorrow.

500
00:52:23,106 --> 00:52:26,337
I need to know-
do you still have feelings for Andy?

501
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:28,775
Of course not.

502
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,641
I trust you.
I just don't want to get hurt.

503
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:36,014
You have nothing to worry about.

504
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,781
<i>I'm devoted to you...</i>

505
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:40,686
forever.

506
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,726
No.

507
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:04,299
Not a zit on my wedding day!

508
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:07,303
Ohh.

509
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,626
Where the hell is Julia?

510
00:55:35,465 --> 00:55:40,129
Grant, I wouldn't be your best man
unless I told you this.

511
00:55:40,236 --> 00:55:42,727
Julia doesn't deserve you.

512
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:47,242
<i>Oh, come on! She's an hour late</i>
<i>for her own wedding.</i>

513
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:51,838
<i>Maybe she's got cold feet 'cause she knows</i>
<i>it's not right between the two of you.</i>

514
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,918
Do you ever think about us?

515
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,544
Yeah.

516
00:55:58,655 --> 00:56:01,351
Me too.

517
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:05,924
My grandmother's ring.

518
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:08,190
She gave you this ring
on her deathbed...

519
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:12,098
and made you promise to give it to the woman
you wanted to spend the rest of your life with.

520
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:14,193
You gave it to me.

521
00:56:18,942 --> 00:56:20,842
My grandfather's toe ring.

522
00:56:20,944 --> 00:56:23,071
<i>Didn't he give you this ring</i>
<i>on his deathbed...</i>

523
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:26,046
and make you promise to give it
to the woman you'd cherish forever?

524
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:29,815
You gave that to me too.

525
00:56:31,855 --> 00:56:36,224
- Julia-
- Oh! She's just the rebound girl.

526
00:56:36,326 --> 00:56:40,057
I'm ready to take you back.
Choose me. Marry me.

527
00:56:41,531 --> 00:56:46,298
Andy, I just don't feel
the same way about you anymore.

528
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,371
Julia's the one.

529
00:56:49,773 --> 00:56:52,071
Then one last kiss.

530
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:03,746
Julia, no!

531
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:14,889
<i>Shut up! It's 4:00 in the morning!</i>

532
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:17,892
<i>Asshole!</i>

533
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:20,394
<i>Turn that crap off!</i>

534
00:58:27,303 --> 00:58:30,397
<i>I'm trying to watch</i>
Desperate Housewives!

535
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:35,471
<i>It's called an iPod!</i>
<i>Get one!</i>

536
00:59:12,282 --> 00:59:14,682
Oh. Jinxers?

537
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:40,543
<i>Julia.</i>

538
00:59:45,014 --> 00:59:47,482
Let's get you out of that funk.

539
01:00:00,363 --> 01:00:05,130
Julia, will you marry me?

540
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:09,299
<i>Please?</i>

541
01:00:13,977 --> 01:00:15,945
It was good, right?

542
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:21,244
I know Nicky's a little
rough around the edges...

543
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:24,582
but give him a chance.

544
01:00:24,687 --> 01:00:28,282
When your mother and I first got married,
we barely knew each other.

545
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:32,327
I was a mail-order bride,
could barely speak the English language.

546
01:00:32,428 --> 01:00:34,419
Dad, you're from Jersey.

547
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:36,657
I'm tryin' to make a point here.

548
01:00:36,766 --> 01:00:39,030
At first,
Linda and I couldn't get along.

549
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:42,764
<i>But we grew to understand</i>
<i>and even respect each other.</i>

550
01:00:42,872 --> 01:00:46,205
I'm proud to say
we've been married for 30 years...

551
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:50,473
<i>and I have you and your sister</i>
<i>to show for it.</i>

552
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:53,481
<i>Now, maybe that's not</i>
<i>the fairy tale you dream of...</i>

553
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:56,347
but that's real life.

554
01:00:56,452 --> 01:00:58,352
So, what do you say?

555
01:01:01,557 --> 01:01:04,458
I've been fooling myself all along.

556
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:07,154
<i>There is no Prince Charming.</i>

557
01:01:07,263 --> 01:01:12,064
And true love is something
that only exists in the movies.

558
01:01:15,638 --> 01:01:18,903
Okay, Dad,
I'll marry Nicky.

559
01:01:20,943 --> 01:01:22,911
Back to work.

560
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:47,335
You're crying.

561
01:01:47,437 --> 01:01:50,406
Tears of joy, Dad.

562
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:59,014
<i>Thanks, Frank.</i>
<i>I'll take it from here.</i>

563
01:02:01,651 --> 01:02:05,314
We are gathered here to join
this man and this woman...

564
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:07,389
<i>in holy matrimony.</i>

565
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:12,052
<i>Marriage is a contract</i>
<i>that should not be taken lightly.</i>

566
01:02:12,161 --> 01:02:16,564
<i>It must be honored by two people</i>
<i>who are truly in love.</i>

567
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:24,028
<i>If anyone has any reason</i>
<i>why these two should not be married...</i>

568
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:26,533
speak now or forever hold your peace.

569
01:03:37,246 --> 01:03:39,874
- I object!
- Thank God!

570
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:47,018
This isn't what you wanted.

571
01:03:47,123 --> 01:03:49,023
It's what I wanted.

572
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:53,391
<i>I was wrong about Grant.</i>
<i>He's a good man.</i>

573
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:55,191
He even liked you
when you were butt-ugly.

574
01:03:55,298 --> 01:03:58,062
- How do you-
- I saw it in your flashback.

575
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:00,761
<i>You and Grant</i>
<i>were meant to be together.</i>

576
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:02,565
I don't know.

577
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:05,140
You need to read this.

578
01:04:07,443 --> 01:04:10,310
<i>My darling Julia. I'm sorry.</i>

579
01:04:10,413 --> 01:04:12,643
<i>So sorry.</i>

580
01:04:12,748 --> 01:04:15,216
<i>So very, very sorry.</i>

581
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:18,810
<i>And yet, sorry seems to be</i>
<i>the hardest word to say.</i>

582
01:04:18,921 --> 01:04:23,221
<i>If you can ever forgive me</i>
<i>and you're ready to make that leap...</i>

583
01:04:23,326 --> 01:04:26,227
<i>I promise I'll be there to catch you.</i>

584
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:29,230
<i>If you still love me</i>
<i>the way I love you...</i>

585
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:31,596
<i>then meet me</i>
<i>where Meg Ryan met Tom Hanks.</i>

586
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:33,601
On the Internet?

587
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:36,501
<i>No, not in</i> You've Got Mail,
<i>in</i> Sleepless in Seattle.

588
01:04:36,606 --> 01:04:40,940
Right. The observation deck
of the Empire State Building.

589
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:42,943
But how do I get there?

590
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:46,173
<i>Um, I'll Mapquest directions</i>
<i>and I.M. -it to your Blackberry.</i>

591
01:04:46,282 --> 01:04:49,274
But I only have a T-Mobile Sidekick.

592
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:51,353
You can borrow my Treo 650.

593
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:56,425
<i>How about we just meet</i>
<i>where we had our first date?</i>

594
01:04:56,525 --> 01:05:00,461
A Restaurant? But that's way uptown.
Traffic's a nightmare.

595
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:03,555
<i>The rooftop of your apartment building?</i>

596
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:06,692
Okay! Great!

597
01:05:06,802 --> 01:05:10,431
This issue's six months old.
I hope he's still waiting.

598
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:14,031
He'd be a fool not to wait for my daughter.
Go get him, baby.

599
01:05:14,143 --> 01:05:16,043
Thanks, Dad.

600
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:39,800
Taxi! Taxi!

601
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:42,336
Taxi!

602
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:49,438
Someone!
Someone please help!

603
01:05:49,545 --> 01:05:52,412
<i>Trick!</i>
<i>You're getting on my nerves!</i>

604
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:55,075
I need to get across town fast.

605
01:06:03,392 --> 01:06:05,792
- I owe you.
- Damn straight!

606
01:06:05,895 --> 01:06:07,624
I'm Hitch, bitch!

607
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:45,862
Come on. Open up!

608
01:06:55,644 --> 01:06:58,374
Oh, please!

609
01:07:38,354 --> 01:07:40,254
He's mine!

610
01:07:40,356 --> 01:07:43,689
Keep your damn hands off my man!

611
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:12,714
I'm too late.

612
01:08:12,822 --> 01:08:15,620
Julia!

613
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:20,328
Ohh!

614
01:08:29,238 --> 01:08:31,832
What happens after the prince
rescues the princess?

615
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:34,933
She rescues him right back.

616
01:08:36,045 --> 01:08:38,411
You make me want to be
a better man.

617
01:08:39,748 --> 01:08:41,648
You had me at "hello."

618
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:46,813
I'm just a girl standing
in front of a boy...

619
01:08:46,922 --> 01:08:49,083
asking him to love her.

620
01:09:30,065 --> 01:09:33,159
What?
I'm also an ordained minister.

621
01:09:40,376 --> 01:09:42,367
By the powers vested in me...

622
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:44,708
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

623
01:09:44,813 --> 01:09:46,508
Show her some love, man!

624
01:10:07,603 --> 01:10:10,595
- Bravo!
- Beautiful!

625
01:10:14,143 --> 01:10:17,112
Yeah-

626
01:10:35,698 --> 01:10:37,859
Julia!

627
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:39,901
This is for you.

628
01:10:44,373 --> 01:10:47,433
<i>It's a vaginal thermometer.</i>

629
01:10:48,978 --> 01:10:51,003
It lets you know
when you're ovulating.

630
01:10:51,113 --> 01:10:53,308
It's been in our family
for generations.

631
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:56,578
And if you want to keep it
our lucky thermometer, don't ever wash it.

632
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:04,259
- Julia.
- Dad.

633
01:11:06,829 --> 01:11:09,730
You're gonna have to find
a new waitress.

634
01:11:09,832 --> 01:11:12,096
It's about time.

635
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:21,334
Come here.

636
01:11:22,745 --> 01:11:25,942
Hey.
Take care of my daughter.

637
01:11:26,982 --> 01:11:28,882
Come on.

638
01:11:31,687 --> 01:11:34,087
<i>Good-bye! Best of luck!</i>

639
01:11:46,402 --> 01:11:49,371
Hey, is it too late to crash
the Fockyerdoder wedding?

640
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:52,303
Bye.

641
01:11:52,408 --> 01:11:55,036
<i>And we lived happily ever after.</i>

642
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:59,547
<i>But not before we went on our honeymoon</i>
<i>to romantic Kong Island.</i>

643
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:15,964
<i>Help!</i>

644
01:12:16,065 --> 01:12:18,625
Please help me!

645
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:28,034
Help!

646
01:12:28,143 --> 01:12:30,236
Keep the camera rolling.

647
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:32,211
<i>Oh, God!</i>

648
01:12:32,314 --> 01:12:35,010
Help! Please!

649
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:41,248
No. No!

650
01:12:46,995 --> 01:12:51,193
<i>Carmen Electra! Carmen Electra! Carmen Electra!</i>

651
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:55,168
<i>- Carmen Electra! Carmen Electra!</i>
- Ooh!

652
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:57,670
That feels kinda good.

653
01:12:57,773 --> 01:12:59,741
A little... kinky.

654
01:13:01,777 --> 01:13:04,541
Oh, yeah!

655
01:13:07,616 --> 01:13:10,016
I like hairy boys.

656
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:36,241
Yes! Yes!

657
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:40,578
Yes!

658
01:13:40,682 --> 01:13:43,617
Yes! Beautiful.

659
01:13:43,719 --> 01:13:45,619
Yes, drink it.

660
01:13:45,721 --> 01:13:47,655
You're gonna love it.

661
01:13:47,756 --> 01:13:50,725
Is that Cos's hand on your booty?

662
01:13:55,931 --> 01:13:58,832
<i>Cut it!</i>

663
01:13:58,934 --> 01:14:00,925
I'm kind of an amateur tennis player.

664
01:14:01,036 --> 01:14:03,971
I was playing,
it was a drizzly day...

665
01:14:04,072 --> 01:14:07,906
and Roz came down and volunteered
to hold my balls and keep 'em dry.

666
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:09,910
- His balls-
- We got rained out anyway.

667
01:14:10,012 --> 01:14:11,946
His balls are always wet,
whether it's raining or not.

668
01:14:23,892 --> 01:14:27,157
Hey, is it too late
for one more parody?

669
01:14:28,597 --> 01:14:30,462
It's on the Hudson...

670
01:14:30,566 --> 01:14:33,501
with breathtaking views of the skyline.

671
01:14:33,602 --> 01:14:35,433
<i>¡Muy romántico!</i>

672
01:14:35,537 --> 01:14:38,335
Yeah! What? Okay!

673
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:40,340
Get crunk!

674
01:14:58,093 --> 01:15:01,654
<i>Hai!</i>

675
01:15:06,568 --> 01:15:10,231
Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah!
I'm your baby! Nyah-nyah!

676
01:15:11,273 --> 01:15:13,241
Infantilism.

677
01:16:29,851 --> 01:16:32,911
<i>How often do you have sex?</i>

678
01:16:33,021 --> 01:16:34,921
I don't understand the question.

679
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:37,491
I mean, it's a PG-13 movie.

680
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:41,029
We're limited
to very mild sexual content.

681
01:16:41,129 --> 01:16:44,155
Above the waist...

682
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:46,427
over the shirt, no tongues.

683
01:16:46,535 --> 01:16:48,435
No tongue.

684
01:16:48,537 --> 01:16:51,267
<i>How about this week?</i>

685
01:16:51,373 --> 01:16:53,102
Nine.

686
01:16:53,208 --> 01:16:56,268
A hundred and 27.
