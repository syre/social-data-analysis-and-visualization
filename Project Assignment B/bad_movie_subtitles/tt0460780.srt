1
00:00:46,068 --> 00:00:48,400
I knew you'd come.

2
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,768
I told you I would.

3
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,838
I mean, I- I felt it.

4
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,845
I felt it before you came.

5
00:00:59,081 --> 00:01:01,948
( man )
you're developing your powers, muriella.

6
00:01:02,017 --> 00:01:04,042
Our time together is paying off.

7
00:01:08,056 --> 00:01:10,718
( Wind Whistling )

8
00:01:29,244 --> 00:01:31,212
Stop.

9
00:01:33,215 --> 00:01:35,149
You have to leave.

10
00:01:35,217 --> 00:01:37,151
Is that your wish?

11
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:40,052
Each time we meet like this, I feel-

12
00:01:42,691 --> 00:01:44,682
Weak. I feel drained.

13
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,752
( Whispering )
Perhaps that is what love does to a woman.

14
00:01:50,032 --> 00:01:52,193
What do you know of love?

15
00:01:52,267 --> 00:01:55,236
I know that poets claim
they would die for it.

16
00:01:55,304 --> 00:01:58,330
- Would you die for it?
- Perhaps.

17
00:01:58,407 --> 00:02:00,432
- In a poem.
- ( Laughs )

18
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:03,535
- ( Chuckles )
- What would my father say?

19
00:02:03,612 --> 00:02:07,946
There are many things in this world
your father doesn't know.

20
00:02:08,016 --> 00:02:11,110
Let this be one of them.

21
00:02:11,186 --> 00:02:15,782
Sacrilege. This is madness, Gallian.
you go too far.

22
00:02:20,095 --> 00:02:22,427
( People moaning, Screaming )

23
00:02:28,303 --> 00:02:30,931
( man )
may the gods save us.

( Indistinct Voices )

25
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,039
Keep pulling, Zeph.

26
00:02:40,115 --> 00:02:42,049
Use your legs.

27
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,711
( Zeph )
It doesn't want to come out.

28
00:02:46,788 --> 00:02:51,122
- ( Grunts )
- It's those big ones that are always the toughest.

- ( Grunts )
- ( Chuckles )

See? Things worthwhile
don't come easy.

( Cawing )

32
00:03:05,874 --> 00:03:08,900
( Squawking )

33
00:03:10,412 --> 00:03:12,403
You missed.

34
00:03:13,482 --> 00:03:15,450
I don't want to kill them-

35
00:03:15,517 --> 00:03:17,576
As long as they don't eat the crops.

36

( Pig Squealing )

37
00:03:33,535 --> 00:03:36,834
Brought the hog.
Same deal as always?

38
00:03:36,905 --> 00:03:38,805
Winter's corn for the pig?

39
00:03:38,874 --> 00:03:41,308
Same deal. Deal never changes.

40
00:03:41,376 --> 00:03:44,140
It's been a tough
dry season, hasn't it?

41
00:03:44,212 --> 00:03:47,375
- I've seen rougher.
- King's recruiting.

42
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:50,043
Soldiers get taken care of really well.

43
00:03:50,118 --> 00:03:53,713
I have this land.
Isn't that enough?

44
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:57,247
you get older,you get tired
ofjust survivin

45
00:03:58,693 --> 00:04:01,457
Wouldn't you like
to test your courage?

46
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,966
I mean, where's the courage
in just surviving?

47
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:08,594
Damn it, Farmer, would it kill you
to just talk for a little while?

48
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,538
I mean, we're not animals.
People actually do converse with one another.

49
00:04:12,607 --> 00:04:15,235
Norick, if I could talk these turnips
out of the ground, I would.

50
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:19,178
When the rains come,
this ground turns to clay.

51
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:22,341
Not even you could talk 'em
out of the ground then.

52
00:04:22,417 --> 00:04:25,750
That's what I love
about your old man, Zeph.

53
00:04:25,821 --> 00:04:27,721
He always knows how to set a mood.

54
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:30,815
- Show Norick where we stack his corn.
- Okay.

55
00:04:30,892 --> 00:04:33,156
Here you go, Zeph. Have a pig.

56
00:04:33,228 --> 00:04:35,219
- ( Laughing )
- ( Squealing )

57
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,966
( Farmer)
Guess you'll be staying for supper.

58
00:04:42,037 --> 00:04:44,267
Well, since you asked.

59
00:04:53,115 --> 00:04:56,448
Norick, it is so good to see you.
You should come by more often.

60
00:04:56,518 --> 00:04:59,544
Well, I figure Farmer saw enough of me
when he was growing up.

61
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:03,751
Now that he's got a family ofhis own,
maybe he needs a little bit of a break.

62
00:05:03,825 --> 00:05:06,089
Norick thinks Father should quit farming
and join the king's army.

63
00:05:06,161 --> 00:05:09,927
- ( Gasps )
- Now hold on a second. I didn't say that exactly.

64
00:05:09,998 --> 00:05:12,626
He says the king's soldiers
make a lot of money.

65
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:15,261
Farmer, you're not seriously
considering this, are you?

66
00:05:15,337 --> 00:05:18,204
You're my family.
I'm not going anywhere.

67
00:05:18,273 --> 00:05:21,470
- That answer your question, Norick?
- I was just talking.

68
00:05:21,543 --> 00:05:24,137
- Just talking.
- Well, everyone's got a talent.

69
00:05:24,212 --> 00:05:28,046
-Just talking seems to be yours.
- ( Zeph, Woman Laugh )

70
00:05:28,116 --> 00:05:31,313
Just ratting on his friends
seems to be yours.

71
00:05:31,386 --> 00:05:33,445
- Can I have some chicken, please?
- Don't give it to him.

72
00:05:33,522 --> 00:05:36,491
- Give me the chicken. Har, har, har.
- ( Zeph Laughs )

73
00:05:55,177 --> 00:05:57,111
Tell me something nice.

74
00:05:57,179 --> 00:05:59,113
Tell me how you love me.

75
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:01,445
You know.

76
00:06:02,517 --> 00:06:04,781
( Laughs, Sighs )

77
00:06:04,853 --> 00:06:06,787
I only know what you tell me...

78
00:06:06,855 --> 00:06:08,914
and you tell me nothing.

79
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:12,790
Look at these hands-
Broken to feed us.

80
00:06:14,196 --> 00:06:16,926
These hands speak louder than words.

81
00:06:16,998 --> 00:06:19,865
What is the cost of telling me?

82
00:06:21,303 --> 00:06:23,294
What more could you want?

83
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:26,830
What every woman wants-

84
00:06:26,908 --> 00:06:28,842
A little passion.

85
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,811
- A little passion?
- Mm-hmm.

86
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,782
Well, let me see what I can do.

87
00:06:39,454 --> 00:06:42,890
- ( Woman ) It's time to go.
- ( Zeph ) Why can't you come with us?

88
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,449
( Farmer)
I have all those fields to clear.

89
00:06:45,527 --> 00:06:48,985
Remember-When men build lives
from honest toil-

90
00:06:49,064 --> 00:06:51,692
- Courage never fails.
- ( Laughs )

91
00:06:51,766 --> 00:06:53,791
That's right.

92
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,941
I hate sleeping without you.

93
00:07:12,087 --> 00:07:14,317
Be safe.

94
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:18,257
It's Stonebridge.
Of course we'll be safe.

95
00:07:29,337 --> 00:07:31,396
( Zeph )
Why do people call Father Farmer?

96
00:07:31,473 --> 00:07:33,600
Doesn't he have a name?

97
00:07:33,675 --> 00:07:36,007
Your father believes that people
become what they do.

98
00:07:36,077 --> 00:07:38,875
Norick brought him to Stonebridge
when he was just little.

99
00:07:38,947 --> 00:07:40,972
So Norick is his father?

100
00:07:41,049 --> 00:07:43,108
The whole town adopted him.

101
00:07:43,184 --> 00:07:45,846
Different families took him
at different times.

102
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,354
But Norick- He always kept
a special eye out.

103
00:07:48,423 --> 00:07:50,516
I'm glad he has a family now.

104
00:07:50,592 --> 00:07:52,560
I'm glad it's us.

105
00:07:54,195 --> 00:07:56,288
Mmm!

106
00:07:56,364 --> 00:07:58,924
Mmm. So am I.

107
00:08:19,387 --> 00:08:21,582
General.

108
00:08:22,657 --> 00:08:25,922
Report to your king.

109
00:08:25,994 --> 00:08:27,985
Your Majesty, Krug-

110
00:08:28,063 --> 00:08:30,793
Savage army. The Krug-

111
00:08:30,865 --> 00:08:32,560
They-They fight with swords.

112
00:08:32,634 --> 00:08:37,003
This is ridiculous. It's as if
you were talking about armed dogs.

113
00:08:37,072 --> 00:08:41,475
They fight like men.
They killed off our entire scouting party.

114
00:08:41,543 --> 00:08:45,138
Had the general not ordered me to return
with word, I should be dead as well.

115
00:08:47,148 --> 00:08:50,345
This is some sort of sorcery.

116
00:09:07,869 --> 00:09:10,770

Zeph, is that you?

124
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,434
( Laughs )
I've got you.

125
00:10:51,506 --> 00:10:53,440
Finally! Into the oven with you.

126
00:10:53,508 --> 00:10:55,499
- ( Laughs )
- I hate the oven.

127
00:10:55,577 --> 00:10:58,444
It's dry, it's warm.

128
00:10:58,513 --> 00:11:00,743
You don't want us
to eat you raw, now, do you?

129
00:11:00,815 --> 00:11:02,749
Why do you have to eat me?

130
00:11:02,817 --> 00:11:04,785
Tonight, I promised your grandfather...

131
00:11:04,853 --> 00:11:07,253
we're going to eat a dish he really loves.

132

( muttering )

134
00:11:24,706 --> 00:11:27,174
- So, how were sales at the market?
- It was good.

135
00:11:27,242 --> 00:11:30,837
Of course, the men tried to take
advantage of me because I'm a woman...

136
00:11:30,912 --> 00:11:34,780
so I make them pay more-
because I'm a woman.

137
00:11:34,849 --> 00:11:37,147
- ( Laughing )
- When we were kids you were always in charge.

138
00:11:37,218 --> 00:11:40,449
- Always the leader.
- No, I just knew what I wanted, that's all.

139
00:11:40,522 --> 00:11:42,319
Until she met your father.

140
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,257
Your father does not take orders
very well from anybody.

( Grunting )

142

- Where's Grandfather?
- The bell tower.

- Shall we go?
- We have to be careful.

144
00:12:14,355 --> 00:12:16,789
The bell tower was made
for times of war.

Hah!

149
00:13:10,285 --> 00:13:12,913
What took you so long?

150
00:13:15,257 --> 00:13:17,225

00:13:39,181 --> 00:13:42,344
Hah! They don't scare easy.

152

( Grunting, Groaning )

153
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,445
- Aaah!
- Aaah!

154
00:13:58,367 --> 00:14:00,301
( Norick )
This is crazy.

155
00:14:00,369 --> 00:14:02,530
Krug are beasts.
They don't have armor and weapons.

156
00:14:02,604 --> 00:14:04,538
I need to use your horse, Norick.

157
00:14:04,606 --> 00:14:07,040
- Where are you going?
- Stonebridge.

- Solana and Zeph are there.
- I'm coming with you.

No. My husband likes to leave
the trade to me so that he can farm.

161
00:14:14,983 --> 00:14:16,917
You did well for a husband.

162
00:14:16,985 --> 00:14:18,919
He loves you very much.

163
00:14:18,987 --> 00:14:23,788
Yes. Yes. I believe he does.

164
00:14:23,859 --> 00:14:27,260
( man ) When the bride and groom kiss,
ring the bell five times...

165
00:14:27,329 --> 00:14:30,321
signaling their marriage
for the village to hear.

166
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,924
( Grunting )

167
00:14:33,001 --> 00:14:36,960
Go. Go now. Take Zeph home now.

168
00:14:39,174 --> 00:14:42,109
Take him! You can protect him, Father.
Protect him.

169
00:14:44,346 --> 00:14:46,678
( Bell Clanging )

170
00:14:55,691 --> 00:14:57,784
( Laughs )

171
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,794
- Are you ready, my lady?
- Always ready.

172
00:14:59,862 --> 00:15:02,524
( Grunting )

173
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:06,633
Hold.

174
00:15:06,702 --> 00:15:08,636
Giving up so soon?

175
00:15:10,105 --> 00:15:12,733
Your progress is truly remarkable.

176
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:17,278
If only Ehb had more soldiers
of your caliber.

177
00:15:17,346 --> 00:15:19,871
- Let mejoin your army and you shall.
- ( Grunts )

178
00:15:23,085 --> 00:15:25,383
( Both Laughing )

179
00:15:25,454 --> 00:15:29,083
I am not quite sure that the armies of Ehb
are ready for women warriors.

180
00:15:29,158 --> 00:15:32,958
Besides, what would your father say?

181
00:15:34,796 --> 00:15:36,730
( Grunts )

182
00:15:36,798 --> 00:15:39,426
My father never lets me do
anything I want.

183
00:15:39,501 --> 00:15:41,492
( man )
Tarish.!

184
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,902
Prepare your troops to ride.

185
00:15:43,972 --> 00:15:47,305
Hordes of Krug are ransacking the land.

186
00:15:47,376 --> 00:15:49,970
Oh, the sun is blistering my skin.

187
00:15:50,045 --> 00:15:52,980
What is this nonsense you speak?

188
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,375
Just do as you're commanded.

189
00:15:57,452 --> 00:15:59,682
I listen only to the king.

190
00:15:59,755 --> 00:16:01,882
It might behoove you...

191
00:16:01,957 --> 00:16:05,154
to learn a little respect.

192
00:16:07,462 --> 00:16:09,726
Respect is earned.

193
00:16:10,832 --> 00:16:13,995
You are mistaken.
Respect is my birthright!

194
00:16:16,972 --> 00:16:19,133
( Clamoring )

195
00:16:20,175 --> 00:16:23,008
( Shouting, Screaming )

196
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,284
- ( Screams )
- ( Snarls )

197
00:17:19,635 --> 00:17:21,398
( Grunting )

198
00:17:41,857 --> 00:17:44,417
( Clanging Continues )

199
00:17:47,896 --> 00:17:50,797
( Snarling )

200
00:17:53,502 --> 00:17:55,129
- ( Gasps )
- ( Snarls )

201
00:17:55,203 --> 00:17:56,966
( Grunting )

202
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,803
( Man )
To the village, everyone!

203
00:18:01,276 --> 00:18:04,143
- Where's Solana?
- She's-She's sounding the bell.

204
00:18:07,749 --> 00:18:11,344
Don't worry, Zeph. I'll find her.

205
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,479
- Father!
- Bastian!

206
00:18:13,555 --> 00:18:17,047
Take my sword.

207
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:21,061
- ( Norick ) Get inside. And bolt the door.
- ( mother ) Come quickly.

208
00:18:21,129 --> 00:18:23,996
- ( Bastian ) Thank you, Father.
- Go.

209
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,791
( Shouting, Screaming Continue )

210
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,751
( Grunting, Snarling )

211
00:18:53,295 --> 00:18:55,229
( Norick )
We'll look for her in the village.

212
00:18:55,297 --> 00:18:57,026
( man )
Let's go, men.! Come on.

213
00:19:02,604 --> 00:19:04,572
( Groans )

214
00:19:27,462 --> 00:19:29,453
( Hissing )

215
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:33,859
( Scream Echoing )

216
00:19:33,935 --> 00:19:36,233
( Laughing )
Well done.

217
00:19:36,304 --> 00:19:38,568
A man with spirit, huh?

218
00:19:46,014 --> 00:19:50,041
- ( Screams )
- ( Krugs Snarling )

219
00:19:52,988 --> 00:19:55,422
( Woman Screams )

220
00:20:16,678 --> 00:20:18,942
( Horse Snorting )

221
00:20:50,111 --> 00:20:53,137
- ( Snarling )
- Let 'em go.

222
00:20:53,215 --> 00:20:55,809
( Echoing Laughter)

223
00:20:55,884 --> 00:21:00,150
You already killed me once today,
and yet, here we are again.

224
00:21:17,138 --> 00:21:19,163
- Father!
- ( Groans )

225
00:21:22,277 --> 00:21:24,677
- ( Yells )
- Run, Son!

226
00:21:55,176 --> 00:21:57,076
( Screaming )

227
00:21:57,145 --> 00:21:58,942
( Horse Whinnies )

228
00:22:08,757 --> 00:22:11,248
( Groans )

229
00:22:24,205 --> 00:22:26,571
( Panting )

230
00:22:35,717 --> 00:22:38,777
Look! They're retreating.

231
00:22:40,455 --> 00:22:42,116
Zeph!

232
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:45,956
- ( man ) They're going to higher ground.!
- Zeph!

233
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,834
( man #2 )
Don't let 'em get away.!

234
00:24:06,141 --> 00:24:08,166
( Gulls Crying )

235
00:25:13,975 --> 00:25:16,239
I need a fourth marker for Solana.

236
00:25:18,413 --> 00:25:22,713
Nobody saw Solana.
Nobody knows.

237
00:25:22,784 --> 00:25:26,242
We didn't find her body.
She could have escaped.

238
00:25:26,321 --> 00:25:28,721
( Bastian )
He's right, Farmer.

239
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:58,289
Gallian! Where have you been?
I've been looking for you.

240
00:25:58,364 --> 00:26:00,298
I've been busy.

241
00:26:00,366 --> 00:26:02,766
( Door Closes )

242
00:26:02,835 --> 00:26:05,804
- Very busy.
- We had an agreement.

243
00:26:05,871 --> 00:26:09,432
I gave you access to my castle
so that we might work together.

244
00:26:09,508 --> 00:26:12,136
And I'm keeping my end.

245
00:26:12,211 --> 00:26:16,011
I'm sure recent events demonstrate
how very busy I've been.

246
00:26:16,082 --> 00:26:21,213
Yes, indeed. You have managed
to stir things up a bit.

247
00:26:21,287 --> 00:26:23,414
Stir things up?

248
00:26:26,258 --> 00:26:28,192
Tell me, Duke.

249
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,854
What do you know of a man
they call Farmer?

250
00:26:38,871 --> 00:26:42,238
( Chattering )

251
00:26:42,308 --> 00:26:45,402
( King )
People of Stonebridge.

252
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:48,845
The armies of Ehb
sympathize with you.

253
00:26:48,914 --> 00:26:51,883
This great tragedy will be avenged.

254
00:26:51,951 --> 00:26:54,283
Where were the king's army
when the Krug came killing?

255
00:26:54,353 --> 00:26:57,845
Peasant, do not forget
to whom you speak.

256
00:26:57,923 --> 00:27:00,517
In your world,
don't you bow before your king?

257
00:27:00,593 --> 00:27:03,926
In my world, the king's army's
expected to protect the kingdom.

258
00:27:05,965 --> 00:27:08,798
- Not just the castle.
- ( Woman Weeping )

259
00:27:08,868 --> 00:27:11,336
What of those taken by the Krug?

260
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:16,497
- Krug taking prisoners?
- Silence!

261
00:27:16,575 --> 00:27:18,702
If these Krug have taken prisoners...

262
00:27:18,778 --> 00:27:22,714
it is not yet clear
what their purpose might be.

263
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:28,084
( man ) The king's army will require
every man capable of combat.

264
00:27:28,154 --> 00:27:30,054
- ( Tarish ) Who is with us?
- ( Woman ) What will happen?

265
00:27:30,122 --> 00:27:33,888
The king has his armies and his walls.

266
00:27:33,959 --> 00:27:36,894
Those taken by the Krug only have us.

267
00:27:39,665 --> 00:27:43,863
- ( Tarish ) You dare defy your king's wishes?
- I'm with you, Farmer.

268
00:27:43,936 --> 00:27:47,099
- Guards!
- ( King ) Let them go.

269
00:27:47,173 --> 00:27:49,266
That is not the way of Ehb.

270
00:27:55,848 --> 00:27:59,443
- ( Farmer) You took a risk
turning your back on the king.
- No more risk than you.

271
00:27:59,518 --> 00:28:02,612
- I have no choice. She's my wife.
- She's my sister.

272
00:28:03,989 --> 00:28:06,514
All right, let's get to it.

273
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,127
Stay here. Go with the armies to Ehb.

274
00:28:11,197 --> 00:28:13,222
You wanted the life
of a soldier, didn't you?

275
00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:16,632
Nah. I didn't like the uniforms.

276
00:28:18,104 --> 00:28:21,369
- Do you have a horse?
- A mare.

277
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,568
She's old, but still strong.

278
00:28:24,643 --> 00:28:27,635
Old... but still strong.

279
00:28:36,622 --> 00:28:38,783
You're in my way.

280
00:28:38,858 --> 00:28:41,326
We have met before, have we not?

281
00:28:53,139 --> 00:28:55,232
( Solana's Voice )
Tell me something nice.

282
00:28:55,307 --> 00:28:57,571
Tell me how you love me.

283
00:28:57,643 --> 00:29:00,237
( Farmer's Voice )
you know.

284
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:15,153
- I'm Merick, the king's magus.
- I've heard of you.

285
00:29:15,227 --> 00:29:17,661
Children's stories about magic.

286
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:22,590
Your king needs you.

287
00:29:22,668 --> 00:29:25,660
Yeah, well, my son needed me.

288
00:29:25,738 --> 00:29:29,071
I failed him.
Now my wife needs me, if she lives.

289
00:29:30,442 --> 00:29:32,842
Does it occur to you, Farmer...

290
00:29:32,912 --> 00:29:36,313
that there may be events
of greater importance...

291
00:29:36,382 --> 00:29:40,512
than the loves and losses
of our particular lives?

292
00:29:41,587 --> 00:29:44,556
No. Doesn't occur to me.

293
00:29:45,624 --> 00:29:49,151
Try to stay alive, Farmer.

294
00:29:49,228 --> 00:29:51,458
Your king needs you.

295
00:29:52,932 --> 00:29:55,400
Far more than he understands.

296
00:29:55,467 --> 00:29:57,492
( Norick )
How did you know about this bridge?

297
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:59,538
( Farmer)
As a child I roamed around these parts.

298
00:29:59,605 --> 00:30:01,539
It's how I spent my days.

299
00:30:09,481 --> 00:30:13,076
- If we wind through the gorge we'll lose a day.
- What are you thinking?

300
00:30:13,152 --> 00:30:15,916
We can cross it.

301
00:30:15,988 --> 00:30:18,081
Let's take the gear off the horses.

302
00:30:18,157 --> 00:30:20,182
What, do you mean
we're leaving 'em,just like that?

303
00:30:20,259 --> 00:30:24,059
Are you afraid we're gonna
hurt their feelings?

304
00:30:24,129 --> 00:30:25,926
- Go home! Hah!
- Hah!

305
00:30:25,998 --> 00:30:27,829
- Hah!
- Get out of here.

306
00:30:36,242 --> 00:30:38,233
Let's do it.

307
00:30:59,965 --> 00:31:02,058
( Grunts )

308
00:31:11,644 --> 00:31:15,080
- All right, I'll go.
- You're a brave old guy.

309
00:31:15,147 --> 00:31:18,776
I just don't want you weakening the rope
before I've had my turn.

310
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,084
- Come on!
- All right, let's go. Come on.

311
00:31:24,156 --> 00:31:26,283
You were more concerned
about your horse.

312
00:31:26,358 --> 00:31:28,155
My horse I like.
It's you I'm not so sure about.

313
00:31:28,227 --> 00:31:31,594
Well, wait till you get to know me better.

314
00:31:31,664 --> 00:31:33,962
( Yells )

315
00:31:36,201 --> 00:31:38,965
( Both Yelling )

316
00:31:40,973 --> 00:31:43,737
( Stops Yelling )

317
00:31:49,381 --> 00:31:52,316
( Both Groaning, Yelling )

318
00:32:12,171 --> 00:32:15,265
That saved us a lot of time.

319
00:32:16,342 --> 00:32:18,537
Oh!

320
00:32:20,846 --> 00:32:24,213
-( man ) your majesty.
-( Tarish ) Get on your feet, soldier.

321
00:32:26,418 --> 00:32:28,386
( King )
How many men on guard here?

322
00:32:30,456 --> 00:32:33,289
I am on guard, my king.

323
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,726
Hmm. You are on guard?

324
00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:43,896
- ( Duke ) Duke Fallow,you're very, very naughty.
- ( Giggling )

325
00:32:43,969 --> 00:32:46,665
You make my bosoms tickle.

326
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:51,171
I'm gonna tell your mommy.

327
00:32:51,243 --> 00:32:53,973
Where are you going?

328
00:32:54,046 --> 00:32:57,038
( King )
my nephew amuses himself on the king's throne.

329
00:32:58,117 --> 00:33:00,415
Do you feel it suits you?

330
00:33:09,061 --> 00:33:12,326
you play while your king
and his legions...

331
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:14,866
are off on a military campaign...

332
00:33:14,933 --> 00:33:18,425
and your only job...

333
00:33:18,504 --> 00:33:21,234
is the safety of this castle-

334
00:33:21,306 --> 00:33:25,470
which is guarded by... no one!

335
00:33:25,544 --> 00:33:28,172
Your Majesty...

336
00:33:28,247 --> 00:33:31,739
was off investigating
outlandish claims. Aah.!

337
00:33:34,853 --> 00:33:37,754
- Get him out of my sight.
- No!

338
00:33:38,991 --> 00:33:41,289
( Tarish )
Go on, before I make you.

339
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,866
( Door Slams )

340
00:33:49,334 --> 00:33:52,929
Unhand me. You are not fit to kiss my gown.

341
00:33:53,005 --> 00:33:56,304
And you-You are not fit
to tarnish your uncle's crown.

342
00:33:58,177 --> 00:34:00,407
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

343
00:34:00,479 --> 00:34:03,277
Unless the king specifically orders it...

344
00:34:05,317 --> 00:34:08,616
you cannot touch me.

345
00:34:10,189 --> 00:34:12,123
Imperial law...

346
00:34:14,793 --> 00:34:17,023
is a toy...

347
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:19,758
I shall never tire of.

348
00:34:25,037 --> 00:34:29,906
- Things are progressing according to plan.
- I cannot wait any longer!

349
00:34:29,975 --> 00:34:34,912
I cannot stand the suffering rule
of that senile goat.

350
00:34:39,818 --> 00:34:42,981
Make it happen.

351
00:34:46,325 --> 00:34:49,658
You wish to accelerate things? Fine!

352
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:52,253
We shall accelerate.

353
00:34:56,902 --> 00:34:58,870
Good.

354
00:35:15,254 --> 00:35:17,017
Gallian.

355
00:35:17,089 --> 00:35:19,649
Must you always appear
suddenly from nowhere?

356
00:35:19,725 --> 00:35:21,659
I don't.

357
00:35:21,727 --> 00:35:24,355
I appear so suddenly from somewhere.

358
00:35:26,665 --> 00:35:29,361
You assume too much
entering my chambers unbidden.

359
00:35:29,434 --> 00:35:32,130
I'm not welcome to the hospitality
you've offered in the past?

360
00:35:32,204 --> 00:35:35,230
You're not welcome
to come and go as you please...

361
00:35:36,608 --> 00:35:38,542
and then vanish without a word.

362
00:35:42,481 --> 00:35:45,575
I'm not your harlot.

363
00:35:45,651 --> 00:35:47,642
How could you think such a thing?

364
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:50,813
you know very well
why I must appear so quietly.

365
00:35:50,889 --> 00:35:53,255
I can't very well be pounding
on milady's door, now, can I?

366
00:35:55,627 --> 00:35:57,686
How do you come and go as you please...

367
00:35:57,763 --> 00:36:00,527
when you're considered by my father
to be an enemy of the king?

368
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:04,091
I have friends. I wield influence.

369
00:36:04,169 --> 00:36:06,160
Why does my father despise you so?

370
00:36:06,238 --> 00:36:08,604
He's not known for his hasty opinions.

371
00:36:08,674 --> 00:36:12,269
Questions! I did not come here
to be interrogated.

372
00:36:12,344 --> 00:36:16,371
your father hates me
because I will not bow and scrape...

373
00:36:16,448 --> 00:36:18,712
before the almighty king and his magus.

374
00:36:18,784 --> 00:36:21,082
Because I will take from him what I please-

375
00:36:21,153 --> 00:36:23,246
Even his daughter's virtue.

376
00:36:27,459 --> 00:36:29,586
( Whispering )
Begone from my chambers.

377
00:36:30,662 --> 00:36:34,098
- Begone from my life.
- ( Chuckles )

378
00:36:34,166 --> 00:36:36,134
Are you banishing me as well?

379
00:36:36,201 --> 00:36:38,897
And after all the work we've done.

380
00:36:38,971 --> 00:36:42,065
Haven't I helped you
discover your power, your vision?

381
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,802
- You've introduced me to
parlor tricks and nightmares.
- Be still.

382
00:36:49,047 --> 00:36:51,709
( muttering, Grunting )

383
00:37:06,331 --> 00:37:10,062
( Woman )
Help! Please. Please.

384
00:37:12,971 --> 00:37:14,905
My liege.

385
00:37:14,973 --> 00:37:17,100
Again allow me to offer
my deepest apologies...

386
00:37:17,175 --> 00:37:19,666
for mistaking your orders.

387
00:37:19,745 --> 00:37:21,736
A mistake?

388
00:37:21,813 --> 00:37:24,179
- Is that what it was?
- Yes.

389
00:37:24,249 --> 00:37:26,183
Hmm.

390
00:37:31,757 --> 00:37:33,748
May I sit, Your Majesty?

391
00:37:41,533 --> 00:37:43,865
Boy!

392
00:37:44,936 --> 00:37:47,632
I know- Go.

393
00:37:49,975 --> 00:37:53,138
I know I have failed your trust
on several occasions...

394
00:37:53,211 --> 00:37:56,840
and perhaps I may be
a disappointment to you...

395
00:37:56,915 --> 00:38:00,009
and the entire kingdom,
but I will change.

396
00:38:00,085 --> 00:38:03,179
I will shed this youthful folly
in this time of great battle...

397
00:38:03,255 --> 00:38:07,385
and I will prove myself a worthy heir.

398
00:38:13,365 --> 00:38:16,198
Eat.

399
00:38:19,771 --> 00:38:22,239
You show a knack, my nephew...

400
00:38:23,308 --> 00:38:25,640
for well-timed diplomacy.

401
00:38:27,412 --> 00:38:30,313
I guess that's something.

402
00:38:30,382 --> 00:38:32,850
May I offer a toast?

403
00:38:32,918 --> 00:38:35,386
Possibly.

404
00:38:35,454 --> 00:38:39,185
Drinking wine in the morning
is not a good way...

405
00:38:39,257 --> 00:38:42,249
to show... reform.

406
00:38:44,129 --> 00:38:46,154
Indeed.

407
00:38:47,232 --> 00:38:49,393
Yes, indeed.

408
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:57,175
Long live the king.

409
00:38:58,243 --> 00:39:00,905
( Chuckles )
Yes.

410
00:39:00,979 --> 00:39:04,039
( man )
The Krug last attacked Stonebridge, in the south.

411
00:39:04,116 --> 00:39:06,107
( Tarish )
yes, and this harsh terrain...

412
00:39:06,184 --> 00:39:08,175
will drive them north,
around the marsh.

413
00:39:08,253 --> 00:39:11,120
Then we should attack.

414
00:39:11,189 --> 00:39:15,285
That is, if the Krug behave
the way they're supposed to behave.

415
00:39:25,604 --> 00:39:27,970
( Norick )
I don't like this, Farmer.

416
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:30,030
Nobody goes into Sedgwick Forest.

417
00:39:30,108 --> 00:39:32,702
( Farmer)
The forest passes between the mountains.

418
00:39:32,778 --> 00:39:36,373
We'll come out at Slate Pass
as the Krugs arrive.

419
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:38,439
There's more than brush
and trees in Sedgwick Forest.

420
00:39:38,517 --> 00:39:40,508
You don't just cut through it
when you please.

421
00:39:40,585 --> 00:39:42,815
you don't wanna
be stuck here at night.

422
00:39:42,888 --> 00:39:44,879
- We'll light torches.
- Torches attract eyes.

423
00:39:44,956 --> 00:39:46,389
- Let 'em look.
- Farmer!

424
00:39:48,727 --> 00:39:54,495
You know what people say.
There are... things in Sedgwick Forest.

425
00:39:54,566 --> 00:39:57,000
People say God watches over the innocent.

426
00:39:57,068 --> 00:40:01,129
People say a lot of things
that won't help us now, Norick.

427
00:40:01,206 --> 00:40:04,073
Come on. We've got a lot
of ground to cover.

428
00:40:17,161 --> 00:40:19,095
( Norick )
I don't see any path.

429
00:40:19,163 --> 00:40:22,599
- There is no path.
- So how do we know where we're going?

430
00:40:37,482 --> 00:40:39,416
( Whispering )
Wait.

431
00:41:00,571 --> 00:41:03,506
Whoa!

432
00:41:21,759 --> 00:41:23,989
Oh!

433
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,128
( Bastian )
You were right, Norick.

434
00:41:39,477 --> 00:41:42,173
Is this part of the plan, Farmer?

435
00:41:45,449 --> 00:41:49,044
- Let us down.
- When I'm ready.

436
00:41:56,894 --> 00:42:00,227
Get out of our forest.
you have no business here.

437
00:42:00,298 --> 00:42:02,926
We hate your weapons
and your killing.

438
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,525
- We're passing through, that's all.
- Then pass through...

439
00:42:05,603 --> 00:42:07,537
and never come back.

440
00:42:10,341 --> 00:42:13,401
( Both Yelling )

441
00:42:21,285 --> 00:42:24,880
We're, uh-We're lost.

442
00:42:24,956 --> 00:42:28,915
men- Not only useless,
but helpless as well.

443
00:42:30,828 --> 00:42:32,762
Your Majesty.

444
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:34,764
I beg of you news of my father.

445
00:42:34,832 --> 00:42:38,529
- Your father has gone on an errand for his king.
- Please-

446
00:42:38,603 --> 00:42:41,936
What's happening?
I worry that he's in grave danger.

447
00:42:52,483 --> 00:42:55,281
The king's magus
has many responsibilities.

448
00:42:55,353 --> 00:42:57,981
What he does not need is a daughter...

449
00:42:58,055 --> 00:43:00,489
who's troubling herself
with the affairs of men.

450
00:43:00,558 --> 00:43:03,994
My father thinks that keeping me
locked in this castle will ease my mind.

451
00:43:04,061 --> 00:43:07,690
He's wrong. I know the mood of this court.
It's never been more troubled.

452
00:43:17,341 --> 00:43:20,071
Darkness threatens...

453
00:43:20,144 --> 00:43:23,045
our empire.

454
00:43:23,114 --> 00:43:26,106
Darkness that's spawned by magic.

455
00:43:26,183 --> 00:43:28,014
Come on! Hey.

456
00:43:29,654 --> 00:43:32,487
your father seeks reason...

457
00:43:32,556 --> 00:43:36,253
- and remedy.
- Your Majesty? Your Majesty?

458
00:43:36,327 --> 00:43:38,693
- Your father-
- Your Majesty!

459
00:43:38,763 --> 00:43:42,255
Gallian.! I feel like I'm dying.

460
00:43:43,567 --> 00:43:46,468
Did you dine well with the king?

461
00:43:50,908 --> 00:43:53,843
- What have you done?
- ( Chuckling )

462
00:43:53,911 --> 00:43:57,642
I thought you were in a hurry
to accelerate things.

463
00:43:57,715 --> 00:44:00,115
( Groans )

464
00:44:01,352 --> 00:44:03,786
I suppose I may have tampered
with the king's food.

465
00:44:03,854 --> 00:44:06,322
You've poisoned me.
You've killed me.

466
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:09,484
- Don't be so melodramatic.
- ( Groans )

467
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,654
It's nothing that can't be fixed.

468
00:44:18,436 --> 00:44:20,404
( Groaning )

469
00:44:24,442 --> 00:44:26,433
Please.

470
00:44:27,945 --> 00:44:30,209
Please!

471
00:44:30,281 --> 00:44:32,215
( Chuckles )

472
00:44:35,219 --> 00:44:38,382
Let us hope you remember
who has the real power here.

473
00:44:38,456 --> 00:44:40,151
Yes.

474
00:44:45,629 --> 00:44:47,620
( Panting )

475
00:44:54,572 --> 00:44:56,938
I'd say I've saved your life.

476
00:44:57,007 --> 00:44:59,441
Now what shall you do for me?

477
00:45:14,959 --> 00:45:16,927
The king has been poisoned.

478
00:45:18,129 --> 00:45:20,063
Can he be saved?

479
00:45:20,131 --> 00:45:23,567
Perhaps, if it's not too late.

480
00:45:37,448 --> 00:45:39,575
On my soul.

481
00:45:48,626 --> 00:45:50,924
A word in private.

482
00:46:00,471 --> 00:46:02,666
Fallow has fled the castle...

483
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:04,731
and he's taken two full legions with him.

484
00:46:04,809 --> 00:46:08,506
( merick )
Well, that tells us who poisoned the king.

485
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:11,480
Prepare to move to the north,
where we shall meet our new allies.

486
00:46:11,549 --> 00:46:13,642
The strength of our combined armies...

487
00:46:13,717 --> 00:46:17,312
shall allow for generations
of peace and tranquillity.

488
00:46:17,388 --> 00:46:19,515
I detect the hand
of Gallian in this.

489
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:23,617
Why has Commander Tarish
not briefed us for this mission?

490
00:46:24,829 --> 00:46:27,195
( Groans )

491
00:46:30,267 --> 00:46:33,430
Anyone else care to commit treason?

492
00:46:33,504 --> 00:46:35,938
- How much of the army remains?
- A third.

493
00:46:36,006 --> 00:46:38,099
Hmm.

494
00:46:38,175 --> 00:46:40,973
Well, I have seen the Krug massing.

495
00:46:41,045 --> 00:46:43,275
Gallian is raising armies-

496
00:46:43,347 --> 00:46:46,009
- vast armies.
- How?

497
00:46:46,083 --> 00:46:50,213
How is that possible-That a single man
can cause so much devastation?

498
00:46:53,858 --> 00:46:57,521
My own daughter betraying me
to my sworn enemy.

499
00:46:57,595 --> 00:47:00,462
- Do you hate me that much?
- ( Moans )

500
00:47:02,833 --> 00:47:04,801
I thought that I loved him.

501
00:47:04,869 --> 00:47:09,397
He has tapped into our bloodline.

502
00:47:09,473 --> 00:47:12,806
You have tilted the balance
of magic in his favor.

503
00:47:12,877 --> 00:47:16,472
Thanks to you, the kingdom may be lost.

504
00:47:17,548 --> 00:47:20,915
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

505
00:47:20,985 --> 00:47:25,354
( Weeping )
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

506
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:31,451
( Norick )
Why do you hate outsiders?

507
00:47:31,529 --> 00:47:34,726
You hate each other.
Why shouldn't we hate you too?

508
00:47:34,798 --> 00:47:38,564
We stay in the forest to avoid
your wars and your contests...

509
00:47:38,636 --> 00:47:40,570
and your mindless enterprise.

510
00:47:40,638 --> 00:47:44,574
And yet, here you are,
shooting your arrows into our trees.

511
00:47:44,642 --> 00:47:47,202
Harm is but a way oflife
for your people.

512
00:47:47,278 --> 00:47:51,180
The fact that you don't realize
it is what makes you so dangerous.

513
00:48:00,558 --> 00:48:02,583
( Woman )
This is as far as I will take you.

514
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:04,525
Good luck.

515
00:48:07,298 --> 00:48:09,232
( Muttering, Grunting )

516
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:12,394
( Norick )
Do we have a plan?

517
00:48:12,469 --> 00:48:14,903
( Bastian Groans )

518
00:48:14,972 --> 00:48:16,906
( Grunting, Groaning )

519
00:48:41,198 --> 00:48:43,632
Are you awake?

520
00:48:43,701 --> 00:48:45,931
( King )
yes, I'm awake.

521
00:48:46,003 --> 00:48:49,063
You'll find it's not so easy to kill a king.

522
00:48:51,709 --> 00:48:53,677
We will attack.

523
00:48:54,745 --> 00:48:57,942
But, Your Majesty,
you have been poisoned.

524
00:48:58,015 --> 00:49:01,348
- Perhaps you haven't your bearings.
- I have my bearings, Commander.

525
00:49:01,418 --> 00:49:03,477
And I have my wits.

526
00:49:03,554 --> 00:49:06,921
The Krugs do not expect us to attack,
so that's exactly what we will do.

527
00:49:08,525 --> 00:49:10,584
Who poisoned me?

528
00:49:12,863 --> 00:49:15,696
I believe it was your nephew, Duke Fallow.

529
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,825
Oh.

530
00:49:21,572 --> 00:49:23,506
- ( Sighs )
- And there's worse.

531
00:49:23,574 --> 00:49:25,701
He has abandoned the castle...

532
00:49:25,776 --> 00:49:28,438
taken the guard
and the 1 1 th and 1 2th legions.

533
00:49:28,512 --> 00:49:31,037
We will attack.

534
00:49:31,115 --> 00:49:34,312
First light. Summon your troops.

535
00:49:40,257 --> 00:49:42,452
How much time do I have?

536
00:49:47,097 --> 00:49:49,327
Your life is coming to a close...

537
00:49:50,401 --> 00:49:52,892
but there is time enough.

538
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:54,904
( Thunder Rumbling )

539
00:49:54,972 --> 00:49:57,099
( Thunderclap )

540
00:50:00,611 --> 00:50:03,239
You sure about this, Norick?

541
00:50:03,313 --> 00:50:05,304
Not at all.

542
00:50:15,225 --> 00:50:17,659
- ( Woman, Indistinct )
- Shh!

543
00:50:21,732 --> 00:50:24,724
She's here, Norick.

544
00:50:24,802 --> 00:50:27,236
- I can feel it.
- I think you're right.

545
00:50:39,616 --> 00:50:42,210
( Grunting )

546
00:50:44,621 --> 00:50:47,556
Hey, hey! Easy.

547
00:50:52,262 --> 00:50:54,389
Solana?

548
00:50:56,333 --> 00:50:58,426
Solana!
( Grunts )

549
00:51:26,029 --> 00:51:28,657
Today...

550
00:51:28,732 --> 00:51:31,166
we ride for our king.

551
00:51:35,672 --> 00:51:39,073
And our king proudly fights...

552
00:51:41,478 --> 00:51:44,936
- in the name of Ehb!
- ( Cheering )

553
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:52,188
Your Majesty.

554
00:51:56,026 --> 00:51:58,790
Ride!

555
00:51:58,862 --> 00:52:03,663
God blesses those
who die for honor and truth.!

556
00:52:03,734 --> 00:52:06,168
( Cheering )

557
00:52:15,913 --> 00:52:18,438
( Groans )

558
00:52:18,515 --> 00:52:20,676
I'm curious about you, Farmer.

559
00:52:22,452 --> 00:52:25,216
I sense danger in you.

560
00:52:25,289 --> 00:52:27,450
I can't read you.

561
00:52:27,524 --> 00:52:30,982
I can read most men,
like reading scrolls of flesh.

562
00:52:31,061 --> 00:52:34,462
But you- you, I can't see
past your scowl.

563
00:52:34,531 --> 00:52:36,658
Why is that?

564
00:52:53,526 --> 00:52:56,188
( Echoing )
Who are you?

565
00:52:56,262 --> 00:52:59,459
Some riddles aren't worth solving.

566
00:52:59,532 --> 00:53:02,000
( Grunts )

567
00:53:09,442 --> 00:53:12,240
( Panting )

568
00:53:19,786 --> 00:53:22,016
( Moans )

569
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:28,889
You are here.

570
00:53:28,962 --> 00:53:31,226
I thought it a nightmare.

571
00:53:35,301 --> 00:53:37,235
Where is Farmer?

572
00:53:43,076 --> 00:53:45,442
Where is Zeph?

573
00:53:46,746 --> 00:53:49,715
Bastian, where is Zeph?
Is he with our parents?

574
00:53:51,951 --> 00:53:53,919
Yes.

575
00:53:53,987 --> 00:53:56,046
He's with them, but...

576
00:53:57,457 --> 00:53:59,391
he didn't make it.

577
00:53:59,459 --> 00:54:02,758
He... was killed with them
the day you were taken.

578
00:54:03,863 --> 00:54:05,797
I'm sorry.

579
00:54:06,866 --> 00:54:09,027
( Sobbing )
My baby.

580
00:54:14,974 --> 00:54:17,909
Did he die quickly?

581
00:54:18,945 --> 00:54:21,072
Tell me.

582
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:26,345
Yes.

583
00:54:26,419 --> 00:54:28,444
He died quickly.

584
00:54:38,164 --> 00:54:40,291
Farmer will come.

585
00:54:42,602 --> 00:54:44,570
He'll find you.

586
00:54:44,637 --> 00:54:46,730
( Solana )
How do you know?

587
00:54:46,806 --> 00:54:48,740
( Norick )
Because he must.

588
00:54:49,809 --> 00:54:52,334
Because he needs you.

589
00:54:52,412 --> 00:54:56,075
At the end of the day,
you're all he really needs.

590
00:55:23,576 --> 00:55:26,602
( Groaning )

591
00:55:26,679 --> 00:55:28,840
( Hoofbeats )

592
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,417
Don't die on me now, Farmer.

593
00:55:35,488 --> 00:55:37,456
Much for you to do.

594
00:55:37,524 --> 00:55:40,288
( Grunts )
Not looking too good, are you?

595
00:55:43,096 --> 00:55:45,064
( Grunts )
Ah. There.

596
00:55:45,131 --> 00:55:47,531
Try a bit of this.

597
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,398
( Gagging )

598
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:53,132
- What's it like?
- What is it?

599
00:55:53,206 --> 00:55:56,073
( Laughing )
That's medicine. Come on.

600
00:56:07,887 --> 00:56:09,912
( Woman moans )

601
00:56:23,903 --> 00:56:25,837
( man, Indistinct )

602
00:56:28,641 --> 00:56:31,235
- ( Woman ) No.!
- ( man Groans )

603
00:56:31,311 --> 00:56:33,245
( Gallian Chuckling )

604
00:56:33,313 --> 00:56:35,474
It's good to be home.

605
00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:46,520
( muriella's Voice )
I am not your harlot.

606
00:56:46,593 --> 00:56:48,527
( merick's Voice )
He has used you to destroy-

607
00:56:48,595 --> 00:56:50,563
( Gallian's Voice )
I know that poets claim-

608
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:54,498
( merick ) He bends emotion for sport.
Have you learned nothing?

609
00:56:54,567 --> 00:56:58,628
( Gallian ) Haven't I helped you
discover your power,your vision?

610
00:57:10,683 --> 00:57:12,674
My lady?

611
00:57:14,721 --> 00:57:16,712
( Weeping )

612
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:20,324
I am my father's undoing.

613
00:57:20,393 --> 00:57:22,884
I've jeopardized everything.

614
00:57:22,962 --> 00:57:25,624
But your father has
nothing but love for you.

615
00:57:27,567 --> 00:57:31,697
My girlish stupidity
has damaged him.

616
00:57:31,771 --> 00:57:34,968
Taking your life would damage him further.

617
00:57:39,712 --> 00:57:41,737
( Exhales )

618
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:46,411
Perhaps you're right.

619
00:57:47,487 --> 00:57:50,149
I would like my father
to be proud of me.

620
00:57:50,223 --> 00:57:52,783
He already is.

621
00:57:52,859 --> 00:57:55,259
He's proud of an idea of me.

622
00:58:12,011 --> 00:58:14,377
( Fallow )
Prepare to meet your new allies.

623
00:58:14,447 --> 00:58:16,813
These are Krug.

624
00:58:16,883 --> 00:58:20,842
( Fallow )
Obedient, relentless and unquestioning.

625
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:23,354
What you see before you
is a powerful army.

626
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:36,068
( Horse Whinnies )

627
00:58:43,076 --> 00:58:45,044
( merick )
Take this man.

628
00:58:45,111 --> 00:58:47,671
Put him in the king's tent.

629
00:58:47,747 --> 00:58:50,215
See that my horse is well fed.

630
00:58:52,352 --> 00:58:54,320
Hold.

631
00:58:56,255 --> 00:58:58,519
So was this your urgent errand?

632
00:58:59,926 --> 00:59:03,157
This is the farmer...
from Stonebridge.

633
00:59:03,229 --> 00:59:07,165
- It is.
- ( Exhales )

634
00:59:07,233 --> 00:59:11,033
Now why does a disloyal dirt-lover
from Stonebridge...

635
00:59:11,104 --> 00:59:13,595
command such careful attention
from the king's magus?

636
00:59:13,673 --> 00:59:16,540
Because the king has
a special interest in this... dirt-lover.

637
00:59:16,609 --> 00:59:19,271
I know nothing of this interest.

638
00:59:19,345 --> 00:59:21,336
Neither does the king.

639
00:59:29,389 --> 00:59:33,553
I thought it was about time
that you two were properly introduced.

640
00:59:34,694 --> 00:59:36,628
We've met.

641
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:40,392
But the last time,
he turned his back on me.

642
00:59:43,403 --> 00:59:45,701
Turned to what needed doing.

643
00:59:47,106 --> 00:59:49,370
I thought Your Majesty
would be interested in this farmer.

644
00:59:49,442 --> 00:59:52,343
He's been through a great deal
since we met him in Stonebridge.

645
00:59:52,412 --> 00:59:54,573
So has everyone else.

646
00:59:54,647 --> 00:59:57,548
What makes him so special?

647
00:59:57,617 --> 00:59:59,551
Because, Your Majesty...

648
00:59:59,619 --> 01:00:01,587
he is your son.

649
01:00:08,694 --> 01:00:11,663
( merick )
Farmer has a friend- Norick.

650
01:00:11,731 --> 01:00:13,995
Norick tended the queen's horses.

651
01:00:14,066 --> 01:00:16,967
I recognized him
when we were in Stonebridge.

652
01:00:17,036 --> 01:00:20,403
After the massacre
at Oxley Pass, this Norick...

653
01:00:20,473 --> 01:00:24,773
found a boy about three years of age
wandering in the battlefiield.

654
01:00:24,844 --> 01:00:27,278
There was only one boy at Oxley Pass.

655
01:00:27,346 --> 01:00:30,474
What do you think
of this tale, Farmer?

656
01:00:36,789 --> 01:00:41,055
One old man thinks he recognizes another
from 30 years ago.

657
01:00:41,127 --> 01:00:44,358
That's how you determine who's king?

658
01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:48,366
You are the king's son,
and heir to the throne.

659
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:53,234
I have no father-

660
01:00:53,306 --> 01:00:55,240
No parents.

661
01:00:56,409 --> 01:00:58,377
I have no business here.

662
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:11,686
Are you telling me that
that arrogant bastard is my son?

663
01:01:11,757 --> 01:01:14,351
He spent the last 30 years...

664
01:01:14,427 --> 01:01:18,363
living over a Stonebridge farm?

665
01:01:18,431 --> 01:01:20,558
It would appear so.

666
01:01:20,633 --> 01:01:24,364
It would appear so.
You told me he was dead.!

667
01:01:24,437 --> 01:01:27,235
You said they were all dead!

668
01:01:33,446 --> 01:01:36,040
What kind of joke...

669
01:01:36,115 --> 01:01:38,515
do the gods play on me?

670
01:01:39,919 --> 01:01:44,720
Sometimes the gods
know what is best for us.

671
01:01:44,790 --> 01:01:47,725
What the hell does that mean?

672
01:01:47,793 --> 01:01:51,559
You remember the chaos
we were in? Hmm?

673
01:01:51,631 --> 01:01:54,657
War everywhere.
Surrounded by enemies.

674
01:01:54,734 --> 01:01:57,567
If that child had been
taken back to Castle Ehb...

675
01:01:57,637 --> 01:02:00,629
how long would he have survived?

676
01:02:00,706 --> 01:02:02,697
Growing up in Stonebridge...

677
01:02:02,775 --> 01:02:05,471
he grew up strong...

678
01:02:05,545 --> 01:02:07,604
and far away from the enemies...

679
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,671
who would have jumped
at any opportunity...

680
01:02:09,749 --> 01:02:12,013
to rid you of your son and heir.

681
01:02:16,422 --> 01:02:19,016
Dear friend...

682
01:02:19,091 --> 01:02:22,117
you better be right about him.

683
01:02:24,196 --> 01:02:26,926
You better be sure.

684
01:02:26,999 --> 01:02:30,366
( Chattering )

685
01:02:30,436 --> 01:02:34,805
The king needs every able man
he can get for this battle.

686
01:02:34,874 --> 01:02:39,607
- That's not my problem.
- His kingdom is threatened.
Your kingdom is threatened.

687
01:02:39,679 --> 01:02:42,147
I don't know this king.

688
01:02:43,215 --> 01:02:45,877
Solana's my family.

689
01:02:45,952 --> 01:02:49,410
Norick and Bastian.
They are my family.

690
01:02:51,123 --> 01:02:54,217
And where will you live?

691
01:02:54,293 --> 01:02:56,227
Hmm?

692
01:02:57,663 --> 01:02:59,824
When the kingdom falls to Gallian...

693
01:02:59,899 --> 01:03:03,130
what future will you
be able to offer your wife?

694
01:03:04,837 --> 01:03:06,566
Think about it.

695
01:03:26,359 --> 01:03:28,327
Fallow, you have committed treason.

696
01:03:28,394 --> 01:03:31,852
We offer no quarter here.

697
01:03:31,931 --> 01:03:33,831
And anyone who follows
under your command...

698
01:03:33,899 --> 01:03:36,197
will likewise be
considered as a defector.

699
01:03:36,268 --> 01:03:38,930
We will spare no traitor.

700
01:03:39,005 --> 01:03:40,939
( Fallow )
Gentlemen...

701
01:03:41,007 --> 01:03:42,998
Commander Tarish
has poisoned the king...

702
01:03:43,075 --> 01:03:45,635
and accuses me of treason.

703
01:03:45,711 --> 01:03:48,009
Hah.!

704
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:50,173
Your ambition has no limits, Tarish.

705
01:03:50,249 --> 01:03:54,310
The Kingdom of Ehb
is now subject to my rule.

706
01:03:54,387 --> 01:03:58,448
We, as well, offer no quarters.

707
01:04:10,836 --> 01:04:12,827
You will never be king, my nephew...

708
01:04:12,905 --> 01:04:15,533
because you have no valor-

709
01:04:15,608 --> 01:04:18,805
Not now, not ever.

710
01:04:24,216 --> 01:04:28,346
The 1 1 th and 1 2th legions
are with you, Your Majesty.

711
01:04:30,923 --> 01:04:33,721
( Fallow )
You coward!

712
01:04:43,936 --> 01:04:48,339
( Tarish ) These Krug have no archers,
but they also have no fear.

713
01:04:48,407 --> 01:04:51,433
Now, they outnumber us,
but we are men...

714
01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:54,843
- and we serve a noble kingdom.
- ( Troops Cheer )

715
01:04:54,914 --> 01:04:58,213
They are beasts, with bloodlust.
Nothing more.

716
01:04:58,284 --> 01:05:01,185
( Cheering )

717
01:05:03,522 --> 01:05:05,387
So, have you come to do your duty?

718
01:05:06,425 --> 01:05:08,359
I've decided to fight.

719
01:05:08,427 --> 01:05:12,523
I'll be proud to have you fight by my side
so that I might keep an eye on you.

720
01:05:12,598 --> 01:05:14,532
( Clicks Tongue )

721
01:05:38,777 --> 01:05:40,404
Mid guard.

722
01:05:44,716 --> 01:05:46,707
( Horse Whinnies )

723
01:06:03,034 --> 01:06:06,765
- (Jingles )
- Commander.

724
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:08,829
Lead out.

725
01:06:15,347 --> 01:06:17,281
( All Grunting )

726
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:31,324
( All Grunt )

727
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:34,995
Archers.

728
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:38,794
Fire!

729
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:47,371
( All Groaning )

730
01:06:47,445 --> 01:06:49,436
( All Cheering )

731
01:06:55,453 --> 01:06:56,852
Fire!

732
01:07:20,378 --> 01:07:21,367
( Rumbling )

733
01:07:27,619 --> 01:07:30,247

( Grunts )

736
01:08:16,668 --> 01:08:18,966
- ( Horse Blusters )
- It's okay.

737
01:08:23,708 --> 01:08:25,699
( Horse Blusters )

738
01:08:27,445 --> 01:08:29,538
( Hoofbeats Approaching )

739
01:08:31,282 --> 01:08:34,046
- Hyah.

( All Grunting )

( Grunts )

746
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:17,687
General, take their flank.

747
01:09:17,762 --> 01:09:20,560
Men, move out.

748
01:09:25,270 --> 01:09:26,862
( Snarling )

749
01:09:26,938 --> 01:09:28,997

( Groans )

753
01:09:59,704 --> 01:10:01,672
They fight like dogs.

754
01:10:01,739 --> 01:10:03,673
Yes, sire.

755
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:05,868
( All Shouting )

( Growls )

762
01:11:41,706 --> 01:11:42,764
Whoa!

763
01:11:43,875 --> 01:11:46,639
( Screaming )

- ( Horse Whinnies )
- ( Screaming )

767
01:12:19,944 --> 01:12:21,935
Let's go.

768
01:12:29,921 --> 01:12:32,014
Ready.

769
01:12:32,957 --> 01:12:34,117
Fire!

770
01:12:41,299 --> 01:12:43,130
Fire!

( All Groaning )

772
01:12:52,110 --> 01:12:53,873
These Krug fight mindlessly.

773
01:12:55,813 --> 01:12:57,747
Their minds belong to those.

774
01:13:03,921 --> 01:13:05,218
( Shouts )

775
01:13:36,587 --> 01:13:39,750
If you win the day,
it means nothing.

776
01:13:39,824 --> 01:13:41,382
We will win more than a day!

777
01:13:41,459 --> 01:13:42,949
You have killed these.

778
01:13:43,027 --> 01:13:44,927
I will simply beckon more.

779
01:13:44,996 --> 01:13:46,395
( Grunts )

780
01:13:50,234 --> 01:13:54,830
Christwind. Is this where we pay for our sins?

781
01:13:54,906 --> 01:13:56,840
No, Norick.

782
01:13:56,908 --> 01:13:59,570
This is where we pay for our virtues.

783
01:13:59,644 --> 01:14:01,976
Sins are more than welcome here.

784
01:14:07,718 --> 01:14:10,084
( All Shouting )

785
01:14:10,154 --> 01:14:12,122
Whoa.

786
01:14:15,026 --> 01:14:16,220
The king.

787
01:14:25,336 --> 01:14:27,634
Hold still, good uncle.

788
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:31,164
( Grunts )

789
01:14:34,579 --> 01:14:36,069

- ( Grunts )
- Guards! Guards!

798
01:16:10,174 --> 01:16:11,539
Quickly.

799
01:16:11,609 --> 01:16:14,237
Get the king off the fiield.

800
01:16:14,312 --> 01:16:15,438
( man )
Come on.

801
01:16:20,785 --> 01:16:22,719
Farewell, good uncle.

802
01:16:22,787 --> 01:16:25,415
- Ride.
- ( Grunts )

803
01:17:18,142 --> 01:17:21,634
( Chuckles )
You have won nothing but time.

804
01:17:21,712 --> 01:17:23,839
( All Grunting )

805
01:17:38,883 --> 01:17:41,317
( Grunting )

806
01:17:41,385 --> 01:17:43,683
I won't live like them.

807
01:17:43,754 --> 01:17:45,722
We're already like them. We're slaves.

808
01:17:45,790 --> 01:17:49,521
- I won't live like a slave.
- Norick, be still.

809
01:17:49,593 --> 01:17:51,584
( Grunts )

810
01:17:53,064 --> 01:17:54,156
( Groans )

811
01:18:15,786 --> 01:18:17,720
( Exhales Deeply )

812
01:18:21,225 --> 01:18:23,216
( Man )
Why are we entering Sedgwick Forest, sire?

813
01:18:23,294 --> 01:18:25,854
We shall cut though
the forest to Castle Ehb.

814
01:18:25,930 --> 01:18:30,367
With no armies and no guard,
the castle is ours for the taking.

815
01:18:30,434 --> 01:18:31,560
Whoa.

816
01:18:35,439 --> 01:18:37,999
Let's get out of this place.

817
01:18:42,847 --> 01:18:46,305
Ho. Ho, ho, ho. Ho. Oh, ho, ho.

818
01:18:46,384 --> 01:18:49,581
Lookee here. A friend of the family.

819
01:18:49,653 --> 01:18:51,553
How delightful.

820
01:18:51,622 --> 01:18:55,080
Alone in the forest does not
make you feel vulnerable?

821
01:18:55,159 --> 01:18:58,856
- Keep your distance.
- You never did trust me, did you, Muriella?

822
01:18:58,929 --> 01:19:01,420
Your comportment
has never earned trust.

823
01:19:01,499 --> 01:19:04,400
Comportment? Decorum?

824
01:19:04,468 --> 01:19:06,595
Those are words for a castle.

825
01:19:06,670 --> 01:19:09,332
We-We are no longer in a castle.

826
01:19:09,407 --> 01:19:12,035
- There are no rules here.
- ( Horse Whinnies )

827
01:19:14,178 --> 01:19:16,078
( All Groaning )

828
01:19:18,582 --> 01:19:20,209
( Gasps )
No.

829
01:19:20,851 --> 01:19:22,580
( Grunting )

830
01:19:22,653 --> 01:19:24,086
( Grunting )

831
01:19:24,155 --> 01:19:26,180
( Both Grunting )

832
01:19:33,464 --> 01:19:36,592
Hyah.
( Grunts ) Hyah. Hyah.

833
01:19:40,838 --> 01:19:42,362
( Grunting )

834
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:44,374
Whoa.

835
01:19:52,483 --> 01:19:54,576
Hyah. Hyah, hyah!

836
01:19:55,653 --> 01:19:57,621
( Grunting )

837
01:20:14,338 --> 01:20:16,932
- ( Horse Whinnies )
- ( Groans )

838
01:20:25,749 --> 01:20:27,740
( Groans )

839
01:20:31,689 --> 01:20:33,520
A special gift for you.

840
01:20:33,591 --> 01:20:35,081
- Thank you.
- ( Grunts )

841
01:20:35,159 --> 01:20:37,093
There are rules everywhere, my duke.

842
01:20:37,161 --> 01:20:39,686
Your talent for breaking them
has failed you at last.

843
01:20:39,763 --> 01:20:42,459
- I'm taking this one with me.
- ( Grunting )

844
01:20:44,835 --> 01:20:47,065
( Grunting )

845
01:20:56,747 --> 01:20:59,181
( All Grunting )

846
01:21:07,758 --> 01:21:09,316
( Grunts )

847
01:21:11,762 --> 01:21:14,060
( Bastian )
Run. Solana, go. Go.!

848
01:21:14,131 --> 01:21:16,065
I'll find you! Go!

849
01:21:18,202 --> 01:21:19,897
( Krugs Grunting )

850
01:21:19,970 --> 01:21:21,961
( Gasps )

851
01:21:22,039 --> 01:21:23,802
( Grunts )

852
01:21:26,310 --> 01:21:29,507
- Norick! Norick!
- ( Sword Clangs )

853
01:21:33,584 --> 01:21:35,575
What you always wanted-

854
01:21:35,653 --> 01:21:37,712
a courageous death.

855
01:21:37,788 --> 01:21:40,188
Ah,you were a brave old guy.

856
01:21:44,261 --> 01:21:46,752
( Bastian )
Solana.

857
01:21:46,830 --> 01:21:49,993
( Solana )
Bastian?

858
01:21:51,001 --> 01:21:53,401
- ( Grunting )
- ( Clanging )

859
01:21:53,470 --> 01:21:54,528
( Grunts )

860
01:21:57,141 --> 01:21:58,608
- Oh!
- Come on!

861
01:21:59,677 --> 01:22:00,666
( Gasps )

862
01:22:00,744 --> 01:22:02,109
- ( Shouting )
- Stay back.

863
01:22:06,317 --> 01:22:08,376
- No. I'm good.
- ( Chattering )

864
01:22:36,313 --> 01:22:39,908
You fought well today.

865
01:22:39,984 --> 01:22:41,975
Slaying beasts...

866
01:22:42,052 --> 01:22:45,317
- can be a cruel courage.
- Yes.

867
01:22:45,389 --> 01:22:48,449
Whatever presents itself...

868
01:22:48,525 --> 01:22:50,891
-you'll do it.
- I'm used to hard work.

869
01:22:50,961 --> 01:22:52,952
( Chuckles )

870
01:22:53,030 --> 01:22:55,191
Well, that'll come in handy...

871
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:58,134
when you're king.

872
01:23:04,675 --> 01:23:08,441
How do you suppose it is that you...

873
01:23:08,512 --> 01:23:11,208
fought so well today?

874
01:23:11,281 --> 01:23:14,580
I mean, was it...

875
01:23:14,652 --> 01:23:16,643
luck?

876
01:23:17,688 --> 01:23:20,486
you have qualities,you know.

877
01:23:20,557 --> 01:23:23,993
Leadership. And, of course...

878
01:23:24,061 --> 01:23:26,052
you speak your mind.

879
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:31,595
This will serve you well.

880
01:23:36,373 --> 01:23:40,139
Wisdom is our hammer.

881
01:23:42,579 --> 01:23:45,742
Prudence will be our nail.

882
01:23:47,084 --> 01:23:49,712
When men build...

883
01:23:49,787 --> 01:23:53,188
lives... from honest toil-

884
01:23:53,257 --> 01:23:55,248
Courage never fails.

885
01:23:59,430 --> 01:24:01,364
Where did you hear that?

886
01:24:03,801 --> 01:24:05,735
I told it to my son...

887
01:24:05,803 --> 01:24:07,998
every night...

888
01:24:08,072 --> 01:24:10,438
when he was a little boy.

889
01:24:12,576 --> 01:24:14,567
And no one else.

890
01:24:18,315 --> 01:24:22,376
Things are gonna be a lot harder
for you from now on.

891
01:24:25,089 --> 01:24:29,082
- I'm a simple farmer.
- yes,yes.

892
01:24:29,159 --> 01:24:32,686
- It's all I know.
- You know, there's that little village...

893
01:24:34,264 --> 01:24:36,858
not too far from here.

894
01:24:36,934 --> 01:24:39,994
They raise two crops a year.

895
01:24:40,070 --> 01:24:42,903
- That would kill the soil.
- No.

896
01:24:42,973 --> 01:24:46,875
It does not kill the soil
because of the seaweed.

897
01:24:46,944 --> 01:24:50,141
You see, the seaweed
comes in from the ocean...

898
01:24:50,214 --> 01:24:52,205
and enriches the soil.

899
01:24:53,383 --> 01:24:55,510
You should try that.

900
01:24:59,056 --> 01:25:01,684
How do you know these things?

901
01:25:01,759 --> 01:25:04,125
Because I am king.

902
01:25:05,362 --> 01:25:09,731
Because I'm expected to know...

903
01:25:10,934 --> 01:25:13,402
about the land.

904
01:25:13,470 --> 01:25:15,938
Just as you will be.

905
01:25:17,441 --> 01:25:19,875
As long as there are kings...

906
01:25:19,943 --> 01:25:23,174
as long as there is land...

907
01:25:24,782 --> 01:25:26,773
they will fight over it.

908
01:25:26,850 --> 01:25:29,375
Battles fought for barren lands.

909
01:25:30,554 --> 01:25:33,148
What are these wars
if they never end?

910
01:25:35,926 --> 01:25:37,985
And they fought for peace.

911
01:25:40,597 --> 01:25:43,930
Peace- that's a dream.

912
01:25:47,971 --> 01:25:50,997
A dream that maybe you...

913
01:25:51,074 --> 01:25:53,065
as king...

914
01:25:54,678 --> 01:25:57,704
can bring peace forever.

915
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:04,811
You don't understand.

916
01:26:06,223 --> 01:26:08,453
These battles have robbed me of my child.

917
01:26:08,525 --> 01:26:11,323
You forget they robbed me of mine.

918
01:26:21,939 --> 01:26:24,134
My son.

919
01:27:04,114 --> 01:27:06,275
- ( Chattering )
- ( Tarish ) General Hallette.

920
01:27:06,350 --> 01:27:09,615
Yes, sir.

921
01:27:09,686 --> 01:27:11,813
Take a scout to the north side of the woods.

922
01:27:11,889 --> 01:27:14,084
- We should know what's waiting for us.
- Aye, sir.

923
01:27:19,596 --> 01:27:20,722
- Commander.
- Aye?

924
01:27:20,797 --> 01:27:23,129
Look.

925
01:27:27,204 --> 01:27:30,105
( Tarish )
Well, now this...

926
01:27:30,173 --> 01:27:32,198
is a surprising delivery.

927
01:27:47,891 --> 01:27:50,359
Duke Fallow's here to meet justice.

928
01:27:52,529 --> 01:27:55,396
I assume the king lives.

929
01:27:57,167 --> 01:27:59,135
( Whimpers )

930
01:28:00,137 --> 01:28:02,071
General Backler...

931
01:28:02,139 --> 01:28:04,300
give this man your sword.

932
01:28:11,315 --> 01:28:13,306
No armor.

933
01:28:16,386 --> 01:28:18,377
A duel.

934
01:28:18,455 --> 01:28:20,446
How lovely.

935
01:28:26,763 --> 01:28:30,392
You remember what I did
to you as boys, don't you, Tarish?

936
01:28:41,311 --> 01:28:44,644
Can I at least have a lick of wine?

937
01:28:53,690 --> 01:28:56,750
Will no man help his king with his armor?

938
01:29:00,831 --> 01:29:02,924
Pigs.

939
01:29:05,002 --> 01:29:07,732
( Grunts )

940
01:29:08,806 --> 01:29:10,774
( Grunting )

941
01:29:27,124 --> 01:29:29,058
( Grunting )

942
01:29:38,535 --> 01:29:40,503
( Gasps, Growls )

943
01:29:40,571 --> 01:29:43,506
This duel- it will be your last, Fallow.

944
01:29:45,376 --> 01:29:47,367
( Grunts )

945
01:29:48,879 --> 01:29:51,473
( Grunting )

946
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,160
( Groans )

947
01:30:12,603 --> 01:30:14,366
( Tarish )
I should kill you.

948
01:30:20,177 --> 01:30:22,111
I should kill you.

949
01:30:22,179 --> 01:30:25,546
( man ) The king is dead.!
The king is dead.! King Konreid has died.!

950
01:30:25,616 --> 01:30:28,346
No. No, this cannot be.

951
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:31,888
I am your king.

952
01:30:31,955 --> 01:30:35,118
- No, you are a curse to the throne!
- Commander Tarish...

953
01:30:35,192 --> 01:30:37,183
is bound by honor.

954
01:30:37,261 --> 01:30:39,559
He'll never kill the new king of Ehb.

955
01:30:41,432 --> 01:30:43,730
( Groans )

956
01:30:45,269 --> 01:30:47,464
( Laughing )

957
01:30:47,538 --> 01:30:49,802
( Sighs )

958
01:30:49,873 --> 01:30:52,569
Coward.

959
01:30:55,979 --> 01:30:58,209
My subjects of Ehb!

960
01:31:00,117 --> 01:31:04,349
Long live the king!

961
01:31:05,355 --> 01:31:07,346
Hip, hip, huzzah!

962
01:31:09,026 --> 01:31:11,290
Hip, hip, huzzah.

963
01:31:16,099 --> 01:31:18,431
Put it away.

964
01:31:18,502 --> 01:31:21,232
( merick )
Citizens of Ehb.

965
01:31:21,305 --> 01:31:23,239
Soldiers of Ehb.

966
01:31:24,741 --> 01:31:26,732
A few moments ago...

967
01:31:28,178 --> 01:31:31,113
our beloved King Konreid passed away.

968
01:31:31,181 --> 01:31:36,209
- ( man ) No.!
- Murdered by his nephew...

969
01:31:36,286 --> 01:31:39,585
who sought to take his place.

970
01:31:39,656 --> 01:31:42,420
By the laws of our land...

971
01:31:42,493 --> 01:31:46,429
the king's successor
must be related to him by blood.

972
01:31:46,497 --> 01:31:49,193
I give you your new king...

973
01:31:49,266 --> 01:31:52,258
the lost son of Konreid...

974
01:31:52,336 --> 01:31:55,305
Camden Konreid...

975
01:31:55,372 --> 01:31:58,205
known to some of you as Farmer.

976
01:32:28,539 --> 01:32:30,530
Stand.

977
01:32:31,542 --> 01:32:34,340
On your feet, please. Stand up.

978
01:32:40,017 --> 01:32:43,475
The king called upon you to face death.

979
01:32:43,554 --> 01:32:47,354
Those still standing have
cheated death of its prize.

980
01:32:47,424 --> 01:32:49,289
But our enemy still lives.

981
01:32:49,359 --> 01:32:53,921
He'll rebuild his forces
and launch a renewed assault.

982
01:32:55,032 --> 01:32:58,058
Tonight we dress our wounds...

983
01:32:58,135 --> 01:33:00,126
bury our dead.

984
01:33:01,338 --> 01:33:04,535
Tomorrow we march
on Christwind hold.

985
01:33:04,608 --> 01:33:08,874
- Gouge evil from its shell.
- ( man ) Gouge evil from its shell.!

986
01:33:08,946 --> 01:33:11,642
God save the king!

987
01:33:11,715 --> 01:33:13,876
( All Cheering )

988
01:33:28,065 --> 01:33:30,499
( Grunts )

989
01:33:30,567 --> 01:33:32,228
( Grunting )

990
01:33:32,302 --> 01:33:34,361
What? What do you want?
Take them away!

991
01:33:34,438 --> 01:33:37,066
Take them with the others.!

992
01:33:37,140 --> 01:33:39,131
Wait.

993
01:33:39,209 --> 01:33:41,905
Bring her over here.

994
01:33:41,979 --> 01:33:43,970
Begone.

995
01:33:52,222 --> 01:33:54,213
I sense him...

996
01:33:55,926 --> 01:33:58,656
in you.

997
01:33:58,729 --> 01:34:00,720
The farmer.

998
01:34:02,766 --> 01:34:04,757
( Laughs )

999
01:34:05,902 --> 01:34:08,393
He'll come for you.
This is perfect.

1000
01:34:08,472 --> 01:34:11,532
- And I will be expecting him.
- I'm nothing to you.

1001
01:34:11,608 --> 01:34:13,576
Yes, but he is something to me.

1002
01:34:15,145 --> 01:34:17,409
More than a farmer.

1003
01:34:19,416 --> 01:34:22,180
Much more dangerous to me than a farmer.

1004
01:34:22,252 --> 01:34:24,447
Now he'll come to me.

1005
01:34:28,659 --> 01:34:30,024
How do you know me?

1006
01:34:30,093 --> 01:34:32,084
How?

1007
01:34:34,331 --> 01:34:36,356
( Whispers )
Don't move.

1008
01:34:36,433 --> 01:34:38,367
Don't move.

1009
01:34:38,435 --> 01:34:40,062
I feel him...

1010
01:34:40,137 --> 01:34:42,765
in you.

1011
01:34:42,839 --> 01:34:45,364
Because you're carrying...

1012
01:34:45,442 --> 01:34:47,433
his son.

1013
01:34:50,414 --> 01:34:53,349
You're carrying his son.

1014
01:34:55,218 --> 01:34:58,153
- ( Gasps )
- ( Chuckles )

1015
01:34:58,955 --> 01:35:01,389
( Grunts )

1016
01:35:01,458 --> 01:35:04,791
( Grunting )

1017
01:35:07,964 --> 01:35:09,397
Where you from?

1018
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:13,731
Gloucern. They took me from my home.

1019
01:35:13,804 --> 01:35:16,102
We'll get you back home.

1020
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:19,331
We'll die here.

1021
01:35:51,541 --> 01:35:54,066
Good-bye, old friend.

1022
01:36:32,682 --> 01:36:34,707
( Farmer )
How do you fight an army that large?

1023
01:36:34,785 --> 01:36:37,515
Where the broadsword fails,
the dagger may succeed.

1024
01:36:37,587 --> 01:36:39,919
No time for riddles, magus.

1025
01:36:39,990 --> 01:36:43,016
A small force might
slip through the Krug lines...

1026
01:36:43,093 --> 01:36:45,323
and solve the problem at its source.

1027
01:36:47,330 --> 01:36:49,264
Get me to this Gallian...

1028
01:36:49,332 --> 01:36:51,323
and I'll kill him.

1029
01:36:51,401 --> 01:36:54,529
Sir, with respect...

1030
01:36:54,604 --> 01:36:58,096
are we making plans to save one woman
when there is an entire kingdom at risk?

1031
01:36:58,175 --> 01:37:02,942
If the king is to save his wife,
he must kill Gallian.

1032
01:37:03,013 --> 01:37:06,176
If he kills Gallian,
the kingdom is saved.

1033
01:37:10,287 --> 01:37:12,653
( Chattering )

1034
01:37:12,722 --> 01:37:14,986
Muriella.

1035
01:37:15,058 --> 01:37:17,049
Now is the time.

1036
01:37:19,629 --> 01:37:21,187
Your Majesty.

1037
01:37:22,499 --> 01:37:25,696
I wish to join your mission.
I wish to be of service.

1038
01:37:25,769 --> 01:37:28,203
Yes. Well, you've made your point.
Now go back to the castle.

1039
01:37:28,271 --> 01:37:30,262
I am my father's daughter...

1040
01:37:31,741 --> 01:37:33,800
and I will serve the king
just as he does.

1041
01:37:37,547 --> 01:37:40,448
You brought the king's murderer.

1042
01:37:40,517 --> 01:37:42,951
He fell into my hands.

1043
01:37:43,019 --> 01:37:46,284
A man needs all the help
he can get, magus.

1044
01:37:46,356 --> 01:37:48,881
I accept your offer.

1045
01:37:51,795 --> 01:37:54,195
- There are others who wish to help.
- Which others?

1046
01:37:54,264 --> 01:37:56,255
( muriella )
Let me show you.

1047
01:38:01,571 --> 01:38:05,337
- You've managed to stay alive.
- I've stayed away.

1048
01:38:06,877 --> 01:38:10,836
Those who you fight,
those who control the Krug-

1049
01:38:13,216 --> 01:38:14,774
we will help you fight them.

1050
01:38:14,851 --> 01:38:17,081
Thought you didn't involve yourself
in the conflicts of men.

1051
01:38:17,153 --> 01:38:19,178
This war isn't going away.
We can see that.

1052
01:38:19,256 --> 01:38:21,622
And when our forest
is burned and invaded...

1053
01:38:21,691 --> 01:38:23,921
we have no other choice.

1054
01:38:23,994 --> 01:38:27,191
We will fight with you,
and then we wish to be left alone.

1055
01:38:55,825 --> 01:38:58,555
Christwind.

1056
01:38:58,628 --> 01:39:02,792
- Built as a secure haven for magi.
- How secure?

1057
01:39:02,866 --> 01:39:05,699
Hmm. Well, the doors
open from within.

1058
01:39:05,769 --> 01:39:07,760
You can get in?

1059
01:39:07,837 --> 01:39:12,001
- A magus does not need
doorways to enter Christwind.
- I'll find a way.

1060
01:39:12,075 --> 01:39:15,704
Do you consider yourself
lucky to be alive?

1061
01:39:17,047 --> 01:39:18,981
I do.

1062
01:39:19,049 --> 01:39:21,540
Life...

1063
01:39:21,618 --> 01:39:24,246
has never been so exciting.

1064
01:39:29,292 --> 01:39:31,760
Those people who came with me-

1065
01:39:31,828 --> 01:39:33,762
Why not free them?

1066
01:39:33,830 --> 01:39:38,665
You do not want the world to know
that you have ultimate power and mercy?

1067
01:39:38,735 --> 01:39:40,726
Do you understand nothing?

1068
01:39:41,972 --> 01:39:43,963
I'm beyond mercy.

1069
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:46,008
I'm beyond good and bad.

1070
01:39:46,076 --> 01:39:47,771
These are childish ideas.

1071
01:39:47,844 --> 01:39:51,678
I'm changing the structures of the world.

1072
01:39:51,748 --> 01:39:54,182
Where would I stop if
I showed your friends mercy?

1073
01:39:54,250 --> 01:39:57,117
- It could-
- No exemptions!

1074
01:39:57,187 --> 01:40:00,247
No one. Not you.
Not the farmer.

1075
01:40:00,323 --> 01:40:04,225
Not your poor screaming boy
whose insides I tore out.

1076
01:40:05,195 --> 01:40:06,890
Kill me!

1077
01:40:06,963 --> 01:40:08,954
Kill me!

1078
01:40:15,639 --> 01:40:17,869
I won't kill you.

1079
01:40:17,942 --> 01:40:19,933
I enjoy you.

1080
01:40:20,010 --> 01:40:22,444
If you can bleed, you can die.

1081
01:40:22,513 --> 01:40:26,279
Perhaps I can.
( Whispers ) But I won't.

1082
01:40:28,018 --> 01:40:30,919
I have too much work to do.

1083
01:40:45,970 --> 01:40:48,336
( Thunderclaps )

1084
01:40:51,041 --> 01:40:53,032
( men murmuring )

1085
01:41:15,966 --> 01:41:19,732
- Tarish.
- ( man Speaks, Indistinct )

1086
01:41:30,848 --> 01:41:32,839
( Thunder Rumbles )

1087
01:41:43,828 --> 01:41:46,490
( All Grunting )

1088
01:41:48,232 --> 01:41:50,223
( All Grunting )

1089
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:04,775
( All Shouting )

1090
01:42:05,716 --> 01:42:07,013
Archers ready.

1091
01:42:17,695 --> 01:42:19,663
Fire!

1092
01:42:36,814 --> 01:42:39,214
Now!

1093
01:43:10,281 --> 01:43:13,182
There is a cave up there.

1094
01:43:13,250 --> 01:43:15,377
It allows the air to enter.

1095
01:43:15,452 --> 01:43:18,819
And now I must leave you.

1096
01:43:18,889 --> 01:43:20,914
I don't want you to go alone.

1097
01:43:20,991 --> 01:43:25,360
If there is any sanity left in that madman,
then I must try to reach it.

1098
01:43:25,429 --> 01:43:27,897
You can't reason with evil, Merick.

1099
01:43:27,965 --> 01:43:31,128
But I should at least
be able to distract him.

1100
01:44:03,534 --> 01:44:04,660
I knew you'd come.

1101
01:44:06,870 --> 01:44:08,861
Old friend.

1102
01:44:20,684 --> 01:44:22,675
We were friends once.

1103
01:44:23,721 --> 01:44:25,916
But you have greatly changed.

1104
01:44:27,858 --> 01:44:29,826
Oh?

1105
01:45:11,235 --> 01:45:14,568
A magus's power is contingent...

1106
01:45:14,638 --> 01:45:16,071
on his service to a king.

1107
01:45:16,140 --> 01:45:19,576
How is it that you thrive
as the king's adversary?

1108
01:45:19,643 --> 01:45:21,338
How do you like my Krug?

1109
01:45:21,412 --> 01:45:24,506
- They are a cruel abomination.
- ( Laughs )

1110
01:45:24,581 --> 01:45:27,072
Funny thing about Krug.

1111
01:45:27,151 --> 01:45:29,085
They have no king.

1112
01:45:29,153 --> 01:45:31,087
So guess what I've done, old friend.

1113
01:45:31,155 --> 01:45:34,750
- I dare not guess.
- I've made myselfking.

1114
01:45:34,825 --> 01:45:36,816
King of the Krug.

1115
01:45:36,894 --> 01:45:41,092
Now I serve a king
who deserves my utmost devotion.

1116
01:45:41,165 --> 01:45:42,860
- Me.
- Enough!

1117
01:45:46,670 --> 01:45:51,369
Gallian,you and I
are the last of the magi.

1118
01:45:51,442 --> 01:45:55,003
I beg you, recognize
that you have fallen into madness.

1119
01:45:58,015 --> 01:46:00,415
You have no idea...

1120
01:46:00,484 --> 01:46:02,509
how powerful...

1121
01:46:02,586 --> 01:46:04,520
madness can be.

1122
01:46:20,971 --> 01:46:22,131
( Groans Softly )

1123
01:46:26,610 --> 01:46:28,407
( Chuckles )

1124
01:46:29,780 --> 01:46:33,876
In my kingdom, there will be
no word for madness.

1125
01:46:33,951 --> 01:46:36,181
We shall simply call it...

1126
01:46:36,253 --> 01:46:38,380
- power.
- ( Groaning )

1127
01:46:51,201 --> 01:46:53,294
( men Shouting )

1128
01:46:57,841 --> 01:46:59,900
Charge!

1129
01:46:59,977 --> 01:47:02,070
( All Shouting )

1130
01:47:28,172 --> 01:47:30,106
Hmm. He's here.

1131
01:47:30,174 --> 01:47:31,607
He's arrived.

1132
01:47:32,843 --> 01:47:34,902
I see no reason to prolong this battle.

1133
01:47:36,580 --> 01:47:39,981
( Groaning Softly )
Muriella.

1134
01:47:41,718 --> 01:47:43,709
Muriella.

1135
01:48:00,571 --> 01:48:01,833
You're here.

1136
01:48:01,905 --> 01:48:04,465
I don't know how it happened.

1137
01:48:04,541 --> 01:48:08,375
How could I have been so stupid?

Farmer. Oh.!

01:51:06,594 --> 01:51:09,859
- ( Gasps )
- you've caused me a lot of worry, Farmer.

1159
01:51:15,303 --> 01:51:17,794
I understand you've become king.

1160
01:51:17,872 --> 01:51:21,364
We can't have two kings bickering
over a single kingdom, now, can we?

1161
01:51:21,442 --> 01:51:24,377
How often do two kings
get to do battle one-on-one...

1162
01:51:24,445 --> 01:51:27,175
getting to taste the blood
of one's true enemy?

1163
01:51:27,248 --> 01:51:30,513
Are you gonna fight...
or talk me to death?

1164

You wanna fight me with magic?

No!

1176
01:54:47,348 --> 01:54:51,341
What manner of vengeance
are you enjoying, Farmer?

1177
01:54:51,419 --> 01:54:54,217
The vengeance of a father,
the vengeance of a husband...

1178
01:54:54,288 --> 01:54:56,882
or the vengeance of a king?

1179
01:55:01,262 --> 01:55:03,230
- You forget the vengeance of a mother.

What's happening?

1189
01:56:21,775 --> 01:56:24,642
There's something
I've always wanted to tell you.

1190
01:56:25,679 --> 01:56:27,670
I love you.

Would you believe
in a night like this

A night like this

When visions come true

1195

Would you believe
in a tale like this

1196
01:57:42,122 --> 01:57:44,420
A lay ofbliss

1197
01:57:44,491 --> 01:57:47,426
Praising the old lore

1198
01:57:47,494 --> 01:57:53,399
Come to the blazing fire
and see me in the shadows

1199
01:57:53,467 --> 01:57:57,460
See me in the shadows

1200
01:57:57,538 --> 01:58:01,030
Songs I will sing
of runes and rings

1201
01:58:01,108 --> 01:58:05,340
Just hand me my harp
this night turns into myth

1202
01:58:05,412 --> 01:58:09,143
Nothing seems real
you soon will feel

1203
01:58:09,216 --> 01:58:12,549
The world we live in
is another skald's

Dream in the shadows

Dream in the shadows

1206
01:58:27,801 --> 01:58:31,396
Do you believe
there is sense in it

1207
01:58:31,472 --> 01:58:33,497
Is it truth or myth

1208
01:58:33,574 --> 01:58:35,735
They're one in my rhymes

1209
01:58:35,809 --> 01:58:39,472
Nobody knows the meaning behind

1210

The weaver's line

1211
01:58:41,682 --> 01:58:46,745
Well, nobody else
but the Norns can

1212
01:58:46,820 --> 01:58:50,586
See through the blazing
fires of time and

1213

All things will proceed
as the child of the hallowed

1214

Will speak to you now

See me in the shadows

1217
01:59:08,842 --> 01:59:12,778
Songs I will sing
of tribes and kings

1218
01:59:12,846 --> 01:59:16,873
The carrion bird
and the hall of the slain

Nothing seems real
you soon will feel

The world we live in
is another skald's

There's nothing to hide

1225
01:59:43,010 --> 01:59:46,912
How bitter your treason
How bitter the lie

1226
01:59:46,980 --> 01:59:51,280
Remember the runes
and remember the light

1227

All I ever want
is to be at your side

1228
01:59:55,022 --> 01:59:56,956
We'll gladden the raven

1229
01:59:57,024 --> 02:00:00,824
Now I will run through
the blazing fires

1230
02:00:00,894 --> 02:00:03,192
That's my choice

Pale-face the innocent

Will drown in blood

1237

Hurt and withdrawn

1238
02:00:43,337 --> 02:00:47,296
Don't ever steal my grief

1239
02:00:47,374 --> 02:00:50,901
In this haze of green and gold

1240
02:00:50,978 --> 02:00:52,946
He's gone

1241
02:00:53,013 --> 02:00:56,661
Blind my eyes and I still can see

1242
02:00:56,795 --> 02:00:59,355
Through the mist to the very end

1243
02:00:59,431 --> 02:01:02,594
There I'll face what I fear the most

1244
02:01:02,667 --> 02:01:08,469
Blind my eyes
But it all doesn't matter right now

1245
02:01:08,540 --> 02:01:11,031
I will bury my dead

1246
02:01:11,109 --> 02:01:15,102
And keep on till the end

1247

I won't give up

I won't give up

1249
02:01:20,752 --> 02:01:25,212
I'll turn to the red fiields of none

1250
02:01:25,290 --> 02:01:27,224
There's a grave

1251

There's a rose

- Drift away
- I can hear me say

1253

Soon you all shall be free

1254

Carry the blessed home

1255
02:01:41,039 --> 02:01:43,405
No one's left here but me

1256
02:01:43,475 --> 02:01:48,378
And I will sing out your name

1257

Call me insane I know

1258

I've opened my heart
and my soul to you, son

So pale turns the innocent

Through the mist to the very end

1266

There I'll face what I fear the most

But it all doesn't matter right now
