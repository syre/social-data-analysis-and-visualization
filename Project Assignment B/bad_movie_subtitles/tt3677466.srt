00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,778
No, I'm Lindsey not left alone.

3
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,881
No, the dog is there.

4
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:52,184
Sue, do not you think you're overreacting?

5
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:56,555
Lindsey is almost 17, she'll be fine.

6
00:00:57,224 --> 00:01:01,727
I know it's my weekend with her.
I'll make it up to her, okay?

7
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:06,332
Hello?
Sue? Damn.

Hi, this is the voice of Lindsey Meher.

9
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:37,263
If you are important, leave a message.
Unless you're Jerry, you can fuck off.

10
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:41,667
Hi Lind here, Dad.
Please change your voicemail.

11
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:44,904
I want to make it up to you,
because I have to work today.

12
00:01:44,906 --> 00:01:49,108
Shall we go to the movies tonight?
I'll see if I can get home first.

13
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:54,580
And do not forget to feed the dog.
And why do not you just stay home tonight?

14
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:57,716
The last time you went was your mobile
empty long enough...

15
00:01:57,899 --> 00:01:59,927
to drunk to get home.

16
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:03,768
The next time your mother will kill me.

17
00:02:03,968 --> 00:02:06,859
I will continue again love you.

18
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,999
Will you tell me what is so important
what you could not say about the phone

19
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:17,169
Last night a meteor storm
a lot of damage in the country.

20
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:18,496
Not something we can not handle.

21
00:02:18,635 --> 00:02:19,787
But Colonel...
- What?

22
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:21,807
We have bigger problems.

23
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:24,167
General Magowan, how bad is the situation?

24
00:02:24,347 --> 00:02:27,680
Mac, the president is so concerned that my
phone keeps going.

25
00:02:27,682 --> 00:02:29,281
The Pentagon running scenarios.

26
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:32,585
Their expert,
any physicist will be here soon.

27
00:02:32,587 --> 00:02:37,356
I already said, my name is Dr.. Gordon.
I have the General speak.

28
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:38,791
Dr. Gordon...

29
00:02:38,793 --> 00:02:42,127
Have you come through security?
- Look, he knows who I am.

30
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,196
Sorry, I'm late.

31
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:49,033
Gentlemen, the last ten years, I kept
contacts between NASA and the U.S. Army.

32
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:52,238
To bring them up to date
potential near Earth objects.

33
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:57,877
And when I see it, there will be a great this way.
- My God, how big is it?

34
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:02,615
With all due respect, if it so was the
size of a satellite, I was not here.

35
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,917
This is a quarter of our moon.

36
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:09,555
We are talking about the end of time.
And life as we know it.

37
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,976
And based on his speed, I say...

38
00:03:11,977 --> 00:03:16,017
- Will it last for 48 hours until
it collides with the earth.

39
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,332
Get yourself a cup of coffee for the colonel.
- You got it.

40
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:24,069
Check out the seriousness of the situation.
- Yes, sir.

41
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:27,773
I have to keep this thing in mind.
I will keep you informed.

42
00:03:27,775 --> 00:03:33,112
Mac, you have the best educated people.
Now we need the best.

43
00:03:33,114 --> 00:03:37,783
There must be one of us fly to that rock,
and get him out of the course of the earth.

44
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:40,686
Captain Captain James Wheeler is coming.
Are you familiar with this mission?

45
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:44,323
Heard that he is negligent.
Has anyone lost on his last mission.

46
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:47,192
Decide that, but once he is.

47
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:52,097
Now we have to spend a great alarm.
People move to bunkers and shelters.

48
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:55,034
God help us.
- Yes.

49
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:08,013
Had to happen again on my day off.

50
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:11,216
Sorry, Chris. five men did not show up.
They have not even been called.

51
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,789
The meteor shower keeps us pretty busy.
There are fires all over the city.

52
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:24,063
I want injectors that windows there.
- Come on.

53
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:28,801
Is there anyone inside?
- No, LAPD said everyone was out.

54
00:04:30,705 --> 00:04:31,904
I do not think so.

55
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,248
Are you ready, boy?
- Yeah, you old?

56
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,084
Let's look up the heat.

57
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,288
Did you get him?
- We need reinforcements.

58
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,958
There is no gain, just us.
- Great.

59
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:55,704
Hurry up, we do not have much time.

60
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:58,796
I heard screaming, she should be here.

61
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:09,742
The fire, is anyone here?
- It's safe.

62
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:18,818
We must find that woman now.
- I know, is anyone here?

63
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:22,187
Check those rooms.

64
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,446
Safe.

65
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:37,336
Where is she?
- She's not here.

66
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,873
Upwards.

67
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,244
Come on, it's coming here, hurry up.

68
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:57,923
There she is.
Stay there, we'll come get you.

69
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:01,460
Sully.

70
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,869
Is it?
- I do not know, I think it's broken.

71
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,306
Yes, it's broken.

72
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:19,111
We need to get you out of here, come on.
- What are you gonna do, go after her yourself?

73
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:22,014
What do you do to stop me?
Come on, let's go.

74
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,919
It will be okay.

75
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:31,857
We're almost there.

76
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,961
Help him, his leg is broken.

77
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:39,758
I go back inside.
- Chris, what are you doing?

78
00:06:39,928 --> 00:06:41,533
Is he crazy, the roof collapses so.

79
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:49,775
Why does it take so long?
- Come on, Chris.

80
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,281
I see him, look.

81
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:05,924
Is it?
- Yes.

82
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:13,065
What did you do?
- The elevator was broken.

83
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,502
How's the leg?
- Are you better.

84
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,674
Good thing we
short path names are not.

85
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,576
Excuse me, General?
Colonel.

86
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,579
Captain Wheeler, thanks for coming.

87
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:30,249
Do you know Colonel McCanless?
- Only through hear say.

88
00:07:30,251 --> 00:07:33,886
I heard that he was the best pilot
of the Air Force.

89
00:07:33,888 --> 00:07:36,622
We're glad you could come as soon as
in the short term.

90
00:07:36,624 --> 00:07:40,314
I think I had little choice.
You are always very pushy.

91
00:07:40,514 --> 00:07:42,895
But I can be very clear.

92
00:07:42,897 --> 00:07:46,498
Whatever it is.
It is no.

93
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,167
I'm done.

94
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,029
Ready?

95
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:54,212
Why are you still wearing that
medallions, captain?

96
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:03,949
I said, I'm done.
- He's very confident.

97
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:09,054
How long will you torture yourself?

98
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,523
It's been two years ago.

99
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:16,995
You're a man lost
and you have multiple saved.

100
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,031
That means nothing.

101
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:23,969
There's nothing I can do to change it.
- Saving the lives of billions?

102
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:31,476
Why am I here?
- The meteor storm that sweeps away the world.

103
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:35,280
At present, there is a huge
asteroid towards the Earth.

104
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:40,385
We have been told that if he takes...

105
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:42,421
nothing will live more.

106
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:45,257
Do we have your attention now?

107
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,461
What do you want me to do?

108
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:53,812
We want you to go there, dig, and
explosives plant and that thing blows up...

109
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:57,202
before it is on the earth.
- How much time do we have

110
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:59,304
Impact in 46 hours.

111
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:08,714
I'm afraid this is a time sensitive situation.
So we have a quick response.

112
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:12,217
If I do this...
- It will not happen as before.

113
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:17,256
We will not send you behind enemy lines.
- It's more that you send me to hell.

114
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,091
Jim.

115
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:21,460
Please.

116
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:23,962
We need your help.

117
00:09:24,198 --> 00:09:28,510
He can watch the world burn-whether he
can do something to change it.

118
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,236
My mission...

119
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:35,107
My team.
No exceptions.

120
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:44,416
Are you sure about him, General?

121
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:47,552
Sometimes, Colonel, you have
rely on your faith.

122
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,099
At ease.

123
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:04,636
General Magowan.
Sergeant Clayton, exploration.

124
00:10:07,141 --> 00:10:09,174
Corporal Cabrera, explosives.

125
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,345
Lieutenant Southard, communication.

126
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:17,582
Fitzpatrick and Sanchez, pilots.

127
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:20,285
General...

128
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,220
Meet the Roughnecks.

129
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,226
Al relieved?
- That's me, when you get back.

130
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,701
Captain Wheeler.

131
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:41,329
I want you to meet Dr. Gordon.

132
00:10:41,501 --> 00:10:44,676
Pentagons most brilliant physicist.
- . I just do not know about that

133
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:49,247
If it saves, Doc.
- Nice to meet you, Captain Wheeler.

134
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,583
I'll show you. Your shuttle

135
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,690
The SI-22: Astraeus.

136
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:12,637
The Astraeus is made as interceptor
with satellite and space emergencies.

137
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,774
We filled up her
for exactly one trip. So...

138
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:18,543
So do not take the scenic route with her.

139
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:24,616
There are things and drawings for which you
have to dig and explosives should be placed.

140
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:28,153
Do we get any weapons?
- For the asteroid? No.

141
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:32,665
However, for safety reasons, there is a
closed briefcase with weapons.

142
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:35,950
We do not make you trigger-happy.

143
00:11:36,103 --> 00:11:39,956
Great, so we got tickets to the end
of the world, but we have no weapons.

144
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:44,619
Do not worry, the government will be your
richly rewarding.

145
00:11:44,675 --> 00:11:46,271
How richly?
- Three.

146
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,907
A hundred thousand?
- Million.

147
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:52,744
Start the thing though, I'm ready.

148
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:59,551
Okay, let's do this.
- Pack but.

149
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:02,754
I think we see each other there.
- We?

150
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:04,689
Yes...

151
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:08,293
Unless you know someone who these rock
formations knows better than I do.

152
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:10,262
I mean, if you know that's that cool.

153
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,617
"We" will be.

154
00:12:11,802 --> 00:12:13,909
You did not think that I
gladly would give.

155
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:18,603
Get her out of there quietly.
I just brushed her.

156
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,170
Launch in less than five minutes.

157
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,582
Do you think you understand this?

158
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:36,607
Sure, after a 30-minute crash course to
a trillion government unit to control...

159
00:12:36,787 --> 00:12:39,791
I get it.
- I thought so

160
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:41,860
Buckle up, everyone.

161
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:44,496
Taking off in 30 seconds.

162
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:47,299
If you arrive at the rock there may
be problems with the radio contact.

163
00:12:47,301 --> 00:12:50,635
That's why we have these satellite
beacon to to amplify signal.

164
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:52,204
Great.

165
00:12:57,844 --> 00:13:00,499
I hope it is tight enough.

166
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,549
Are you ready?

167
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:07,075
You know I'm ready.
- You were born ready.

168
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,873
They also have drinks on this flight?

169
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,631
We made it.

170
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:56,268
Not yet, we still have a while.

171
00:13:57,737 --> 00:13:59,871
That was a ride.

172
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:05,810
That can not be good.

173
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,018
What the hell is that?
Talk to me.

174
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:16,821
Our set course is not good. We are on
a collision course with the asteroid.

175
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:18,857
That is not logical.

176
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:22,561
Based on the speed we knew what
Our journey had to be gently countries.

177
00:14:22,563 --> 00:14:25,864
It seems that it's slowing down.
- What?

178
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:27,799
His estimated distance
has been established with the earth.

179
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:31,536
It inhibits slowly.
- At least.

180
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:34,873
Everyone back in your seats.
- Why?

181
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:38,009
We're going too fast, it can be rough.
- Hold on.

182
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,398
Turn the thrusters on.

183
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,146
Come on.

184
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:42,574
Do you pee in your pants?
- Do normal.

185
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:48,580
What's this? Gonzo's rock?

186
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:51,483
Team, all listen.

187
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:56,488
You all have the coordinates.

188
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,724
Find your target, and mark them
with a traceerstaaf.

189
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:01,259
Roger that, sir.

190
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:03,261
Clayton, you're boring.

191
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:07,098
Cabrera and Southard, you go back to the
vessel and make the finished explosives.

192
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,800
Stay together.

193
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:11,870
Fitzpatrick and Sanchez, you
make the shuttle ready to take off.

194
00:16:11,872 --> 00:16:13,705
Understood, Captain.

195
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:15,507
The clock is ticking.

196
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:18,576
Team at work.
- Roger that, sir.

197
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:20,779
Okay, let's go.

198
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:29,354
Do not look at me, she's your tourist.

199
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,802
I start here.

200
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:51,676
An asteroid tooth root treatment
the move, Captain.

201
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:03,121
That is strange.
- What is it?

202
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:07,125
I drill, but I'm only 15 meters.

203
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:09,494
It will be a tough chore
to get deeper.

204
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:12,731
That is not deep enough.
- Go on.

205
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,065
Roger that, sir.

206
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:20,004
Come on, we should mark more points.
- It is curious.

207
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:24,676
What?
- There.

208
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:28,513
See that?
- A cave.

209
00:17:28,582 --> 00:17:34,933
If there is a passage, there may be also
a cave that leads us to the epicenter.

210
00:17:35,115 --> 00:17:39,190
We can load sites there, having
We do not dig to destroy this thing.

211
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,829
Team...

212
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:48,933
we examine a cave since
that a potentially explosive point can be.

213
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:52,204
Keep going.
- What, a cave?

214
00:17:52,388 --> 00:17:56,835
Be careful, we are next
landed a cliff, so watch out.

215
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,234
This way.
- Take it easy, Doc.

216
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:46,024
Captain James?
- What you got?

217
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:50,728
Look.

218
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,701
This is not logical.

219
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,606
Captain, do you read me?
- Go ahead, Southard.

220
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:04,309
There's something here.
- What?

221
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:06,744
Cabrera and I were on our coordinates
marking and...

222
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:08,246
And what?

223
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:13,618
Something moved, there was a shadow passed.
- Debris?

224
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:15,854
Captain, where are you?

225
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,723
Get ready, boys.

226
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:34,706
What the hell is this?

227
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,642
This is strange.

228
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:49,787
I think this is nothing.
- I've never seen anything like it.

229
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,323
What is that?

230
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,293
Do not.

231
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,034
Okay, this is not an asteroid.

232
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:06,004
Everyone, fall back to the ship.

233
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:10,141
This whole thing goes back and forth.

234
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,919
Spring quickly.

235
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:24,255
Spring.

236
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,859
I got you.

237
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,194
Good work, kid.

238
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:33,197
What the hell is going on?
- . I do not know

239
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:37,035
My god, go.

240
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:39,904
What is that?

241
00:20:41,174 --> 00:20:44,382
Command Center, there's going to be
hundreds bogey the atmosphere of the earth.

242
00:20:44,523 --> 00:20:46,244
Can you repeat that, Astraeus?

243
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:50,181
Enemy planes, you get that?
Warn everyone.

244
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:54,308
Thirty kilometers from
Saint-Guilhem-le-Desert, France

245
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:23,214
What was that?

246
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:42,934
My God.

247
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:30,114
Please.

248
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:31,916
Not now.

249
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:35,486
Come on.

250
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:59,177
No.

251
00:23:09,923 --> 00:23:13,858
That's enough excitement for one day.
- Yeah, just relax.

252
00:23:26,205 --> 00:23:29,974
Have you seen anything like this before?
- What is that?

253
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:36,247
Station 2-4-9, Hansen here, do you copy?
You see this?

254
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:42,220
You drive too fast, stop.
- Watch out.

255
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:46,924
Turn your engine off.

256
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,929
Turn your engine off.
- I'll call you right back.

257
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,369
What is going on here?
- This is a limited area.

258
00:23:58,371 --> 00:24:00,638
What are you talking about, our barracks
is only one block away.

259
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:06,043
We have orders to everyone
to move. safe bunker

260
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:08,179
Moving?
Under whose authority?

261
00:24:08,181 --> 00:24:10,515
That's classified information.

262
00:24:10,517 --> 00:24:14,105
So go back in your truck and I let somebody
our escort you.

263
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:25,263
Captain, what's going on?
- An invasion.

264
00:24:25,265 --> 00:24:28,332
What's all the fuss?
- This is not what you think it is.

265
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:31,502
You're kidding. We gotta get out
of here as soon as possible.

266
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:47,151
Sanchez... Fitzpatrick...

267
00:24:49,388 --> 00:24:51,556
Enemies backwards.

268
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:54,926
Walk.

269
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:58,863
Clayton.

270
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:02,466
Keep going.

271
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,241
I got you, bitch.

272
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:16,047
Everyone to the cave.
- What, I'm not going in there.

273
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,216
Cabrera, lie.

274
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:21,327
Captain, help me.

275
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:27,425
Cabrera.

276
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:31,596
Come on, I do not think she's dead.

277
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,800
It does not look promising.
- We're trapped.

278
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:54,051
What are you doing?

279
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:57,622
There has to be some other way.
- Take cover.

280
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:01,425
How did you do that?

281
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:04,228
I think it's the same thing happened to
Cabrera happened.

282
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:10,001
I think they have found a way
to teleport, or a wormhole or something.

283
00:26:10,003 --> 00:26:13,337
Earth to Wheeler...
They do not give up.

284
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:18,009
It's our only way out.
See you on the other side.

285
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,646
Where did she go?
- She's crazy.

286
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:24,348
Maybe not, go.
- What?

287
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,484
I was wrong, you're crazy.
- I said, go.

288
00:26:26,486 --> 00:26:29,186
Roger, let's go, Clayton.

289
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,503
It going, guys?

290
00:26:45,505 --> 00:26:48,172
I think so.
- I'm doing well.

291
00:26:48,174 --> 00:26:49,573
Where are my men?

292
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:57,081
Do not shoot.
- I do not shoot at you.

293
00:27:58,377 --> 00:28:00,411
That thing comes around.

294
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:07,351
Where did he go?

295
00:28:13,392 --> 00:28:16,127
Hide.

296
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:29,507
Damn, it's above the truck.

297
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:35,413
What are those things?

298
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:39,517
I do not know, I could not see well.
- They have destroyed the radio.

299
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:42,253
And killed my men.
- Great.

300
00:28:42,322 --> 00:28:48,592
Whatever they are, they patrol.
And turn off all possible threats.

301
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:52,496
I can not see.
- That's because we are under a truck.

302
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:55,299
Wait a minute.

303
00:28:55,301 --> 00:28:57,468
It's Lindsey.

304
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:58,803
Lindsey.

305
00:28:58,805 --> 00:29:02,206
Dad, I'm so sorry.
Will you pick me up? On

306
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:05,309
They came out of nowhere,
and now we're trapped.

307
00:29:05,311 --> 00:29:09,513
Where are you? Are you okay?
- I'm fine, there are other people here.

308
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:12,716
What do you mean?
You're not at home, where are you?

309
00:29:12,718 --> 00:29:18,255
I'm in the city.
Dad, what's going on? I'm afraid.

310
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:20,658
We hear noises, screaming and I...

311
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:26,110
I know where you are,
locking yourself and avoid...

312
00:29:26,254 --> 00:29:27,631
windows and doors, okay?

313
00:29:28,701 --> 00:29:30,401
Now tell me exactly where you are.

314
00:29:30,403 --> 00:29:35,239
They rushed to an old
office building near Union Station...

315
00:29:35,241 --> 00:29:38,342
Dad, what are those things?

316
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:41,545
They are dead, because I'm
coming to get you now.

317
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,280
Sit tight, all right.

318
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:46,650
I love you, Dad.
- I love you too.

319
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:55,826
What's the plan?

320
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:59,463
Major?
- Blake.

321
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:02,166
Chris Meher.
- Nice to meet you.

322
00:30:03,235 --> 00:30:04,388
Listen...

323
00:30:05,369 --> 00:30:10,541
They have surrounded us,
but I think they're leaving here.

324
00:30:10,543 --> 00:30:12,776
I think we can go
come through that side.

325
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:15,713
And I can see the weapons that we have in
bring security.

326
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:20,451
What's the plan, boss?
- I'll go get my daughter.

327
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,588
His daughter is not worth it.
- She is not so nice.

328
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,504
Dad, where are you?

329
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,482
No, go away.

330
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:57,915
Come on.

331
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,800
Glad you could come upon us. Party
- Where are we?

332
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,537
I thought we were coming.

333
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:24,375
Look at that.

334
00:32:31,383 --> 00:32:33,350
This is not South-central.

335
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:34,885
What did I tell you?

336
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:39,723
These things have a technology
which is bigger than ours.

337
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,693
They have come to Earth
through wormholes.

338
00:32:42,695 --> 00:32:45,462
That's nice, but how do we get back?

339
00:32:47,499 --> 00:32:49,333
Good question.

340
00:32:49,335 --> 00:32:52,436
It is not that we can call for help.
Our transmitters do not work here.

341
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:59,043
Sure we can.

342
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:04,715
We can use this beacon to us
strengthen signal and sending. SOS

343
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:11,655
But it's only for a transmission.
- Yeah, do it.

344
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:14,758
It will take some time to recharge.

345
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,629
Give it an hour.
- Beautiful, go ahead.

346
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:29,707
Nobody leaves here
without my permission, you understand?

347
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:53,764
What are you, smart guy?

348
00:33:53,766 --> 00:33:57,067
We are on an unknown planet,
You do not even know if there is oxygen.

349
00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:06,844
Do not worry, you can breathe.

350
00:34:06,846 --> 00:34:08,779
Crazy girl.

351
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:24,161
That smells good.

352
00:34:26,698 --> 00:34:28,198
I miss Los Angeles.

353
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:32,102
Captain, you should see this.

354
00:34:34,973 --> 00:34:37,441
I think we are in their backyard.

355
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,183
Damn.

356
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:54,158
That's not all.
We are not the only ones here.

357
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:06,236
They gather people.

358
00:35:08,907 --> 00:35:13,010
Doc, that should really take an hour?
- Unfortunately, yes.

359
00:35:16,482 --> 00:35:19,217
We'll send an SOS.
And hope they come soon.

360
00:35:19,919 --> 00:35:23,787
That's a long wait.
- And time for those things to find us.

361
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:27,191
Wait... And those people?
- What about them, we gotta get outta here.

362
00:35:27,193 --> 00:35:29,493
Sure, and where?

363
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:48,045
Pack up, we're leaving.
- Where to?

364
00:35:48,047 --> 00:35:50,247
We go down and we save those people.

365
00:35:50,249 --> 00:35:54,184
Are you crazy? What about us?
- Stand down, Lieutenant.

366
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:57,955
These are innocent people who
need our help.

367
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:05,295
The rest can follow me or stay here
with their thumbs up their asses.

368
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:09,800
I said pack.
- Got it.

369
00:36:12,237 --> 00:36:14,838
Can I have a gun?

370
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:21,178
Thank you.

371
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:24,281
We're going.

372
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:41,798
Try this, the bigger they are
the harder they fall.

373
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:51,275
Come over here.
Come and get it.

374
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:53,310
Precisely, they pick Blake.

375
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,187
Here you are.

376
00:37:14,767 --> 00:37:17,267
I'm glad I lie here.

377
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:18,635
Come on.

378
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:28,145
Deb, where is Shawn?

379
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:33,417
Where did you see him last?
He can not just disappear.

380
00:37:33,419 --> 00:37:35,719
I can not go home until they are returned.

381
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:39,990
There are fires in the city.
Call the police.

382
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:43,093
Try again.

383
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:48,398
Honey, stop crying.
We'll find him.

384
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,866
I promise.

385
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:13,290
I hope you know which way we should go.
We can not keep running around. So

386
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:15,192
Do not worry, we're close.

387
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:18,962
Come on.

388
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:29,439
Holy Mary, are you okay?
- Not quite.

389
00:38:29,574 --> 00:38:31,775
Tim, thank God you're alive.

390
00:38:31,943 --> 00:38:35,812
What's all the fuss?
- It is the end of the world.

391
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:38,815
It must be, I have all day
seen one yet.

392
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:42,686
The others took the only working.
That there are gear is broken.

393
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,454
We have to use my truck.

394
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,390
We will avenge us.

395
00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:56,700
Where's the fire?
- I'm going to find my daughter.

396
00:38:57,125 --> 00:39:02,005
And there are some foreigners not so friendly.
If I were you I would arm me.

397
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:05,442
Are you serious?

398
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:10,414
My family, I have my family.

399
00:39:10,416 --> 00:39:13,050
I must go to my family.
- Tim.

400
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,252
Come with us.

401
00:39:15,254 --> 00:39:18,221
If it is as bad as you say, then I
gather my family.

402
00:39:18,223 --> 00:39:20,442
If the grid
not working I have to go.

403
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:24,861
Stay focused, and be careful.

404
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:28,365
Good luck, Chris.
- Take care of yourself, Tim.

405
00:39:29,086 --> 00:39:33,837
Chris, I can not thank you enough.
I must return to the base.

406
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,406
It's war.
- Give them hell.

407
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,290
You drive.

408
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:43,146
Sully...

409
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:50,787
Let's put this back.
- Let's do it, boss.

410
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:52,549
Captain, what is it?

411
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:55,039
There.

412
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:00,123
Where?

413
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,200
What does it do?

414
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:12,836
What's going on?

415
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:17,941
Something is not right.
- What? How do you know?

416
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:19,976
They are hunting us.

417
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,113
And that there is bait.

418
00:41:24,382 --> 00:41:26,950
The rest will surround us.

419
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,858
Instructions, Captain?
- Racing...

420
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,494
as fast as you can.

421
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:53,009
This way.

422
00:42:41,158 --> 00:42:44,327
It's gone.
- Jesus.

423
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:48,365
My heart keeps pounding.

424
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:53,603
It's war.
Get used to it.

425
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:15,060
Is it?

426
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:19,729
I should have. Never her alone

427
00:43:20,231 --> 00:43:21,564
Chris, come on.

428
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,168
If only she looks anything like you,
then she is okay.

429
00:43:26,137 --> 00:43:28,738
She wants to be anything but me.

430
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:33,710
I'm no promises.
I'm never there.

431
00:43:36,314 --> 00:43:38,315
Do not worry, we'll find her.

432
00:43:42,153 --> 00:43:44,120
We're going to find her.

433
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,455
Okay?

434
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,462
Guys, we have visitors.

435
00:43:53,632 --> 00:43:56,366
Come on, faster.
- Hold on.

436
00:43:56,368 --> 00:43:58,268
Lose him.

437
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,717
Chris, when did you last checked?

438
00:44:19,224 --> 00:44:21,725
Will, now get us out of here.
- Hold on.

439
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:24,160
Chris, look out.

440
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:29,065
Thank you.

441
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:30,700
Now we're even.

442
00:44:32,771 --> 00:44:36,406
Jesus, they Sullivan.
- That thing keeps following me.

443
00:44:36,408 --> 00:44:37,718
Keep your eyes on the road

444
00:44:42,447 --> 00:44:46,082
The brakes do not work.
- What do you mean?

445
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:58,895
Guys, be ready to jump.
- We're going to jump.

446
00:44:58,897 --> 00:45:01,297
What do you mean?
- We're going to jump.

447
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:25,355
Are you ready?
- I'm not going to jump.

448
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,883
It's okay guys, do not worry.
- I do not want to spoil your style.

449
00:46:16,474 --> 00:46:17,907
This is unbelievable.

450
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,906
You go where we go.
Whether you are left alone.

451
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:26,776
Sorry.
- That does not, just be smart.

452
00:47:57,441 --> 00:48:00,343
What are you doing it?
- Let's go get them.

453
00:48:00,345 --> 00:48:03,546
He was already dead, we could
not do anything do for him.

454
00:48:03,548 --> 00:48:05,848
And we do not know how
many there are even more.

455
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:10,753
We have to be smart.
- Guys, can you keep your mouth shut.

456
00:48:21,132 --> 00:48:22,632
Come on, bitch.

457
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:27,637
Southard.

458
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:35,178
Cabera.

459
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:40,583
Backwards.

460
00:49:01,538 --> 00:49:05,675
Did you see anything?
- No, it's safe, come on, let's go.

461
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,812
Where is your daughter, Chris?
- The block.

462
00:49:09,814 --> 00:49:11,447
Let us take you there.

463
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:14,651
Oh, no.
- Should we withdraw?

464
00:49:14,653 --> 00:49:17,086
No, therein.

465
00:49:28,032 --> 00:49:30,033
Come on, quick.

466
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:37,740
Hide yourself.

467
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:43,846
Do you think it does not come in here?

468
00:49:54,591 --> 00:49:56,392
That must be a yes.

469
00:50:06,437 --> 00:50:09,105
Chris, what do we do?
- We need that thing to lose.

470
00:50:09,107 --> 00:50:10,673
How?

471
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:20,450
What are you doing?

472
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:22,452
Come on, let's go.

473
00:50:47,845 --> 00:50:48,945
Watch out.

474
00:51:11,903 --> 00:51:15,471
Find your daughter.

475
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:39,729
What is the reason that I'm here?

476
00:51:40,531 --> 00:51:43,866
The meteor shower that
Earth's destroying...

477
00:51:44,902 --> 00:51:47,103
nothing will stay alive...

478
00:51:47,538 --> 00:51:49,939
We do not send you back
enemy lines...

479
00:51:49,941 --> 00:51:53,142
but something like go to hell...

480
00:51:53,144 --> 00:51:55,778
And what about all those people?
- What's wrong with them?

481
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,647
We have to leave here.

482
00:51:57,649 --> 00:51:59,015
We go there
and will save them...

483
00:51:59,017 --> 00:52:01,217
Are you crazy?

484
00:52:01,219 --> 00:52:02,752
Southard.

485
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:06,889
Cabrera.
Go back, go back.

486
00:52:06,891 --> 00:52:10,660
Humanity needs you...

487
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:20,002
Who's there?

488
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,911
Who's there?

489
00:52:33,116 --> 00:52:34,851
What are you doing it?

490
00:52:35,786 --> 00:52:37,520
I'll get you out of here.

491
00:52:38,689 --> 00:52:39,922
Why?

492
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:44,994
To bring you. Safety

493
00:52:44,996 --> 00:52:48,364
This place?
Their?

494
00:52:48,366 --> 00:52:51,701
Come on. I'm going to get you out of here.
It's all good.

495
00:52:51,703 --> 00:52:57,874
Please, you do not understand.
They have my children taken away.

496
00:53:02,247 --> 00:53:04,180
They have slain me.
- Stop.

497
00:53:04,182 --> 00:53:06,175
But I'm still alive.

498
00:53:06,251 --> 00:53:08,651
Stop, I can not do that.

499
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:12,788
Please.

500
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:14,857
I can not.

501
00:53:15,726 --> 00:53:17,159
I will not do that.

502
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:22,164
Do you have children?
Well?

503
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:27,603
If it were, you would understand.
They are your life.

504
00:53:28,238 --> 00:53:31,340
Your reason to live for.

505
00:53:31,342 --> 00:53:32,942
Sorry.
- Please.

506
00:53:32,944 --> 00:53:34,310
Sorry.

507
00:53:37,226 --> 00:53:43,642
If it was not for me, do it for
Ashley, Annie, and George.

508
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:48,991
You remind me of them.

509
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:52,929
Please.

510
00:54:03,707 --> 00:54:05,074
Please.

511
00:55:29,026 --> 00:55:30,192
Gordon.

512
00:55:31,067 --> 00:55:33,467
Captain. They keep us trapped here.
Fast. Get me out of here.

513
00:55:33,523 --> 00:55:34,830
It's locked.

514
00:55:37,135 --> 00:55:38,334
Wait a minute.

515
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,978
My God. Clayton.

516
00:56:02,893 --> 00:56:04,293
Focus your hood.

517
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:09,231
There is still hope for you.

518
00:56:12,102 --> 00:56:17,339
You and Doc escape.

519
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:22,411
Launch the beacon.

520
00:56:23,514 --> 00:56:25,848
There is still hope for us all.

521
00:56:27,084 --> 00:56:28,818
Captain?

522
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:30,786
They can not see you.

523
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:32,488
You have to go here.

524
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:36,992
They'll kill you.
At the worst possible way.

525
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:43,499
Hide.

526
00:56:44,034 --> 00:56:46,469
I'm sorry soldier.
- Hide.

527
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:07,089
Stay away from him.

528
00:57:09,226 --> 00:57:11,060
Leave him alone.

529
00:57:20,637 --> 00:57:23,205
Can you understand me?

530
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:26,342
Kun...

531
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,012
Can you?

532
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:34,283
You're not gonna do it, do not you?

533
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:39,488
You really need to run to
that beacon of here.

534
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:45,594
Do it.
Pdf here.

535
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:54,303
Come on.
Do it.

536
00:57:54,437 --> 00:57:55,638
Come on.

537
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:59,341
No. Do not.

538
00:58:40,383 --> 00:58:44,253
No. Watch out.

539
00:58:48,992 --> 00:58:50,492
How long has it been?

540
00:58:50,494 --> 00:58:53,229
Nearly six hours since Captain Wheeler
his last broadcast.

541
00:58:53,231 --> 00:58:56,365
Slightly more than eight since you
loss of SI-22 confirmed.

542
00:58:56,367 --> 00:58:59,368
Stay on top down.
Continue scanning for their distress.

543
00:59:01,189 --> 00:59:04,139
We men are gathering for the attack,
but we need more.

544
00:59:04,141 --> 00:59:05,407
Do you think Captain Wheeler's team...

545
00:59:05,409 --> 00:59:07,509
We spent hours ago
Radio contact lost.

546
00:59:07,511 --> 00:59:09,311
Further civilian survivors?

547
00:59:09,313 --> 00:59:12,381
Not much.
There is no telling how many there are.

548
00:59:12,383 --> 00:59:17,987
With your permission, I would like all the
trained soldiers prepare for the attack.

549
00:59:17,989 --> 00:59:19,688
Permission?

550
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:23,659
We are talking about the past
chance to save our civilization.

551
00:59:23,661 --> 00:59:26,362
Our lives, our world.

552
00:59:26,364 --> 00:59:29,465
This is not war, this is survival.

553
00:59:29,467 --> 00:59:30,766
Take as many as you can.

554
00:59:30,768 --> 00:59:32,568
Yes, sir.

555
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:02,298
Follow me. Come on.

556
01:00:02,732 --> 01:00:04,566
Leave a message...
- Damn.

557
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:22,284
Quickly. Grab something to block.

558
01:00:24,555 --> 01:00:26,388
Ren.

559
01:00:28,224 --> 01:00:29,658
Come on, Lindsey.

560
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:36,699
Lindsey.

561
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,034
Lindsey.

562
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:41,751
Pa?

563
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:52,114
Lindsey.

564
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:02,992
No.

565
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:11,300
No. Damn.

566
01:01:24,714 --> 01:01:27,282
Lindsey.

567
01:01:30,654 --> 01:01:32,388
Lindsey.

568
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:36,425
Sir, we vacate the area.
Come with us. Then you are safe.

569
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:14,316
Stop.

570
01:04:44,314 --> 01:04:46,014
Chris. Hey. Meher.

571
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:50,452
You got through it.
I can not believe it.

572
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:56,091
The rest of my team,
who had not. happiness

573
01:04:56,093 --> 01:04:57,793
Your daughter?

574
01:04:59,762 --> 01:05:03,932
Away.
Included.

575
01:05:04,867 --> 01:05:06,568
You're here now.

576
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:10,038
If someone can keep safe
we will.

577
01:05:12,675 --> 01:05:15,577
I do not think there
a safe place.

578
01:05:37,634 --> 01:05:39,568
You are still alive.

579
01:05:39,702 --> 01:05:41,670
I thought they had slain you.

580
01:05:43,806 --> 01:05:45,574
What have they done to you?

581
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:47,676
I know their plan.

582
01:05:48,111 --> 01:05:49,845
They show you?

583
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:51,880
She told me.

584
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:57,552
They?
- Their queen.

585
01:05:59,589 --> 01:06:04,993
She came into my head,
and she told me.

586
01:06:08,431 --> 01:06:11,600
They are a dying breed.

587
01:06:12,902 --> 01:06:16,104
Visits planet planet
to collect for her.

588
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:23,045
Their last queen.
And they keep her alive.

589
01:06:24,447 --> 01:06:26,081
My God.

590
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:28,917
I've seen her plan.

591
01:06:31,421 --> 01:06:33,588
And we're all going to die.

592
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:38,160
No. You should not give up.
Listen, I need you.

593
01:06:38,162 --> 01:06:41,430
We still have the beacon.
It should be. Now charged

594
01:06:41,432 --> 01:06:45,567
We can contact the command center.
Tell them to come here.

595
01:06:45,868 --> 01:06:48,737
And these bastards where they live.

596
01:06:48,871 --> 01:06:50,072
How?

597
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:53,642
Stay strong with me.

598
01:07:05,555 --> 01:07:08,056
Southard.
- Captain...

599
01:07:08,058 --> 01:07:13,995
Is it?
- No, tell me that there is a plan.

600
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:15,831
We are working on it.

601
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:19,995
My God...

602
01:08:27,871 --> 01:08:30,705
Suffocate it, asshole.

603
01:08:34,544 --> 01:08:35,777
James.

604
01:08:36,546 --> 01:08:38,980
Hold on.
- It hurts.

605
01:08:38,982 --> 01:08:41,983
I'll get you out of here.
- My head hurts.

606
01:08:43,554 --> 01:08:49,057
No. Get out of here.
Get out of here.

607
01:09:54,824 --> 01:09:59,194
Command Center, this is Captain James Wheeler.
Do you read me? About.

608
01:10:00,997 --> 01:10:04,633
Command Center, this is Captain James Wheeler.
Do you read me?

609
01:10:10,172 --> 01:10:12,107
I hope you receive this.

610
01:10:12,909 --> 01:10:18,613
We are face to face with...
alien hostiles.

611
01:10:20,082 --> 01:10:22,851
And there came back
they abduct people...

612
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:26,288
and bring them to their home planet.

613
01:10:27,123 --> 01:10:28,924
There are some...

614
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:32,661
hundreds in captivity.

615
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:37,499
We have found a way through
one of their space transports to travel...

616
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:40,368
and I suggest
that you do the same.

617
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:48,176
They are a dying, desperate race...

618
01:10:48,178 --> 01:10:50,979
and there is still hope
to eradicate them.

619
01:10:52,181 --> 01:10:56,284
The asteroid is a launch pad...

620
01:10:57,119 --> 01:11:01,389
Fly there and shoot a bomb in the cave that
we have highlighted. traceerstaven with

621
01:11:01,391 --> 01:11:03,725
That will make him explode.

622
01:11:05,294 --> 01:11:06,895
My...

623
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:12,100
My entire team,
they died as heroes.

624
01:11:12,868 --> 01:11:15,971
Please, let their death
have been. not for nothing

625
01:11:17,473 --> 01:11:19,307
Give them hell.

626
01:11:20,810 --> 01:11:23,078
And good luck all.

627
01:11:26,916 --> 01:11:32,020
If you listen to this,
you are the resistance.

628
01:11:33,155 --> 01:11:35,323
Humanity's last hope.

629
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:39,227
Over and out.

630
01:12:25,241 --> 01:12:30,512
They come. And they're going
to wipe out your entire race.

631
01:12:35,284 --> 01:12:39,454
Chris.
This means you really hear.

632
01:12:49,932 --> 01:12:51,433
Soon...

633
01:12:51,790 --> 01:12:56,504
We propose the biggest attack on
in world history...

634
01:12:56,972 --> 01:12:59,240
against a threat
like never before.

635
01:12:59,481 --> 01:13:04,379
Early this morning we received a
message from Captain James Wheeler.

636
01:13:04,381 --> 01:13:09,818
It was written
they hold several civilians caught.

637
01:13:10,887 --> 01:13:13,488
But he also said how
they had to fight...

638
01:13:13,622 --> 01:13:19,060
Where we can continue this fight in their and
that they wished they had never come here.

639
01:13:19,062 --> 01:13:24,532
Captain Wheeler and his team
gave their lives for this information.

640
01:13:24,534 --> 01:13:28,036
And now it's our turn
to honor. their sacrifice

641
01:13:28,038 --> 01:13:32,941
This is not about politics,
or national interest...

642
01:13:32,943 --> 01:13:38,505
or protecting resources, this is a
fight for all humanity to survive.

643
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:41,416
And we will.

644
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:45,220
We will survive.

645
01:13:45,222 --> 01:13:47,989
Now and forever...

646
01:13:47,991 --> 01:13:54,395
and the universe will know
this, this is our world.

647
01:14:01,938 --> 01:14:04,439
Two teams will fight simultaneously.

648
01:14:04,441 --> 01:14:06,307
Assault and rescue team.

649
01:14:06,309 --> 01:14:10,211
Team will attack the rock
the aliens go beyond our atmosphere.

650
01:14:10,213 --> 01:14:13,948
We will focus our attack
on the marked targets.

651
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:17,152
A clear shot would
the need to inflate.

652
01:14:17,154 --> 01:14:19,420
Regarding the rescue, Colonel?

653
01:14:19,422 --> 01:14:21,990
We have a captured alien craft.

654
01:14:21,992 --> 01:14:24,926
They take civilians
an armed gate.

655
01:14:24,928 --> 01:14:27,428
Transporting them directly
to their home planet.

656
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:33,001
Rescue team, you will be heavily armed,
hostiles off-site...

657
01:14:33,003 --> 01:14:37,639
bring citizens safe
back through the gate.

658
01:14:37,641 --> 01:14:41,876
Let us learn that new world
what the meaning of fear.

659
01:14:49,518 --> 01:14:51,586
I'll get you, sweetheart.

660
01:15:22,718 --> 01:15:24,352
Are you ready?

661
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:32,527
Let's do it.

662
01:15:37,132 --> 01:15:40,335
Dad.
Please help me.

663
01:15:40,502 --> 01:15:42,670
The SI-22's are fueled up and ready.

664
01:15:42,672 --> 01:15:45,506
The space, which is a
new flying experience for me.

665
01:15:45,508 --> 01:15:48,009
Do not get lost in there, Colonel.
We're counting on you.

666
01:15:48,011 --> 01:15:49,344
Yes, sir.

667
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:03,057
I'm almost done.
Perhaps you will feel a tingling sensation.

668
01:16:17,006 --> 01:16:20,508
Eagle Star 1. Warplanes ready.
Aim at the marked target.

669
01:16:20,510 --> 01:16:22,010
Understood.

670
01:16:28,017 --> 01:16:29,484
What's this?

671
01:16:34,023 --> 01:16:35,423
Is there no one?

672
01:16:35,425 --> 01:16:37,392
There's more coming.

673
01:16:37,394 --> 01:16:40,328
Look where we are and go quietly.

674
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:06,054
I think it seems.

675
01:17:12,028 --> 01:17:13,428
Listen.

676
01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:17,165
We go towards the building.
We go hard.

677
01:17:17,167 --> 01:17:21,736
I want you
kill everything that is not human.

678
01:17:21,738 --> 01:17:24,539
Ready?
Let's go.

679
01:18:35,744 --> 01:18:37,412
They know we're coming.

680
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:42,750
Come on, keep walking.

681
01:19:55,825 --> 01:19:58,593
Go down and then left.
Go to the main entrance.

682
01:22:06,688 --> 01:22:09,557
Enemy aircraft.
Fighters attack.

683
01:22:14,496 --> 01:22:16,297
Is that all you got?

684
01:22:20,902 --> 01:22:23,371
Lindsey.
- Dad.

685
01:22:23,373 --> 01:22:28,976
Sweetheart. I found you.
I found you.

686
01:22:28,978 --> 01:22:30,745
Everything okay?
Let me look at you.

687
01:22:30,747 --> 01:22:33,080
Dad, it was terrible.
- I know, I'm so sorry.

688
01:22:33,082 --> 01:22:34,615
It was horrible.
- I'm so sorry.

689
01:22:34,617 --> 01:22:37,518
Come on. You must go.
- Let's get you out of here. Come on.

690
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:50,398
No.

691
01:23:02,444 --> 01:23:04,078
Lindsey.

692
01:23:05,514 --> 01:23:07,848
My God.
- Dad.

693
01:23:08,551 --> 01:23:10,551
It's good.

694
01:23:15,692 --> 01:23:17,591
It's all good.
It's okay.

695
01:23:17,593 --> 01:23:20,428
Take me home, Dad.

696
01:23:21,497 --> 01:23:24,932
Stay with me.
Let's go home.

697
01:23:30,872 --> 01:23:33,541
I'm exhausted.
We have any missiles.

698
01:23:33,875 --> 01:23:35,142
Damn.

699
01:23:37,646 --> 01:23:40,548
Am I too late?
- General Magowan?

700
01:23:40,550 --> 01:23:42,016
That's right.

701
01:23:42,018 --> 01:23:45,720
Lok guests away so
I have a clear shot.

702
01:23:45,722 --> 01:23:48,723
You have heard the general.
Evasive maneuver. We're going.

703
01:23:55,097 --> 01:23:59,033
Target in sight.
Welcome into oblivion.

704
01:24:01,770 --> 01:24:03,471
Fighters retreat.

705
01:24:08,110 --> 01:24:11,112
Excellent work, sir.
- You're welcome.

706
01:24:18,987 --> 01:24:20,721
Lindsey, sweetheart. No. Stay with me.

707
01:24:20,723 --> 01:24:22,723
Open your eyes, sweetheart.
Open up your eyes.

708
01:24:23,191 --> 01:24:26,494
No, Lindsey.
Open your eyes, Lindsey. Stay with me.

709
01:25:27,622 --> 01:25:28,956
Pa?

710
01:25:29,858 --> 01:25:34,895
Please. It's over.
It's over.

711
01:25:41,803 --> 01:25:43,159
Please.

712
01:25:47,642 --> 01:25:49,109
That's not it.

713
01:25:53,014 --> 01:25:54,548
It's not over.

714
01:26:01,823 --> 01:26:03,290
Not yet.
