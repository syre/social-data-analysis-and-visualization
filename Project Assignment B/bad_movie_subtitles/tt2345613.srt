162
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,185
I'm driving here.

163
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,720
The poor boy gets
cranky in the summer.

164
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,911
Who doesn't like the summer?

165
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:15,213
SEAN: What's to love
about it, nancy boy?

166
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:16,414
Did he just call
me a nancy boy?

167
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,548
Yup.

168
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,486
Ah, throw us
another one, would you?

169
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:24,468
That's the spirit.

170

(SIGHS)

171
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,694
So we saw these stones on
the outside of the village,

172
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:32,297
and I don't know too much
about Celtic symbols...

173
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:33,631
All right, bullshit.

174
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,134
What?

175
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:39,504
But do you know by chance what
the symbols on the stones mean?

176
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:41,572
I've got no idea, darlin'.

177
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:43,574
Them stones have been there
for centuries,

178
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:45,677
long before our
village was built.

179
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:48,379
But I tell you, about 15
years ago we discovered gold

180
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:50,181
in an old Celtic cave.

181
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:53,351
Turned it into a mine.
Stones were there, too.

182
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:59,624
But eventually
the cave collapsed.

183
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:05,001
Well, things ain't been the
same round here ever since.

184
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,951
Times, they can't
be that tough.

185
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:20,044
Ah, this?
A guest gave that to me.

186
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:23,247
Oh. It's a Rolex.

187
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,484
It's a pretty nice gift.

188
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:30,555
Well, I guess he
appreciated my hospitality.

189
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,596
(SINGING)

190
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,546
Da, you're making
my ears bleed.

191
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:51,442
It's not that bad.
It's pretty nice.

192
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,580
It's kind of run down
though, but whatever!

193
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:57,648
That's not where
you're staying.

194
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:00,050
That's where we lived
before the mine closed.

195
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,099
HAMISH: Well, there it is.

196
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:18,569
The trail is right down there.

197
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,480
You sure it's safe?
It's falling down a little.

Ah, no. She's solid.
On the inside.

199
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:40,055
Just needs a lick of paint, that's all.
Good as new.

200
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:51,302
We have to guard against break-ins
when the place isn't being used.

201
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:54,505
You let a lot of
people stay here?

202
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:56,307
You said The Stones of the Gods

203
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:58,470
was the village's
best kept secret.

204
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:03,815
Yeah. Well, that's why the
cabin don't get much use.

Sorry about all that.

What was that all about?

216

Well, there's a lot of wild
boars round these parts.

217
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:01,806
They can get pretty nasty.
Anyway...

Sorry to give you such a scare.
Let's get you settled.

Can I give you some money
for those beers?

Oh, no, thanks. I'm good.

Oh, good. Because I didn't
bring my Rolex.

you'd have to give us a helpin' hand

rather than stayin' back

do the dirty work.

Yeah, well...

391
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:49,266
Maybe if you all
hadn't have been so greedy,

392
00:37:49,268 --> 00:37:51,968
and taken all that gold
from its cave...

393
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:54,838
Well, maybe if we
increase our offerin',

394

we can buy us some lenience

was on the stone outside of town.

It can't be right.

What?

401
00:38:43,455 --> 00:38:44,621
It means...

<i>Tuatha De Danann.</i>

403
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,800
What the fuck does that mean?

404
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:53,477
Leprechaun.

405
00:38:56,734 --> 00:39:00,337
Come on! Leprechaun?

406
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:02,699
I'm just telling you
what it says.

407
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:09,946
Whatever it is, you think that's
what they dug up in that mine?

408
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:15,452
It wasn't a mine originally,
it was a cave.

409
00:39:15,454 --> 00:39:18,688
But the people in the village took the
gold, that's what Hamish said to us.

410
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:21,124
Okay, now we're talking
pots of gold?

411
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:23,393
I know.

412
00:39:23,395 --> 00:39:25,596
I know it sounds crazy, but...

when you take its gold.

414
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:39,409
You have to make amends.

415
00:39:39,411 --> 00:39:41,971
Until the debt has been repaid.

416
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:46,750
So they put us in this cabin
they locked us in there

417
00:39:46,752 --> 00:39:49,919
to sacrifice us
to a leprechaun?

418
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:56,726
You guys, my earring was gold.

419
00:39:56,728 --> 00:40:01,431

How do we get out of here?

421
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:09,706
Look, these stones are
like a boundary,

422
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:11,941
like an ancient warning sign
or something.

423
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:15,223
SOPHIE: Maybe the leprechaun won't go
past a certain distance from its cave...

424
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:17,580
So?

425
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:20,450
So, if we make it
to the stones...

426
00:40:20,452 --> 00:40:23,486
Then what, the leprechaun won't
go past the stones, Sophie?

427
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:25,622
Really?

428
00:40:25,624 --> 00:40:28,984
No, that makes sense. That's why the guy
who dropped us off didn't go past them.

429
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,497
We have to get back there.

that means it hasn't fed!
