1
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,720
Come in.

2
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,360
Mr Spencer.
Mr Spencer, I hate to bother you...

3
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,920
but I thought you'd like to know
there were two men here.

4
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,840
Two men askin' for you.

5
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,680
A young man and a kind of older man.

6
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,560
They was sorry you wasn't in.
I said you wasn't.

7
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,720
- Did they say they'd be back?
- They didn't say, but I think they will.

8
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,720
Just now, when I had to go to the store,
I seen them standing there at the corner.

9
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,040
Maybe I shoulda let them in,
only you said not to disturb you...

10
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,800
- Yes.
- And I'm sure They'll be back.

11
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,680
You look kinda tired to me,
and that's a fact.

12
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,920
You got a headache or somethin'?

13
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,400
I think maybe you need a real rest.
That's what I think.

14
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,160
Why, Mr Spencer. You oughtn't to leave
all that money lying around like that.

15
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,760
Oh, it makes me nervous
to see money lying around.

16
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,880
Everybody in the world
ain't honest, you know.

17
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,240
Though I must say I haven't had
much trouble that way.

18
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,720
Those friends of yours
told me not to mention they'd called.

19
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,200
Wanted to surprise you. But I thought
you'd like to know somehow.

20
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,920
Yes, yes. Of course. If they come back,
you may show them in.

21
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,360
Yes. You know, Mrs Martin,
it's very funny.

22
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,640
They aren't exactly friends of mine.
They've never seen me.

23
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,720
- That's odd, isn't it?
- 'Tis odd, like you say.

24
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,480
And now that I'm here,
I'll have to meet them.

25
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,440
I may even go out and meet them.

26
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,680
And then again, I may not. Not yet.

27
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,000
You go ahead with your nap.
I'll pull down the blind.

28
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,080
/What do you know?
/You're bluffing. You've nothing on me.

29
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,080
Hello, Postal Union?
I want to send a telegram

30
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,280
to Mrs Joseph Newton
in Santa Rosa, California.

31
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,800
Here's the message. Ready?

32
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,040
Lonesome for you all. Stop.

33
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,480
Am coming out to stay
with you awhile. Stop.

34
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,720
Will arrive Thursday and try and stop me.

35
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,600
Will wire exact time later.

36
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,800
Love to you all...

37
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,160
and a kiss for little Charlie
from her Uncle Charlie.

38
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,440
That's right. That's the signature.
"Uncle Charlie."

39
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,520
That's right. Santa Rosa.

40
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,480
Santa Rosa, California.

41
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,640
/Ann! Answer the telephone.

42
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,200
Newton's residence.
Ann Newton speaking.

43
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,040
Oh, hello, Mrs Henderson. This is Ann.

44
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,400
Mother isn't home yet.

45
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,840
A telegram? Well...

46
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,840
I don't see a pencil, so maybe
she better call you back.

47
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,040
I'm trying to keep my mind free of things
that don't matter...

48
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,360
because I have so much
to keep on my mind.

49
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,520
Innumerable things.

50
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,840
I'll have her call back.
Thank you for calling.

51
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,840
Goodbye.

52
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,760
Hello, Ann. Where's your mother?

53
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,680
- She's out.
- Out?

54
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,760
Mrs Henderson just called
from the Postal Union Office.

55
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,680
She says we have a telegram.

56
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,040
I would have taken it down,
only I couldn't find a pencil. I looked.

57
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,280
Telegram, eh?

58
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,320
I knew there'd be trouble if
your Aunt Sarah got her driver's licence.

59
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,920
- Whereabouts was the accident?
- I didn't take notes.

60
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,600
Oh. Then how about a kiss?

61
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,040
Isn't that the funniest thing?
Here I am, practically a child

62
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,080
and I wouldn't read the things you read.

63
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,680
Mm-hm. Well, I guess
they'd give you bad dreams.

64
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,680
Bad dreams? You don't understand, Papa.
Mystery stories have done...

65
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,800
- Where's Roger?
- Out. The average mind...

66
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,680
- Where's Charlie?
- Out. No, she's in her room thinking.

67
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,880
Well, don't read too much.
You'll ruin your eyes.

68
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,760
And leave my book alone.
What's that you're reading?

69
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,880
- Ivanhoe.
- Hm? Oh.

70
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,600
- Who is it?
- It's me.

71
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,760
What's the matter?
Don't you feel well?

72
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,120
No. I'm perfectly well.

73
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:48,800
I've just been thinking for hours,
and I've come to the conclusion I give up.

74
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,160
- I simply give up.
- What are you going to give up?

75
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,960
Have you ever to thought that a family
should be the most wonderful thing ever?

76
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,440
And that this family's
just gone to pieces?

77
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,360
- We have?
- Of course we have.

78
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:05,520
We just sort of go along and
nothing happens. We're in a terrible rut.

79
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,760
It's been on my mind for months.
What's going to be our future?

80
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,040
Oh, come now, Charlie.
Things aren't as bad as that.

81
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,320
- The bank gave me a raise last January.
- Money.

82
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,160
How can you talk about money
when I'm talking about souls?

83
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,080
We eat and sleep and that's about all.

84
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,320
We don't even have
any real conversations.

85
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,560
- We just talk.
- And work.

86
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,920
Yes. Poor Mother. She works like a dog.

87
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,880
- Just like a dog.
- Where is she?

88
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,760
She's out. When she comes back,
it'll be the same thing.

89
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,880
Dinner, then dishes, then bed.
I don't see how she stands it.

90
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,320
You know,
she's really a wonderful woman.

91
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,720
I mean, she's not just a mother. And
I think we ought to do something for her.

92
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,240
- Don't you think we should?
- Yeah. What were you thinking of?

93
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,520
Oh, nothing, I suppose.

94
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,800
I guess we'll just have to wait
for a miracle or something.

95
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,840
Oh, now, Charlie, you're right.
Absolutely right.

96
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,560
- I'll figure out some way...
- I don't believe in good intentions now.

97
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,160
- All I'm waiting for now is a miracle.
- Oh, Charlie.

98
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,320
Those back stairs are steep.

99
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,960
What's the matter, Charlie?
What's the matter, Joe?

100
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,120
- Well, it seems that, uh...
- Oh, I've become a nagging old maid.

101
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,320
You went downtown in that awful old
hat you'd promised you'd throw away.

102
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,440
/- Mama.
- Darling, does it matter what hat I wear?

103
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,120
/- Mama.
- Why do you let that child yell at you?

104
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,760
- If she...
- I'm going downstairs, anyway.

105
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,560
Joe, what were you
both talking about when I came in?

106
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,480
Something about a miracle.

107
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,960
/Oh, it's nothing.
/Charlie's a bit under the weather.

108
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,920
/Oh. Well, she'Il be all right.

109
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,600
Well, come on, dear. Let's go
downstairs. No use standing here.

110
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,320
I'm going to get myself a bottle of beer.

111
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,320
Mother, I'm going downtown
and send a telegram.

112
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,600
Why, darling, who do you know
to send a telegram to?

113
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,160
I know a wonderful person who'll come
and stir us up. Just the one to save us.

114
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,400
What do you mean, "save us"?

115
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,440
All this time, there's been
one right person to save us.

116
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,600
- What's Uncle Charlie's address?
- Uncle Charlie?

117
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,280
- You're not going to ask him for money?
- Of course not.

118
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,120
That wouldn't help us.
What's his address?

119
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,040
- The last address I had...
- Do you know how many steps it is

120
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,880
to get from here
to the drugstore and back?

121
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,280
- 649.
- If you've forgotten, I won't tell you.

122
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,040
I remember. Philadelphia.

123
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,840
You can't ask a busy man
to come all this way for nothing.

124
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,160
He'll come for me. I'm named after him.

125
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,640
Besides, we're the only relatives
he has in the world.

126
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,680
/If you come all the way
/up Fourth Street, it's 802.

127
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,880
- Mama, guess what?
- I have no time for guessing.

128
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,920
What's that thing in your hair?

129
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,080
Well, I'll tell you anyway, even though
I think it's nicer when people guess.

130
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,120
Mrs Henderson said to call her at
the telegraph office. We have a telegram.

131
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,440
Ann, I don't think you ought to put things
behind your ears.

132
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,400
- Something might get into your ear.
- Emmy, Ann says we have a telegram.

133
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,880
I think you ought to find out about it.
Somebody might be sick or something.

134
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,160
Mrs Henderson didn't read the telegram
because I couldn't find a pencil.

135
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,160
When I have a house, it's going
to be full of well-sharpened pencils.

136
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,960
- Did Mrs Henderson say who it's from?
- No, she didn't.

137
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,720
She might have said who it was from.

138
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,280
Come on, Ann. That's my chair.
I'll call up and find out.

139
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,680
If you will be quiet just a second.

140
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,760
Hello.
181, please. I wonder who it can be?

141
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,720
Oh, nothing, Operator. Just 181.

142
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,320
- If that's from my sister...
- Hello?

143
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,240
Mrs Henderson? This is Emma Newton.

144
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,720
Ann says you have a telegram for me.

145
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,640
- Mama, you don't have to shout.
- Ssh.

146
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,960
Really, Papa. You'd think
Mama had never seen a phone.

147
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,000
She makes no allowance for science.

148
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,000
She thinks she has to cover the distance
by sheer lungpower.

149
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,000
Why, how wonderful. Thursday, you say?

150
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,920
Looks like somebody's coming.

151
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,760
- Who's coming, Ma?
- Well, it's the most wonderful surprise.

152
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,720
It's my brother, you know.
My younger brother. The baby.

153
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,440
Yes, of course, a little spoiled.
Families always spoil the youngest.

154
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,480
Well, it's just simply wonderful.

155
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,400
Thanks most awfully, Mrs Henderson.

156
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,480
Well...

157
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,840
What do you think? Charles is coming.

158
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,760
- Who?
- Your Uncle Charlie.

159
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,000
Did you say "Charles"?

160
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,760
And our Charlie's sending him a telegram.
Now, what made her think to do that?

161
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,960
/Hello, Charlie. I just called your house.

162
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,560
- Telegram for your mother.
- Did you?

163
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,640
Gonna send that by Bill Forest,
but you can take it.

164
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,480
Thanks. From your uncle.
The spoiled one.

165
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,440
My uncle? My Uncle Charlie?

166
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,680
Yeah.

167
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,640
Mrs Henderson,
do you believe in telepathy?

168
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,520
Well, I ought to. That's my business.

169
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,760
Oh, not telegraphy. Mental telepathy.

170
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,680
Like...
well, suppose you have a thought,

171
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,440
and suppose the thought's about
someone you're in tune with.

172
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,720
Then across miles, that person knows
what you're thinking and answers you.

173
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,080
- And it's all mental.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

174
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,360
I only send telegrams the normal way.

175
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,960
He heard me. He heard me.

176
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,080
- Mr Otis? Mr Otis?
- Yes?

177
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,480
You're almost in Santa Rosa. Want to be
ready when you get into Santa Rosa.

178
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,320
- I'm ready now. Thanks.
- Then I'll get all your bags out for you.

179
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,840
- How you feelin', Mr Otis?
- Pretty well.

180
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,440
A little weak
but pretty well on the whole.

181
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,440
Harry, tell the porter you're a doctor.

182
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,640
Ask if there's anything you can do.
Maybe you can help that poor soul.

183
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,200
- I'm on my vacation.
- My husband's a doctor and if there's...

184
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,600
No, Ma'am. He's a very sick man.
Won't see anyone.

185
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,600
I haven't set eyes on him myself
since we first got on the train.

186
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,200
/Well, you don't look very well either.

187
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,520
Ah, here we are. Come on, children.

188
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,280
Close the door, there. That's right.

189
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,600
- Oh, are you...
- Charlie. Young Charlie.

190
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,080
At first, I didn't know you.
I thought you were sick.

191
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,880
- Sick?
- You aren't sick, are you?

192
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,040
Look, Pop! Here he is!

193
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,360
Why, Uncle Charlie, you're not sick.
That was the funniest thing.

194
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,200
- Me, sick? Well, Joe, how are you?
- Alright, Charles.

195
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,320
Roger. Hello, Ann.
I bet you don't remember me.

196
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,720
I remember you sort of.
You look different.

197
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,440
Well, we better get started.
Emma's got the dinner almost ready.

198
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,640
I couldn't persuade her to come
to the station. Dinner came first.

199
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,520
- Roger, get the bags. I'll take that.
- Thank you, Joe.

200
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,200
That's it. Come on. Let's go.

201
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,760
/Come on, Roger, get these bags.

202
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,520
You, uh, sure that isn't
too heavy for you?

203
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,600
Oh, no. It's nothing.
I love to carry.

204
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,880
Emma. Don't move.

205
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,120
Standing there,
you don't look like Emma Newton.

206
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,960
You look like Emma Spencer Oakley of
46 Burnham Street, St Paul, Minnesota.

207
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,640
- The prettiest girl on the block.
- Charles.

208
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,080
Mama, nobody got off the train
but Uncle Charlie.

209
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,520
- Let me look at you.
- There was only us meeting somebody.

210
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,800
- To think you could take the time off.
- There was only one bed made up.

211
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,360
- It's so wonderful to have you here.
- Emmy, Emmy, don't cry.

212
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,800
And imagine your thinking
of 46 Burnham Street.

213
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,120
I haven't thought of that
funny old street in years.

214
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,400
I keep remembering those things.
All the old things.

215
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,680
/Emmy, how's he look?
Same old Charles, eh?

216
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,480
Roger, Ann, get these other bags.

217
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,760
/You have Charlie's room
/right here at the head of the stairs.

218
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,120
Emmy wanted to move Ann, but Charlie
thought you'd be more comfortable here.

219
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,200
/Come on, Roger.

220
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,560
- Don't put the hat on the bed.
- Superstitious, Joe?

221
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,520
No, but I don't believe
in inviting trouble.

222
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,720
It wasn't the biggest yacht in the world,
but it had a fireplace in the library

223
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,680
and the bar was panelled
in bleached mahogany.

224
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,200
You pushed a button and...
What am I talking about? That's all over.

225
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,080
Let's talk about you.

226
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,560
Charlie,
that's the prettiest dress I ever saw.

227
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,520
I think so, too.

228
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,040
Why, Charles, don't you remember?

229
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,960
Remember? Remember what?

230
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,560
- Why, Uncle Charlie, you sent it to me.
- I did?

231
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,600
Well, say, I've been sitting here
all this time forgetting something.

232
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,520
Ann. Roger.

233
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,600
- Look at that. Oh, dear now.
- Joe. Don't know whether you had one.

234
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,440
You didn't have to think of me, Charles.
Presents for the children are alright.

235
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,280
Say... I've never had a wristwatch.

236
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,120
Fellows at the bank'll think
I'm quite a sport.

237
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,400
I have two for you, Emmy.
One old and one new.

238
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,840
/Oh, Charles. What is it?

239
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,040
- You shouldn't have. Really. No.
- Well, yeah.

240
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,640
Oh, Charles.

241
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,960
Oh, how... beautiful.

242
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,960
Oh, I've-I've always wanted one.

243
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,000
Oh, Mother, it's exactly right.
It's what you should have.

244
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,160
Look, Emmy.

245
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,040
Charles. You've had these all along.

246
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,080
Mm-hm. All along, Emmy.
All these years.

247
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,720
Safe in a deposit box,
no matter where I was.

248
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,840
Oh. Grandpa and Grandma?

249
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,120
1888.

250
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,280
53 years ago.

251
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,840
Aren't they sweet?
My, she was pretty.

252
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,320
Everybody was sweet and pretty then.
The whole world.

253
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,920
A wonderful world.
Not like the world today.

254
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,160
Not like the world now.

255
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,080
It was great to be young then.

256
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,200
We're all happy now, Uncle Charlie.
Look at us.

257
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,160
- And we're all happy at the same time.
- Now, for your present, Charlie.

258
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,560
Oh, I don't want anything.
Right now, I have enough.

259
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,520
Before you came,
I didn't think I had anything,

260
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,520
but now I don't want another thing.

261
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,320
- She's crazy.
- She doesn't mean it.

262
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,760
If you ask me, I think she's putting on,
like girls in books.

263
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,800
The ones that say they don't want
anything always get more in the end.

264
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,920
- That's what she's hoping.
- She's not crazy.

265
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,920
The smartest girl
in her class at school.

266
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,720
Won the debate against theEast
Richmond HighSchool. She's got brains.

267
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,280
I meant it.
Please don't give me anything.

268
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,840
- Nothing?
- Oh, I can't explain it.

269
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,760
But you came here
and Mother's so happy and...

270
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,960
Oh, I'm glad that she named me after you
and that she thinks we're both alike.

271
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,600
I think we are, too. I know it.

272
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,080
Oh, it would spoil things
if you should give me anything.

273
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,120
You're a strange girl, Charlie.
Why would it spoil things?

274
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,920
Because we're not just an uncle
and a niece. It's something else.

275
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,360
I know you. I know that you don't
tell people a lot of things.

276
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:16,040
I don't either. I have a feeling
that inside you somewhere,

277
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,160
there's something nobody knows about.

278
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,560
Something... nobody knows?

279
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,160
Something secret and wonderful and...
I'll find it out.

280
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,960
It's not good
to find out too much, Charlie.

281
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,720
But we're sort of like twins.
Don't you see?

282
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:36,000
- We have to know.
- Give me your hand, Charlie.

283
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,760
Thank you.

284
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,520
- You didn't even look at it.
- I don't have to.

285
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,600
No matter what you gave me,
it'd be the same.

286
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,600
Here. Let me show you.

287
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,360
It's a good emerald. A really good one.

288
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,160
Good emeralds are
the most beautiful things in the world.

289
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,880
- You've had something engraved.
- I haven't, but I will if you like it.

290
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,400
Yes, you have, Uncle Charlie.
It's very faint.

291
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:26,080
"T. S. from B. M."

292
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,400
But... Why, it must be someone's initials.

293
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,000
Well, I've been rooked.
The jeweller rooked me.

294
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,320
- Oh, it doesn't matter. Really.
- Give it back. I'll have it taken off.

295
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,720
No, No. I like it this way.

296
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,760
Someone else was probably happy
with this ring.

297
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,600
Oh, it's perfect the way it is.

298
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,000
You bring the coffee.

299
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,680
Sing at the table,
you'll marry a crazy husband.

300
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,080
Yes, I've been thinking of transferring
some money out here from the East.

301
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,200
I could put it in your bank, Joe,
until I found out what's what.

302
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,480
Uh, I suppose your bank
does take money, huh?

303
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,680
That's one thing we do.
Rake in the dough.

304
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,600
Can't promise to give it back.

305
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,560
Well, I'll go downtown in the morning
and open an account.

306
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,120
- 30 or 40,000 just to start things off?
- That's a lot of money.

307
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,680
He won't have it long.
The government will get it.

308
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,840
- The government gets...
- Don't talk against the government.

309
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,120
/The way men do things.

310
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,760
I can't get that tune out of my head.

311
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,400
Maybe if somebody tells me what it is,
I'll forget it.

312
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,280
/- It's a waltz.
- I know it is, but what one?

313
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,240
You know, it's the funniest thing.

314
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,560
/Sometimes I get a tune
/in my head like that

315
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,480
and pretty soon, I hear
somebody else humming it too.

316
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,760
I think tunes jump from head to head.

317
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,760
Do you know what it is,
Uncle Charlie?

318
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,520
Uh, no. No. I-I-I don't know what it is.

319
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:09,120
/I remember.
/Uh... It's on the tip of my tongue.

320
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,320
It's a waltz and it's Victor Herbert.

321
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,800
- Victor Herbert wasn't a waltz.
- It's the Blue Danube Waltz.

322
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,800
Oh, yes. Of course it is.

323
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,160
No, it isn't, Uncle Charlie.
I know what it is. It's the Merry...

324
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,480
- I'm terribly sorry, Emmy.
- Nothing to make a fuss about.

325
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,680
Charles, while we do the dishes,
why don't you come in the living room

326
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,120
and stretch out on the sofa
and read the evening paper?

327
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,040
You never were much on helping.

328
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,640
- Joe, here's Herbert.
/- Ann, Roger, help me here.

329
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,760
Herbert's a friend of Joe's.
They're literary critics.

330
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,440
Hello, Herb. Had your supper?

331
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,800
- Had mine an hour ago.
- Hour ago, huh?

332
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,720
- Oh. A watch.
- Yeah, a present.

333
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,240
Here, Herb.
I'd like you to meet my brother-in-law.

334
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,640
- Charles, this is Herb Hawkins.
- Nice to know you, Mr Hawkins.

335
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,960
- Fine, thank you.
- How's your mother, Herb?

336
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,560
Oh, uh, just middling.

337
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,440
- Excuse me, Herb.
- Oh.

338
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,640
Thank you.
I'm sorry your mother's not better.

339
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,720
- Thank you, dear. There, now.
- Thank you.

340
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,360
/Lead a life of luxury.

341
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,080
Well, I must go and see
what Charlie's doing.

342
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,000
Wife's brother from the East.
New York man.

343
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,280
Good for the children.
You know what I mean?

344
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,800
In business?
Well, he takes himself very seriously.

345
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,280
Well, how's everything?

346
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,360
Say, ha-have you read this one? Huh?

347
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,280
That little Frenchman beats them all.

348
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,080
You can talk all you like
about Sherlock Holmes.

349
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,000
That little Frenchman beats 'em all.

350
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,320
I read it. Air bubbles don't
necessarily kill a person.

351
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,200
Those writers from the other side
get too fancy.

352
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,440
- The best way to commit a murder-
- I know, I know.

353
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,600
Hit 'em on the head
with a blunt instrument.

354
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,120
Well, it's true, isn't it? Listen.

355
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,160
If I wanted to murder you tomorrow,

356
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,120
do you think
I'd waste my time on fancy hypodermics?

357
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,080
- Or on Inee?
- What's that?

358
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,880
- Inee. Indian arrow poison.
- Oh.

359
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:14,120
Listen,
I'd find out if you were alone, walk in,

360
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,280
hit you on the head with a piece
of lead pipe or a loaded cane...

361
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,280
What'd be the fun of that?

362
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,920
Where's your planning?
Where's your clues?

363
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,480
I don't want any clues.
I want to murder you.

364
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,760
What do I want with clues?

365
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,760
Well, if you haven't got any clues,
where's your book?

366
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:34,280
I'm not talkin' 'bout writing books.
I'm talking about killing you!

367
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,240
If I was going to kill you, I wouldn't do
a dumb thing like hitting you on the head.

368
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,640
First of all,
I don't like the fingerprint angle.

369
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,680
Of course, I could always wear gloves,
press your hands against the pipe

370
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,640
after you were dead
and make you look like a suicide.

371
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:54,520
But you wouldn't beat yourself to death.
I'd do it so it didn't look like murder.

372
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,200
Oh, Ann?

373
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,000
- What?
- Come here.

374
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,200
Did you ever see a house
made out of newspapers?

375
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,480
Well, watch.

376
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,280
You-You take one sheet here.

377
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,400
OK? And you tear it down here.

378
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,040
And you tear it there.

379
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,960
You fold it over here at the side.

380
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,920
Fold over the other side here.

381
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,200
And turn it up there.

382
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,760
Now with... the door...

383
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,520
Right off... and there.

384
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,440
I'm not a baby any more.
Besides, that's Papa's paper.

385
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,200
/Oh, Roger, look what
/we've got. A nice, little red barn.

386
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:04,160
- You've got Papa's paper.
- Oh, that's alright.

387
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,240
Simply unfold it.
Nobody will ever know the difference.

388
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,120
What are you two doing?

389
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,800
- You know that's father's paper.
- It's my fault. I was playing a game.

390
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,280
- Didn't think about it as Joe's pap.
- Oh, that's alright.

391
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,000
Here's page one, five... eight.

392
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,680
- What did you do with three and four?
- We never touched it.

393
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,720
/Really. Uncle Charlie's
/the only one that touched it.

394
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,320
Oh, well. I guess it's all right.

395
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,040
If I fold it very neatly,
maybe he won't notice.

396
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,720
/Come in.

397
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,200
I brought you water.

398
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,720
Oh, thank you, Charlie.
That's very thoughtful of you.

399
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,200
Pleasant dreams.

400
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,400
Uncle Charlie...

401
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:56,960
- I know a secret you don't think I know.
- What secret?

402
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,920
Remember I said you couldn't hide
anything from me because I'd find it out?

403
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,960
Well, now I know there was something
in the evening paper about you.

404
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,880
About me in the evening paper?

405
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,360
And that's why you played that game
with Ann and Roger.

406
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,400
You didn't want us to know
and you wanted to tear the paper.

407
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,840
Now I know. You might as well tell me.

408
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,720
Well, you've got me there, Charlie.

409
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,640
Only it wasn't about me.
It was about, uh...

410
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,240
someone I used to know.

411
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,680
There!

412
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,600
It's none of your business.

413
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,920
Oh! Uncle Charlie, you're hurting me.

414
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,360
- Oh, Charlie.
- Your hands.

415
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,720
Charlie, I didn't mean to hurt you.

416
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,760
I was just fooling.

417
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,520
It was nothing. Just... Just some gossip.

418
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,600
Not very pretty,
about someone I once met up with.

419
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,240
Not for you to read.

420
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,560
Forget it.

421
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:04,000
- Good night, young Charlie.
- Good night. Pleasant dreams.

422
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,400
- How long is Uncle Charlie staying?
- Forever, I hope.

423
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,320
Hasn't he got a house of his own?

424
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,480
Not that I mind you in here,

425
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:29,080
but I never can tell
when I'll want some privacy.

426
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,640
You better go to sleep, baby.

427
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,640
- You said your prayers?
- I forgot.

428
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,840
You better say them.

429
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,480
I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord my soul to keep...

430
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,400
- Don't bless too many people. It's late.
- I pray the Lord my soul to take.

431
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:46,280
God bless Mama, Papa, Captain Midnight,
Veronica Lake and the president...

432
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:51,360
- You can't say them all tonight, dear.
- Oh, and Uncle Charlie. Amen.

433
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,880
- All ready for breakfast?
- Oh, coffee, Emmy.

434
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,320
I don't know how you do it.
Now, I'm never comfortable eating in bed.

435
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,560
I had to have my meals in bed for a while

436
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,400
after the children came,
but I never liked it.

437
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,680
I can't face the world in the morning.
I must have coffee before I can speak.

438
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,320
Well, I don't mind pampering you
your first morning,

439
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,160
but I think you're the only person
in this town to have breakfast at 10:30.

440
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,200
And while you were sleeping,
the newspaper called up for an interview.

441
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,680
With me?

442
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:52,320
And the women's club I belong to
wants you to give a little talk.

443
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,200
Women's club.

444
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,520
Oh! Oh, you haven't finished unpacking.
I'll do that for you.

445
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,400
- Where's Charlie?
- She's running around like a mad thing.

446
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,320
She thinks everything needs fixing.

447
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,120
But what I wanted to tell you was that
you're not the only celebrity in this town.

448
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,360
- We're all going to be in limelight.
- What are you cooking up?

449
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,680
Well, a young man called this morning,
said his name was Graham,

450
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,720
and he wants to interview
everybody in this house.

451
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,880
- Interview everybody?
- That's what he said.

452
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,680
He's being sent around the country
by some kind of institute or committee

453
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:29,440
and he has to pick a representative
American family and ask them questions.

454
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,720
It's a kind of a poll.
It's called the National Public Survey.

455
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,680
Wonder how he happened
to pick this family?

456
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,280
Well, he said he wanted
a typical American family.

457
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,920
I told him
we weren't a typical American family.

458
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,480
If he's going to ask a lot of questions,
he can leave me out of it.

459
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:47,160
Oh, but you could tell him so much more
than any of us could.

460
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,560
- He's going to take our pictures too.
- Pictures.

461
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,640
My, isn't that lovely?

462
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,640
You see, there were really,
there were two young men.

463
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,240
One of them takes the pictures.

464
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,520
- Oh, there were two.
- Yes. Mr Graham was the nicest.

465
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,840
Oh, he doesn't want us
to dress up or anything.

466
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,320
He just wants us to act
the way we always do.

467
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,800
Emmy, women are fools.
They'd fall for anything.

468
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,680
Why do you let two strangers come
and turn this place upside down.

469
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,480
Why expose the family
to a couple of snoopers?

470
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:23,680
- You should have more sense.
- Why, Charles, I...

471
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,400
/- Good morning, Uncle Charlie.
/- Good morning, Charlie.

472
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,760
Your mother says the Newtons have been
picked for all-American suckers.

473
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,960
- What do you know about it?
- Charlie wasn't here when they came.

474
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:35,920
But really, the way Mr Graham told it,
it wasn't like snooping at all.

475
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,520
It was our duty as citizens.
It's something the government wants.

476
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,400
- Government?
- Well, it's for the public good.

477
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,160
I told them about you andtheplaces
you've been and he was very interested.

478
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,640
Now, listen, Emmy.
I'll have nothing to do with this.

479
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,840
I'm just a visitor here and my advice
to you is to slam the door in his face.

480
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,200
Oh. Well, I-I couldn't do that.

481
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,280
But you don't have to meet him
if you don't want to.

482
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,200
Well, I think I'd be kind of exciting.

483
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,640
He'd take your photograph
and then we could have it for nothing.

484
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,360
No thank you. I've never been
photographed and I don't want to be.

485
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,280
Oh, Charles, how can you talk that way?

486
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,120
I had a photograph of you.
I gave it to Charlie.

487
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,720
I tell you, there are none.
I guess you've forgotten this one.

488
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,120
Get it, Charlie.

489
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,040
/You sure you don't remember?

490
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,400
/Of course I don't
/ever remember being photographed.

491
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,000
46 Burnham Street.

492
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,280
Mm-hm. It was taken
the Christmas you got your bicycle.

493
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,720
- Just before your accident.
- Uncle Charlie, you were beautiful.

494
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,640
Wasn't he, though?
And such a quiet boy. Always reading.

495
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,800
Papa shouldn't have got you that bicycle.
You didn't know how to handle it.

496
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,360
He took it right out on the icy road
and skidded into a streetcar.

497
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,400
- We thought he was going to die.
- I'm glad he didn't.

498
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:51,160
He almost did. He fractured his skull,
and he was laid up so long.

499
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,880
And then, when he was getting well,
there was no holding him.

500
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,120
And it was just as though
all the rest he had was too much for him

501
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,000
and he had to get into mischief
to blow off steam.

502
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,960
He didn't do much reading after that,
let me tell you.

503
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,600
It was taken the very day
he had his accident.

504
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,000
A few days later when the pictures
came home, how mama cried.

505
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,400
She wondered if he'd ever look the same.
She wondered if he'd ever be the same.

506
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,720
What's the use of looking backward?
What's the use of looking ahead?

507
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,920
Today's the thing.
That's my philosophy. Today.

508
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,760
If today's the thing,
then you'd better finish your breakfast

509
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,800
and get down to the bank
because Joe'll be waiting.

510
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,320
Charlie, don't be late back.
The survey men are coming at 4:00.

511
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,840
- Good morning, Charlie.
- Hello, Madge.

512
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,400
- Good morning, Charlie.
- Hello, Catherine.

513
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,840
Did you see the way they looked at you?
I bet they wonder who you are.

514
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Uncle Charlie, I love to walk with you.
I want everybody to see you.

515
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,400
There's Papa in that window over there.

516
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,360
Hello, Joe. Can you stop embezzling
a minute and give me your attention?

517
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,760
Oh, uh...

518
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,160
Charles, we don't joke
about such things here.

519
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,640
Oh, what's a little shortage in the books
at the end of the month?

520
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,360
Any good bank clerk can cover up
alittle shortage. Isn't that right, Charlie

521
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:48,240
- Everyone can hear you.
- Good. We all know what banks are.

522
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,920
Look all right, but noone knows
what goes on when they lock the doors.

523
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,640
Can't fool me, though.
Well, Joe, let's see your president.

524
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,920
Still want to open that account, Charles?
That's why I'm here.

525
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:01,200
Well, uh, you wait right here.
I'll see if Mr Greene's busy.

526
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:05,400
And, uh, Charles, he doesn't care much
for jokes about banks.

527
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,120
Well, $40,000 is no joke.
Not to him, I bet.

528
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,680
It's a joke to me.
The whole world's a joke to me.

529
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,040
I'll be right back.

530
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,520
You shouldn't tease Papa like that.

531
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,520
I wasn't teasing him.
I just hate this stuffy atmosphere.

532
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:32,000
They're waving for us to come in.

533
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,440
/- Hello, Mr Greene.
- Hello, Charlie.

534
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,640
Well, Mr Greene, this is
my brother-in-law, Mr Oakley.

535
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,560
- How do you do?
- How are you, Mr Oakley?

536
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,880
Well, Mr Greene, I was thinking
of settling down here for a while.

537
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,600
Great country. Great country.

538
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,000
We think so. What have you been doing?

539
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,760
I suppose you might call me a promoter.
I've done a little bit of everything.

540
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,400
The only trouble is that once I make
the money, I'm not interested in it.

541
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,080
Not interested in money?

542
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,760
You know there's money just lying around
waiting for somebody to pick it up.

543
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,840
I thought maybe I'd put some of
my loose cash away for safekeeping.

544
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,360
- In the bank where Joe works, naturally.
/- Loose cash?

545
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,160
Well, I got in a habit of carrying a lot
of cash with me when I was travelling.

546
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:15,200
- A dangerous habit.
- Never lost a penny in my life.

547
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,680
I guess heaven takes care
of fools and scoundrels.

548
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:21,400
- Yes.
- Thirty, thirty-five...

549
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,320
Forty thousand.
Shall we start with forty?

550
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,280
- If you'll just write out a deposit slip.
/- Ah, details.

551
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,880
I'm glad to see you're a man
who understands details, Mr Greene.

552
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:37,240
They're most important to me.
Most important. All the little details.

553
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,840
/Oh, dear. I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were busy.

554
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,480
- We can come back.
- Come in, now that you're here.

555
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,760
Mrs Greene,
I'd like you to meet my uncle, Mr Oakley.

556
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,400
Uncle Charlie,
this is Mrs Greene and Mrs Potter.

557
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,760
Mrs Greene, Miss Potter.

558
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,080
Mrs Potter.

559
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,640
- Something about you made me think...
- Yes?

560
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,920
- What did you want, Margaret?
- I need some money to go shopping.

561
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,840
There's one good thing
in being a widow, isn't there?

562
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,480
You don't have to ask
your husband for money.

563
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,920
- Here you are.
- Oh, thank you.

564
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,080
- Goodbye, Mr Oakley.
- Mrs Potter.

565
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,240
Bye, Mrs Greene.

566
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,240
There. There you are, Mr Greene.

567
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,840
- Charlie, let's see the town.
- Goodbye, Mr Oakley.

568
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,840
- Bye, Mr Greene.
- Call on us for advice anytime.

569
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,680
- Thank you.
- Joe, you may see Mr Oakley out.

570
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:31,520
Joe, keep your eyes open.
You'll have his job in a couple of years.

571
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,320
Here he is.

572
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,680
Those must be the questionnaire men.
They're a whole hour early.

573
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,640
I won't see them.

574
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,000
You don't have to if you don't want to.
I'll see that you don't.

575
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,960
The way they got around your mother.

576
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,600
I thought she'd have better sense.

577
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,600
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

578
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,600
- You must have come to interview us.
- My name is Graham, Miss Newton.

579
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,800
- Oh, how do you do?
- And this is Fred Saunders.

580
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,040
How do you do? Won't you come in?

581
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,440
- I'll call my mother.
- Thank you.

582
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,480
/Mother, the government men are here.

583
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,400
/Will you sit down?

584
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,680
But you said 4:00. Nothing's ready now.

585
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,920
My husband is still at the bank
and-and the house is...

586
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,400
That's all we want now, Mrs Newton,
some pictures of the house.

587
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,320
Saunders can get busy
and I'd like to ask a few questions.

588
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,880
Alright, but I do wish you'd waited
until I had the house looking its best.

589
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,960
/I wanted flowers around
/and fresh curtains in the kitchen.

590
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,800
/And there are a lot of things
/I don't want you to photograph.

591
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:55,080
- You said you own the house?
/- Own it? It owns us.

592
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,720
No sooner do I get one thing fixed
than something else gets broken.

593
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,960
And then it needs fresh paint and th...

594
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,880
/Mr Saunders, I'm very sorry...

595
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,040
/but you simply cannot
/take a picture with that chair in it.

596
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,680
/- It needs a new slipcover.
- And there are, uh, six in your family?

597
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,200
- Five.
- Five? But...

598
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,160
/Well, my uncle's just visiting.

599
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,120
/I told you about him.
/He's here from the East.

600
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,320
My uncle doesn't want to be bothered
with a lot of questions.

601
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,560
Well, you see, on a survey, we usually...

602
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,480
/He's not interested
/in a survey

603
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,840
/and I promised him
/he wouldn't be bothered.

604
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,760
Well, we'd like it
if we could get all of you.

605
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,040
You know, your opinions,
what you do or what you want to do.

606
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,280
My uncle's opinions aren't average
and I'm afraid they wouldn't help you.

607
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,680
/I think when someone asks for privacy,
/they should have it.

608
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,720
Well, we'll...
The whole idea of this thing is that...

609
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,440
Mr Graham, perhaps
you'd better choose another family.

610
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,680
We'll do anything you say, of course,
but this family seemed right and...

611
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,600
/It is a nice family.

612
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,520
Charlie, let the young men go ahead,
so long as they're here.

613
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,880
Well, alright.

614
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,760
OK. Saunders, go ahead
and get another shot.

615
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,800
Mrs Newton, what organisations
do you and your husband belong to?

616
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,720
How about a picture in the kitchen?

617
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:04,960
Well, I'm afraid the kitchen
isn't quite the way I'd like it.

618
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,120
/Come along.

619
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,560
If you'll start by breakin' an egg,
Mrs Newton.

620
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,400
Oh, but you don't start a cake
by breaking an egg.

621
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,600
You have to put
the butter and sugar in first.

622
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:22,560
Survey or no survey,
I'm not going to start by breaking an egg.

623
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,280
I thought I'd make a maple cake.
My brother Charles loves maple cake.

624
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,520
What does your brother do?
I guess he just does about everything.

625
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,360
What does he do? He's just in business.
You know, the way men are.

626
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,920
My husband works in a bank,
but I think Charles is just in business.

627
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,280
/If you really want a picture
of me breaking an egg,

628
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,160
you'll have to wait
till I cream the butter and sugar.

629
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,080
I'll wait.

630
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,160
I wonder if we could
take a look upstairs.

631
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,080
You show us, and your mother can call us
when she's ready.

632
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,080
- Alright.
- If you'd rather wait, Mr Saunders.

633
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,840
Folding in the eggs
has to be done just right.

634
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,760
I can't beat them and let them stand.

635
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,160
The minute I hear you've
broken the eggs, I'll come right down.

636
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,320
Yes.

637
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,440
I really don't see
what you want to look up here for.

638
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,800
Whose room is that? It's mine.
My uncle's using it now, though.

639
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:17,520
I'd like to see what your room looks like.
Typical girl, typical room.

640
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,120
Typical of you to ask.
My uncle's resting.

641
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,320
I really don't want to disturb him.

642
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,680
- Is there a back stairs?
- Mm-hm. Right down the hall.

643
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,320
I'll bet you 50 cents
that your uncle isn't in there.

644
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,240
Oh, betting's silly.

645
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,080
All you want to do
is photograph my room, doesn't he?

646
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,040
- That's it.
- Besides, I know my uncle's in there.

647
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,640
Alright, I'll still bet he isn't.
Let me knock and see.

648
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,240
Oh, I'll knock.

649
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,920
Uncle Charlie?

650
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,320
Uncle Charlie, may we come in?

651
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,240
- See?
- You were right.

652
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,040
Nice room. Do you mind if I take a picture
since he isn't here?

653
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,960
- I don't want to disturb your uncle.
- Oh, I suppose so.

654
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:04,600
But I really can't imagine
anyone being interested in my room.

655
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:09,360
It's not the way I'd like it.
I'd like to have it yellow and white.

656
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,280
Might as well let him work in peace.

657
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,920
Besides, I'd like to talk to you.

658
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:18,800
Your picking us as an average family
gave me a funny feeling.

659
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,680
- What kind of a funny feeling?
- Oh, I don't know.

660
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,480
I guess I don't like to be and average girl
in an average family.

661
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,520
Average families are the best.
Look at me.

662
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,920
- I'm from an average family.
- As average as ours?

663
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,200
Sure.
Besides, I don't think you're average.

664
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:36,520
Oh, that's because you see me now
instead of a few days ago.

665
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:41,760
I was in the dumps. Then Uncle Charlie
came and everything changed.

666
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,720
But your mother said he came last night.
Maybe you just think...

667
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,520
I don't think. I know.

668
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:52,680
Funny, but when I think about how I feel,
I always come back to Uncle Charlie.

669
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:56,720
Are you trying to tell me
I shouldn't think he's so wonderful?

670
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,280
- Oh, no. I...
/- Mr Saunders?

671
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,960
/- I'm ready with the eggs.
- Mr Saunders mustn't move anything.

672
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:08,640
/- My uncle's awfully neat and fussy.
- Saunders is neat and fussy, too.

673
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,600
- Is this your uncle?
/- Yes, it is.

674
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:23,000
Now, for one of the hall.

675
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,240
/Mr Saunders has been
/taking pictures of my room.

676
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:31,440
My sister told me to remind you
about eggs and a cake.

677
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,560
I don't like to be photographed.
I'll have to ask you for the film.

678
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,760
- Oh, Uncle Charlie.
- Give it to me, please.

679
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,320
Give it to him, Fred.

680
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:44,560
That's too bad. There's a picture
of Mrs Newton on this film.

681
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,880
- Excuse me.
/- The eggs are ready.

682
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,680
I can't let them stand another minute.

683
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:03,040
/That was my last roll of film.

684
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,440
Mr Saunders took
Uncle Charlie's picture by mistake

685
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,160
and Uncle Charlie made him
give him back the roll.

686
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,880
He wasn't joking
about not wanting to be photographed.

687
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,800
We didn't want to start a family feud.

688
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,720
I'll get you
making the cake again tomorrow.

689
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,160
I won't be
making a cake again tomorrow.

690
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:20,680
I want to help an important work,
but I cannot go on making cakes.

691
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:23,600
You have helped, Mrs Newton.

692
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,520
And now I'd like to ask another favour.

693
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,800
Could I borrow your daughter?
I'd like to look around the town.

694
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,680
- Ann?
- Charlie.

695
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:35,680
Ann would be better.
Ann knows everything about everybody.

696
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:39,480
- Charlie.
- Well, if, uh, Charlie doesn't mind.

697
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:42,080
- I don't mind.
- Swell.

698
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,880
- Goodbye, then, Mrs Newton.
- Goodbye.

699
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,280
- 6:30?
- 6:30.

700
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,440
- OK. Goodbye.
- Bye.

701
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,240
- Bye, Mr Saunders.
- Bye.

702
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,040
Goodbye.

703
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,560
He seems like a nice young man.

704
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,400
But I thought you were
going to the movies with Catherine.

705
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:06,320
Oh, I'll tell her
I don't feel well or something.

706
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,640
- Hello, Charlie.
- Well... hello, Catherine. Hello, Shirley.

707
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,920
- Hello.
- This is Jack Graham. He's in town.

708
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,840
/- How do you do?
- Hello.

709
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,280
- How's your throat, Charlie?
- Oh, much better. Thank you.

710
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,440
Bill Forest was asking about you.

711
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,960
Oh. Bill Forest?

712
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,160
Well, uh... goodbye.

713
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,320
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

714
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,480
I know what you are, really.

715
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:58,040
You're a detective. There's something
the matter and you're a detective.

716
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,560
- Charlie, listen.
- I don't want to listen.

717
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,160
Why, you're not on a survey at all.

718
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,080
You lied to us. You lied to Mother.

719
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,280
You just wanted to get in our house.
Police.

720
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,160
That's what it is.

721
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:12,400
What do you want with us?
Why are you here, lying to us?

722
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,480
Look, Charlie, you've got to listen to me.
You've got to trust me.

723
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,400
When you've done nothing but lie?

724
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:19,160
And you probably didn't want to
take me out at all the way I thought.

725
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,240
You just wanted to ask me
a lot of questions.

726
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:24,120
Have I asked you a lot of questions?
Have I?

727
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:27,520
Alright, I'm a detective.
A pretty bad one.

728
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,440
Now, won't you even listen to me?

729
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,800
- Why should I when you lied to me?
- I had to.

730
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,520
When I came here to find a man,
I hadn't counted on you.

731
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:38,360
- I hadn't counted on your family.
- Find a man? What man?

732
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,920
There's a man loose in this country.
We're after him.

733
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:44,280
We don't know much.
We don't even know what he looks like.

734
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:48,280
Charlie, think. How much
do you know about your uncle?

735
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:52,400
Why, he's my mother's brother.
What's he got to do with it?

736
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,480
This man we want may be your uncle.

737
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,160
Oh, I don't believe you.
Go away and leave me alone.

738
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:01,640
We're after one man.
Your uncle may be that man.

739
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:05,080
But in the East, there's another man
who's being hunted too,

740
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,560
through Massachusetts and into Maine.
He may be the one.

741
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,880
My uncle hasn't done anything.

742
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,680
He knows it would kill
my mother if he did.

743
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:16,400
He's her younger brother,
just like Roger is mine.

744
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,400
Why don't they arrest
that man in the East?

745
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:21,680
Why don't you go away
and leave us alone?

746
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:24,720
Charlie, when we were eating tonight
and talking about our folks

747
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,200
and what we'd done and how we felt,
we were like two ordinary people.

748
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,240
We'd been brought up about the same.

749
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:34,160
- You liked me and I liked you.
- Oh, it doesn't matter now.

750
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:37,360
What do you mean, "It doesn't matter"?
It's the only thing that does.

751
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,680
If it weren't for you,
you don't think I'd care

752
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,720
how or where I caught up
with your uncle, do you?

753
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:45,960
Because if he's the guy, I'm going to
catch up with him. Remember that.

754
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,240
And you're going to keep
your mouth shut.

755
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,960
You're going to keep your mouth shut
because you're such a nice girl

756
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:54,720
you'd help if you knew
your uncle was the man we wanted.

757
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,560
- I wouldn't help you.
- And I know you would.

758
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,960
And I'm trying to make it easier for you.

759
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:03,040
If your uncle's the man we want,
we'll get him out of town quietly.

760
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,880
- We won't arrest him here.
- Arrest him here? With mother...

761
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,800
I'm trying to tell you we won't.

762
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:14,480
- Please, Charlie.
- I won't say anything.

763
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,960
Oh, take me home!

764
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,000
Good night, Charlie.

765
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,080
It's going to be funny
when you find out you're wrong.

766
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,520
Good night.

767
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,280
- Hello, Charlie. Home already?
- Oh, yes, Dad.

768
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:13,400
It's so nice out, I thought
I'd get some air before I went to bed.

769
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:16,760
You better run in. Your Uncle Charlie's
been asking about you.

770
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,840
I think I'll just go up the back way.

771
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,760
I-I'm tired and I don't feel like talking.

772
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:23,240
Alright. Suit yourself.

773
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,120
Take care of yourself.

774
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,080
- Good night, Herb.
- Good night, Charlie.

775
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,800
Good night, Charlie.

776
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,720
What were we saying, Herb?
Did I notice what?

777
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,600
Well, did you taste anything funny

778
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,800
about that coffee you had
at my house this evening?

779
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:37,960
No. It tasted all right.

780
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,120
That's what I mean. It wasn't all right.

781
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:42,880
- Put something in it?
- Put a little soda.

782
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:46,360
About the same amount that I'd have used
if I'd wanted to use poison.

783
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,880
Well, you don't say?
I never tasted a thing.

784
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,880
Of course, I might not notice the soda.

785
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:55,560
You'd notice the soda more
than you would the poison.

786
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:57,760
For all you knew, you might
just as well be dead now.

787
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,680
Aren't you asleep yet, Ann?

788
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:43,240
Charlotte, what are you doing?

789
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,120
Oh, I'm just looking for a recipe
I thought I saw,

790
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,720
but it's just so torn up.

791
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,880
They have papers in the "libarry",
new ones and old ones.

792
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:53,760
Miss Corcoran will get them out for you.

793
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,320
She won't even notice
if you cut out a little, bitty recipe.

794
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,680
Oh, it's not that important.

795
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,200
What time does the library close?

796
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:07,320
If you read as much as you should,
you'd know it closes at 9:00.

797
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:12,480
Oh, well. If I think about
it, maybe I'll go tomorrow.

798
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,080
You really ought to go to sleep, Ann.

799
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,240
Get back there!
Get back! Get back!

800
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,560
Just a moment, Charlie.
What do you think I am out here for?

801
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,600
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr Norton.

802
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,760
Alright. Go ahead.

803
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,240
Oh! Miss Corcoran, please let me in.

804
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,400
Oh, please!

805
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,600
Oh, thank you.

806
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:09,600
Really, Charlie. You know as well as I do
the library closes at 9:00.

807
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,640
If I make one exception,
I'll have to make a thousand.

808
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:15,360
I'm sorry, Mrs Corcoran, but there is
something in the paper I've got to see.

809
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,800
I'm surprised at you, Charlie.
No consideration.

810
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:20,560
- Oh, I'll only be a minute.
- You've got all day to come here.

811
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,200
I don't know why you want
to rush in here tonight like a madwoman.

812
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,840
I'll give you just three minutes.

813
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:44,920
Can't be anything really awful.

814
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:47,680
I'll prove to him it isn't.

815
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,000
Page three...

816
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,760
Hello.

817
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:30,120
- Where's Charlie?
- Still asleep. I don't want to wake her.

818
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:42,120
- Charlie still asleep?
- No, she just woke up.

819
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:45,880
I shouldn't have let her sleep so long,
but she needed it.

820
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:49,520
She doesn't look quite herself.
She'll be down for dinner.

821
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:11,960
Mother, let me finish mashing those.

822
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:14,920
I'll fix the rest of dinner
and get it on the table.

823
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,320
You go talk to Uncle Charlie.

824
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,200
- How do you feel?
- Fine.

825
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,720
I must have been tired. I slept like a log.

826
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:24,040
Uncle Charlie was asking for you again.
He's fond of you.

827
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:29,600
That nice young man came to ask
after you. I told him you were asleep.

828
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:34,520
I'm rested now. Is the gravy made?

829
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:40,200
Now you're humming that waltz.
Please don't hum that tune anymore.

830
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:43,200
I've just got it out of my head
and don't want it started again.

831
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,800
Please remember, don't hum that tune.

832
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:48,160
And don't keep getting up
every few minutes.

833
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:49,840
You just sit there and be a real lady.

834
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,120
Alright, if you say so,
but at least I can carry in the soup.

835
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:59,760
Roger, wash your hands!
Joe. Charles. Dinner.

836
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:06,040
- Mama...
- Ann, don't put things behind your ear.

837
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:09,200
And don't whisper.
Anyone could hear you a block away.

838
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:10,880
May I sit by you at the table?

839
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,960
By me? I should think
you'd want to sit by Uncle Charlie.

840
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:17,240
/- No, I want to sit by you.
/- Why do you want to change?

841
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,160
Mother, let her change if she wants to.

842
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:21,320
Roger doesn't mind.

843
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:25,320
No, certainly not.
Uncle Charlie might think... Certainly not.

844
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:29,920
- Mother, let her change.
- OK, but Ann has some foolish ideas.

845
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:33,600
Go in the dining room, both of you.

846
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:43,480
What's going on here?
Have I lost my little girl?

847
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:45,920
/Roger wanted to sit next to you,

848
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:49,000
and I thought it would be nice
if the children took turns.

849
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:50,760
- I never...
- Never what, Roger?

850
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:55,080
- Nothing.
- Come, Ann. Come and help me.

851
01:01:55,240 --> 01:02:00,160
Joe! I brought it in by mistake.
Nothing special in it.

852
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:03,520
- Want to look at the headlines, Charles?
- Thank you, Joe.

853
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:08,080
/Roger, don't make so much noise
/with your soup.

854
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:12,520
/If he holds his lips together, he
/could draw it carefully, like a horse.

855
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:15,400
/- Don't be disgusting.
/- May I dip my bread in it?

856
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:18,360
/- Where's Charlie?
/- She wanted to serve dinner.

857
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:22,040
/- She'Il be in in a minute.
/- You're right, Joe.

858
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:25,240
Nothing special tonight. Oh, here she is!

859
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:28,160
/- Here's my girl.
/- How many hours did you sleep?

860
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:31,000
If you could tell me
the exact minute you went to sleep,

861
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:34,280
the exact minute you woke up,
if you woke up in between

862
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:37,160
and how long you stayed awake
each time you woke up,

863
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,040
then I could tell you exactly...

864
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:42,720
You won't sleep tonight.
Nobody who sleeps all day can.

865
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,640
I slept all right, and I kept dreaming,

866
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:49,400
perfect nightmares
about you, Uncle Charlie.

867
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:50,680
Nightmares about me?

868
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:56,360
You were on a train,
running away from something

869
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:59,920
and when I saw you on the train,
I felt terribly happy.

870
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:03,200
/How could you feel happy
/seeing Uncle Charlie on a train?

871
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:06,800
I don't want to see him on a train.
I hope he stays here forever.

872
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:11,840
Well, he has to leave sometime.
We have to face the facts.

873
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,480
I like people who face facts.

874
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:17,920
Well, we're not going
to face any such facts as those.

875
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:22,120
Oh, Ann,
would you like to see the funnies?

876
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:26,400
I'm too old for funnies. I read two books
a week. I took a sacred oath I would.

877
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:30,040
Besides, no one's allowed to read
at the table. It isn't polite.

878
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:31,800
Don't correct your elders!

879
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:33,960
She's right, Emmy.
I'm forgetting my manners.

880
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:36,920
Joe, I'm going to blame this paper on you.

881
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:42,040
Roger, go to the icebox and bring me
a big, red bottle you'll find there.

882
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:45,240
You can throw the paper away.
Dad's read it, you've read it.

883
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,880
We don't need to play any
games with it tonight.

884
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:50,440
/Ann, you can help
/Charlie carry the vegetables.

885
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:53,320
/I saw that bottle
/when I was getting dinner.

886
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:57,320
St Paul said, "Take a little wine
for thy stomach's sake."

887
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,320
Wine for dinner sounds so gay!

888
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:03,960
Remember they had the champagne
when the oldest Jones girl got married?

889
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:05,440
This is sparkling burgundy.

890
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:09,960
One sip and I'll be calling it
"sparkling burgledy."

891
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:12,200
/Maybe I'd better not take any.

892
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:14,640
Oh... imported.

893
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:17,240
Imported Frankie and his tweeds?

894
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,400
And his loaded cane.

895
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:21,600
His loaded everything!

896
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:31,000
/Roger, go get four
/of the small glasses with stems.

897
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:36,560
/Charles, I promised Mrs Greene of our
/club that you'd talk to the ladies.

898
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:41,160
What am I going to talk about?
Travel or current events?

899
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:43,400
Oh, not current events.
We get current events.

900
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:45,560
/Who'll my audience be?

901
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:48,880
Oh, women like myself.
Busy with our homes, most of us.

902
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:51,200
Women keep busy in towns like this.

903
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:56,400
In the cities it's different.
Middle-aged widows, husbands dead,

904
01:04:56,560 --> 01:05:01,320
/husbands who've spent their lives
/making fortunes, working and working,

905
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:05,560
/and then they die and leave their money
to their wives, their silly wives.

906
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:09,200
And what do the wives do,
these useless women?

907
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:13,760
You see them in the best hotels
every day by the thousands,

908
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,160
drinking the money, eating the money,

909
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:19,280
losing the money at bridge,
playing all day and all night,

910
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,360
smelling of money.

911
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:25,000
Proud of their jewellery,
but of nothing else.

912
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:29,640
Horrible, faded, fat, greedy women.

913
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:33,040
/But they're alive! They're human beings.

914
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:36,160
Are they?
/Are they, Charlie?

915
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:40,400
Are they human,
or are they fat, wheezing animals? Hm?

916
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:44,720
And what happens to animals when
they get too fat and too old?

917
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,360
Well, I seem to be making
my speech right here.

918
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:53,080
Don't talk about women like that
in front of my club! You'll be lynched.

919
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:58,080
That nice Mrs Potter's going to be there.
She was asking me about you.

920
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:03,120
The Greenes are bringing her here to
the party I'm having for you afterwards.

921
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,280
Joe, it's Herbert.

922
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,960
He always comes when we're eating.

923
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:12,840
Good evening, Mrs Newton.

924
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,360
- Good evening, Mr Oakley.
- Good evening.

925
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:18,080
/Well, Herb, how's your mother?

926
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,240
Oh, she's just middling.

927
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:24,960
- Had your dinner?
- Oh, I had mine an hour ago.

928
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:29,560
You folks are getting pretty stylish.
Having dinner later every evening.

929
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:37,920
- Joe.
- Huh?

930
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:43,480
- Joe, I-I picked some mushrooms.
- You don't say?

931
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:46,240
Mushrooms mean anything to you, Joe?

932
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:51,400
I eat 'em on my steak when I'm out
and the meat's not good enough as it is.

933
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:53,640
If I brought you some mushrooms,
would you eat 'em?

934
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:55,560
Suppose I would. Why?

935
01:06:55,720 --> 01:07:00,560
Then I've got it. The worst I'd be
accused of would be manslaughter.

936
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:04,320
Doubt if I'd get that.
Accidental death, pure and simple.

937
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:08,720
A basket of good mushrooms and...
two or three poisonous ones.

938
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:13,520
No, no. Innocent party might
get the poisonous ones.

939
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:16,000
I thought of something better
when I was shaving.

940
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:21,080
A bath tub. Pull the legs out
from under you, hold you down.

941
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:25,680
/Oh, what's the matter with you two?

942
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:28,240
Do you always have to
talk about killing people?

943
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,320
We're not talking about killing people.

944
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,360
Herb's talking about killing me,
and I'm talking about killing him.

945
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,400
It's your father's way of relaxing.

946
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:37,600
Can't he find some other way to relax?

947
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:42,240
Can't we have a little peace and quiet
without dragging in poisons all the time?

948
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:45,280
/Charlie!
/She doesn't make sense talking like that.

949
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:47,680
/I'm worried about her.
/Roger, bring her back.

950
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:51,800
I'll go. You stay and finish dinner.
I'll catch up with her.

951
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:54,440
/What's wrong with her?

952
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:09,760
- Excuse me, Mr Norton.
- You're always running around at night.

953
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:13,560
- Where were you hurrying to last night?
- Just doing an errand.

954
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:16,880
- Is this your uncle I've heard about?
- Yes.

955
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:20,200
- Uncle Charlie, Mr Norton.
- Glad to know you. What's the name?

956
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:22,560
Oakley. Charles Oakley. Nice to meet you.

957
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:26,920
Better keep your eye on your niece. I'll
have to give her a ticket for speeding.

958
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:30,240
- City ordinance about running.
- Hear that, Charlie?

959
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,840
Don't want to break the law.
I'll take care of her.

960
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,240
- Good night.
- Good night.

961
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:38,520
What's the matter, Charlie?
What's wrong?

962
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:50,240
- I want to talk to you.
- You're hurting my arm again.

963
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:53,280
- Come in here with me.
- I can't. I don't go to places like this.

964
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:55,440
Go on in.

965
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:10,880
- Why'd you bring me here?
- What does it matter where we are?

966
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,800
Hello, Charlie. Hello.

967
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:16,840
Hello, Louise.
Uncle Charlie, Louise Finch.

968
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:21,360
- This is my uncle.
- I was in Charlie's class in school.

969
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:25,480
I sure was surprised to see you come in.
I never thought I'd see you here.

970
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:29,440
I been here two weeks.
Lost my job over at Kern's.

971
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:33,360
I've been in half the restaurants in town.
What'll you have, Charlie?

972
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:38,560
- Nothing, thank you.
- A ginger ale for her, a brandy for me.

973
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:42,080
- Well, Charlie?
- Well?

974
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:46,080
Think you know something, don't you?
That young fellow told you something.

975
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:48,920
Jack?
Why should he know anything about you?

976
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:56,000
Charlie, something's come between us.
I don't want that to happen.

977
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:58,840
Why, we're old friends.

978
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:03,840
More than that. We're like twins.

979
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,160
- You said so yourself.
- Don't touch me, Uncle Charlie.

980
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:11,480
What did that boy tell you?

981
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:17,880
He's got nothing to do with it. I hope
he never knows anything about you.

982
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:22,880
Charlie,
you're a pretty understanding sort of girl.

983
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:28,280
If you've heard
some little things about me,

984
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:32,960
I guess you're a woman of the world
enough to overlook them.

985
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:39,560
You're the head of your family, Charlie.
Anyone can see that.

986
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:45,080
I'm not so old. I've been chasing
around the globe since I was sixteen.

987
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,320
I guess I've done
some pretty foolish things,

988
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:51,920
made some pretty foolish mistakes.

989
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:55,680
Nothing serious, just... foolish.

990
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:15,520
Oh, Charlie, now,
don't start imagining things.

991
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:20,680
How could you do such things?
You're my uncle,

992
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:22,520
my mother's brother.

993
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:26,280
We thought you were
the most wonderful man in the world.

994
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:29,920
- The most wonderful and the best.
- Charlie, what do you know?

995
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:41,040
I'm sorry I was so long.
We're awful busy.

996
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:46,400
Whose is it? Ain't it beautiful?

997
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:51,240
I'd just die for a ring like that.

998
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:55,160
Yes sir, for a ring like that,
I'd just about die.

999
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:58,480
I love jewellery, real jewellery.

1000
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:03,040
Notice I didn't even have to ask
if it was real. You can tell.

1001
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:05,880
- I can.
- Bring me another brandy.

1002
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,680
Sit down.

1003
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:11,840
Sit down!

1004
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:18,480
You think you know something,
don't you?

1005
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:21,560
You think you're the clever little girl
who knows something.

1006
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:25,400
There's so much you don't know.
So much.

1007
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:27,200
What do you know, really?

1008
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:31,160
You're just an ordinary little girl
living in an ordinary little town.

1009
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:35,320
You wake up every day and know there's
nothing in the world to trouble you.

1010
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:38,040
You go through your ordinary little day.

1011
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:43,840
At night, you sleep your ordinary sleep
filled with peaceful, stupid dreams.

1012
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:47,640
And I brought you nightmares.

1013
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:52,520
Or did I?
Or was it a silly, inexpert, little lie?

1014
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:55,880
You live in a dream.
You're a sleepwalker, blind.

1015
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:58,440
How do you know
what the world is like?

1016
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:01,400
Do you know the world is a foul sty?

1017
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:05,840
Do you know if you ripped
the fronts off houses, you'd find swine?

1018
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,280
The world's a hell.
What does it matter what happens in it?

1019
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:11,880
Wake up, Charlie.
Use your wits. Learn something!

1020
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:13,880
You goin', Charlie?

1021
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:35,960
- Charlie, will you help me?
- Help you?

1022
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:41,240
The same blood flows through our veins.
I was at the end of my rope.

1023
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:46,840
Oh, I'm so tired. There's an end
to the running a man can do.

1024
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,720
You'll never know what it's like
to be so tired. I was going to...

1025
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:58,560
Then I got the idea of coming out here.
It's my last chance, Charlie.

1026
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,200
Give it to me.

1027
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:04,080
Graham and the other fellow,
they don't know.

1028
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:08,120
There's a man in the east they suspect,
and if they get him, I'll...

1029
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:11,640
Charlie, give me this last chance.

1030
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:14,160
Take your chance. Go!

1031
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:17,000
I'll go, Charlie. Just give me a few days.

1032
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:19,600
Think of your mother.
It'll kill your mother.

1033
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:22,920
Yes, it would kill my mother.

1034
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:26,240
Take your few days.
See that you get away from here.

1035
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:29,440
You realise what it'll mean
if they get me?

1036
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,520
The electric chair.

1037
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:35,080
Charlie, you've got to help me.

1038
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:40,240
You said yourself we're no ordinary uncle
and niece, no matter what I've done.

1039
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:43,520
You go in. I'll be in in a minute.

1040
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:00,240
/- Home, sweet home.
/- Where's Charlie?

1041
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:03,200
/- She's outside. Don't worry about her.
/- What was the matter?

1042
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:07,600
/She was a little edgy. I persuaded her
/to go for a walk. She's calmer now.

1043
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:12,840
/- I'm so glad. I've saved dessert for you.
/- We had an ice-cream soda.

1044
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:17,840
/Oops-a-daisy! Off to bed you go!

1045
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:42,720
/- Roger, come here!
- No!

1046
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:50,680
There's my girl. Psst! Ann!

1047
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:53,800
Hello!
You must be trying to hide or something.

1048
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:57,880
- We're not hiding.
- People who are hiding say "psst".

1049
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:00,560
- We just don't want to yell on Sunday.
- Look, Ann.

1050
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:05,200
Ask your sister to run over here.
Just ask her quietly. We'll wait here.

1051
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:08,760
- Did my father have a feud with yours?
- My father?

1052
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:12,760
Because if they didn't, there's no sense
in my asking Charlotte quietly.

1053
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:16,280
Mama won't care. She thinks
girls ought to marry and settle down.

1054
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:18,840
- In a book I'm reading...
- Just ask her, Ann. Don't be literary.

1055
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,760
- Alright.
- Remember, I'm doing all the talking.

1056
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:30,080
/- Hello.
- Hello.

1057
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:32,520
Good morning, Mr Graham.

1058
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:35,560
Catherine, this is Mr Saunders.

1059
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:38,000
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

1060
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:41,440
- Ann says you want to speak to me.
- Saunders wants to.

1061
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:44,960
Come on, Ann.
Tell Catherine the story of Dracula.

1062
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:47,120
Come on, Catherine.

1063
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:52,920
- What do you want?
- Let them get a little bit ahead.

1064
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:02,200
It's about that photograph we took,
the one of your uncle.

1065
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:05,600
- He probably burned it.
- Not that one, he hasn't.

1066
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,920
We gave him the wrong film.

1067
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,240
We got the picture alright.
We wired it East.

1068
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:13,240
They've got witnesses can identify
the man we want from that picture.

1069
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:15,720
- What do you mean, identify him?
- Just what I said.

1070
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:18,960
When the witnesses see that picture,
we'll know whether Oakley's the man.

1071
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:22,040
- We're waiting for the wire now.
- And then Uncle Charlie will be...

1072
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:25,400
That's right. That's the way it is.

1073
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:32,720
Graham thought you could get your uncle
to leave town now. It would be better...

1074
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:36,080
I've got to, haven't I? I've got to!
What's the most time you'll give me?

1075
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:40,040
- Two hours.
- I'll make him leave!

1076
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:42,840
You seem pretty sure
he's the man we want. Why?

1077
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:47,320
No reason why. I'm just scared.
You're the ones who seem sure.

1078
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:51,920
- I couldn't bear anything happening here.
- You know what he's done?

1079
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:54,480
- No, I don't want to hear!
- Well, I want you to get this.

1080
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:59,720
We're doing you a favour. If you know
anything more about your uncle, tell us.

1081
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:02,120
We also want to know
when and how he leaves town.

1082
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:03,800
- If you hold out on us...
- I won't. I'll tell you.

1083
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:09,440
/Step on a crack,
/you'll break your mother's back.

1084
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:12,080
I wish I knew we could trust you.

1085
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:15,200
I won't do anything to help him,
I promise.

1086
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:18,320
But you can't ask me to spy on him.

1087
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:22,000
We've made a bargain.
I'll get him to leave. That's all I'll do.

1088
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:24,760
Think, Charlie. The man's dangerous.
If he gets away from us...

1089
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:29,800
I don't want to hear what he'll do.
We've made a bargain. I'll keep it.

1090
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:32,400
I'll let you know when he leaves.

1091
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:37,360
Funny if he turned out
to be the wrong man. Could be.

1092
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:41,240
/- Ann!
- I broke my mother's back three times.

1093
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:45,360
Not bad. You didn't finish telling me
whether Miss Rose married the rich guy,

1094
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:48,360
- or the one she was in love with.
- How long have you two such friends?

1095
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:51,960
Oh, we play games. I ask questions.
She knows all the answers.

1096
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:54,960
The only trouble is
I can't make out what she's making up.

1097
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:58,320
I never make up anything.
I get everything from my books.

1098
01:18:58,480 --> 01:18:59,960
They're all true.

1099
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:03,920
Come on, Ann. We'd better get home
and help with dinner. Goodbye.

1100
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:07,440
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Mr Graham. Mr Saunders.

1101
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:09,600
- Goodbye, Catherine.
/- Come on, Catherine.

1102
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:14,000
- Why not pick flowers for the table?
- Simple flowers are the best.

1103
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:17,440
I didn't ask for orchids.
/- I wish I'd been born in the South.

1104
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:20,800
/Southern women have a lot of charm.
/They pick flowers with gloves on.

1105
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:23,400
- Goodbye, Catherine.
- Goodbye, Charlie. See you after dinner.

1106
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:25,200
/Bye.

1107
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:28,280
/- Hello, Ann.
- Hello.

1108
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:33,080
How was church, Charlie? Did you
count the house? Turn anybody away?

1109
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:35,480
No, room enough for everyone.

1110
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:37,600
I'm glad to hear that.

1111
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:41,840
Show's been running such a long time,
/I thought attendance might be falling off.

1112
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,480
/Anything special on the noon broadcast?

1113
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:48,760
They caught that other fellow,
the Merry Widow Murderer.

1114
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:52,000
- They did, did they? Where?
- State of Maine. Portland.

1115
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:55,400
Didn't catch him exactly.
He was running away from the police,

1116
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:59,840
and they cornered him at the airport
and he ran into the propeller of a plane.

1117
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,800
- Oh, boy!
- Cut him all to pieces.

1118
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:04,160
Had to identify him by his clothes.

1119
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:08,120
His shirts were all initialled,
"C," "O," apostrophe "H."

1120
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:10,680
Well, makes a good ending.
Couldn't have done better myself.

1121
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:13,000
I guess that closes that case pretty final.

1122
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:16,280
/Sure does.
/Never cared much for that case.

1123
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:21,800
Well, I think I'll go get ready for dinner.
I'm hungry. I can eat a good dinner today.

1124
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:21,720
Charlie, I have great news for you.
Where can we talk alone?

1125
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:37,440
We got a wire from Maine. We can call off
the job. I'll bet you're relieved. I am.

1126
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,320
Oh, I am relieved.

1127
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:42,920
You were trying to get youruncle out.
He must have thought you were crazy.

1128
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:46,080
Now that it's over, I don't
want to talk about it any more.

1129
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,760
I'd like to pretend the whole
dreadful thing never happened.

1130
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:52,920
- There's nothing to pretend about.
- There's mother's gloves.

1131
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:55,920
Mother and her gloves.
She's always losing things.

1132
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:59,240
All mothers lose things.
Someday, she'll be losing you.

1133
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:02,960
Mothers don't lose daughters,
they gain sons.

1134
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:06,360
Yes, but gain isn't always the word.
Now, take me.

1135
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:08,880
Who'd want a detective
for a son-in-law?

1136
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:11,120
- My father would.
- He would?

1137
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:16,360
If you told him you were going to marry
a detective, he wouldn't disown you?

1138
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:18,360
It wouldn't have to be me. There's Ann.

1139
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:22,560
No, Ann wants to marry a librarian.
She told me.

1140
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:26,360
So she'll always have
plenty of books around to read.

1141
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:30,040
What's the matter?

1142
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:33,680
I was laughing.
It's been so long since I laughed.

1143
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,480
I like it when you laugh.

1144
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:40,680
I like it when you don't.
I guess I like you whatever you do.

1145
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:45,120
- I guess I like you.
- I'm glad. I like you too.

1146
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:50,280
Funny how you happen to meet someone
and like them and... like them.

1147
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,120
- Charlie?
- Yes?

1148
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:58,680
I suppose it couldn't ever really happen
some day that you'd tell your father...

1149
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:02,440
You know, about marrying someone,
a detective, I mean.

1150
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:05,720
- I don't know.
- I didn't mean to tell you.

1151
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:09,040
I wanted to wait until you'd forgotten
the mess we've been through together,

1152
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:12,080
till you didn't think of me as part
of something unpleasant and frightening.

1153
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:16,560
I wanted to wait and come back
and then tell you.

1154
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:18,920
But I can't help it.
I want to tell you now.

1155
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:22,520
I love you, Charlie. I love you terribly.

1156
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:26,680
I know it's no time to tell you now
and I'm sorry. Do you mind?

1157
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:29,560
- I don't mind.
- Do you think you could think about it?

1158
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:33,800
- About your loving me?
- And perhaps your loving me?

1159
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:40,400
I-I'd like us to be friends. I know that.
We are friends.

1160
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:44,000
- I'd like to have that to think about.
- Nothing more?

1161
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:48,240
I don't know, Jack.
I... just don't know yet.

1162
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:51,400
Alright. But I may come back?

1163
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:55,960
Oh, please come back.
Please come back.

1164
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:58,680
Listen, Charlie.

1165
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:01,360
When I go, go back to that square
in the middle of town.

1166
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:05,040
Take a good look at it.
That's where I first knew I loved you.

1167
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:08,960
That's where we had the fight
and I didn't know what to do.

1168
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:11,960
I like my job,
but I didn't like it that night.

1169
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:14,040
I hated it that night.

1170
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:17,200
- You hate it now?
- No, not now.

1171
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:23,440
You know, this is a swell place.
I'm going to put a bronze plaque up.

1172
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:28,560
That door's always banging shut!

1173
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:31,320
Oh! It sticks.

1174
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:46,600
What are you two locking yourselves
in the garage for?

1175
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:48,880
- When I was young, it was the parlour.
- Hello, Mr Oakley.

1176
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:51,320
- I was saying goodbye to Charlie.
- In the garage?

1177
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:54,560
The door got stuck.
Now I'll have to say goodbye to you.

1178
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:58,680
Let's say goodbye out here on the lawn.
No use taking a chance on the garage.

1179
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:01,720
- Finished here?
- All finished, but I'll be back.

1180
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:04,200
You'Il be seeing me around.

1181
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:06,560
Not on business, though.

1182
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:10,600
I can understand you coming back.
Charlie's a fine girl.

1183
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:13,120
She's the thing I love most in the world.

1184
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:16,440
I mean it. Have a nice trip, Mr Graham.

1185
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:19,600
And don't take any more photographs
without permission.

1186
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:22,000
Rights of man. You know, freedom?

1187
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:25,760
We'll have a talk
about freedom some day, Mr Oakley.

1188
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,720
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

1189
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:39,680
Don't forget to write.
Remember, you have the addresses.

1190
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:48,360
Jack!

1191
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:25,520
Anything else? I've got butter, fruit,
green thread and go to the library.

1192
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:29,800
And whatever vegetable looks freshest.
If I've forgotten anything, I'll send Ann.

1193
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:31,720
Alright.

1194
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:38,360
Mother!

1195
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:41,200
Charlie! Darling! Are you hurt?

1196
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:43,520
I tripped.

1197
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:46,160
Oh, what is it? Is it your ankle?

1198
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:49,160
I don't think I'm hurt.
I grabbed the banister.

1199
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:50,800
You might have been killed!

1200
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:55,960
I worry myself sick every time
one of you comes down these stairs.

1201
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:58,880
They're too steep and rickety.
They ought to be fixed.

1202
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:01,160
Are you sure you're all right?

1203
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:42,320
When are you leaving, Uncle Charlie?

1204
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:46,480
Oh, come now. That other business,
it's all over. I'd like to forget it.

1205
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:49,240
- We're all happy here.
- When are you leaving?

1206
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:51,400
I'm not going, you see.

1207
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:54,560
Not yet. I'm not going.

1208
01:27:54,720 --> 01:27:58,520
I want to settle down. Live somewhere
people know me. Put some money by.

1209
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:03,000
- Start a business. Be part of the family.
- I see.

1210
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:07,440
The most sensible thing for you to do
is to be friends with me.

1211
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:10,240
I can do a lot for you, Charlie,
for all of you.

1212
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:14,240
No, not you.
We don't want anything from you.

1213
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:18,800
- I wish I'd told my mother about you.
- I know what you've been thinking.

1214
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:22,520
How would your mother have felt?
What would it do to her now?

1215
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:25,760
How about your father?
His job at the bank?

1216
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:28,480
What would become of all of you
if everything came out?

1217
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:31,880
You needn't be afraid. I can't tell them.

1218
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:36,520
But I'm not afraid. What would you tell?
Who'd believe you?

1219
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:38,760
A waltz runs through your head.

1220
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:43,000
You don't like the initials on a ring and
connect it up with a newspaper clipping.

1221
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:45,560
Now, you haven't even got the ring.
I don't know what became of it.

1222
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:48,520
- You have it.
- I?

1223
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:50,680
I gave it to you.

1224
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:57,040
I don't want you here, Uncle Charlie.
I don't want you to touch my mother.

1225
01:28:57,200 --> 01:29:02,040
So go away, I'm warning you.
Go away, or I'll kill you myself.

1226
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:04,120
See? That's the way I feel about you.

1227
01:29:30,160 --> 01:29:32,560
- Here you are, Joe.
- Oh, perfume.

1228
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:36,680
- Just the fresh, clean smell of lavender.
- Yeah, I know.

1229
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:38,640
You look very handsome, both of you.

1230
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:42,760
- I'm proud of the two men in my family.
- Emmy, you're a dream.

1231
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:45,400
It's a pity the children
have to sit on our laps.

1232
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:48,720
It's going to be a tight squeeze.
It won't do my pants any good.

1233
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:52,280
/- Joe, I wish you could drive.
/- We do it this way.

1234
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:55,880
/- Charles, you'll sit...
- He can sit in the back with Dad.

1235
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:58,240
The children can fit in beside them.

1236
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:00,120
Nonsense. I'm getting a cab.
You all go in the taxi.

1237
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:03,960
- Charlie and I'll go in the car.
- No, Uncle Charlie, you go in the taxi.

1238
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:05,320
I want to ride in the taxi!

1239
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:07,680
Course you do. So it's all arranged.

1240
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:11,640
- Charlie, run out and get the car.
- I'd rather drive the family.

1241
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:16,800
I want you to hear my speech
on the way. You're my severest critic.

1242
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:21,360
/Anyway, we need a taxi.
/Ann, go call Mr Abercrombie.

1243
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:23,920
Mother!

1244
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:29,200
Mother, please ride with me.
Father can take the children. Please!

1245
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:20,080
/Bet I'll be the only man outside
/of Charles fool enough to dress up.

1246
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:24,240
/Then you'll be the only other one
/to be correct. You look distinguished.

1247
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:26,680
/Charles, are you all ready?
Joe, are you?

1248
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:29,200
Wait a minute!
I've got to get my overcoat.

1249
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:31,360
Please, dear. Hurry!

1250
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:34,520
Take your time, Emmy.
They can't start till I get there.

1251
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:36,720
It's getting chilly in here.

1252
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:39,120
/KSRO, Santa Rosa,

1253
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:42,440
/with studios in Vallejo
/and Santa Rosa, California.

1254
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:45,200
May as well have a little music
while we wait.

1255
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:48,600
/Oregon State Police pressed their search
/today for five...

1256
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:51,600
Oh! Does it have to be so loud?

1257
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:53,560
Gets the lower tones better.

1258
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:57,880
I like it loud! If the music's too soft,
I can't tell what they're playing.

1259
01:31:58,040 --> 01:32:00,200
If I have a band,
I'm a-least have 87 men.

1260
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:03,160
Help, everybody!
Somebody's caught in the garage.

1261
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:06,200
They're suffocating!
There's something wrong with the door.

1262
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:08,240
Joe!

1263
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:33,520
I'll take her. I've got her.

1264
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:39,920
Joe, there's some whisky on my bureau.
Get it quick.

1265
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:42,600
- Charlie. Charlie. Dear Charlie.
- Charlie?

1266
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:45,640
Emmy, rub her feet.
Roger, run get something to fan her with.

1267
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:48,080
Charlie!

1268
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:50,680
/Ann, don't, dear.

1269
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:54,000
Charlie? What are you trying to say?

1270
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:02,520
Go away.

1271
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:05,680
Emmy, she wants you.

1272
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:10,280
I'm here, darling. Here's mother.
That's right, my baby.

1273
01:33:10,440 --> 01:33:14,120
That's right, my brave little girl. Here.

1274
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:16,560
- Take a little sip of this.
- No, I'm all right.

1275
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:21,280
- Joe, call Dr Phillips.
- No, I'm all right. I just want to get up.

1276
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:25,240
You had a wonderful escape. Someone
must have left the motor running.

1277
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:28,800
- I couldn't find the key to turn it off.
- The key was there when I went in.

1278
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:31,080
Lucky thing I passed by.

1279
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:34,640
She might have died. You saved her.
You knew just what to do.

1280
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:38,840
- Don't know how I happened across her.
- We'll put the lecture off.

1281
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:43,320
Oh, yes, there is. I want you all to go.
There's the cab now.

1282
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:46,080
Oh, I couldn't. I just couldn't go.

1283
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:49,400
Wh-Who found me in the garage?

1284
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:51,760
/Herb heard you beating on the door.

1285
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:55,760
I was coming across the backyard
and I heard gaspin' and bangin'.

1286
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:58,800
I figured there must be
a human bein' in there.

1287
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:01,040
Quick thinking, Herb.
/- Lucky thing.

1288
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:03,520
I'm glad you happened
to be going by, Herb.

1289
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:05,920
Come on, Mother.

1290
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,800
I-I want to stay with you.

1291
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:12,400
I don't feel like making a speech now,
when I think what might have happened.

1292
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:16,360
I'm all right. I just want to sit
on the porch a while and get the air.

1293
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:18,280
No, darling, I won't hear of it.

1294
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:23,280
I'm alright, really. I'd rather stay home
and get things ready for the party.

1295
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:25,880
Darling, I want to stay with you.

1296
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:34,360
Herb, will you take Roger?
Ann, you come with us.

1297
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:41,800
I just don't understand it.
First the stairs and...

1298
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:02,360
Mr Graham isn't there?

1299
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:07,480
This is the Hotel Stewart in Fresno,
isn't it?

1300
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:10,000
And you don't expect him?

1301
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:12,200
I see. Thank you.

1302
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:17,520
He isn't there?
Thank you very much. Goodbye.

1303
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:20,680
Can you tell me where I can reach him?

1304
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:24,880
I've already tried to get him
at the address he gave me in Fresno.

1305
01:35:26,280 --> 01:35:28,280
Thank you.

1306
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:07,120
Mom, may we have some sandwiches?

1307
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:11,000
Don't take anything from the dining room.
Go in the kitchen.

1308
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:14,280
Please go. And just leave your coats...

1309
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:17,760
Joe, dear,
will you take care of everyone?

1310
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:19,400
Charlie!

1311
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:21,320
/I'll be right down.

1312
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:24,440
/Well... now... hm.

1313
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:31,640
Now, Mr Oakley. I thought champagne
was only for battleships!

1314
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:37,240
None for me, nor I'm sure, for my wife.
But we hope you'll all forget we're here.

1315
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:40,480
I'd like to propose a toast to...
Isn't Charlie coming down?

1316
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:43,440
She'll be down in a moment.
Mrs Potter.

1317
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:48,200
Not that one. Why do I make tomato?
They always soak through the bread.

1318
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:52,920
Try one of these. It's whole wheat bread
and cream cheese. Paprika makes it pink.

1319
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:55,360
/- Mr Greene.
- Mrs Greene, what would you like?

1320
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:57,160
Thank you.

1321
01:36:57,320 --> 01:37:00,120
- I think I'd like to propose a toast, too.
- Emmy.

1322
01:37:00,280 --> 01:37:05,280
To our distinguished visitor, who made
the best speech heard in town for years.

1323
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:08,480
To that very good fellow, Mr Oakley.

1324
01:37:08,640 --> 01:37:11,080
- Herbie.
- Thank you.

1325
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:13,160
/We don't get many American speakers.

1326
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:15,040
/Seems like foreigners
/make the best talkers.

1327
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:21,480
Ah, here she is. Now for my toast.

1328
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:31,400
Charlie...

1329
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:35,320
You're just in time for a farewell toast.

1330
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:40,320
I hate to break the news to you like this,
but tomorrow I must leave Santa Rosa.

1331
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:43,520
- Not forever.
- If that isn't the strangest coincidence.

1332
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:46,160
/- I'm off to San Francisco.
- Charles?

1333
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:50,520
Oh, Emmy darling,
I didn't mean to spoil your fun tonight.

1334
01:37:50,680 --> 01:37:54,360
I got a letter today.
I have to catch the early morning train.

1335
01:37:55,240 --> 01:37:57,240
I'll miss you, Emmy.

1336
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:04,880
But I want you all to know
I'll always think of this lovely town...

1337
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:08,920
as a place of hospitality
and kindness...

1338
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,880
and homes... homes.

1339
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:17,640
- But I can't bear it if you go, Charles.
- Oh, Emmy, I'll be back.

1340
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:23,240
I've arranged with Dr Phillips
for our little memorial for the children.

1341
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:27,240
It isn't any of the things you've done.

1342
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:33,520
It's just the idea
that we were together again. I'm sorry.

1343
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:37,520
But you see,
we were so close growing up.

1344
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:41,080
And then Charles went away,
and I got married, and...

1345
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:44,720
Then, you know how it is.

1346
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:48,960
You sort of forget you're you.
You're your husband's wife...

1347
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:54,680
We'll be looking for you. We feel
you're one of us, don't we, Margaret?

1348
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:58,320
Indeed. I want to thank you
on behalf of our club.

1349
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:00,440
And bless you
for your gift to our hospital.

1350
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:04,080
- The children will bless you, too.
- Thank you, sir.

1351
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:07,640
Excuse me, sir,
but I-I can hear the train coming now.

1352
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:09,200
Excuse me.

1353
01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:22,680
Better get aboard, Charles.

1354
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:27,360
Alright. Goodbye, everybody.
Roger, Ann, come see the train.

1355
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:30,240
Come on, Charlie.
You can see they get off.

1356
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:32,200
Alright.

1357
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:34,520
/I want to see the rooms,
/the private ones.

1358
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:38,520
/I've seen berths. I've slept in two uppers
/and one lower with papa.

1359
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:41,360
- Goodbye, Joe.
- Goodbye, Charles.

1360
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:44,680
- Goodbye, Emmy.
- Goodbye. And don't forget to write!

1361
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:48,760
I will. You write too.
I'll send you my address.

1362
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:55,720
Goodbye.

1363
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:01,120
Don't jump on the seats, Roger.

1364
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:05,120
Roger, what did I tell you?

1365
01:40:08,440 --> 01:40:12,080
Porter, there's one more bag
in the other car. Will you get it, please?

1366
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:15,360
Charlie, the train's going to start.
I don't want to get carried away.

1367
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:18,200
Maybe it's too late!
Maybe I'll have to go along!

1368
01:40:18,360 --> 01:40:20,440
There's plenty of time.
You run along, we'll follow.

1369
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:22,200
Charlie.

1370
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:24,960
Just a minute.

1371
01:40:26,160 --> 01:40:30,120
I want you to know
I think you were right to make me leave.

1372
01:40:31,120 --> 01:40:34,600
It's best for your mother,
best for all of us.

1373
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:38,720
You saw what happened
to her last night.

1374
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:43,440
She's not very strong, you know.
I don't think she could stand the shock.

1375
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:46,680
- I remember once, when she was little...
- The train's moving!

1376
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:50,040
Listen, Charlie.
I want you to forget all about me.

1377
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:52,880
Forget that I ever came to Santa Rosa.

1378
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:55,840
Your hands!

1379
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:00,760
Let me go, Uncle Charlie! Let me go!

1380
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:06,280
I've got to do this, Charlie...

1381
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:09,120
so long as you know
what you do about me.

1382
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:22,680
Not yet, Charlie. Let
it get a little faster.

1383
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:26,040
Just a little faster.

1384
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:27,480
Faster.

1385
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:29,080
Now!

1386
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:56,000
/Santa Rosa has gained
/and lost a son,

1387
01:41:56,160 --> 01:41:58,560
/a son that she can be proud of.

1388
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:03,200
/Brave, generous, kindly.
/With all of the spendid dignity...

1389
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:06,280
I'm glad you were able to come, Jack.

1390
01:42:06,440 --> 01:42:10,240
I couldn't have faced it
without someone who knew.

1391
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:15,640
- I did know more. I couldn't tell you.
- I know.

1392
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:20,920
He thought the world
was a horrible place.

1393
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:24,760
- He couldn't have been very happy ever.
- No.

1394
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:30,400
He didn't trust people.
He seemed to hate them.

1395
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:32,760
He hated the whole world.

1396
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:37,520
You know, he said that people like us

1397
01:42:37,680 --> 01:42:41,600
had no idea
what the world was really like.

1398
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:44,600
Well, it's not quite as bad as that,

1399
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:47,480
but sometimes it needs a lot of watching.

1400
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:50,480
It seems to go crazy every now and then.

1401
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:52,640
Like your Uncle Charlie.

1402
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:56,600
/The beauty of their souls,
/and characters live on with us forever.
