1
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,211
My name is Dalton Russell.

2
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,922
Pay strict attention
to what I say

3
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:51,884
because I choose my words carefully
and I never repeat myself.

4
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,971
I've told you my name.
That's the "who."

5
00:00:56,432 --> 00:01:00,226
The "where" could most readily
be described as a prison cell.

6
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:02,019
<i>But there's a vast difference</i>

7
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:05,815
<i>between being stuck in a tiny
cell and being in prison.</i>

8
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,943
The "what" is easy.

9
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:14,449
Recently I planned and set in motion events
to execute the perfect bank robbery.

10
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:17,118
That's also the "when."

11
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:21,873
As for the "why," beyond the
obvious financial motivation,

12
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:24,417
it's exceedingly simple.

13
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:27,003
Because I can.

14
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:30,715
Which leaves us only
with the "how."

15
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,010
And therein, as the
Bard would tell us,

16
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:36,763
lies the rub.

17
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,920
So, your mother tells me about

18
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:01,217
a certain young lady who's helping you
with the Triborough Bridge project?

19
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,011
- Okay?
- All right, okay.

20
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,138
He's crazy.

21
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:13,312
- Now? On 51st? 50...
- Yeah, that's where he is right now.

22
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:17,483
He's on 40, he... No, he's still on 47th
Street, but it's a much smaller space.

23
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,318
What do I have to...

24
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:24,532
Yeah, we'll get lobster. I'll put it on Mr.
Ansinori's card.

25
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:28,619
Whatever. It's a meeting with one
of his clients or something.

26
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,457
Because it's been like
over a year now. Yeah.

27
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,754
I want to snap this guy's
neck, I swear to God.

28
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,217
So what?

29
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:48,014
So what? They're flowers. They
could've been to his grandmother.

30
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,933
They could've been to me.
It's my birthday, so...

31
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:55,396
Okay, so maybe it's a client's.

32
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,234
Okay. This is funny.

33
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:04,321
I got this guy in front of me that
thinks I don't see him looking at me.

34
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:07,616
Fantastic. God damn it.

35
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,326
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

36
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,954
Can you lower your voice
just a little bit, please?

37
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,915
You're getting a little
loud on your phone. Please.

38
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,292
Yeah. Fine.

39
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,169
I don't want you disturbing
the other customers.

40
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,503
- Sorry.
- All right?

41
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,464
- Yeah, you got it.
- Thank you.

42
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,217
It was a security guy.

43
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:28,471
I didn't know I was in a library.
It's a fucking bank.

44
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,181
Manhattan Trust.

45
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,146
...from Yale. And this fucking
rich prick I work for.

46
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:42,818
Thank you.

47
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,791
Excuse me. Sir?

48
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,167
Easy.

49
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,754
Everybody get down on
the fucking floor! Now!

50
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,382
Get down on the ground!

51
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:09,303
You have four seconds!
Anyone still standing gets shot!

52
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:12,765
One! Two! Three!

53
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:16,102
Back away from that counter! Get
your hand away from that button!

54
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:19,688
Put your hands on the floor!
Now!

55
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,607
Oh... What the... What is this?

56
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,026
- Todd, what are we gonna do?
- What the fuck do you want me to do?

57
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:26,195
- Keep your head down, fat man!
- All right!

58
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,781
Get your fucking
face on the floor!

59
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,869
You get the same treatment
as everyone else, Rabbi.

60
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:35,955
Get down.

61
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:43,295
Now, my friends and I are making

62
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,132
a very large withdrawal
from this bank.

63
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,803
Anybody gets in our way
gets a bullet in the brain.

64
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,349
Lie down, old man! Put
your fucking hands down!

65
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:58,393
- Get your face on the floor.
- All right, I'm down! I'm down!

66
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,733
Hey, Officer, there's smoke
coming out of there.

67
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:21,208
Possible 10-30. Manhattan Trust.
20 Exchange Place.

68
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:23,085
I have got hostages.

69
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:27,131
You fucking cops come near this
door, I start killing people.

70
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,383
I not fucking kidding, man.

71
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,349
Central. Give me an 85.

72
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,185
Back up, sir! Back up! You!

73
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,644
- Shit!
- Back up! Back up!

74
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,271
Stay around the corner!

75
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,315
Central, give me an 85.

76
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,650
Perp with a gun.
Possible hostages.

77
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:50,029
I repeat, possible hostages. 20 Exchange.
Manhattan Trust.

78
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,780
Baby, I'm fighting for
my life over here.

79
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,867
Keith, every time we have this
conversation, it's the same thing.

80
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,202
- "Not now."
<i>- Listen. Listen.</i>

81
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,412
Do you know what kind of
thin ice I'm on right now

82
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,539
with this check-cashing thing?
They want to lock me up.

83
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,833
<i>If this $140,000 doesn't
show up somewhere soon,</i>

84
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:05,211
<i>- things gonna get rough for me.</i>
- But you didn't take it.

85
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:08,005
Of course I didn't take it, baby.
It's just some lying drug dealer

86
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,007
trying to save his own
ass by fucking me over.

87
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,884
- Eventually, it'll go away.
<i>- Then what?</i>

88
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,178
- What about us?
<i>- Then, you know, I'll make First Grade</i>

89
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:17,097
and we'll have enough money to buy a
bigger place and then, you know...

90
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,975
Why we got to have this conversation
every time your brother gets locked up

91
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,978
<i>- or gets caught stealing a car?</i>
- He's the only family I've got.

92
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,980
All right, I'm sorry, baby.
You okay?

93
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,732
- You still love me?
- I'm sorry, too.

94
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,377
<i>- You still love me?</i>
- I love you, baby.

95
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,569
All right. Big Willie and the
twins for you when I get home.

96
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:32,988
- I got the handcuffs.
- I got the gun.

97
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,615
Bye, Big Daddy.

98
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,910
- Big Willie and the twins, huh?
- That's correсt.

99
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:41,872
Her lowlife brother, he's got three
priors, one for armed robbery.

100
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:45,251
17-year-old high-school dropout. Doesn't
have an honest bone in his body

101
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:48,587
and he's too fucking stupid to amount
to anything. Even as a criminal.

102
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:51,006
- Can't you get rid of him?
- I could, couldn't I?

103
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,651
No, she loves him. What am I gonna do?
Put him out in the street?

104
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:55,261
- How's he feel about you?
- Oh, he's thrilled.

105
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,012
To have a deteсtive
sleeping in the next room,

106
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,306
banging his sister. Then she tries
to bring it all back on me.

107
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:02,072
You know, "if we had a bigger place,
we wouldn't have this problem."

108
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,645
Of course, if we got married
then things would be different.

109
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,690
- And what's wrong with that?
- A wedding. Furniture. Kids.

110
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,233
You know what a
diamond ring costs?

111
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,735
- Come on, man. You've been married.
- Please. I was 21.

112
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,030
- Yeah, but you give her a ring?
- Yeah, but she won't call me back.

113
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:18,409
- You guys cops?
- Oh, shit! He made us!

114
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,953
Christmas came early
for you this year.

115
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:24,123
Bank robbery. Hostage situation.
20 Exchange Place.

116
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,292
- What?
- Grossman's on vacation. You're up.

117
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:29,044
What about the Madrugada thing?
The check-cashing thing?

118
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,529
- I thought I was in the doghouse.
- I just threw you a bone.

119
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,349
As far as I'm concerned,
you still work here,

120
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,592
- but if you don't think you're ready...
- No, no, he's ready!

121
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,303
Oh, good. Good.

122
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,930
I'm giving you a break, here.
Don't make me look like a fool.

123
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:42,599
- This is it, baby. The show!
- Yeah.

124
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,310
You got the call, man. God damn!

125
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,895
I guess I should be happy. I
might get to put off I.A. B.

126
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,981
Here's all you need to know.
You walk in unarmed.

127
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,786
Head bad guy puts a gun to your head
and makes you get on your knees.

128
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,570
You look around. There are five
armed men pointing Uzis at you.

129
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,196
Just picture them
in their underwear.

130
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,882
How about orange
jumpsuits and shackles?

131
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:01,493
- There you go, Keith. You can do this, man.
- Look out, bad guys. Here I come.

132
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:28,187
Get back around the corner!
Get back!

133
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:30,773
I told you, move it! Move it!

134
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,443
Get those people back! Get
them the hell out of here!

135
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:39,198
All right, guys, as soon as we
pull up, I want everybody out.

136
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:43,786
The second floor window. Now.

137
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:47,081
- Let them in there!
- Let's go! Go now!

138
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,292
Sarge, what do you got?

139
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:53,087
I got a perp in the bank.
Possible hostage situation.

140
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:54,451
Who's on today? Who's your boss?

141
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:56,673
- Sergeant Hernandez. I'll get him over here.
- Get him down here.

142
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:59,176
- Sergeant Hernandez, you on the air?
- On the air. Go.

143
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,012
Sarge, I got Sergeant Collins over here.
He called this in.

144
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:03,555
Can you come over
to the other side?

145
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,849
Redirect, on my way. Let's go.

146
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,155
Back up! Go around,
around the corner.

147
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,533
- Pull back. Pull it back.
- We got to keep this secure.

148
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:24,743
- Collins? What you got?
- Hernandez.

149
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:28,497
I got a perp inside with a gun. He
claims he's got some hostages in there.

150
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,584
Everyone, heads up!
Let's clear the way!

151
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,898
Let's go. Set them up.
All right.

152
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,609
We've got it under control.

153
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,778
Step back, please!

154
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:02,114
- Step back!
- Get back! Thank you.

155
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,074
There's nothing going on.

156
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,160
You'll see it on
the news tonight.

157
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:07,911
Step back, please.

158
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:21,133
Mr. Case?

159
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,886
Oh, good morning, Katherine.
What can I do for you?

160
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,181
Sir, there's a robbery in
progress at one of our branches.

161
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:28,515
Oh, my.

162
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,978
- Has anybody been hurt?
- I don't think so, but there are hostages.

163
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:35,397
Oh, how awful.

164
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:40,235
- Which branch is it?
- Number 32. 20 Exchange Place.

165
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:43,322
- Which one?
- 20 Exchange Place.

166
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,701
Thank you, Katherine.

167
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,578
I'm sorry, Mr. Case.

168
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:02,925
Oh, dear God.

169
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:08,013
Get these people out of here. Come
on, open these gates. Back up.

170
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,349
Up on the sidewalk. Come on in.

171
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,524
Sergeant Collins, first on scene.
Are you the hostage negotiator?

172
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:21,318
That's right. Detective Frazier. This
is Detective Mitchell. What do you got?

173
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,320
Not much. Saw the bank
was filled with smoke.

174
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,697
The door was locked. I tried
to take a look inside

175
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:29,201
and one of the gunmen opens the
door, sticks a .357 in my face,

176
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,870
screaming in some foreign
accent about killing hostages.

177
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:34,665
- See any other gunmen?
- No, sir. I couldn't see anything at all.

178
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,375
- You hear anything inside?
- No, sir,

179
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:40,462
but with that .357 sticking in my face,
I can't really be sure. I'm sorry.

180
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:42,005
Okay.

181
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:46,760
Good, good. Good, good, good, good.
You did a good job, Sergeant.

182
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,221
You ever had a gun stuck
in your face before?

183
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,347
- Yeah, once.
- Really?

184
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,182
Yeah, by a 12-year-old.

185
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:55,686
- What was that like?
- Not one of my better days.

186
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,896
I bet. All right, well, look.

187
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:00,607
As soon as we get this thing cleared
up, we'll cut you loose, all right?

188
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:02,652
If you don't mind, I'd
rather hang around a while,

189
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:04,444
at least until we make contaсt.

190
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,822
That's what I like
to hear, Sergeant.

191
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:28,343
What? Come on. Why you doing this?
Why you doing this to me?

192
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:32,472
Pop, what's going on? Yo.

193
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:39,521
All bank employees,
raise your hands!

194
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:44,651
Bank employees, this side!
Everyone else, over there!

195
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:55,454
Now, I need everybody to take
your cell phones and your keys

196
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:59,207
out of your pockets and handbags
and hold them in the air.

197
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,813
- What's your name?
- Peter.

198
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:24,399
- Peter what?
- Peter Hammond.

199
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,778
- Where's your cell phone, Peter Hammond?
- I left it at home.

200
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:33,700
Peter, think very carefully about
how you answer the next question

201
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:37,037
because if you get it wrong,
your headstone will read,

202
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,248
"Here lies Peter Hammond, hero,

203
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,627
"who valiantly attempted to
prevent a brilliant bank robbery

204
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,546
"by trying to hide
his cellular phone,

205
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:50,258
"but wound up getting shot
in the fucking head."

206
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:54,429
Now, Peter Hammond,

207
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,848
where is your cell phone?

208
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,434
I'm telling you, I did.
I left it at home.

209
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:57,075
Okay, I fucked up. I'm sorry.
Please.

210
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,161
Hey. Don't worry about it.

211
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:22,726
Just let me talk to you!
Please, please, listen to me.

212
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,352
Let me explain.

213
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,981
Help! Help me.

214
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:31,568
Stop!

215
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,714
Anyone else here
smarter than me?

216
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:01,973
- And you are?
- Vikram Walia.

217
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:04,810
Vikram Walia. Thanks, Vikram.

218
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,228
Hey, mister.

219
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,484
Keep it.

220
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,237
Men here. Women here.

221
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:17,656
Move!

222
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:26,915
I need all of you to strip
down to your underwear.

223
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:29,876
Now.

224
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:53,233
Lady?

225
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:58,947
Believe me. This is the only situation
where I'd ask you to do this.

226
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:03,618
- But take off your fucking clothes.
- No.

227
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,913
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

228
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,375
What's with you mishegoyim?

229
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,752
Go ahead. Make my day.

230
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:15,422
- Take your fucking clothes off, lady.
- No!

231
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,383
Stevie?

232
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,221
Let's go!

233
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,225
Now, I need all of you

234
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:30,228
to put on one of these
suits and these masks.

235
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:43,450
<i>I'm Shon Gables, with CBS 2 News,
outside Manhattan Trust Bank,</i>

236
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:46,036
<i>where we have just been
told by investigators,</i>

237
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,787
<i>the bank has been robbed.</i>

238
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:51,082
<i>The suspect or possible
suspects are inside,</i>

239
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,043
<i>holed up with an unknown
number of hostages.</i>

240
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:54,753
- Captain Darius?
- Yeah.

241
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,797
I'm Deteсtive Frazier. This
is Deteсtive Mitchell.

242
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:57,923
Hey.

243
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,383
You may remember, we worked
that hospital thing on 93rd,

244
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:02,093
during my training?

245
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,596
Oh, yeah. That was a real shame.

246
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,890
Yeah, it was. It was.

247
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,224
So, what do we got?

248
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:11,978
I got an unknown number of suspects
and an unknown number of hostages,

249
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:15,607
and a bank, and about a million spectators,
and I can't see shit inside there,

250
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,400
- so I'm kind of busy.
- I understand.

251
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:20,153
The way this works, Mr. Frazier,
is I deal with Mr. Grossman.

252
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,530
So if you need anything, you
can speak with him, okay?

253
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,616
No, it's not okay, Captain.

254
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,202
Detective Grossman
is away on vacation,

255
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,121
so Deteсtive Frazier is the
big dick today, all right?

256
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:33,833
Now, if you need anything, you
can speak to me, all right?

257
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:35,293
I guess it'll have to be.

258
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:37,629
That's the way it's gonna be.
You got vests for us?

259
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,005
- Berk!
- Yo!

260
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,007
- Get these guys some vests!
- Okay.

261
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:42,968
- And check them into the command log.
- Okay.

262
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,719
You know what? I'm gonna
get out of your hair

263
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,680
and let you get control of
this crime scene, okay?

264
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:49,015
You'll let me know when you're
ready with a detailed briefing?

265
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,018
- Okay.
- We're gonna take a walk down to the diner.

266
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,063
Don't go in the bank without
calling us first, all right? Okay?

267
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,732
- All right.
- Good to see you, Captain.

268
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:07,867
Shouldn't we be in there?

269
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:11,413
Let's give him some time.
See what he does. Come on.

270
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,000
Until he secures his position
and gets the physical layout,

271
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,334
he'll only dump on us.

272
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:18,795
If the show starts, he'll call us.
Trust me. I've seen him work.

273
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,005
Your call, Keith.

274
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,340
Can you get that for me?
I guess it is, isn't it?

275
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:24,259
That's the one thing I
learned from Grossman,

276
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,594
is these guys don't have
much respect for what we do.

277
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:29,079
- How do you mean?
- Well, to them it's a tactical situation.

278
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:33,268
Us being here means there's a mental
side to it that they don't get.

279
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,645
- Told you, you could handle this.
- Yeah.

280
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:39,107
I keep waiting for someone higher up
on the food chain to show up and say,

281
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,316
"Here's what we do."

282
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:41,735
What happened at the hospital?

283
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:44,612
Guy shot himself, shot his girlfriend.
Thank you.

284
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,291
I told you, I've got

285
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,046
a heart condition.

286
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:02,464
Get up.

287
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,966
Put down
your fucking weapons!

288
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:32,243
- Don't move! Don't move!
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

289
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,496
- Don't move! Don't move! Come here!
- I haven't got...

290
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:38,041
- Come here, come here, come here!
- I work in the bank!

291
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,959
On your knees! Down
on your knees now!

292
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:43,463
- They sent me out here!
- Now!

293
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,256
- He said stay away!
- Cuff him.

294
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:47,759
If you come near the bank, he'll
throw out two dead bodies!

295
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,803
- Who said this? Who?
- I don't know who!

296
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:51,304
The guy with the
big fucking gun!

297
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,098
- That's who!
- All right, get on your feet. Let's go.

298
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:54,641
- There's four of them in there!
- Come on.

299
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:55,892
Christ!

300
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,227
- Calm down!
- Let's go!

301
00:23:57,311 --> 00:24:00,522
- Am I gonna be on TV?
- Yeah. A big star. Let's go. Come on.

302
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:07,028
Was it a time when I thought I might
not see my family again? Yeah.

303
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:09,781
Yeah, I thought about it. I
mean, at first, I wasn't...

304
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:12,283
It was too much to think
about at that point.

305
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:15,370
You know, with a gun in your
face, but after a while I...

306
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,622
You know, I thought about...

307
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,792
Yeah.

308
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,711
My wife, you know, not
seeing my wife again.

309
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:28,216
My kids. I got a 10-year-old
son, 17-year-old daughter.

310
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,929
Yeah, I thought about it, man.
What do you think?

311
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:35,431
Those are my babies.

312
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:31,946
Beautiful.

313
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,131
Go ahead.

314
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:52,508
Miss White, I want
you to rest assured

315
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:55,386
my only intention is to spend
time in your wonderful city

316
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:57,263
and to enjoy all that
it has to offer.

317
00:25:57,348 --> 00:25:58,723
And no business with your uncle?

318
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,100
In truth, I have very little
to do with him these days.

319
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,686
I'm told you haven't seen him
in nine years. Is that right?

320
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:07,273
- You are extremely well informed.
- I have to be. Yes?

321
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:10,360
I have a Mr. Arthur Case
on the phone for you.

322
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,321
We'll need to end this here.

323
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,406
I'm gonna need a copy of
your purchase agreement,

324
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,652
your mortgage application,
and the other documentation,

325
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,869
- and I'll be in touch.
- Thank you, Miss White.

326
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:21,704
Right this way, sir.

327
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,592
Arthur Case? You sure?

328
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:36,719
<i>- That's what he said.</i>
- He said his name, just like that?

329
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:39,097
It wasn't his secretary
saying he was on the line?

330
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:41,140
<i>- No, ma'am.</i>
- All right. Put him through.

331
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:42,350
<i>Okay.</i>

332
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:48,606
- This is Madeleine White.
<i>- Miss White, I'm Arthur Case.</i>

333
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:50,149
Oh, good morning, Mr. Case.

334
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:54,153
- Have we met formally?
<i>- No, sir, I don't believe we have.</i>

335
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,448
Yet, you're always turning up

336
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:59,909
at my July 4th parties
in Southampton.

337
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,622
Yes, we know some
of the same people.

338
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:05,999
It seems.

339
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:08,334
I'll come right to the point.

340
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,713
I have a small problem
which requires someone

341
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:15,091
with very special skills
and complete discretion.

342
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:19,012
Are you such a person or
have I been misinformed?

343
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:20,888
Go on.

344
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,600
Can I pick you up in front of your
office building in five minutes?

345
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:26,978
- I'll be downstairs.
- Thank you.

346
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:35,987
They had a kind of genius plan

347
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,614
for throwing us out of whack

348
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:43,077
and depriving us of any kind of
way of controlling ourselves.

349
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:45,246
They were... They were very

350
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,835
insistent, and yet,
strangely detached.

351
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:54,797
All I know is that they called
each other a variation of Steve.

352
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:57,967
Steven, Steve-O, Stevie.

353
00:27:58,052 --> 00:27:59,260
And they called you what?

354
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:01,346
They didn't call me anything.
They just told me...

355
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:04,515
You're lying to me. Tell me the truth, now.
You're lying to me.

356
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,480
Tell me the... Look at me
and tell me the truth.

357
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,145
They had AK-47s out.
Four of them.

358
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:10,980
- You know a lot about guns.
- No.

359
00:28:11,065 --> 00:28:14,105
- I don't know anything about guns, except...
- But you know they had an AK-47.

360
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:17,153
- Everybody knows what an AK-47 is.
- Everybody?

361
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:21,157
Anybody who's ever watched a
decent aсtion movie would.

362
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,868
- You ever rob a bank before?
- Are you kidding?

363
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,621
Me rob a bank? No.

364
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,873
- Never stole a dollar?
- Never.

365
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,209
- Never?
- Not ever.

366
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:34,379
- You know what?
- That one time. That one time, that one time.

367
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:37,965
I stole a nickel from my
grandmother's pocketbook once.

368
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,135
She was Polish.

369
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:46,057
I used to go up to her and say,
<i>"Mama, toh nicklah, toh nicklah."</i>

370
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:52,188
One day, I opened her pocketbook
and there was a nickel.

371
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:53,648
I took it.

372
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:56,150
That was the only
thing I ever took.

373
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,782
Look, Detective, I didn't mean to
give you a hard time back there.

374
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:05,076
Forget about it. What's
the story, Captain?

375
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,913
Well, the hostage they let
go was Herman Gluck, 73.

376
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,374
He was having chest pains.
Paramedics have him.

377
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,961
They told him to say that if
any cops came near the door,

378
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:17,380
they'd throw out
two dead bodies.

379
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:21,342
He thinks there's four perps. Says
they came in dressed as painters.

380
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,762
There's a video
system in the bank.

381
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:26,764
We're working on
getting a download

382
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:30,226
from Manhattan Trust's central security
office, but it'll take a while.

383
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:33,646
We got the block locked up.
I got men in the windows.

384
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,441
We're checking on the sewers with D.
E. P.

385
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:37,859
What about the phones?

386
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:41,863
Cut and diverted into M.C.C. We're
the only ones they're gonna call.

387
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:46,617
Cell phones are monitored and we
can jam the air whenever you say.

388
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:49,954
But we like to leave it clear in case
a hostage is able to get through,

389
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,206
but so far nothing.

390
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:55,209
- 911?
- It's up on the screen.

391
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:58,337
Any call about a bank gets
routed straight to us.

392
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:02,216
Well, that's my end
of it, Detective.

393
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:04,469
Yeah.

394
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:07,472
Yeah, I'm not calling them yet.

395
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:09,140
Beg your pardon?

396
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:11,476
Doesn't feel right yet,
you know what I mean?

397
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,478
I'm not gonna call him and
ask what I can do for him.

398
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:15,313
Let's see what he does.

399
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:17,815
Your call.

400
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:28,493
Now, Mr. Case, why don't you let
me explain to you how I work?

401
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:30,578
Please. That would be nice.

402
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:35,625
Well, you say that there are family
heirlooms inside your safety deposit box.

403
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:37,084
That's fine.

404
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:40,838
But in my experience, people like
you have people working for them

405
00:30:40,923 --> 00:30:42,381
that handle these
kinds of things.

406
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:45,426
And when they can't, well,
they don't call me.

407
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:47,303
Their people call me.

408
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:50,556
So, immediately, I know that
there's something in that box

409
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:53,935
that you don't even want your
closest aides to know about.

410
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,395
No problem with me.

411
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,650
You tell me I don't need to know what's
in that box and I don't need to know.

412
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:03,611
But if you tell me that it's a
bunch of old baseball cards

413
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:07,657
and I find out that it's the launch
codes for a nuclear missile,

414
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,452
then let's just say we no
longer have an agreement.

415
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:13,496
- Have you finished?
- Yes.

416
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:15,831
What's inside that
box, young lady,

417
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:18,626
has belonged to me since
before you were born.

418
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:22,922
It's very valuable and poses no
danger whatsoever to anyone.

419
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:24,799
Except you.

420
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:29,428
Okay. Well, first, there are
men with guns in there,

421
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:31,347
so I can't guarantee any results.
Agreed?

422
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,140
- Of course.
- All right.

423
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:36,143
Now, what makes you think that
they want to rob your box?

424
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,478
I don't.

425
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:42,275
Well, why don't you tell me how
you would like this to end?

426
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:48,864
I'd prefer that nobody ever
touch my safe deposit box.

427
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,909
Not them, not you,
not the authorities.

428
00:31:51,994 --> 00:31:54,870
And the sooner this situation
ends, the happier I'll be.

429
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:57,665
- Is that specific enough for you?
- No.

430
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:02,211
The contents of that box

431
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:06,507
are of great value to me.

432
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:09,927
So long as they
remain my secret.

433
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:11,887
And if they're exposed?

434
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:22,857
I'll face some
difficult questions.

435
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:26,277
- So, it stays locked or it disappears.
- Precisely.

436
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,613
- Can you make that happen?
- Yes.

437
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:32,074
I hope so. I have to say, I
can't help but be skeptical.

438
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,077
Whoever gave you my
number got the same deal.

439
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:37,955
Clearly, they must
have been satisfied.

440
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,006
Steve?

441
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,216
It's time for Steve-O.

442
00:32:56,058 --> 00:32:59,060
I came out here to take a look
at the perimeter they laid down.

443
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:00,478
Guess what I found?

444
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:03,981
That hostage they let out said these guys
came in dressed like painters, right?

445
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:05,191
Yeah.

446
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,036
Probably stolen.

447
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,580
Have them run it and
check it for prints.

448
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:27,088
- Everybody on?
- Yep, I'm there.

449
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:41,227
- Sure you got the right number?
- Absolutely.

450
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,280
Okay. Nothing yet.

451
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,243
We got video.

452
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:58,744
Let's have it.

453
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,500
What happened to
that camera right there?

454
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,918
Wait. Hold on,
hold on, hold on.

455
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,382
Yeah, there it is.
That guy right there.

456
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:14,802
It's like he blinds the
camera with the flashlight.

457
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,388
It's weird, isn't it? It's
like nobody else sees it.

458
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,307
- You'd think it'd be pretty bright, huh?
- Lt could be infrared.

459
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:22,518
- What's that?
- Infrared bulb.

460
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:25,563
See, humans can't see it, but a
video camera will pick it up.

461
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:27,767
He could knock out the cameras
without no one knowing.

462
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:28,983
Right,
right, right, right.

463
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,908
He knocked out
the cameras about 10:00.

464
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:33,070
So, for approximately
two minutes,

465
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:36,866
we got no evidence of people leaving
or entering the bank. That's great.

466
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:39,952
Miriam, how long were
you there before it began?

467
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,579
It was just a few minutes.

468
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:44,790
Well, can you tell us what happened
after the explosions and the smoke?

469
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:49,211
They just told us to put our heads down.
And then close our eyes.

470
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:52,256
And then I just
remember one of them

471
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,092
telling the others to just
go down and fix the cameras.

472
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:57,052
<i>- The video cameras?</i>
<i>- I don't know.</i>

473
00:34:57,179 --> 00:34:59,180
Anything else you want
to share with us?

474
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,306
No, just...

475
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,183
- You sure?
- Yeah, I...

476
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,352
Could you give us the names
of the bank robbers, maybe?

477
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,438
I'm just messing with
you, sweetheart.

478
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:08,898
- You okay?
- Thank you.

479
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:10,065
Okay.

480
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:12,109
- It was pretty awful.
- Was it bad?

481
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:14,361
I mean, they made us strip.

482
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:17,448
They made us
take off our clothes.

483
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,869
I don't understand why
they had to do that.

484
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,454
I really just thought...

485
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,873
I thought I was gonna be killed.

486
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:27,750
Well.

487
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,879
- All right, my dear.
- Okay.

488
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,423
- I can go?
- No.

489
00:35:34,508 --> 00:35:36,175
- No?
- No, you got to stay.

490
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,760
- You got to stay.
- No, you can go.

491
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,012
No, stay. No, go.

492
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,639
Did you rob the bank?

493
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:43,044
- You did.
- Did you rob the bank?

494
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:44,517
- No.
- You sure?

495
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:47,311
- There's movement at the front door.
- Let's go.

496
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:53,814
- Put down the fucking weapon!
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

497
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,694
Don't move!
Don't move!

498
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:57,179
He's got a
device on him there.

499
00:35:57,197 --> 00:36:00,407
I said put your hands on your head
and get down on your fucking knees!

500
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:03,244
I said put your hands on your
head and down on your knees now!

501
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:04,745
- Hands are tied!
- Hands are tied.

502
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,997
- Jesus, pat him down.
- All right.

503
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:08,958
- I'm one of the hostages!
- Careful.

504
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:10,209
Easy, be very
careful, now. Easy.

505
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,877
I can't see
him from where I'm at.

506
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:14,802
- I can see him. I got a clear shot.
- Any weapons?

507
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,341
- Who are you?
- Vikram Walia. I work in the bank.

508
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,593
Okay. Vikram? Is this a bomb?

509
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:21,929
- Oh, shit! A fucking Arab!
- What? No. I'm a Sikh!

510
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,055
- Is that a bomb?
- No.

511
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,306
- Answer me, Vikram. Is this a bomb?
- No.

512
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:25,766
- Are you booby-trapped?
- No, fuck, no.

513
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:27,518
Okay, Vikram, I
need you to relax.

514
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,187
- Jesus, give me a hand.
- I don't know.

515
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:32,356
Just watch. There's a
lot of movement in that bank.

516
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,858
- Team, take him down.
- Mike, now, get him.

517
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:35,359
What the fuck? Easy, easy.

518
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:38,112
Get off my... That's my turban.
Get off. Easy.

519
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:41,699
Get... My turban! Look,
fuck, give my turban back!

520
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:43,158
Come on, shut up. Relax.

521
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:45,077
What the fuck are you doing?
Give me my turban back.

522
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,871
- You can't fucking rip my turban.
- Shut up, already.

523
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:48,080
- What the fuck?
- Come on, move it.

524
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:50,124
Get your fucking hands off me!

525
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,213
And the 11:00 and 12:00...

526
00:36:56,298 --> 00:36:59,425
And don't forget about your 1:00
with Chancellor Joel Klein.

527
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:01,886
- Oh, Madge. What a day...
- Your Honor.

528
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,679
Madeleine! How are you?

529
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:06,307
I'm just fine, but thank you for
seeing me on such short notice.

530
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:09,643
- Sure. Madge, are we through here?
- Yes, Mr. Mayor.

531
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,729
This way, Miss White.

532
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:16,650
I always have time to put on a tux
and eat free food for a good cause.

533
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:18,569
Who are we saving this week?

534
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,404
Well, I'm doing a
round of support

535
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:23,407
for the Joseph Freidkin Memorial
Fund for Spinal Cord Research

536
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,576
and we're having our annual
fundraiser next month.

537
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,660
If you could attend, it
would give us such a boost.

538
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:31,624
It would be my pleasure. Is there
anything else I can do to...

539
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,710
- What the fuck do you want?
- A favor.

540
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:38,631
- No shit. Which kind?
- The last one I'll ever ask of you.

541
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:41,342
That's the kind I had in mind.

542
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,969
You know about this
hostage situation.

543
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:46,263
On my way. What's
it to do with you?

544
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:48,474
All right, well, I need
to keep an eye on it.

545
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:51,602
So, I want you to bring me down
there and tell whoever's in charge

546
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,687
to extend me every courtesy.

547
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,859
You're out of your fucking mind.

548
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:02,196
If it was easy, it wouldn't
square us, would it?

549
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:05,616
- It's impossible.
- Nothing's impossible.

550
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,826
You just have to call in a
few markers, that's all.

551
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:10,120
I may have to give out a few.

552
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:13,248
Then that's exactly
what you'll do.

553
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:16,669
You're a magnificent cunt.

554
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,382
Thank you.

555
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,389
<i>It's been a very tense situation
for several hours now.</i>

556
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:30,808
<i>It's unclear how many
hostages are inside</i>

557
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:33,310
<i>and how many robbers
police are dealing with.</i>

558
00:38:33,395 --> 00:38:36,647
<i>Officials say this all started out
as a robbery at Manhattan Trust,</i>

559
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,650
<i>but has turned into
this hostage situation.</i>

560
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:42,486
<i>Negotiators are here on the
scene, working very hard</i>

561
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,239
<i>and it's still unclear on
any possible injuries.</i>

562
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,574
<i>Of course, we'll keep you up
to date with the very latest</i>

00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:50,619

scene as this all unfolds.</i>

564
00:38:50,704 --> 00:38:52,621
<i>That's the latest from
here in lower Manhattan.</i>

"Protect and serve" my ass.
Where's my turban?

567
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:00,963
I'm not talking to anybody
without a turban.

568
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:04,133
It's part of my religion, to cover my
head in respect to God. I'm a Sikh.

569
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:05,509
Okay,
we'll find your turban.

570
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,874
Not an Arab, by the way, like
your cops called me outside.

571
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:09,972
Now, no, I don't think
you heard that.

572
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:12,349
There was a lot going on. You
were probably disoriented.

573
00:39:12,434 --> 00:39:14,393
- I didn't hear that.
- I heard what I heard.

574
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,562
I'll give you all the
information you want.

575
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:19,523
I don't need this. I need my turban.
It's part of my religion.

576
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,692
- We'll get you your turban.
- We'll find it for you.

577
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:24,194
No, no, no. Not "get me."
I want my turban now.

578
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:26,989
You just got to start thinking about
the people inside the bank now.

579
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,154
It's a dangerous situation.

580
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,659
You got to start telling us about
what's going on inside the bank.

581
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:33,162
We can talk about this later. We'll
get an officer to come down.

582
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:34,705
You can write a
formal complaint.

583
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:37,124
But for now, we got to
deal with this situation.

584
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,251
First you beat me, and
now you want my help.

585
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:42,004
You need to start thinking
about your coworkers.

586
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:45,632
I could apologize on behalf of the NYPD,
but that was not us. We are deteсtives.

587
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:47,760
- We're gonna try and find out...
- What do you want to know?

588
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:50,471
- How many were there?
- I think there were about four.

589
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:54,308
- How many hostages?
- I don't know how many hostages, 20, 30.

590
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:59,730
I'm fucking tired of this shit. What
happened to my fucking civil rights?

591
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:02,649
Why can't I go anywhere
without being harassed?

592
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:05,015
I get thrown out of a bank. I'm a hostage.
I get harassed.

593
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:06,153
I go to the airport.

594
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:09,031
I can't go through security
without a "random" seleсtion.

595
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,956
Fucking random, my ass.
I nearly lost my job...

596
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:13,327
I bet you can get a cab, though.

597
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:16,330
I guess that's one of the perks.

598
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,916
Put the ice on your face.

599

00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:29,384
<i>"and pilots at JFK, parked
at the end of runway."</i>

601
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:31,095
<i>They give us until
9:00 pm to do this,</i>

602
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:33,639
<i>then they kill one hostage every
hour in front of TV cameras.</i>

603
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:37,184
"Bank is secured with Semtex. We
will demonstrate if necessary."

604
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:41,146
- Whatever you do, don't give them a jet.
- There's no plane. Maybe a bus. Maybe.

605
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:43,899
Till I talk to them, they get nothing.
Not even a cup of coffee.

606
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,109
For now, we wait.

607
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:47,611
Let's let them wonder
what we're doing, okay?

608
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,947
Excuse me, Detectives.
This is Arthur Case.

609
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:52,616
- He's the...
- I'm Chairman, Board of Directors.

610
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,786
- Of the bank. You wanna talk to him?
- Absolutely.

611
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,497
Mr. Case, how are you?
I'm Deteсtive Frazier.

612
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:00,958
Anything in particular you
think we should know?

613
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:05,087
No. I just wondered if I
might be of some assistance.

614
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:10,217
- Have they made any demands?
- They want a jet.

615
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,511
Oh, I see.

616
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:17,558
Would you like me to
arrange one for you?

617
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:26,441
I'm so sorry. I must
have misunderstood.

618
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:28,944
That's quite all right, Mr.
Case.

619
00:41:29,571 --> 00:41:31,363
Where can we reach you
if we need anything?

620
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,323
Well, those are my people
in there, you know,

621
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:36,285
and I would like to stay here for a while.
And I won't disturb you.

622
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:38,370
- I'll be very quiet right down...
- Sergeant Collins!

623
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:41,665
Mr. Case, we'll try and keep
you posted as best we can,

624
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,669
but you're gonna have to
excuse us for now, okay?

625
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,502
- Right this way, sir.
- Thank you very much.

626
00:41:45,587 --> 00:41:46,747
- Absolutely.
- This way, sir.

627
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:49,464
- Thank you very much.
- And thank you all so much.

628
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:51,008
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

629
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:52,593
This way, sir.

630
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:29,296
"Fifty hungry people
need food now."

631
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:41,892
All right. Are we ready
with the listening devices?

632
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:44,228
I'm gonna need 15 minutes
once we get the food.

633
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:46,230
Pizza's the best. No sandwiches.

634
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:48,273
- Is she for real?
- Are you for real?

635
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:51,652
Well, if we send in, say, 10
pizzas boxes with transmitters,

636
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:54,529
maybe we'll get some conversation if we
give them something to group around.

637
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:56,573
Give them each a sandwich,
it's hit or miss.

638
00:42:56,658 --> 00:42:59,284
They can move around and I
don't have 50 transmitters.

639
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:01,495
- What's this?
- It's a digital recorder.

640
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,664
You click it, and it'll
record for half an hour.

641
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:06,166
- James Bond shit.
- Well, you can get them on Amazon.

642
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:08,811
- You gonna ask for a hostage?
- He already gave us one, didn't he?

643
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,921
I ask for another one,
he says no, then what?

644
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,839
No, he knows what he's doing.

645
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:14,883
He gave us a hostage.
We'll give him some food.

646
00:43:14,968 --> 00:43:17,177
I don't want to get
caught bluffing this guy.

647
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:26,603
Fuck this shit. Look, they want to shoot me
for taking off my mask, they can go ahead.

648
00:43:26,688 --> 00:43:28,272
Do you wanna get us all killed?

649
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:30,482
You wanna relax? What the
hell is the difference?

650
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:33,402
They're out there
robbing the bank!

651
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:36,029
- Can't you see they fucked him up?
- Shut up.

652
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:38,154
You think they dressed us
like this for fun, <i>puñeta?</i>

653
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:39,560
- I have no idea.
- Please shut up.

654
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,785
...why they made us put
on all of this crap.

655
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,830
Probably so when the cops
break in and try to rescue us

656
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:47,124
- we all get fucking shot.
- Oh, my God!

657
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:49,251
It's a great plan,
but, no, thanks.

658
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,753
I told you to shut up!
Leave him!

659
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,675
No! Don't do this to me!
Please, don't.

660
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:05,058
I'll do as you say!
No! Help! Help!

661
00:44:19,866 --> 00:44:21,616
Please, don't! Don't!

662
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:31,209
One guy did most of the talking.

663
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:33,628
He told everyone
else what to do.

664
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:36,423
- So they were talking amongst themselves?
- We couldn't hear them.

665
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:39,092
They had us in these rooms.

666
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:41,845
The doors were
locked all the time.

667
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,930
We didn't know what
they were doing.

668
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:46,736
- Did you hear anything they said?
- I have problems with my hearing.

669
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:48,602
- I see.
- I wear hearing aids.

670
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,395
- Where are they?
- They're in my ears.

671
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,680
- Let's see.
- Let me see them.

672
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:54,316
- Yeah, let's take a look at them.
- Yeah, it's a hearing aid.

673
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,692
That's your other one, there?

674
00:44:55,777 --> 00:44:57,694
What's the red part, there?
What does that do?

675
00:44:57,779 --> 00:45:00,280
They're different colors.
You need two different...

676
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:02,324
And to distinguish
right from left, also.

677
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:03,888
- Distinguish right from left?
- Yeah.

678
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,410
Right from wrong.

679
00:45:05,495 --> 00:45:06,953
I don't understand.

680
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:09,414
- Steve?
- I'm sorry?

681
00:45:09,499 --> 00:45:10,874
- I didn't say anything.
- Oh.

682
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,834
Steve. Is that your name? Steve?

683
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:14,503
Stevie? Steve-O?

684
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:17,214
- How much are they gonna pay you?
- I'm sorry?

685
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:19,883
- You heard me.
- No, I didn't.

686
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:23,762
- How much are they going to pay you?
- Who's gonna pay me?

687
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:26,890
- Were you involved in this robbery?
- Absolutely not.

688
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:29,226
Were you involved
in this situation?

689
00:45:30,395 --> 00:45:32,646
- What situation?
- Don't lie. Don't lie.

690
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:53,834
If he gives us a
tip, I'm keeping it.

691
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:55,853
- Put that gun down!
- Check that weapon!

692
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:57,921
All right, everybody, relax.
Calm down. Calm down.

693
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,756
Calm the fuck down!

694
00:46:02,385 --> 00:46:03,885
How you doing?

695
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:08,682
I'm Detective Keith Frazier,
Hostage Negotiation Team.

696
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:10,851
How's it going?

697
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:15,147
Okay. I hope the pizzas are okay.
They might be a little cold.

698
00:46:15,523 --> 00:46:17,941
Listen, you pick up the
phone anytime you want.

699
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,443
It's a direсt line to me.

700
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:21,445
I would love to talk to you.

701
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,369
Nice talking to you.

702
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:00,692
Shit. Fucking Russians.

703
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:04,029
Call Operations. See if they can get
a Russian translator over here ASAP.

704
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:05,864
And get some fucking body bags.

705
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:07,741
I hope you know
what you're doing.

706
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,660
Because if my guys got to shoot it
out with those fucking savages...

707
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:12,329
Okay, okay, okay. Mitch?

708
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:14,581
Check with either one
of the hostages.

709
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:18,460
Find out if they heard any Russian or
Russian accents when they were in there.

710
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:20,337
We'll be all right.

711
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:39,731
No!

712
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:44,110
Down on the floor!

713
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:53,995
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.
Let's go.

714
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:57,624
Stop crying! Shut the fuck up!

715
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:04,965
Get in there! Sit down!
Put your masks on!

716
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:08,051
Come on, let's go.
Come on, boobs.

717
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:11,638
- "Boobs"? Who the fuck you talking to?
- Let's go. You heard me! Shut the fuck up!

718
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,140
- Why?
- Move that fat ass! Let's go! Come on!

719
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:15,517
"Fat ass"? Are you kidding me?

720
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:18,478
If you don't shut the fuck up, I'm
gonna put my foot up your fat ass!

721
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:24,901
Put your masks on!

722
00:48:24,986 --> 00:48:26,903
Put your hands on the ground!

723
00:48:26,988 --> 00:48:28,488
Okay, okay.

724
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:31,324
On the floor.
Hands are on the floor.

725
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:37,831
Masks on!

726
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,250
Put your hands on the ground!

727
00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:43,128
Come on, boobs, let's go.

728
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:45,547
Oh, shit. Sit down! Sit down!

729
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:57,017
She was on
line in front of me.

730
00:48:57,518 --> 00:48:59,811
He was the teller on my line.

731
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:03,732
This guy was to my right and
his kid was in front of him.

732
00:49:03,816 --> 00:49:05,775
He was playing
with a video game.

733
00:49:06,027 --> 00:49:07,444
I remember her.

734
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:09,904
- Why do you remember her?
- Great tits.

735
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:15,827
- You remember seeing any of them after?
- Yeah, I saw her one time afterwards.

736
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:19,414
- How are you sure you saw her again?
- I could see under the suit.

737
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:21,583
Can't hide quality like that.

738
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:24,169
This guy, he almost
got us all killed.

739
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:25,337
How?

740
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:27,881
They put eight or nine of us
in an office for a while.

741
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:32,010
This guy took off his mask and was
talking like he wasn't afraid.

742
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:34,554
"I don't have to wear this
damn mask," you know?

743
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:38,391
So, they come in, pull him out of the
room and smack him around a little.

744
00:49:39,852 --> 00:49:41,770
- You see him again after that?
- No.

745
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:44,856
- Was he okay?
- Seemed fine.

746
00:49:48,069 --> 00:49:51,863
- You recognize anyone else from that room?
- I can't be sure about the others.

747
00:49:52,365 --> 00:49:53,573
No one?

748
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:57,035
- Why don't you keep looking?
- You know, I was terrified.

749
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,453
What about before it began?

750
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:00,872
You didn't look around while
you were waiting in line?

751
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:03,416
I was talking to my
girlfriend on the phone.

752
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:09,255
You wanna take another picture?

753
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:11,716
I could bend over and
pick up a pencil.

754
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:13,802
Whatever.

755
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:15,804
This guy.

756
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:17,972
Asshole.

757
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:41,830
What the fuck? This
ain't Russian.

758
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:44,958
No? What the hell is it?

759
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:47,836
It's not Polish. Not Hungarian.

760
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:50,338
Bulgarian, maybe.

761
00:50:51,132 --> 00:50:53,341
It's Central European. Sort of.

762
00:50:53,426 --> 00:50:55,844
That's it? I mean, you're
the language expert.

763
00:50:55,928 --> 00:50:57,345
What? No.

764
00:50:58,222 --> 00:51:00,140
- What do you think?
- Well, okay.

765
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:02,058
Well, this is New York City.

766
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:03,977
Somebody on the street
must know what it is.

767
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:05,395
Probably the hot-dog man.

768
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:08,189
Berk, play that over the speaker for me.
Excuse me.

769
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:13,278
Excuse me!

770
00:51:13,571 --> 00:51:17,240
Does anybody know what language
they're speaking? Anybody?

771
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:18,616
Yo, my man.

772
00:51:18,701 --> 00:51:20,994
Hey, Phil, let that guy through.
Come on.

773
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:28,831
- You know what language they're speaking?
- Yeah, they're speaking Albanian.

774
00:51:28,878 --> 00:51:31,171
- Albanian?
- Albanian. From Albania.

775
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:36,426
What am I doing here?

776
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,597
Yo, am I getting
arrested for something?

777
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:42,849
No, you're not getting arrested.
Come on. Come on.

778
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:45,477
Whoa.

779
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:49,564
- Okay. What are they saying?
- I have no idea what they're saying.

780
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,483
You got no idea? I thought
you said you spoke Albanian.

781
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:52,734
No. I never said I
speak Albanian.

782
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:53,939
You said you spoke Albanian.

783
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,144
I never said I speak Albanian.

784
00:51:55,196 --> 00:51:56,636
Well, how do you
know it's Albanian?

785
00:51:56,697 --> 00:51:58,656
My ex-wife and her
parents are Albanian.

786
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:01,201
Her parents couldn't
speak English for shit.

787
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:02,685
I have no idea what
they're saying,

788
00:52:02,745 --> 00:52:05,413
but I'll tell you right now that
the language is 100% Albanian.

789
00:52:05,498 --> 00:52:06,998
- 100%?
- 100%.

790
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:09,918
Call the Albanian Consulate. See
if they can get somebody over here

791
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:11,843
to translate this for us.
Make it happen fast.

792
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:13,599
Okay, you hang out in
the back for me, okay?

793
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:14,756
Oh, man, not again.

794
00:52:15,925 --> 00:52:19,427
Van was stolen two days ago,
but it's clean. No prints.

795
00:52:19,512 --> 00:52:21,012
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

796
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:23,139
Albanian?

797
00:52:23,224 --> 00:52:26,392
My man, like I told
you, 100% Albanian.

798
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:30,063
Undeniable.

799
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:45,245
- Hey.
- Thanks.

800
00:53:10,855 --> 00:53:13,314
<i>Yo, yo, yo. There
go that motherfucker right there.</i>

801
00:53:13,399 --> 00:53:15,775
<i>Hey, yo, you thought you was gonna
get away with that shit, didn't you?</i>

802
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,360
How does this game work?

803
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:21,614
You get points for doing dirt, like
jacking a car or selling crack.

804
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:25,368
And you lose points if someone
jacks your ride or shoots you.

805
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:27,287
<i>Come on, baby.</i>

806
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:29,956
<i>Take that! Take this!
What? What? What?</i>

807
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,041
<i>Talk shit now! I don't hear you!</i>

808
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:34,961
<i>Eat this! Eat that! Eat this!
Eat that!</i>

809
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:37,380
<i>You're gone, baby! You're dead!
Bye-bye!</i>

810
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:38,631
Jesus!

811
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:40,967
What's the point of this?

812
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:44,512
Like my man 50 says, "Get
rich or die tryin'."

813
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:48,182
Yo, you'd get mad points for
knocking over the bank.

814
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:52,270
- You think that's cool?
- Hell, yeah. You trying to get paid, too.

815
00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:58,902
Finish your slice. I'll take
you back to your father.

816
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:02,780
I got to talk to him
about this game.

817
00:54:11,123 --> 00:54:13,333
- Is it good?
- No doubt.

818
00:54:16,921 --> 00:54:18,379
It's gonna be okay.

819
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:20,506
Cool.

820
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:22,675
You'll be home soon.

821
00:54:23,344 --> 00:54:24,761
That's whassup.

822
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:31,309
- Sir?
- Yeah.

823
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:33,394
- No luck with the Albanian Consulate.
- What do you mean?

824
00:54:33,479 --> 00:54:35,980
I couldn't tell what the guy was talking
about. I think he wanted money.

825
00:54:36,065 --> 00:54:38,145
And I tried the State Department.
That takes a month.

826
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:39,317
Okay.

827
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,569
- Call her.
- Are you crazy?

828
00:54:41,654 --> 00:54:43,988
- I hate that bitch. Come on.
- You said she speaks Albanian, right?

829
00:54:44,073 --> 00:54:45,990
- Yeah, she was born there.
- Call her.

830
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:47,867
I'm gonna regret this.

831
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,702
- Who's Deteсtive Frazier?
- Right here.

832
00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:33,371
- I have llina Maria over here.
- Miritia.

833
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:34,914
- Oh, how you doing?
- Hello.

834
00:55:34,999 --> 00:55:36,249
How you doing?

835
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:39,877
- What's this?
- Parking tickets. You can fix them?

836
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,090
Yeah, I'll see what I can do.

837
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:46,926
Can you listen to this and
tell us what they're saying?

838
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:48,803
You can't smoke in here.

839
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:53,266
Shit. Go ahead.

840
00:56:03,819 --> 00:56:06,362
What's so funny? What, you know
what they're talking about?

841
00:56:06,447 --> 00:56:09,532
I know what they're talking about.
I even know who it is.

842
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:11,701
You know who it is? You
mean you know their names?

843
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:13,536
- Who? I mean, who is it?
- Parking tickets?

844
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,205
- They're taken care of. Who is it?
- It's Enver Hoxha.

845
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:18,958
- Who?
- He was the president of Albania.

846
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:20,543
Wait.

847
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:23,504
You're telling me the former president
of Albania is in there robbing a bank?

848
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:24,839
Enver Hoxha's dead.

849
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:28,092
That's a tape of him discussing how
Albanian people are great people.

850
00:56:28,177 --> 00:56:30,678
They are immortal people.
I wouldn't worry.

851
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:34,599
It's a tape. You're
sure about that?

852
00:56:34,683 --> 00:56:36,851
I had to listen to all
this nonsense in school.

853
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:41,230
"Communism is great. Capitalism is evil.
Lenin, Marx, blah, blah, blah."

854
00:56:41,315 --> 00:56:43,232
It's Enver Hoxha. It's a tape.

855
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:47,070
Okay. Okay, well, Officer,
you can take her home.

856
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:50,073
And do me a favor, huh? Watch
where you park next time, okay?

857
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:59,207
So, they're playing
tapes for us now.

858
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:00,750
They knew we were
gonna bug them.

859
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:03,503
Yeah, you're damn right they knew we
were gonna bug them. And they knew how.

860
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:05,627
What makes it even worse,
they wanted us to bug them

861
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:07,131
so they could send us
on a wild goose chase.

862
00:57:07,216 --> 00:57:10,093
Last time I had my johnson
pulled that good, it cost me $5.

863
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:11,177
$5?

864
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:14,055
Yeah, Tijuana. Don't ask.

865
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:18,142
Look at the... Oh, fuck that.

866
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:14,800
- Detective Frazier. Nice to meet you.
- My pleasure.

867
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:16,135
This is Madeleine White.

868
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:18,679
- How do you do, Miss White?
- It's an honor, Detective.

869
00:59:18,764 --> 00:59:21,349
Miss White may be
able to assist you.

870
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:24,518
Good. Good. What do
you have in mind?

871
00:59:24,603 --> 00:59:28,231
She has a certain amount of
influence in these matters

872
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:30,983
for reasons which I
can't share with you.

873
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:34,737
What are you trying to say, sir?

874
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:37,990
What the Mayor means is that
there are matters at stake here

875
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:40,910
that are a little bit above
your pay grade. No offense.

876
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:43,037
And he's offering to help you.

877
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:47,917
Well, why don't you just tell the Mayor
to raise my pay grade to the proper level

878
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:49,418
and problem solved.

879
00:59:49,503 --> 00:59:51,879
From what I hear, that would
have happened a long time ago

880
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:55,258
if you'd been a little bit more diplomatic.
But we can certainly discuss it.

881
00:59:55,342 --> 00:59:58,386
Look, I'm kidding. I mean, I make
First Grade when I make First Grade.

882
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:01,264
You want to speed that up, I'm
not gonna talk you out of it.

883
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:04,767
Then there's also the matter of
$140,000 that seems to have walked away

884
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:06,686
from the Madrugada
check-cashing bust.

885
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:07,979
Oh, I see.

886
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:11,190
Well, I had nothing
to do with that.

887
01:00:12,693 --> 01:00:14,986
Yeah, Collins, we got
snipers in the windows here.

888
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:17,738
We got guys in the building next door.
Guys up on the roof.

889
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:19,949
We're trying to get the
blueprints for the bank

890
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:22,827
so we can figure out the ventilator shaft.
Maybe we can come down.

891
01:00:27,124 --> 01:00:29,500
<i>- Well?</i>
- Is this the President of Albania?

892
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:31,711
- Speaking.
- Pretty funny.

893
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:34,964
- You shouldn't eavesdrop on people.
- Well, you better get used to it, pal.

894
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:37,128
There's not gonna be much
privacy where you're going.

895
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:38,301
<i>You're damn right.</i>

896
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:41,470
This time next week, I'll be
sucking down piña coladas

897
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:44,432
in a hot tub with six girls
named Amber and Tiffany.

898
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:47,810
More like taking a shower with
two guys named Jamal and Jesus,

899
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:50,479
if you know what I mean.
And here's the bad news,

900
01:00:50,564 --> 01:00:53,691
that thing you're sucking
on, it's not a piña colada.

901
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:59,655
<i>- Maybe you like that kind of thing, huh?</i>
- You really want to piss me off.

902
01:01:00,115 --> 01:01:01,449
All right, here's
where we stand.

903
01:01:01,533 --> 01:01:04,285
I don't need your fucking
status report, Serpico.

904
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:05,953
I tell you where things stand.

905
01:01:06,038 --> 01:01:08,372
- Sure, sure. I just meant...
<i>- Here's where things stand.</i>

906
01:01:08,457 --> 01:01:10,291
You're getting me
what I asked you for.

907
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:12,251
You'll have it ready
in the time I gave you

908
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:15,629
or you'll sit by and you'll watch me
do just what I said I would do. Clear?

909
01:01:15,714 --> 01:01:17,594
Very clear. I'm trying to
get you what you want.

910
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:19,050
But you got to understand this.

911
01:01:19,551 --> 01:01:23,387
You know, it's not like the City of New York
has 747s waiting around for days like today.

912
01:01:23,472 --> 01:01:25,848
I understand that if you
don't get my plane ready,

913
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:28,059
- then you might as well send a hearse.
<i>- Please.</i>

914
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:30,811
<i>Let's focus on how we can both
get what we want, all right?</i>

915
01:01:30,896 --> 01:01:33,314
Hey! You're not listening.

916
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:38,778
You get me what I want,
I won't kill anyone.

917
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:41,280
All right. I'm on it. I'm on it.

918
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:44,408
Let's just try to keep
everybody calm, okay?

919
01:01:44,493 --> 01:01:47,286
- Don't I sound calm to you?
- Yeah, you do.

920
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:51,582
<i>Yeah, you do.</i>

921
01:02:45,637 --> 01:02:48,431
- So, Mr. Damerjian...
- Damerjian.

922
01:02:48,515 --> 01:02:50,635
- Damerjian. Is that Albanian?
- Just call me Kenneth.

923
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:52,935
- Kenneth?
- Is that Albanian or...

924
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:54,520
It's Armenian.

925
01:02:55,272 --> 01:02:56,689
What's the difference?

926
01:02:57,482 --> 01:02:59,483
Detective, I was born in Queens.

927
01:03:00,444 --> 01:03:03,654
I've never been to Armenia, Albania.
I went surfing in Australia once.

928
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:05,322
Can I have a glass of water?

929
01:03:05,407 --> 01:03:07,783
- Are you thirsty?
- My throat's parched.

930
01:03:07,868 --> 01:03:09,469
- I'm not nervous.
- Your throat's parched?

931
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:11,296
- My throat's parched.
- His throat is parched.

932
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:13,080
- I just want a glass of water.
- Oh, shit!

933
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:16,333
When you start telling us
what really happened...

934
01:03:16,418 --> 01:03:18,294
- I just want a glass of water.
- His throat is parched.

935
01:03:18,378 --> 01:03:20,004
- Here. You want some coffee?
- No, that's all right.

936
01:03:20,088 --> 01:03:21,338
- I don't drink that stuff.
- No, go ahead.

937
01:03:21,423 --> 01:03:22,590
Did you know they were
robbing the bank?

938
01:03:22,674 --> 01:03:25,134
I didn't know they were robbing the bank
until they pulled a gun in my face.

939
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:26,427
Is that why you held the
door open for them?

940
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:27,636
How do you know they
robbed the bank?

941
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:29,013
Because they pulled
a gun in my face...

942
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:30,431
That doesn't mean they
were robbing the bank.

943
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:32,141
Did they take money? Did
you see them take money?

944
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:35,853
I was in a bank and I was locked
up for who knows how long.

945
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:38,647
- Okay.
- Tied up in a room. I saw you see me.

946
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:40,107
You saw me see you?

947
01:03:40,192 --> 01:03:41,553
- Is that what you just said?
- Yeah.

948
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:43,986
I was locked up in the room. You
saw me gagged when you came in.

949
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,697
Listen, I can't work miracles over here.
I'm gonna need more time.

950
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:49,575
Well, perhaps if you'd use the time
that I gave you more efficiently,

951
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:51,160
you wouldn't be
having this problem.

952
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:53,871
<i>- What do you want me to say?</i>
- That my plane is ready.

953
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:56,123
<i>Okay, listen.</i>

954
01:03:57,375 --> 01:04:01,003
I promise you, as God is my witness,
I'm working on it as hard as I can.

955
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:02,838
It's just gonna take
a few more hours.

956
01:04:02,923 --> 01:04:04,423
Why should I give
you any more time?

957
01:04:04,508 --> 01:04:06,842
<i>Well, it's simple. You give me
more time, you get what you want.</i>

958
01:04:06,927 --> 01:04:09,011
<i>You don't give me the time,
you don't get what you want.</i>

959
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:10,930
You got nothing to lose.

960
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:15,559
Meanwhile, we'll send
in some more food.

961
01:04:15,644 --> 01:04:18,437
I got a question for you. You get
it right, I give you more time.

962
01:04:18,522 --> 01:04:21,065
<i>- And?</i>
- You know what happens if you don't.

963
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:24,652
Which weighs more?

964
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:29,114
All the trains that pass through
Grand Central Station in a year,

965
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:33,786
or the trees cut down to print
all US currency in circulation?

966
01:04:34,371 --> 01:04:36,872
Here's a hint. It's
a trick question.

967
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:42,086
What the hell is that?
Playing games now?

968
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:43,337
It's the trains.

969
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:46,423
US money isn't printed on paper at all.
It's cotton.

970
01:04:46,508 --> 01:04:48,188
- Yeah, I heard that.
- Yeah, that's right.

971
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:49,618
- Okay.
- So no trees were cut down.

972
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:52,096
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. 100%.

973
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:53,347
Okay.

974
01:04:58,478 --> 01:04:59,728
I got it.

975
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:02,356
- Wait a second. Wait a second.
- I'll call you back.

976
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:08,988
It's a trap. They
both weigh the same.

977
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:11,532
Tell him they both weigh the same.
They both weigh nothing.

978
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:13,656
They both weigh nothing or
they both weigh the same?

979
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:14,743
Tell him they both
weigh the same.

980
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:16,412
Tell him they both weigh the same.
Do it now.

981
01:05:16,496 --> 01:05:17,955
They both weigh the same.
Got it.

982
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:25,087
- Well?
- They both weigh the same.

983
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:27,131
This time, send sandwiches.

984
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:31,010
That's pretty good.
This guy's nuts.

985
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:33,429
He said, "Grand
Central Station."

986
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:36,348
Grand Central Terminal
is the train station.

987
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:39,101
- Grand Central Station is the post office.
- Is the post office.

988
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:40,506
- He's wrong.
- Who's wrong?

989
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:43,772
Perp One. Trains don't pass
through Grand Central.

990
01:05:44,524 --> 01:05:45,924
It's the last stop
for every train.

991
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:48,777
- What about the subway? They run through.
- Metro-North goes there.

992
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:50,862
- How the fuck do you know?
- Metro-North goes there!

993
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:52,323
No. Metro-North starts there.

994
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:54,491
What are you guys talking about?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

995
01:05:54,576 --> 01:05:57,369
- Metro-North goes through!
- Let's just get the sandwiches.

996
01:05:58,246 --> 01:06:01,790
- Metro-North...
- Deal is, he said, "Passes through."

997
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:04,001
Yeah, but the Metro-North
goes up there, though.

998
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:06,462
Look, shut up. It
doesn't matter, anyway.

999
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:07,921
<i>I know what he meant.</i>

1000
01:06:08,006 --> 01:06:09,632
<i>What he said is one thing, but
what he meant is another.</i>

1001
01:06:09,716 --> 01:06:10,924
<i>Yeah. That's always
a problem, isn't it?</i>

1002
01:06:11,009 --> 01:06:12,092
<i>Sandwiches.</i>

1003
01:06:12,177 --> 01:06:13,636
<i>I'm on it, I'm on it.</i>

1004
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:19,141
You know, right now I could go
for a nice kosher hot dog and a beer.

1005
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:21,386
I had Met tickets tonight.
And Pedro's pitching!

1006
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:23,145
They're gonna get
their asses kicked anyway.

1007
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:25,939
- Tell me about it. I'm better off here.
- I'm glad they didn't separate us.

1008
01:06:26,024 --> 01:06:28,745
- Do you think they're terrorists?
- They're robbers, not terrorists.

1009
01:06:28,777 --> 01:06:30,444
How do you know? They
could be Al-Qaeda.

1010
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:32,363
Trust me. I've studied
these things.

1011
01:06:32,447 --> 01:06:34,207
- What are you, Mossad?
- No. I was a lawyer.

1012
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:37,409
Now I teach courses at Columbia
Law on genocide, slave labor,

1013
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:39,286
- war reparation claims.
<i>- Mira.</i>

1014
01:06:39,371 --> 01:06:42,748
- Can I sue anybody when this is over?
- Oh, sure. Go nuts.

1015
01:06:43,083 --> 01:06:44,416
Go meshuga.

1016
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,463
Now that's a good
looking shithole.

1017
01:06:59,683 --> 01:07:01,363
- Hello?
- Hey, baby, how you doing?

1018
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:03,477
<i>Baby, I'm worried about you.
You coming home?</i>

1019
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:05,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Soon.

1020
01:07:05,105 --> 01:07:07,648
It's gonna be a long night,
though, so don't wait up for me.

1021
01:07:07,732 --> 01:07:09,212
Why don't you let
me come down there?

1022
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:11,902
Because I don't want to be
distracted by you, that's why.

1023
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:15,239
<i>Well, if you're still there when I come
on duty in the morning, you will see me.</i>

1024
01:07:15,323 --> 01:07:18,450
- I cannot wait. I cannot wait.
<i>- So, how you doing?</i>

1025
01:07:18,785 --> 01:07:21,453
It's all right. We got a couple of
the hostages out. Thanks a lot.

1026
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:24,998
- No, no. How you doing?
- I'm doing okay. I'm doing all right.

1027
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:28,794
<i>Oh, I saw the Mayor on TV. He said you're
doing a great job. I saw you, too.</i>

1028
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:30,504
- You saw me on TV?
- Yeah.

1029
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:33,048
- How'd I look?
<i>- You looked good, baby. Real good.</i>

1030
01:07:33,133 --> 01:07:35,801
- All right, listen. I got to go.
- All right. Hey.

1031
01:07:36,261 --> 01:07:38,804
- Keep your head down.
- All right, I will. Love you.

1032
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:41,682
Come on.

1033
01:07:44,644 --> 01:07:47,146
So, are we clear about
the ground rules?

1034
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:50,607
- There's no need to worry, Detective.
- I get paid to worry, okay?

1035
01:07:50,692 --> 01:07:52,317
I just need you to
look me in the eye

1036
01:07:52,402 --> 01:07:56,071
and make me believe that you
understand everything we talked about.

1037
01:07:56,156 --> 01:07:57,823
- I understand.
- Okay.

1038
01:08:02,954 --> 01:08:04,872
Someone here wants
to talk to you.

1039
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:08,876
- Hello?
- Who is this?

1040
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:11,003
<i>Let's not get into any names.</i>

1041
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:13,505
- What matters is what I can offer you.
<i>- And what's that?</i>

1042
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:16,091
Well, if I can be assured that
certain interests are protected,

1043
01:08:16,176 --> 01:08:18,343
I might be able to help you
get what you came for.

1044
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:19,720
I doubt that.

1045
01:08:20,847 --> 01:08:23,807
Tell me about these interests
that you are trying to protect.

1046
01:08:23,892 --> 01:08:25,559
Why don't you let me
worry about that?

1047
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:29,188
Now, what is it you were
hoping to get out of all this?

1048
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:31,273
- Rich, of course.
- Of course.

1049
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:33,776
But you may have bitten off
more than you can chew.

1050
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:36,737
<i>- How?</i>
- I can't discuss that on the phone.

1051
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:39,072
- You work for the bank?
- No.

1052
01:08:39,699 --> 01:08:41,366
<i>And you're not a cop.</i>

1053
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:43,202
That's right.

1054
01:08:44,871 --> 01:08:46,246
Come on in.

1055
01:08:53,463 --> 01:08:55,005
You got 10 minutes. No more.

1056
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:56,840
If you're not out before
the lights come back on,

1057
01:08:56,925 --> 01:08:58,509
you can stay inside until
this thing is over.

1058
01:08:58,593 --> 01:09:01,053
- You don't need to threaten me.
- That's not a threat, lady, but this is.

1059
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:04,264
I know this game is a mile over my head, but
I'm telling you, if you fuck me over...

1060
01:09:04,349 --> 01:09:06,475
I got where I am by collecting
friends, not enemies.

1061
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:08,101
Trust me, okay?

1062
01:09:08,937 --> 01:09:10,354
You're on your own.

1063
01:09:36,256 --> 01:09:38,090
What makes you
think I need help?

1064
01:09:39,551 --> 01:09:41,927
Well, the hundred
people outside, for starters.

1065
01:09:42,095 --> 01:09:43,345
It's not a problem.

1066
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:45,931
And they're fueling your
jet right now as we speak.

1067
01:09:47,392 --> 01:09:49,268
Come on. You're not that stupid.

1068
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:52,104
Here's what I'm thinking.

1069
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:54,857
If you give up now, I can ensure
that you'll serve the minimum.

1070
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:57,150
I'm thinking three years,
four years at the most.

1071
01:09:57,235 --> 01:09:58,318
You can arrange that?

1072
01:09:58,403 --> 01:10:00,445
Well, you haven't hurt
anyone or stolen anything,

1073
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,739
so yes, as a matter
of fact, I can.

1074
01:10:03,366 --> 01:10:05,784
- It's not good enough.
- Well, I wasn't finished.

1075
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:09,329
When you get out,
you'll have $2 million.

1076
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:11,874
Will I? How?

1077
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:15,168
We'll put it someplace safe and it'll
be waiting for you when you get out.

1078
01:10:15,253 --> 01:10:16,461
Thanks.

1079
01:10:17,255 --> 01:10:18,797
But no, thanks.

1080
01:10:18,882 --> 01:10:22,092
Oh, come on. I made you
such a sweet offer.

1081
01:10:22,176 --> 01:10:24,616
I really don't think you have
much in the way of alternatives.

1082
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:28,640
Why don't you talk to me about these
interests that you're in here to protect?

1083
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:30,392
- I'm afraid I can't.
- I can.

1084
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:32,102
Let me tell you a story.

1085
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:38,859
During World War ll, there was an American
working for a bank in Switzerland.

1086
01:10:40,278 --> 01:10:42,779
<i>Now, I don't need to tell you
that this period in history</i>

1087
01:10:42,864 --> 01:10:45,741
<i>was rife with opportunity
for people of low morals.</i>

1088
01:10:45,825 --> 01:10:47,284
<i>People like this man.</i>

1089
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:52,623
<i>He used his position with the Nazis to
enrich himself while all around him</i>

1090
01:10:52,707 --> 01:10:55,292
<i>people were being stripped
of everything they owned.</i>

1091
01:10:56,794 --> 01:11:00,797
Then he used his blood
money to start a bank.

1092
01:11:00,882 --> 01:11:01,924
Now,

1093
01:11:03,635 --> 01:11:06,470
does this sound like it might
be the man you work for?

1094
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:09,890
Or am I just whistling
Dixie out of my ass?

1095
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:12,851
- I believe we understand each other.
- Good.

1096
01:11:14,729 --> 01:11:16,605
So, what the hell
can you do for me

1097
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:20,400
since I clearly know more than you do,
and I've planned this to perfection?

1098
01:11:20,485 --> 01:11:24,696
Believe me, if I need to, I can
change your entire program.

1099
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:26,865
So, the sooner that you
stop being my problem

1100
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:30,452
and you start becoming my solution,
the better off you'll be.

1101
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:33,038
- What is it you want?
- Two minutes.

1102
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:35,916
The safety deposit box room. I
just need to go to one box.

1103
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:39,836
Looking for this?

1104
01:11:41,214 --> 01:11:43,840
This could be very
embarrassing to your employer.

1105
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:46,802
He should have destroyed
this a long time ago.

1106
01:11:46,886 --> 01:11:48,887
He didn't, so now it's mine.

1107
01:11:51,265 --> 01:11:54,226
Now, if the day ever comes where
I have to stand before a judge

1108
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:56,186
and account for what I did here,

1109
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:58,647
you and your boss will do
whatever it takes to help me.

1110
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:02,567
You get out of here
with that envelope,

1111
01:12:03,403 --> 01:12:05,445
and we'll pay you
a lot of money.

1112
01:12:05,905 --> 01:12:07,155
I'll keep that in mind.

1113
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:10,158
You're not gonna tell me how you're
planning to get out of here, are you?

1114
01:12:10,243 --> 01:12:13,078
I'm gonna walk right out the front door.
Anything else?

1115
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:16,164
- How did you know about all this?
- Doesn't matter.

1116
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:19,710
Fact is, all lies, all
evil deeds, they stink.

1117
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:23,380
You can cover them up for a
while, but they don't go away.

1118
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:25,882
- Murder will out?
- Precisely.

1119
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:29,094
Well, I still don't get
what you're doing here.

1120
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:30,262
Really?

1121
01:12:31,806 --> 01:12:32,848
Good.

1122
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:38,478
So, we spoke.

1123
01:12:38,563 --> 01:12:40,272
Oh, no. You're gonna have
to give me more than that.

1124
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:42,024
- Let me have this window, fellows.
- Yes, sir.

1125
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:44,901
I told him that, well, since
he hadn't killed anyone,

1126
01:12:44,986 --> 01:12:47,946
it wasn't too late to surrender and
get off with a lighter sentence.

1127
01:12:48,031 --> 01:12:49,114
And?

1128
01:12:49,824 --> 01:12:51,658
And that was basically it.

1129
01:12:53,077 --> 01:12:55,120
You know, I don't
ordinarily get offended

1130
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:58,415
the first time somebody treats me like
an idiot, but you are pushing it.

1131
01:12:58,499 --> 01:13:02,085
Now, I know you did not go in there to
tell this guy something he already knew.

1132
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:03,503
Talk to me.

1133
01:13:04,047 --> 01:13:05,130
Look, Detective.

1134
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:07,716
Our arrangement doesn't include me
giving you a detailed explanation.

1135
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,593
I say it does, okay?

1136
01:13:09,969 --> 01:13:11,344
Okay, you don't own me.

1137
01:13:11,429 --> 01:13:14,598
This check-cashing thing, this coke
bust, I can face that on my own.

1138
01:13:14,682 --> 01:13:17,225
I know what I did and
what I didn't do.

1139
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:19,728
- Talk to me.
- Off the record?

1140
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:23,315
"Off the..." Everything about you
is off the record. Just talk to me.

1141
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:26,193
- Well, I gave him an incentive.
- Okay.

1142
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:30,614
- Did he go for it?
- No. But I'd say he's considering it.

1143
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:33,658
He's smart, isn't he?

1144
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:35,577
- He thinks he is.
- Yeah.

1145
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:38,663
One of your types, like
the lvy League type?

1146
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:41,750
- Clearly well educated.
- That's what I'm talking about.

1147
01:13:42,043 --> 01:13:43,960
That's exactly what
I'm talking about.

1148
01:13:44,212 --> 01:13:48,006
You talk like him, so think like him.
What do you think he's gonna do?

1149
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:52,260
- Well, he's not gonna kill anyone.
- How do you know?

1150
01:13:52,345 --> 01:13:54,638
- Because he's not a murderer.
- How do you know?

1151
01:13:55,181 --> 01:13:57,349
I got news for you. Most of
the guys up in Sing Sing

1152
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:59,193
weren't murderers until
they killed somebody.

1153
01:13:59,227 --> 01:14:02,437
You never know what a person will do
until you push him into a corner.

1154
01:14:03,481 --> 01:14:05,899
But it doesn't seem like you've
pushed him into a corner.

1155
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:09,361
It doesn't, does it? Seems
more like he chose the corner.

1156
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:12,280
You're right.

1157
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:14,866
So, you through?

1158
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:18,120
- I guess. Are you saying I'm dismissed?
- Yes, I am.

1159
01:14:18,204 --> 01:14:20,330
You got a card, in case
I need to call you?

1160
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:24,334
Please don't take this
personally, but no.

1161
01:14:24,502 --> 01:14:26,086
I don't think you can afford me.

1162
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:29,589
Well, don't take this personally,
Miss White. Kiss my black ass, okay?

1163
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:34,511
Careful, Detective Frazier. My
bite's much worse than my bark.

1164
01:14:40,518 --> 01:14:42,679
- So, how old are you, Brian?
- Eight and three-quarters.

1165
01:14:42,687 --> 01:14:45,272
Eight and three-quarters.
Big boy.

1166
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:48,608
- Were you scared in there?
- No.

1167
01:14:48,693 --> 01:14:51,319
- No? Not at all, huh?
- Nope. I'm from Brooklyn.

1168
01:14:51,404 --> 01:14:53,029
You're from Brooklyn, huh?
I understand.

1169
01:14:53,114 --> 01:14:54,834
- Guns don't scare me.
- They don't scare you?

1170
01:14:54,907 --> 01:14:56,324
- Brave, too, huh?
- Yeah.

1171
01:14:56,409 --> 01:14:59,703
So the guys that had the guns, do
you remember them saying anything?

1172
01:14:59,954 --> 01:15:01,830
- Yeah.
- What'd they say?

1173
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:03,415
They asked me about my game.

1174
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:06,084
- Who did?
- The guy that robbed the bank. Duh.

1175
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:08,545
Son, be respectful.

1176
01:15:08,629 --> 01:15:10,505
Okay, Brooklyn. But it...
Was he the one in charge?

1177
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:11,631
Uh-huh.

1178
01:15:11,716 --> 01:15:12,757
Okay.

1179
01:15:12,842 --> 01:15:15,468
And you don't remember
anything else?

1180
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:17,179
He was kind of tall.

1181
01:15:17,972 --> 01:15:19,181
He had a mask.

1182
01:15:19,265 --> 01:15:23,226
Brian, you think you can recognize
him in any of these pictures?

1183
01:15:24,187 --> 01:15:26,479
Take your time.
Have a good look.

1184
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:29,733
Let's keep that over there.
Just take a look.

1185
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:39,451
- With the mask, they look all the same.
- It's true.

1186
01:15:41,204 --> 01:15:44,164
With the mask, they all look the same.
That's right, Brian.

1187
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:47,626
Attempted robbery. Liquor store.

1188
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:51,296
Well, this was a real step up for
a small-timer like you, huh?

1189
01:15:52,048 --> 01:15:53,882
I got to hand it to you, Pablo.

1190
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:57,510
First of all, it's Paul.
Not Pablo, okay?

1191
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:58,803
Excuse me.

1192
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:01,806
- You want some gum?
- No.

1193
01:16:02,642 --> 01:16:04,226
And second, I didn't
do it, all right?

1194
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:06,853
What? I made a few
mistakes when I was a kid.

1195
01:16:06,938 --> 01:16:10,232
I was out with some friends and
they held up a liquor store.

1196
01:16:11,317 --> 01:16:13,151
What was I supposed to do?

1197
01:16:14,946 --> 01:16:17,072
Where'd you grow up, you
Wassa Wassa, Park Avenue?

1198
01:16:17,156 --> 01:16:19,699
- What's that? Wassa what? What'd you say?
- Wassa Wassa.

1199
01:16:21,035 --> 01:16:23,286
You know, a person that don't
come to your neighborhood.

1200
01:16:23,371 --> 01:16:25,664
How do you say "Rikers
Island" in Spanish?

1201
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:27,123
What about these two?

1202
01:16:27,667 --> 01:16:29,167
That ring a bell?

1203
01:16:29,377 --> 01:16:31,586
These two? No.

1204
01:16:31,671 --> 01:16:32,921
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

1205
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:34,422
Don't they look
suspicious to you?

1206
01:16:34,507 --> 01:16:37,968
I mean, I would think that you
would want to know who they are.

1207
01:16:38,219 --> 01:16:39,261
No.

1208
01:16:39,345 --> 01:16:41,012
- Well, thank you very much.
- Thank you.

1209
01:16:41,097 --> 01:16:43,807
Hey, just out of curiosity do you
know anything about diamonds?

1210
01:16:43,891 --> 01:16:45,934
A bit. What do you need?

1211
01:16:46,018 --> 01:16:48,311
What do you think a guy like me
should pay for a diamond ring?

1212
01:16:48,396 --> 01:16:50,355
Depends. How many carats?

1213
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:52,440
If you'd like, I could give
you my nephew's number.

1214
01:16:52,525 --> 01:16:53,925
- Okay.
- You'll get a very good deal.

1215
01:16:53,985 --> 01:16:55,986
What do you have on underneath?

1216
01:16:56,153 --> 01:16:58,363
- Excuse me?
- Underneath your painter's coat?

1217
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:00,615
- What do you have on underneath?
- Clothing.

1218
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:02,867
Could you show us, please?

1219
01:17:07,081 --> 01:17:09,124
You see, there's just
you and one other woman

1220
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:11,793
that fit the physical description
of the female suspect.

1221
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:13,044
What's that?

1222
01:17:14,547 --> 01:17:17,799
It's your height,
your age, and your...

1223
01:17:18,676 --> 01:17:20,051
Your cup size.

1224
01:17:20,136 --> 01:17:23,596
So, I violated
Section 34 double-D?

1225
01:17:23,681 --> 01:17:25,598
That's what you're telling me?

1226
01:17:29,228 --> 01:17:32,480
How dumb do these morons have to be
to think they're gonna get a plane?

1227
01:17:32,565 --> 01:17:33,690
This guy's no moron.

1228
01:17:33,774 --> 01:17:36,526
I don't just mean him.
Any hostage taker.

1229
01:17:37,903 --> 01:17:40,572
Those ragheads at the
Munich Olympics.

1230
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:42,615
Who the fuck ever got a plane?

1231
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:45,327
Shit, and these days? This
guy doesn't know that?

1232
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:47,787
<i>The area is flooded
with law enforcement right now.</i>

1233
01:17:47,872 --> 01:17:49,122
<i>Snipers are on rooftops...</i>

1234
01:17:49,206 --> 01:17:50,498
What you doing there, Keith?

1235
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:52,343
He wants a plane. I'm
gonna give him a plane.

1236
01:17:52,418 --> 01:17:55,179
- What happened to playing it by the book?
- That's what's bugging me.

1237
01:17:55,254 --> 01:17:59,591
It's like the other team read the book, too,
and they know exactly what we're gonna do.

1238
01:18:02,553 --> 01:18:06,056
This whole time, we're
trying to stall him, right?

1239
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:07,932
Wrong. They're the ones
that are stalling.

1240
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:10,435
Think about it. The bullshit
questions, the Albanian thing...

1241
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:12,020
So, you're saying he what?

1242
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:15,190
I'm saying that he wants to give
us more time. He makes demands.

1243
01:18:15,858 --> 01:18:19,110
He gives us deadlines. We stall.
Then he gives us more time.

1244
01:18:19,195 --> 01:18:20,528
I don't think he's in a rush.

1245
01:18:20,613 --> 01:18:22,906
- Why?
- That's what I'm gonna find out.

1246
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:45,678
- Yeah.
- Your plane is ready.

1247
01:18:45,763 --> 01:18:46,888
Is that a faсt?

1248
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:49,474
<i>That's a fact, but I'm gonna
need something from you first.</i>

1249
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:52,602
I'm gonna need to come in there and
make sure the hostages are okay.

1250
01:18:52,686 --> 01:18:54,396
You'll see them when
they get on the bus.

1251
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:57,941
I just need to make sure you're
not leaving any bodies behind.

1252
01:19:00,444 --> 01:19:02,153
Meet me at the front door.

1253
01:19:08,244 --> 01:19:11,454
- What the hell just happened?
- You got to be crazy to go in there.

1254
01:20:01,547 --> 01:20:02,922
Down the stairs.

1255
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:13,057
- Gum?
- Excuse me?

1256
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:16,352
- Would you like some gum?
- No, thank you.

1257
01:21:05,736 --> 01:21:07,237
Let me take the kid.

1258
01:21:08,948 --> 01:21:09,948
No.

1259
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:12,116
Any more?

1260
01:21:12,785 --> 01:21:14,911
There are some who misbehaved.

1261
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,627
Please help me!

1262
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:24,879
Please help us!

1263
01:21:24,964 --> 01:21:27,423
Please help us! Please!

1264
01:21:28,092 --> 01:21:30,218
We're gonna get you
all out of here.

1265
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:32,053
I promise you.

1266
01:21:32,805 --> 01:21:34,055
Tour is over.

1267
01:21:42,523 --> 01:21:45,942
- Can I ask you a question?
- There is nothing to talk about.

1268
01:21:46,569 --> 01:21:48,236
What were you planning on doing

1269
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,905
if you actually got the
plane and the pilots, huh?

1270
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:54,242
- Excuse me?
- You don't want a plane. You never did.

1271
01:21:54,326 --> 01:21:57,620
Who ever heard of bank robbers
escaping on a plane with 50 hostages?

1272
01:21:57,705 --> 01:22:01,124
You saw Dog Day Afternoon. You're stalling.
Why? I don't know.

1273
01:22:02,001 --> 01:22:04,460
What's the matter? You
can't get into the safe?

1274
01:22:04,545 --> 01:22:06,129
Perhaps.

1275
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:08,464
There's two ways out of this.

1276
01:22:08,549 --> 01:22:12,468
The easy way, we walk out the front door
together, or the hard boys cut the power,

1277
01:22:12,553 --> 01:22:15,430
hit you with the tear gas, and
come in strong through the glass.

1278
01:22:15,514 --> 01:22:18,433
It's your choice. You don't want that.
I don't want that.

1279
01:22:18,517 --> 01:22:20,768
And, you know, they'd
like to do it tonight.

1280
01:22:20,853 --> 01:22:22,687
You got night vision?

1281
01:22:23,188 --> 01:22:25,857
- You got gas masks?
- Maybe.

1282
01:22:27,026 --> 01:22:29,569
- I'm this close to ordering it.
- Let's cut the crap.

1283
01:22:29,653 --> 01:22:32,614
First, you don't order an assault
when no hostages have been killed

1284
01:22:32,698 --> 01:22:34,240
and there's no immediate threat.

1285
01:22:34,325 --> 01:22:37,368
Second, if it ends that
way, whatever happens,

1286
01:22:37,453 --> 01:22:39,120
you don't get to be the hero.

1287
01:22:39,204 --> 01:22:41,414
You want to bullshit
me, try harder.

1288
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:43,374
Let's go.

1289
01:22:45,294 --> 01:22:46,461
Okay.

1290
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:56,929
I tell you what. My ass
is covered, sport.

1291
01:22:57,014 --> 01:22:59,641
But I would not get too comfortable
in here if I were you.

1292
01:22:59,725 --> 01:23:01,809
No? I got the cable guy
coming on Wednesday.

1293
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:05,730
- Why don't you just walk out the door?
- I will.

1294
01:23:07,483 --> 01:23:10,610
I'm gonna walk out of that
door when I'm good and ready.

1295
01:23:10,903 --> 01:23:12,904
Can I get you to do that today?

1296
01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:15,990
I didn't think so.

1297
01:23:16,075 --> 01:23:17,367
Any other proposals?

1298
01:23:17,451 --> 01:23:19,661
Oh, please. Do not
say "proposals."

1299
01:23:19,745 --> 01:23:22,497
My girlfriend, she wants
a proposal from me.

1300
01:23:22,581 --> 01:23:26,292
- You think you're too young to get married?
- No, I'm not too young. Too broke.

1301
01:23:26,377 --> 01:23:28,586
Maybe I should rob a bank.

1302
01:23:29,672 --> 01:23:31,381
You love each other?

1303
01:23:31,924 --> 01:23:33,758
Yeah. Yeah, we do.

1304
01:23:33,884 --> 01:23:36,052
Then money shouldn't
really matter.

1305
01:23:36,595 --> 01:23:38,262
Thank you, bank robber.

1306
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:41,891
I'm just saying money
can't buy love.

1307
01:23:43,644 --> 01:23:46,312
Thank you very much. I'm...

1308
01:23:47,731 --> 01:23:49,982
I'm learning so much
today, you know?

1309
01:23:50,734 --> 01:23:53,528
Look, why don't we go across the
street to the Killarney Rose, huh?

1310
01:23:53,612 --> 01:23:55,488
Forget about this dangerous
hostage situation.

1311
01:23:55,572 --> 01:23:58,074
- I'll buy you a beer. My treat.
- Thanks, Detective,

1312
01:23:58,158 --> 01:24:01,285
but I'm trying to stay away from
bars, if you know what I mean.

1313
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:04,872
Well, if you change your mind there's
still a standing offer, all right?

1314
01:24:10,629 --> 01:24:12,839
Cellblock or the graveyard?

1315
01:24:12,923 --> 01:24:14,716
Prison whites or a toe tag?

1316
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,969
- Make up your mind. Tick tock, tick tock.
- Hey! Hey!

1317
01:24:19,179 --> 01:24:20,471
We done?

1318
01:24:23,225 --> 01:24:25,351
You just crossed
the fucking line!

1319
01:24:27,146 --> 01:24:29,313
Buses, Kojak, parked outside.

1320
01:24:29,857 --> 01:24:31,482
You think I'm bluffing?

1321
01:24:32,651 --> 01:24:35,027
You roll the dice and
see what happens.

1322
01:24:43,996 --> 01:24:45,997
All right.
Now get the bunker up.

1323
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:48,082
- So, what's up?
- Got him right where I want him.

1324
01:24:48,167 --> 01:24:49,333
Yeah? Where's that?

1325
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:52,879
Right behind me with my pants
around my ankles, but it's a start.

1326
01:24:52,963 --> 01:24:54,380
Jesus Christ.

1327
01:25:09,188 --> 01:25:10,480
- What the fuck, man?
- How long?

1328
01:25:10,564 --> 01:25:12,023
- He got the drop on you!
- Two.

1329
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:13,547
- How long?
- What if he saw your face?

1330
01:25:13,567 --> 01:25:14,967
- Two.
- What if I didn't have my gun?

1331
01:25:15,027 --> 01:25:16,778
Two, maybe three hours.

1332
01:25:16,862 --> 01:25:20,198
You know, you're letting this
cop get too fucking close.

1333
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:24,285
What happened?

1334
01:25:24,369 --> 01:25:26,370
I gave him every excuse
to blow my brains out.

1335
01:25:26,455 --> 01:25:27,455
Yeah.

1336
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:30,666
He doesn't bite. Why?
He ain't the type.

1337
01:25:30,751 --> 01:25:33,252
Let's just step back and think
about this for a second.

1338
01:25:33,337 --> 01:25:36,839
We know that they planned this whole thing.
The tape, the cameras, the costumes.

1339
01:25:36,924 --> 01:25:39,258
There was a game plan, but
it never included airplanes.

1340
01:25:39,343 --> 01:25:41,969
He's up to something
but it ain't violence.

1341
01:25:46,016 --> 01:25:48,559
- I'm listening.
<i>- How's the reception?</i>

1342
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:51,395
- Excuse me?
<i>- The camera on the truck.</i>

1343
01:25:51,814 --> 01:25:54,440
<i>Give me a close-up on the
second-floor window.</i>

1344
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:57,068
- Rourke?
- I'm on it, I'm on it.

1345
01:26:08,622 --> 01:26:11,123
No, no, no, no, no, no! Fuck!

1346
01:26:11,208 --> 01:26:12,542
Oh, shit.

1347
01:26:16,129 --> 01:26:18,923
Keith! Keith! Keith!

1348
01:26:25,264 --> 01:26:27,598
What are you doing? What
the fuck are you doing?

1349
01:26:27,683 --> 01:26:29,767
You mean beyond the obvious?

1350
01:26:29,935 --> 01:26:32,395
That's what I mean. Come on,
this ain't no bank robbery!

1351
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:35,356
This is your fault. I told
you to get the buses.

1352
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:38,901
Fuck you! I didn't kill anybody.

1353
01:26:40,988 --> 01:26:43,698
I got 50 more people in here.
You fuck with me again,

1354
01:26:43,782 --> 01:26:45,908
I'll give you two of the
longest days of your life.

1355
01:26:45,993 --> 01:26:50,288
All right, look, just tell me what it is
you really want and I'll get it for you.

1356
01:26:50,372 --> 01:26:53,207
- I promise.
- I've told you. Two buses, a plane.

1357
01:26:53,292 --> 01:26:56,002
Right, right. And box seats behind
home plate at Yankee Stadium.

1358
01:26:56,086 --> 01:26:58,337
Come on, don't bullshit
a bullshitter.

1359
01:26:59,006 --> 01:27:01,424
You planned every inch of this
thing right from the start.

1360
01:27:01,508 --> 01:27:05,303
You got everybody marching to your beat,
including me, and I'm through buying it.

1361
01:27:08,473 --> 01:27:10,683
You're too damn
smart to be a cop.

1362
01:27:10,767 --> 01:27:12,518
Now get the fuck out of here.

1363
01:27:12,603 --> 01:27:14,270
What? You going to shoot me?

1364
01:27:15,147 --> 01:27:16,689
Do it. Shit, you got
nothing to lose.

1365
01:27:16,773 --> 01:27:19,066
I damn sure ain't got nothing
to lose, so shoot me.

1366
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:20,651
Do it.

1367
01:27:20,986 --> 01:27:23,029
- Shoot me.
- Fuck you.

1368
01:27:23,739 --> 01:27:26,240
Tell them to send
someone sane over here.

1369
01:27:55,187 --> 01:27:56,646
We got a big problem.

1370
01:27:56,730 --> 01:27:58,856
Hey, Detective, this
ain't your day.

1371
01:28:05,614 --> 01:28:07,281
How you doing, Captain?

1372
01:28:09,159 --> 01:28:11,202
Look, I know you put your
trust in me and I just...

1373
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:14,080
Well, you're a good cop.
Frazier, I need more like you.

1374
01:28:14,164 --> 01:28:16,457
But if you're going down on
this one, I can't go with you.

1375
01:28:16,541 --> 01:28:18,181
You got to understand
this, though, sir...

1376
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:20,491
No, no, no. Let me just tell
you what my problem is, okay?

1377
01:28:20,504 --> 01:28:22,463
I go to bed,
everything's hunky-dory.

1378
01:28:22,547 --> 01:28:24,924
I get a call at 3:15, and there's what?
A dead hostage.

1379
01:28:25,008 --> 01:28:27,802
- Right, right, right. But I can end this...
- Lt is ended.

1380
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:30,137
See, you think I got options.

1381
01:28:30,222 --> 01:28:32,515
I got to answer to
the Chief of D's.

1382
01:28:32,599 --> 01:28:35,059
Darius is calling the shots on this.
That's it.

1383
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:53,953
Hey, Sarge.

1384
01:28:54,246 --> 01:28:56,247
- What'd he say?
- That's it.

1385
01:28:57,624 --> 01:28:58,749
Shit.

1386
01:29:00,293 --> 01:29:02,920
- It's a tactical nightmare.
- I know.

1387
01:29:03,005 --> 01:29:06,048
Well, first, this
is the only way in.

1388
01:29:06,133 --> 01:29:08,384
Then we got to make it
up the stairs blind.

1389
01:29:08,468 --> 01:29:10,761
Once we get up there, we're
right out in the open.

1390
01:29:10,846 --> 01:29:14,849
<i>They have the advantage of cover.
They can pick us off like sitting ducks.</i>

1391
01:29:15,434 --> 01:29:19,020
<i>Then if we make it across the
floor and down the stairs,</i>

1392
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:22,523
we still can't tell the homies from
the good guys until they shoot at us.

1393
01:29:22,607 --> 01:29:25,447
Even if it isn't rigged with explosives,
it's still a fucking nightmare.

1394
01:29:31,116 --> 01:29:32,783
Move! Move! Move!

1395
01:29:33,618 --> 01:29:35,327
Open the door!

1396
01:29:49,051 --> 01:29:51,177
- Keep moving.
- To the right.

1397
01:29:51,261 --> 01:29:52,720
Watch the hands,
watch the hands.

1398
01:29:52,804 --> 01:29:55,264
And let's not forget the possibility
of hostages being killed.

1399
01:29:55,348 --> 01:29:57,183
Right now! Put the gun down!

1400
01:29:57,267 --> 01:30:00,061
Back off or I shoot!
I said back off!

1401
01:30:00,145 --> 01:30:03,522
<i>Well, our best hope is to
separate them from the hostages.</i>

1402
01:30:03,607 --> 01:30:06,358
If we can get two or three
upstairs and take them out?

1403
01:30:06,443 --> 01:30:07,610
Kill them?

1404
01:30:15,827 --> 01:30:17,495
Gun! Gun! Gun!

1405
01:30:26,713 --> 01:30:28,172
What if there's more than four?

1406
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:33,010
Yeah, well, that's what's so nuts about it.
Anybody in a painter's suit could be a perp.

1407
01:30:33,136 --> 01:30:36,388
Maybe we should dress our guys
up like a bunch of painters.

1408
01:30:37,265 --> 01:30:41,185
And we should use rubber bullets. Take
head shots. Put their lights out.

1409
01:30:43,021 --> 01:30:44,730
- Not a bad idea.
- Yeah.

1410
01:30:44,815 --> 01:30:46,816
<i>Rubber bullets it is, baby.</i>

1411
01:30:51,363 --> 01:30:53,114
If this goes down wrong,

1412
01:30:54,116 --> 01:30:57,326
they're going to dump this whole
mess in your lap, you know?

1413
01:30:57,410 --> 01:30:59,203
- I'm making First Grade.
- What?

1414
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:02,581
I'm making Detective First Grade.
Things ain't all they appear to be.

1415
01:31:02,666 --> 01:31:06,710
- What the fuck does that mean?
- Deteсtive First Grade Keith Frazier.

1416
01:31:06,795 --> 01:31:08,921
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Yes.

1417
01:31:09,005 --> 01:31:11,715
Thank the Mayor and our
mystery guest for that.

1418
01:31:12,425 --> 01:31:14,426
You cut a deal with those guys?

1419
01:31:14,845 --> 01:31:17,096
Never make First Grade? Shit.

1420
01:31:17,973 --> 01:31:19,807
Worked too hard to
let that happen.

1421
01:31:19,891 --> 01:31:22,601
Everybody's getting theirs.
I'm gonna get mine.

1422
01:31:24,521 --> 01:31:26,063
I'll be outside.

1423
01:31:31,903 --> 01:31:33,487
What a day, what a day.

1424
01:31:33,572 --> 01:31:37,324
Detective, they're gonna storm that
bank without you? It's not right.

1425
01:31:38,410 --> 01:31:41,829
So, tell me about the kid who pointed
the gun at you, the 12-year-old.

1426
01:31:41,913 --> 01:31:43,539
- Now?
- Yeah.

1427
01:31:44,249 --> 01:31:46,000
Last year, up in the 33rd,

1428
01:31:46,084 --> 01:31:48,878
I was breaking up a fight about a
half a block from the high school.

1429
01:31:48,962 --> 01:31:51,672
This one little spic is getting
his clock cleaned by another one.

1430
01:31:51,756 --> 01:31:55,134
Do me a favor, Sergeant. Just
tone down the color commentary.

1431
01:31:57,095 --> 01:31:59,346
So I bust up the fight,

1432
01:31:59,431 --> 01:32:03,142
I turn around and this kid is
pointing a .22 at my chest.

1433
01:32:03,226 --> 01:32:07,271
- Is that right? Now, which kid was this?
- Another kid, an African-American.

1434
01:32:07,355 --> 01:32:08,898
- An African-American, right?
- Yeah.

1435
01:32:08,982 --> 01:32:10,524
Came out of nowhere.
I didn't see him.

1436
01:32:10,609 --> 01:32:11,734
So, what'd you do?

1437
01:32:11,818 --> 01:32:13,986
What did I do then? I'll
tell you what I did then.

1438
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:17,198
I got shot in the fucking chest.
That's what I did then.

1439
01:32:17,407 --> 01:32:19,700
Yeah, so you'll pardon my
euphemisms, Detective,

1440
01:32:19,784 --> 01:32:23,370
but I would rather wind up an old
bigot than a handsome young corpse.

1441
01:32:23,455 --> 01:32:25,039
Now, no offense, Detective,

1442
01:32:25,123 --> 01:32:27,583
but I'm just trying to
keep them away from us.

1443
01:32:27,667 --> 01:32:30,878
Now, what do you say we just get
these people safely out of the bank?

1444
01:32:30,962 --> 01:32:32,087
I hear that.

1445
01:32:32,172 --> 01:32:35,299
And I'll try and watch
what I say in the future.

1446
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:37,468
You never know who's listening.

1447
01:32:51,816 --> 01:32:53,359
What are you doing?

1448
01:32:53,443 --> 01:32:54,693
Jesus. Shit.

1449
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:58,781
They bugged us.

1450
01:33:02,619 --> 01:33:03,827
Darius!

1451
01:33:04,412 --> 01:33:06,372
Darius, don't make a move!

1452
01:33:06,456 --> 01:33:08,249
- What?
<i>- It's all fucked up!</i>

1453
01:33:08,333 --> 01:33:10,334
Do not make a move!
Keep your men back!

1454
01:33:10,418 --> 01:33:11,835
What are you talking about?

1455
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:13,640
They heard everything
we said in the M.C.C.

1456
01:33:13,672 --> 01:33:15,756
- What?
<i>- Stand down! Stand down!</i>

1457
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:19,176
The drawer with the demands in it!
They heard everything we said!

1458
01:33:19,261 --> 01:33:21,595
They put a transmitter in it!
They bugged us!

1459
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:23,597
<i>No, no, no. I'm going in.</i>

1460
01:33:25,183 --> 01:33:26,225
Shit.

1461
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:35,943
Get everyone together.

1462
01:33:36,027 --> 01:33:38,487
Steve! Steve-O!

1463
01:33:41,449 --> 01:33:42,866
They're coming in.

1464
01:33:43,034 --> 01:33:44,827
- Everybody good?
- Yeah.

1465
01:33:44,911 --> 01:33:46,954
All right! Everybody out!

1466
01:33:47,038 --> 01:33:49,873
- Put your masks on!
- Everyone out! Out!

1467
01:33:51,167 --> 01:33:52,251
- Go now!
- Go!

1468
01:33:52,335 --> 01:33:54,670
Go! Go! Go!

1469
01:33:55,922 --> 01:33:57,562
- Now!
- Get the fuck out!

1470
01:33:57,966 --> 01:33:59,091
Move!

1471
01:33:59,175 --> 01:34:02,303
Everybody up the
fucking stairs! Move!

1472
01:34:12,314 --> 01:34:13,522
Move!

1473
01:34:41,801 --> 01:34:43,441
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!

1474
01:34:43,511 --> 01:34:45,888
- Get down! Get down on the ground!
- Don't shoot!

1475
01:34:50,602 --> 01:34:51,769
Cease fire!

1476
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:57,775
Cease fire! Cease fire!

1477
01:35:00,570 --> 01:35:01,987
Let's go, people.

1478
01:35:18,797 --> 01:35:20,589
Put your hands on your head!
Get down!

1479
01:35:20,673 --> 01:35:22,007
Put your hands on your head.

1480
01:35:22,092 --> 01:35:24,218
- Will somebody stop him?
- Get down!

1481
01:35:24,302 --> 01:35:26,053
Put your hands on your head.

1482
01:35:26,137 --> 01:35:28,138
- Put your hands on your head.
- Get them down!

1483
01:35:28,223 --> 01:35:31,100
- On the ground!
- Put your hands on your fucking heads!

1484
01:35:31,184 --> 01:35:32,726
Do not move!

1485
01:35:32,811 --> 01:35:35,938
- Get down, put your hands on your head!
- Put the cuffs on them! Let's go!

1486
01:35:39,818 --> 01:35:41,276
What's going on?

1487
01:35:47,117 --> 01:35:48,742
Don't take any chances!

1488
01:35:51,204 --> 01:35:53,831
It wasn't me! I'm
not a criminal!

1489
01:35:54,791 --> 01:35:55,958
Cuffs!

1490
01:35:58,670 --> 01:35:59,753
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1491
01:35:59,838 --> 01:36:01,588
- Don't move!
- I'm not moving!

1492
01:36:08,346 --> 01:36:10,514
- Don't move!
- Do not move!

1493
01:36:10,598 --> 01:36:13,475
Check them. Make sure they ain't
got no weapons on them and shit.

1494
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:15,320
- Hernandez!
- Right here.

1495
01:36:17,814 --> 01:36:19,857
E.S.U.
Team, line up!

1496
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:32,786
Door to the left,
door to the left.

1497
01:36:32,871 --> 01:36:35,205
- Clear on the right.
- Clear!

1498
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:39,710
- Left side clear.
- Clear!

1499
01:36:41,754 --> 01:36:43,964
- Clear.
- Clear.

1500
01:36:44,048 --> 01:36:46,425
- All clear!
- Check under the desk.

1501
01:36:47,135 --> 01:36:49,887
- Clear.
- Checking the office. All clear, Sarge.

1502
01:36:51,097 --> 01:36:52,639
- Clear.
- Clear.

1503
01:36:52,724 --> 01:36:55,976
Clear.

1504
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:57,603
All clear, Sarge.

1505
01:37:01,149 --> 01:37:03,734
All clear. E.S.U.
On the stairs. Line it up!

1506
01:37:11,493 --> 01:37:14,036
Let's go, guys.
Team in, team in. Let's go.

1507
01:37:19,501 --> 01:37:20,626
Clear!

1508
01:37:21,085 --> 01:37:26,673
- Clear.
- Clear.

1509
01:37:26,758 --> 01:37:27,925
Clear.

1510
01:37:28,510 --> 01:37:30,344
- Clear, Sarge.
- Clear.

1511
01:37:31,095 --> 01:37:33,597
Give me a bunker up here.
I need a bunker up front.

1512
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:35,390
Bringing the bunker up.

1513
01:37:35,475 --> 01:37:36,683
Clear, Sarge.

1514
01:37:38,144 --> 01:37:39,269
Clear.

1515
01:37:40,021 --> 01:37:42,773
- We're almost clear down here.
- Make sure you're sure.

1516
01:37:43,107 --> 01:37:44,733
- I'll keep looking.
<i>- Stay on it.</i>

1517
01:37:44,817 --> 01:37:46,235
Roger that.

1518
01:37:46,945 --> 01:37:48,946
Ready? Let's go.

1519
01:37:52,617 --> 01:37:54,201
This is the last door.

1520
01:38:01,543 --> 01:38:03,961
- Clear, Sarge!
- Come on down.

1521
01:38:11,469 --> 01:38:13,030
- Did you find a dead hostage?
- Negative.

1522
01:38:13,096 --> 01:38:15,013
If it ain't here, you
must've missed something.

1523
01:38:15,098 --> 01:38:17,898
Maybe, but I'm pretty sure we're the
only ones moving around down here.

1524
01:38:17,976 --> 01:38:20,811
Check this out. They
forgot to rob the joint.

1525
01:38:20,895 --> 01:38:23,397
- Holy shit.
- And you didn't find anybody?

1526
01:38:23,481 --> 01:38:25,691
We're still looking, but
there are no bad guys,

1527
01:38:25,775 --> 01:38:27,901
no booby traps, no
tunnels, no damage.

1528
01:38:27,986 --> 01:38:29,403
- And nothing missing.
- Great, great, great.

1529
01:38:29,487 --> 01:38:32,406
We'll put out a city-wide description for
David fucking Copperfield, then, huh?

1530
01:38:32,490 --> 01:38:34,491
Listen, I'm not trying to tell
you your jobs, Detectives,

1531
01:38:34,576 --> 01:38:36,577
but unless they swam out
through the toilets,

1532
01:38:36,661 --> 01:38:38,495
whoever did this is
upstairs sucking pavement.

1533
01:38:38,580 --> 01:38:39,871
All right, good job.

1534
01:38:39,956 --> 01:38:41,164
What's that?

1535
01:38:43,835 --> 01:38:45,002
Cell phones.

1536
01:38:46,129 --> 01:38:49,006
- Hey, guys! You need to see this.
- Okay.

1537
01:38:49,340 --> 01:38:53,343
Collins! Grab a uniform, make a quick
count of that money in there, all right?

1538
01:38:53,428 --> 01:38:55,262
- Yes, sir.
- And stand by, all right?

1539
01:38:55,346 --> 01:38:57,264
Don't let anybody get
tempted, including you!

1540
01:38:57,348 --> 01:38:58,473
Yes, sir!

1541
01:38:59,017 --> 01:39:00,601
Right here, Detective.

1542
01:39:00,685 --> 01:39:04,271
- What do you got?
- You're going to love this one. Toy guns.

1543
01:39:04,355 --> 01:39:06,523
Fake guns. You got
to be kidding me.

1544
01:39:07,567 --> 01:39:10,319
- Toys.
- As if it wasn't weird enough already.

1545
01:39:10,403 --> 01:39:12,571
<i>Cap, come to the ladies' room.</i>

1546
01:39:13,156 --> 01:39:14,531
On my way.

1547
01:39:32,467 --> 01:39:33,717
Check it out.

1548
01:39:34,802 --> 01:39:36,887
We can stop looking
for that body.

1549
01:39:37,388 --> 01:39:38,680
Fake guns.

1550
01:39:39,682 --> 01:39:41,224
Fake execution.

1551
01:39:42,393 --> 01:39:44,519
Nobody goes home till we
get everybody's story.

1552
01:39:44,604 --> 01:39:47,314
Cap, we got something
else in the storage room.

1553
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:00,827
- Porcario?
- Yo.

1554
01:40:01,412 --> 01:40:04,247
- Where's the men's room?
- Down the hallway on the left.

1555
01:40:14,884 --> 01:40:17,511
Pick them up, pick them up.
Toss them.

1556
01:40:17,595 --> 01:40:19,763
I'm a hostage.
Stop pushing.

1557
01:40:43,246 --> 01:40:47,290
Female hostages to be
searched by female officers only!

1558
01:40:48,292 --> 01:40:50,460
All right, listen,
let's get these people up.

1559
01:40:50,545 --> 01:40:52,713
- I can't hear you. What?
- Valerie Keepsake.

1560
01:40:52,797 --> 01:40:54,715
Valerie Keepsake. Go,
go, get on the bus.

1561
01:40:54,799 --> 01:40:56,508
- Kenneth Damerjian.
- Yeah.

1562
01:40:56,592 --> 01:40:57,884
Person one.

1563
01:40:57,969 --> 01:41:00,679
- I'm Peter Hammond.
- Eric Dodge.

1564
01:41:00,763 --> 01:41:03,682
- Wait!
- Chaim. My name's Chaim.

1565
01:41:05,476 --> 01:41:07,185
Fucking cocksucker.

1566
01:41:07,854 --> 01:41:09,396
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1567
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:11,606
Just give me your name.
Just give me your name.

1568
01:41:11,691 --> 01:41:13,483
Say your name.

1569
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:16,319
I work in the bank!

1570
01:41:16,529 --> 01:41:19,072
I'm the bank security guard!
Nobody's listening!

1571
01:41:19,157 --> 01:41:20,449
Okay, we'll straighten it out.

1572
01:41:20,533 --> 01:41:22,200
Everybody's saying listen!
Nobody's listening!

1573
01:41:22,285 --> 01:41:23,660
We'll straighten it out.
Come on.

1574
01:41:23,745 --> 01:41:25,825
- Listen, I'm not getting on the bus!
- Yes, you are.

1575
01:41:25,830 --> 01:41:28,206
- Move! Move! Move!
- I am not! I work at the bank!

1576
01:41:28,291 --> 01:41:29,750
Collins, you got this?

1577
01:41:29,834 --> 01:41:31,251
Listen, I work at the bank!

1578
01:41:31,335 --> 01:41:33,462
All right, just get him
on the bus. Get him on the bus.

1579
01:41:33,546 --> 01:41:36,673
- Nobody's listening!
- All right. Calm down. Get on the bus.

1580
01:41:50,438 --> 01:41:52,606
- Come on, guys, guys!
- Over this way. Over this way.

1581
01:41:52,690 --> 01:41:54,733
Officer, take her over to Sarge.
Come on.

1582
01:41:55,526 --> 01:41:58,820
Come on, let's get going with
these people off that line over there.

1583
01:41:58,905 --> 01:42:00,197
Come on.

1584
01:42:06,871 --> 01:42:10,540
Captain, I'm telling you,
this thing is a mess.

1585
01:42:11,417 --> 01:42:13,585
They thought this one
out, soup to nuts.

1586
01:42:13,669 --> 01:42:15,212
So, lay it out for me.

1587
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:18,465
We photograph everybody
that came out of the bank.

1588
01:42:18,549 --> 01:42:21,384
We sit them down, we question
them, we show them the photos.

1589
01:42:21,469 --> 01:42:24,888
Most of them can't point to anybody
that's guilty of anything.

1590
01:42:25,723 --> 01:42:29,142
We ask them if they could recognize
anybody who was not one of the bad guys.

1591
01:42:29,227 --> 01:42:31,895
Even if we considered someone
as a possible suspect,

1592
01:42:31,979 --> 01:42:34,689
there's one or two or three other
people that would rule them out.

1593
01:42:34,774 --> 01:42:36,174
It's like the thing
never happened.

1594
01:42:36,234 --> 01:42:39,069
- What about prints?
- Everywhere. So what?

1595
01:42:39,904 --> 01:42:43,448
- All it shows is that these people were there.
- Alibis?

1596
01:42:43,533 --> 01:42:44,866
Just about everyone.

1597
01:42:44,951 --> 01:42:46,827
Even if their alibi was weak,

1598
01:42:46,911 --> 01:42:49,996
a hostage would identify them
as being one of the good guys.

1599
01:42:50,081 --> 01:42:51,623
There we are, back
to square one.

1600
01:42:51,707 --> 01:42:52,707
Priors?

1601
01:42:52,792 --> 01:42:56,294
We got one employee who had some
juvie stuff. One customer had...

1602
01:42:56,379 --> 01:42:57,546
Excuse me.

1603
01:42:58,256 --> 01:43:00,882
One customer had an out-of-state
warrant for child support.

1604
01:43:00,967 --> 01:43:03,718
Another one had a couple of priors, G.
L.A. mostly.

1605
01:43:04,762 --> 01:43:07,681
Again, same problem. Plus,
he was a fucking idiot.

1606
01:43:07,765 --> 01:43:09,808
- Bank cameras?
- Useless.

1607
01:43:09,892 --> 01:43:12,310
I'm telling you, they thought
of everything. Almost.

1608
01:43:12,395 --> 01:43:14,688
- Sounded like everything to me.
- But this.

1609
01:43:14,772 --> 01:43:18,024
We haven't found that .357 or
the perp that was holding it.

1610
01:43:18,109 --> 01:43:20,819
If you did, there'd be
no prints on it anyway.

1611
01:43:21,612 --> 01:43:23,154
- Bury it.
- Bury it?

1612
01:43:23,406 --> 01:43:25,699
What the fuck do you
expect me to say?

1613
01:43:29,745 --> 01:43:33,123
Captain, this thing stinks to high hell.
I mean, somebody did something here.

1614
01:43:33,207 --> 01:43:34,749
You said it yourself.

1615
01:43:34,834 --> 01:43:37,460
You got no robbery. No suspects.

1616
01:43:37,962 --> 01:43:40,297
Nobody's breathing down my
neck to come up with answers.

1617
01:43:40,381 --> 01:43:42,841
I'm not gonna breathe down yours.
Bury it.

1618
01:43:46,470 --> 01:43:48,263
I wasn't expecting this.

1619
01:43:48,347 --> 01:43:51,391
I promise you, I'll find you
guys more cases to solve.

1620
01:43:53,895 --> 01:43:54,978
Okay.

1621
01:43:56,772 --> 01:43:59,608
Oh, here's something that
you probably did expect.

1622
01:43:59,692 --> 01:44:03,403
- They found that missing Madrugada money.
- No shit.

1623
01:44:03,988 --> 01:44:06,197
Yes, you want to
know where it was?

1624
01:44:06,282 --> 01:44:08,450
- In my bank account?
- No.

1625
01:44:08,534 --> 01:44:10,869
- My summer house in Sag Harbor?
- No.

1626
01:44:10,953 --> 01:44:12,662
- My wallet?
- No.

1627
01:44:13,539 --> 01:44:16,291
Then, no. I don't want to know.

1628
01:44:24,091 --> 01:44:25,800
This is bullshit, man.

1629
01:44:25,885 --> 01:44:28,136
I mean, we're the only ones left
trying to catch the bad guys

1630
01:44:28,220 --> 01:44:29,900
and they're gonna come
after us like that?

1631
01:44:29,972 --> 01:44:32,012
I'll tell you what. Every
one of your accusers, man,

1632
01:44:32,058 --> 01:44:35,477
I say we go after them all,
Keith, Michael Corleone style.

1633
01:44:35,561 --> 01:44:37,604
"Michael Corleone, do
you renounce Satan?"

1634
01:44:37,688 --> 01:44:39,022
"Yes, I renounce him."

1635
01:44:40,483 --> 01:44:42,484
There's no 392.

1636
01:44:42,568 --> 01:44:45,528
- Huh?
- Safety deposit box number 392.

1637
01:44:45,613 --> 01:44:47,864
According to these
records, it doesn't exist.

1638
01:44:47,949 --> 01:44:50,367
Pinstriped, mayonnaise,
lying motherfucker.

1639
01:44:50,701 --> 01:44:53,912
- Didn't Coughlin say we should move on?
- Let's go.

1640
01:45:03,339 --> 01:45:05,699
Thank you, again, Your Honor.
I'll come pick it up tomorrow?

1641
01:45:05,716 --> 01:45:07,717
- Yes, you're welcome.
- Thank you.

1642
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:16,101
What are you doing, Detective?

1643
01:45:16,185 --> 01:45:18,728
Now, what business do you
have with Judge Pasqua?

1644
01:45:18,813 --> 01:45:20,313
Police business.

1645
01:45:20,398 --> 01:45:23,775
- Weren't you told to bury this?
- I got a job to do, Miss White.

1646
01:45:23,859 --> 01:45:26,653
And since when is your job more
important than your career?

1647
01:45:26,737 --> 01:45:29,155
- Or did you forget our arrangement?
- We didn't have any arrangement.

1648
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:30,720
Let me tell you how this works.
You...

1649
01:45:30,741 --> 01:45:32,784
No, let me tell you
how this works.

1650
01:45:32,868 --> 01:45:36,079
You press here to record and
you press here to play.

1651
01:45:36,163 --> 01:45:38,415
<i>There's also the matter of the $140,000</i>

1652
01:45:38,499 --> 01:45:39,749
<i>that seems to have walked away</i>

1653
01:45:39,834 --> 01:45:42,585
<i>from the Madrugada
check-cashing bust.</i>

1654
01:45:42,753 --> 01:45:45,005
<i>I didn't have anything
to do with that, so...</i>

1655
01:45:45,089 --> 01:45:47,173
<i>We'd like to be
in your corner on that.</i>

1656
01:45:47,258 --> 01:45:48,299
<i>In exchange for what?</i>

1657
01:45:48,384 --> 01:45:50,093
<i>I mean, what, do you want me
to do something unethical?</i>

1658
01:45:50,177 --> 01:45:52,137
<i>I mean, no disrespect
to the both of youse</i>

1659
01:45:52,221 --> 01:45:54,264
<i>but I don't need you to be
in my corner, Mr. Mayor.</i>

1660
01:45:54,348 --> 01:45:55,682
<i>Look, I'm innocent.</i>

1661
01:45:55,766 --> 01:45:58,560
<i>Innocent or guilty,
you're still going down.</i>

1662
01:45:59,395 --> 01:46:03,356
<i>Give Miss White whatever she
needs, or your career is over.</i>

1663
01:46:03,816 --> 01:46:04,941
<i>Done.</i>

1664
01:46:05,317 --> 01:46:06,526
<i>Kaput.</i>

1665
01:46:08,029 --> 01:46:10,989
So? You gave me what I wanted.

1666
01:46:11,073 --> 01:46:14,200
Your career is blossoming and
all is right with the world.

1667
01:46:14,285 --> 01:46:15,785
What was Case hiding?

1668
01:46:18,956 --> 01:46:22,459
You know, there's a famous saying
by the Baron de Rothschild.

1669
01:46:24,170 --> 01:46:27,380
"When there's blood on the
streets, buy property."

1670
01:46:29,842 --> 01:46:32,886
I think Mr. Case really took
that sentiment to heart.

1671
01:46:32,970 --> 01:46:35,764
But he is no different
than half the Fortune 500.

1672
01:46:37,224 --> 01:46:38,975
Let it go, Detective.

1673
01:46:40,478 --> 01:46:42,062
You're a good cop.

1674
01:46:42,813 --> 01:46:44,564
This city needs you.

1675
01:47:12,718 --> 01:47:16,179
- Lady! Lady, you're in the wrong place.
- I have an appointment.

1676
01:47:24,814 --> 01:47:26,022
Arthur.

1677
01:47:26,816 --> 01:47:29,359
- Good morning.
- Miss White.

1678
01:47:30,194 --> 01:47:31,528
Have a seat.

1679
01:47:33,405 --> 01:47:36,199
Thank you, Vincent. That's all for now.
Thank you.

1680
01:47:39,829 --> 01:47:41,996
Well. What did he say?

1681
01:47:42,081 --> 01:47:45,125
Well, Detective Frazier
turned out to be quite sharp.

1682
01:47:45,209 --> 01:47:48,336
But I just fast-tracked his career
a little and he's under control.

1683
01:47:48,420 --> 01:47:51,381
I hope so. Tell me
about the envelope.

1684
01:47:51,841 --> 01:47:52,966
Where is it now?

1685
01:47:53,050 --> 01:47:55,969
Well, the gang leader is
going to hang on to it,

1686
01:47:56,053 --> 01:47:59,180
as an insurance policy to keep
you from seeking revenge.

1687
01:47:59,849 --> 01:48:02,600
Clearly, he has a very
low opinion of you.

1688
01:48:02,685 --> 01:48:03,977
And what might that be?

1689
01:48:04,061 --> 01:48:07,397
Well, let's see. In a
nutshell, that you got rich,

1690
01:48:07,565 --> 01:48:10,692
doing business with the
Nazis during the Holocaust.

1691
01:48:13,946 --> 01:48:15,071
Yes.

1692
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:19,367
It was 60 years ago. I
was young and ambitious.

1693
01:48:19,994 --> 01:48:22,787
I saw a short path to
success and I took it.

1694
01:48:24,415 --> 01:48:25,915
I sold my soul.

1695
01:48:27,710 --> 01:48:30,670
And I've been trying to
buy it back ever since.

1696
01:48:30,754 --> 01:48:35,258
But you and this mystery man,
you have an understanding?

1697
01:48:35,426 --> 01:48:39,262
I think so. And he managed to get
out of there with that envelope.

1698
01:48:40,306 --> 01:48:43,641
If someday he comes back
to blackmail you, well,

1699
01:48:44,476 --> 01:48:47,187
you'll pay him. And
you'll get it back.

1700
01:48:48,439 --> 01:48:50,523
- So, I guess that's it.
- I suppose so.

1701
01:48:50,608 --> 01:48:52,483
- Bullshit.
- I beg your pardon?

1702
01:48:52,568 --> 01:48:56,404
He didn't go through all that just to
stick your envelope under his mattress.

1703
01:48:56,488 --> 01:48:59,324
Look, they left money
untouched, Arthur.

1704
01:48:59,408 --> 01:49:00,450
So?

1705
01:49:00,618 --> 01:49:04,996
So, he had to have walked out
of there with something else.

1706
01:49:05,956 --> 01:49:08,458
The bank says that there
was nothing missing.

1707
01:49:08,542 --> 01:49:11,127
So, there had to have been
something in that box

1708
01:49:11,212 --> 01:49:13,838
that was worth more to
him than your envelope.

1709
01:49:15,841 --> 01:49:17,842
You don't have to tell me.

1710
01:49:17,927 --> 01:49:20,303
There's only one thing
it could be anyway.

1711
01:49:23,682 --> 01:49:24,849
Diamonds.

1712
01:49:25,809 --> 01:49:27,644
And then there's the ring.

1713
01:49:28,354 --> 01:49:29,771
Cartier ring.

1714
01:49:30,397 --> 01:49:33,358
It belonged to the wife
of a Parisian banker.

1715
01:49:33,776 --> 01:49:36,444
Wealthy family of French Jews.

1716
01:49:37,112 --> 01:49:40,240
And when the war came along, the
ring and everything else they owned

1717
01:49:40,324 --> 01:49:45,161
was confiscated and they were shipped off
to concentration camps. None survived.

1718
01:49:47,164 --> 01:49:48,790
We were friends.

1719
01:49:49,667 --> 01:49:51,501
I could have helped them.

1720
01:49:53,420 --> 01:49:58,216
But the Nazis paid too well.

1721
01:50:00,177 --> 01:50:04,722
Can I trust that you will
keep what you've learned

1722
01:50:04,807 --> 01:50:08,142
here today confidential?

1723
01:50:09,186 --> 01:50:11,521
Despite whatever you may think?

1724
01:50:20,614 --> 01:50:22,031
Yes, Arthur.

1725
01:50:23,993 --> 01:50:27,161
Well, I'd love to tell you
what a monster you are,

1726
01:50:27,371 --> 01:50:31,541
but I have to help bin Laden's
nephew buy a co-op on Park Avenue.

1727
01:50:35,713 --> 01:50:38,214
If that were true, you
wouldn't tell me.

1728
01:50:38,507 --> 01:50:40,675
We're listing you
as a reference.

1729
01:50:55,149 --> 01:50:57,483
My name is Dalton Russell.

1730
01:50:58,068 --> 01:50:59,861
Pay strict attention
to what I say

1731
01:50:59,945 --> 01:51:03,573
because I choose my words carefully
and I never repeat myself.

1732
01:51:03,657 --> 01:51:06,409
<i>I've told you my name.
That's the "who."</i>

1733
01:51:07,411 --> 01:51:11,080
<i>The "where" could most readily
be described as a prison cell.</i>

1734
01:51:11,623 --> 01:51:13,207
But there is a vast difference

1735
01:51:13,292 --> 01:51:16,836
between being stuck in a tiny
cell and being in prison.

1736
01:51:18,547 --> 01:51:20,131
<i>The "what" is easy.</i>

1737
01:51:21,175 --> 01:51:25,887
<i>Recently I planned and set in motion events
to execute the perfect bank robbery.</i>

1738
01:51:26,930 --> 01:51:28,806
That's also the "when."

1739
01:51:29,850 --> 01:51:34,228
<i>As for the "why," beyond the
obvious financial motivation,</i>

1740
01:51:34,938 --> 01:51:36,731
<i>it's exceedingly simple.</i>

1741
01:51:37,107 --> 01:51:38,566
<i>Because I can.</i>

1742
01:51:39,651 --> 01:51:41,819
<i>Which leaves us only
with the "how."</i>

1743
01:51:42,738 --> 01:51:45,782
<i>And therein, as the
Bard would tell us,</i>

1744
01:51:46,825 --> 01:51:48,284
<i>lies the rub.</i>

1745
01:52:37,501 --> 01:52:41,129
- He's gonna smell like shit.
- What do you expect after a week?

1746
01:52:43,507 --> 01:52:44,590
Yeah.

1747
01:52:45,008 --> 01:52:47,510
Why do you think I
rolled down the window?

1748
01:53:07,197 --> 01:53:08,448
Oh, shit.

1749
01:53:13,871 --> 01:53:16,456
That cop, Frazier, and his partner
are walking into the bank.

1750
01:53:16,540 --> 01:53:19,834
- Are they coming for me?
<i>- Can't say. It's just the two of them.</i>

1751
01:53:27,468 --> 01:53:30,428
Yeah, everything's
going great today. No.

1752
01:53:30,804 --> 01:53:33,764
Yeah, about 5:30. Okay.

1753
01:53:34,224 --> 01:53:36,767
Sounds like fun. Okay.

1754
01:53:37,561 --> 01:53:39,103
Talk to you later.

1755
01:54:00,501 --> 01:54:02,251
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

1756
01:54:05,589 --> 01:54:06,964
Mr. Hammond?

1757
01:54:07,049 --> 01:54:08,799
Good morning, Detectives.

1758
01:54:12,387 --> 01:54:13,930
Just like he planned.

1759
01:54:14,014 --> 01:54:16,599
I got a court order here to
open a safe deposit box.

1760
01:54:16,683 --> 01:54:18,601
Number 392.

1761
01:54:29,821 --> 01:54:31,614
Oh, thank God.

1762
01:54:37,329 --> 01:54:38,746
Where is it?

1763
01:54:39,498 --> 01:54:40,957
I left it in there.

1764
01:54:41,041 --> 01:54:42,708
This way, Detectives.

1765
01:54:42,793 --> 01:54:45,378
Why did you do that?
You left the ring.

1766
01:54:45,462 --> 01:54:46,754
Trust me.

1767
01:54:47,673 --> 01:54:49,340
I left it in good hands.

1768
01:54:50,259 --> 01:54:51,842
<i>I'm no martyr.</i>

1769
01:54:52,553 --> 01:54:54,178
<i>I did it for the money.</i>

1770
01:54:55,973 --> 01:54:59,517
<i>But it's not worth much if you
can't face yourself in the mirror.</i>

1771
01:55:00,477 --> 01:55:03,104
<i>Respect is the
ultimate currency.</i>

1772
01:55:05,941 --> 01:55:09,860
<i>I was stealing from a man who
traded his away for a few dollars.</i>

1773
01:55:11,780 --> 01:55:14,240
<i>And then he tried to
wash away his guilt.</i>

1774
01:55:15,367 --> 01:55:19,412
<i>Drown it in a lifetime of good
deeds and a sea of respectability.</i>

1775
01:55:20,205 --> 01:55:22,331
- Let me get that.
- Let me.

1776
01:55:22,416 --> 01:55:23,791
<i>It almost worked, too.</i>

1777
01:55:23,875 --> 01:55:25,001
Okay.

1778
01:55:27,087 --> 01:55:28,504
<i>But inevitably,</i>

1779
01:55:29,423 --> 01:55:31,632
<i>the further you run
from your sins,</i>

1780
01:55:32,426 --> 01:55:35,386
<i>the more exhausted you are
when they catch up to you.</i>

1781
01:55:35,721 --> 01:55:36,887
<i>And they do.</i>

1782
01:55:38,807 --> 01:55:40,308
Son of a bitch.

1783
01:55:40,392 --> 01:55:41,601
<i>Certain.</i>

1784
01:55:42,603 --> 01:55:44,270
<i>It will not fail.</i>

1785
01:55:48,692 --> 01:55:50,693
What do you think that's worth?

1786
01:55:50,944 --> 01:55:53,613
If you got to ask,
man, you can't afford it.

1787
01:55:53,697 --> 01:55:56,073
Thank goodness my
girlfriend ain't here.

1788
01:55:58,201 --> 01:55:59,994
"Follow the ring"?

1789
01:56:14,051 --> 01:56:16,969
- Deteсtive Frazier.
- Mr. Case.

1790
01:56:17,179 --> 01:56:19,138
- How are you?
- I am great.

1791
01:56:19,556 --> 01:56:22,975
Nobody got killed at the bank.
Everybody's happy. My kind of day.

1792
01:56:23,060 --> 01:56:25,019
That's wonderful. Wonderful.

1793
01:56:25,103 --> 01:56:26,812
- Deteсtive Mitchell.
- Mr. Case.

1794
01:56:26,897 --> 01:56:28,856
- Be seated, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

1795
01:56:28,940 --> 01:56:31,233
- Can I offer you anything?
- No.

1796
01:56:31,318 --> 01:56:32,902
I must say

1797
01:56:33,278 --> 01:56:35,738
I was most impressed

1798
01:56:36,907 --> 01:56:38,783
by the way you handled
that business.

1799
01:56:38,867 --> 01:56:40,159
Thank you, Mr. Case.

1800
01:56:40,243 --> 01:56:42,161
Whenever I hear the term
"New York's Finest"

1801
01:56:42,245 --> 01:56:43,996
you're who I think of.

1802
01:56:44,081 --> 01:56:47,333
You keep the rest of us
safe and make it look easy.

1803
01:56:49,628 --> 01:56:52,004
- Pardon me.
- Well, what's so amusing?

1804
01:56:52,089 --> 01:56:55,007
When you say "the rest of us," Mr.
Case, I mean, you got to look around.

1805
01:56:55,092 --> 01:56:59,178
"The rest of us" is a category that you
haven't qualified for in a long time.

1806
01:56:59,262 --> 01:57:01,972
Touché, Detective. I won't deny it.
I've done well.

1807
01:57:02,057 --> 01:57:04,183
Yes, you have. But
I'm very confused.

1808
01:57:04,267 --> 01:57:06,060
You see, I got a case

1809
01:57:06,770 --> 01:57:09,730
where armed robbers laid
siege to your bank.

1810
01:57:09,815 --> 01:57:11,148
It is your bank, right?

1811
01:57:11,233 --> 01:57:13,109
Well, I'm Chairman of
the Board of Directors.

1812
01:57:13,193 --> 01:57:14,860
Then...

1813
01:57:14,945 --> 01:57:16,904
The robbers disappear. Poof.

1814
01:57:17,239 --> 01:57:18,679
And they don't take
a nickel, right?

1815
01:57:18,699 --> 01:57:21,033
- You're asking me?
- Yes, I'm asking you.

1816
01:57:21,118 --> 01:57:23,285
I mean, it's your bank. You own it.
I'm asking you.

1817
01:57:23,370 --> 01:57:25,246
It's a tiny part of
our organization.

1818
01:57:25,330 --> 01:57:27,456
No robbers. No real viсtims.
No loot missing.

1819
01:57:27,541 --> 01:57:29,625
It's got to be the first time
in law-enforcement history.

1820
01:57:29,710 --> 01:57:30,876
I never heard of it before.

1821
01:57:30,961 --> 01:57:34,004
So, you got to ask yourself, "What the
fuck happened?" Don't you, Mr. Case?

1822
01:57:34,089 --> 01:57:35,715
I'm not quite sure I
like your tone, Officer.

1823
01:57:35,799 --> 01:57:38,134
You don't like my tone? Then
give me a straight answer.

1824
01:57:38,218 --> 01:57:42,054
It's the founding bank of your empire.
You built it. It's your baby.

1825
01:57:42,139 --> 01:57:44,259
Give me a straight answer.
What do you think happened?

1826
01:57:44,266 --> 01:57:47,893
- I have no idea.
- Oh, come on, now. Come on.

1827
01:57:47,978 --> 01:57:49,418
I'll tell you what
I think happened.

1828
01:57:49,479 --> 01:57:51,680
I think you sent that woman
in there to patch things up.

1829
01:57:51,690 --> 01:57:54,233
Miss White. I think you paid her.
What was she doing in there?

1830
01:57:54,317 --> 01:57:55,776
Look, this is absurd.

1831
01:57:55,861 --> 01:57:57,861
Are you implying that I had
anything to do with it?

1832
01:57:57,904 --> 01:57:59,530
392.

1833
01:58:00,073 --> 01:58:02,575
Safe deposit box 392.
What's the story on that?

1834
01:58:02,659 --> 01:58:05,035
- I have no idea what you're...
- Don't lie to me, Mr. Case.

1835
01:58:05,120 --> 01:58:07,580
- I don't lie.
- I looked at all the records.

1836
01:58:07,664 --> 01:58:11,250
All the bank records for safe
deposit boxes at your bank.

1837
01:58:11,418 --> 01:58:14,128
At first glance,
everything looked fine,

1838
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:17,214
but there was one safe deposit
box that had no records.

1839
01:58:17,299 --> 01:58:19,258
I mean, going all the
way back to 1948.

1840
01:58:19,342 --> 01:58:22,470
So I started thinking. Who would
have the answer to this riddle?

1841
01:58:22,554 --> 01:58:24,430
Probably the man who
forgot to mention

1842
01:58:24,514 --> 01:58:26,807
that he built the bank in
the first place in 1948.

1843
01:58:26,892 --> 01:58:29,643
It doesn't add up, Mr. Case.
It does not add up.

1844
01:58:30,687 --> 01:58:35,024
I'm afraid I can't be of any
further use to you, Detective.

1845
01:58:36,151 --> 01:58:38,694
It's something really
bad, isn't it?

1846
01:58:39,362 --> 01:58:44,033
Mr. Frazier, I have spent my
whole life serving humanity.

1847
01:58:45,452 --> 01:58:47,536
You can ask anyone who knows me.

1848
01:58:48,789 --> 01:58:51,791
They'll vouch for me, and for
the things that I've done.

1849
01:58:51,875 --> 01:58:54,919
You think they'll vouch for you after
I find out the truth about this ring?

1850
01:58:55,003 --> 01:58:56,378
I don't think so.

1851
01:59:01,051 --> 01:59:04,094
Oh, by the way, that thing you said
about us being New York's finest?

1852
01:59:04,179 --> 01:59:06,806
I want you to know, we
really appreciate that.

1853
01:59:07,432 --> 01:59:08,766
How gracious.

1854
01:59:09,601 --> 01:59:12,269
Let's go. We're gonna
follow that ring.

1855
01:59:19,277 --> 01:59:21,821
- Hey, Keith, let me see your shoe.
- What?

1856
01:59:21,905 --> 01:59:24,323
- Let me see your shoe.
- Why?

1857
01:59:24,407 --> 01:59:27,618
'Cause I have never seen anybody put
their foot that far up a guy's ass.

1858
01:59:30,539 --> 01:59:32,206
Yeah, I guess I did, didn't I?

1859
01:59:32,290 --> 01:59:34,875
Oh, man. You cut him an ass the
length of the Lincoln Tunnel.

1860
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:37,294
We're gonna need a traffic
cop on that shit.

1861
01:59:46,221 --> 01:59:47,388
Good afternoon, sir.

1862
01:59:47,472 --> 01:59:49,348
- Do you have a reservation?
- Looking for the Mayor.

1863
01:59:49,432 --> 01:59:51,433
- May I have your hat, please?
- No, you cannot. Get your own.

1864
01:59:51,518 --> 01:59:54,103
They're looking to invest
$4 billion over the next four years.

1865
01:59:54,187 --> 01:59:55,312
And that's all in place.

1866
01:59:55,438 --> 01:59:58,357
Sorry to interrupt you, Mr. Mayor,
but there's an old American saying,

1867
01:59:58,441 --> 02:00:02,236
"When there's blood on the streets,
somebody's got to go to jail."

1868
02:00:02,904 --> 02:00:05,948
Edwin, could you please
excuse us for a minute?

1869
02:00:07,993 --> 02:00:09,577
What's this about, Detective?

1870
02:00:09,661 --> 02:00:13,205
I believe Deteсtive Frazier
is looking for some closure?

1871
02:00:13,540 --> 02:00:15,791
That's a good word. Closure.

1872
02:00:15,876 --> 02:00:18,460
Case closed, you
know what I mean?

1873
02:00:18,545 --> 02:00:19,879
This is the number

1874
02:00:19,963 --> 02:00:24,008
of the War Crimes Issues
office in Washington, D.C.

1875
02:00:25,635 --> 02:00:28,220
How'd you like to be on the front
page of the New York Times?

1876
02:00:28,305 --> 02:00:29,430
That'd be great.

1877
02:00:29,514 --> 02:00:32,850
Make sure they spell my name right, though.
That's Frazier with a "z".

1878
02:00:33,977 --> 02:00:35,519
You can keep the pen.

1879
02:00:36,229 --> 02:00:37,730
You made copies?

1880
02:00:39,316 --> 02:00:40,524
Please.

1881
02:00:40,984 --> 02:00:44,361
We got to keep the real criminals
off the streets, Your Honor.

1882
02:00:45,822 --> 02:00:48,490
All right, well,
thanks for lunch.

1883
02:00:52,871 --> 02:00:54,455
War crimes, huh?

1884
02:00:55,248 --> 02:00:57,499
What have you got
me into this time?

1885
02:01:17,062 --> 02:01:18,187
Mama?

1886
02:01:22,859 --> 02:01:25,611
- Did you bring Big Willie?
- And the twins.

1887
02:01:39,250 --> 02:01:40,501
Slow down, girl.

1888
02:01:40,585 --> 02:01:42,962
I'll get my gun off before
I get my gun off, okay?

1889
02:01:43,046 --> 02:01:44,296
Pow, pow.

1890
02:02:26,256 --> 02:02:27,965
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

1891
02:02:28,717 --> 02:02:30,259
<i>Why don't you
just walk out the door?</i>

1892
02:02:30,343 --> 02:02:31,677
<i>I will.</i>

1893
02:02:31,761 --> 02:02:34,638
<i>I'm gonna walk out of that
door when I'm good and ready.</i>

1894
02:02:34,723 --> 02:02:36,015
Son of a bitch.

1895
02:02:43,398 --> 02:02:46,275
Come on, honey.
The handcuffs are getting cold.
