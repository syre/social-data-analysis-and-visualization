1
00:00:32,672 --> 00:00:36,634
I need a father who's a role model,
not some horny geek boy...

2
00:00:36,718 --> 00:00:41,389
who's going to spray his shorts whenever
I bring a girlfriend home from school.

3
00:00:42,974 --> 00:00:45,393
What a lame-o.

4
00:00:47,687 --> 00:00:51,733
Someone really should just put him
out of his misery.

5
00:00:54,027 --> 00:00:57,238
<i>You want me to kill him for you?</i>

6
00:01:04,245 --> 00:01:06,748
Yeah. Would you?

7
00:01:19,427 --> 00:01:22,555
<i>My name is Lester Burnham.</i>

8
00:01:22,639 --> 00:01:25,808
<i>This is my neighborhood.</i>

9
00:01:25,892 --> 00:01:28,811
<i>This is my street.</i>

10
00:01:28,895 --> 00:01:31,731
<i>This is my life.</i>

11
00:01:31,814 --> 00:01:36,819
<i>I'm 42 years old.</i>
<i>In less than a year, I'll be dead.</i>

12
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:47,163
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>I don't know that yet.</i>

13
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:54,754
<i>And in a way,</i>
<i>I'm dead already.</i>

14
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:08,059
<i>Look at me:</i>
<i>jerking off in the shower.</i>

15
00:02:09,644 --> 00:02:14,941
<i>This will be the high point of my day.</i>
<i>It's all downhill from here.</i>

16
00:02:19,445 --> 00:02:22,574
<i>That's my wife, Carolyn.</i>

17
00:02:22,657 --> 00:02:27,662
<i>See the way the handle on those pruning</i>
<i>shears matches her gardening clogs?</i>

18
00:02:27,745 --> 00:02:30,790
<i>That's not an accident.</i>

19
00:02:30,874 --> 00:02:33,418
<i>Hush, Bitsy!</i>

20
00:02:33,501 --> 00:02:37,380
- Hush. What is wrong with you?
- <i>That's our next-door neighbor, Jim.</i>

21
00:02:37,463 --> 00:02:41,384
<i>And that's his lover, Jim.</i>

22
00:02:41,467 --> 00:02:44,929
- You spoil her. Bitsy, no bark. Come inside now.
- Me?

23
00:02:45,013 --> 00:02:47,974
- <i>Come on. Yes. Inside.</i>
- <i>Good morning, Jim!</i>

24
00:02:48,057 --> 00:02:50,226
Good morning, Carolyn.

25
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,522
I love your tie!
That color!

26
00:02:54,606 --> 00:02:59,110
I just love your roses. How do you
get them to flourish like this?

27
00:02:59,194 --> 00:03:02,906
Well, I'll tell you:
eggshells and Miracle-Gro.

28
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:07,493
- I've never heard that.
- <i>Man, I get exhausted just watching her.</i>

29
00:03:07,577 --> 00:03:11,664
<i>She wasn't always like this.</i>
<i>She used to be happy.</i>

30
00:03:14,167 --> 00:03:17,462
We <i>used to be happy.</i>

31
00:03:17,545 --> 00:03:21,716
<i>My daughter Jane.</i>
<i>Only child.</i>

32
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:27,472
<i>Janie's a pretty typical teenager:</i>

33
00:03:27,555 --> 00:03:31,809
<i>angry, insecure, confused.</i>

34
00:03:31,893 --> 00:03:37,106
<i>I wish I could tell her that's all going</i>
<i>to pass, but I don't want to lie to her.</i>

35
00:03:40,985 --> 00:03:44,197
Jane, honey, are you trying
to look unattractive?

36
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,451
- Yes.
- Congratulations. You've succeeded admirably.

37
00:03:48,535 --> 00:03:52,997
Lester, could you make me a little later,
please, because I'm not quite late enough.

38
00:03:56,251 --> 00:03:58,670
Nice going, Dad.

39
00:03:58,753 --> 00:04:03,007
<i>Both my wife and</i>
<i>daughter think I'm this gigantic loser.</i>

40
00:04:03,091 --> 00:04:06,052
<i>And they're right.</i>

41
00:04:06,135 --> 00:04:09,514
<i>I have lost something.</i>

42
00:04:09,597 --> 00:04:12,684
<i>I'm not exactly sure</i>
<i>what it is,</i>

43
00:04:12,767 --> 00:04:16,312
<i>but I know</i>
<i>I didn't always feel this...</i>

44
00:04:16,396 --> 00:04:18,314
<i>sedated.</i>

45
00:04:18,398 --> 00:04:21,109
<i>But you know what?</i>

46
00:04:21,192 --> 00:04:25,697
<i>It's never too late</i>
<i>to get it back.</i>

47
00:04:25,822 --> 00:04:29,075
Hello. This is Lester Burnham
from <i>Media Monthly</i> magazine.

48
00:04:29,158 --> 00:04:32,203
I'm calling
for Mr. Tamblin, please.

49
00:04:32,287 --> 00:04:35,874
Well, we're all under a deadline here.
You see, there's some basic information...

50
00:04:35,957 --> 00:04:40,378
about your product launch that isn't even
covered in your press release, and I'd...

51
00:04:40,461 --> 00:04:43,339
Yeah, c...
can I ask you a question?

52
00:04:43,423 --> 00:04:47,886
Who is Tamblin? Does he exist?
'Cause he doesn't ever seem to come in.

53
00:04:47,969 --> 00:04:50,763
Yeah. Okay.
I'll leave my number.

54
00:04:50,847 --> 00:04:55,268
<i>It's 555-0199.</i>

55
00:04:55,351 --> 00:04:58,897
Lester Burnham.
Thank you!

56
00:05:00,356 --> 00:05:04,444
Hey, Les.
You got a minute?

57
00:05:04,527 --> 00:05:08,239
For you, Brad,
I got five!

58
00:05:08,323 --> 00:05:12,785
So, yeah, I'm sure you can understand
our need to cut corners around here.

59
00:05:12,869 --> 00:05:14,996
Oh, sure.
Times are tight.

60
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:18,458
You got to free up some cash.
You got to spend money to make money.

61
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:21,419
- <i>Right?</i>
- Exactly.

62
00:05:21,502 --> 00:05:25,423
<i>Like the time that Mr. Flournoy used the
company MasterCard to pay for that hooker,</i>

63
00:05:25,506 --> 00:05:29,636
and she used the card numbers and stayed at
the St. Regis for, what was it, three months?

64
00:05:29,719 --> 00:05:33,765
- That's unsubstantiated gossip.
- That's $50,000. That's somebody's salary.

65
00:05:33,848 --> 00:05:36,935
That's somebody who's going to get fired
because Craig has to pay women to fuck him!

66
00:05:37,018 --> 00:05:39,020
<i>Jesus!</i>

67
00:05:39,103 --> 00:05:42,774
I mean, calm down.
Nobody's getting fired yet.

68
00:05:42,857 --> 00:05:45,318
<i>That's why we're having everyone...</i>

69
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:49,906
write out a job description mapping
out in detail how they contribute.

70
00:05:49,989 --> 00:05:53,743
That way management
can assess who's valuable...

71
00:05:53,826 --> 00:05:56,538
And who's expendable.

72
00:05:56,621 --> 00:05:59,290
<i>It's just business.</i>

73
00:05:59,374 --> 00:06:02,627
I've been writing
for this magazine for 14 years.

74
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:06,965
- You've been here how long? A whole month?
- I'm one of the good guys, Les.

75
00:06:07,048 --> 00:06:09,884
I'm trying to level with you.

76
00:06:09,968 --> 00:06:13,471
This is your one chance
to save your job.

77
00:06:15,056 --> 00:06:17,767
<i>There is no decision.</i>
<i>You just write the damn thing.</i>

78
00:06:17,851 --> 00:06:20,854
- You don't think it's weird and kind of fascist?
- Possibly.

79
00:06:20,937 --> 00:06:22,897
- But you don't want to be unemployed.
- All right.

80
00:06:22,981 --> 00:06:25,692
Let's just all sell our souls and work for
Satan 'cause it's more convenient that way.

81
00:06:25,775 --> 00:06:28,820
Oh, could you be a little bit
more dramatic, please, huh?

82
00:06:28,903 --> 00:06:31,114
So, we finally
got new neighbors.

83
00:06:31,197 --> 00:06:35,785
<i>You know, if the Lomans had let me represent
them instead of the Real Estate King,</i>

84
00:06:35,869 --> 00:06:38,371
that house would never
have sat on the market for six months.

85
00:06:38,454 --> 00:06:41,207
Well, they were still mad at you
for cutting down their sycamore.

86
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,877
<i>Their</i> sycamore?
Come on.

87
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,671
A substantial portion of the root
structure was on our property.

88
00:06:46,754 --> 00:06:49,716
You know that.
How can you call it <i>their</i> sycamore?

89
00:06:49,799 --> 00:06:54,888
I wouldn't have the heart to just cut down something
if it wasn't partially mine, which, of course, it was.

90
00:07:04,105 --> 00:07:09,110
Mom, do we always have to listen
to this elevator music?

91
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,906
No. No, we don't.

92
00:07:12,989 --> 00:07:16,910
And as soon you've prepared a nutritious
yet savory meal that I'm about to eat,

93
00:07:16,993 --> 00:07:19,954
you can listen
to whatever you like.

94
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:26,878
So, Janie, how was school?

95
00:07:26,961 --> 00:07:29,339
It was okay.

96
00:07:29,422 --> 00:07:31,841
Just okay?

97
00:07:31,925 --> 00:07:36,012
No, Dad.
It was spectacular.

98
00:07:38,973 --> 00:07:41,893
Well, you want to know
how things went in my job today?

99
00:07:41,976 --> 00:07:44,395
They've hired
this efficiency expert,

100
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,190
this really friendly guy
named Brad...

101
00:07:47,273 --> 00:07:51,694
How perfect is that? And he's basically
there to make it seem they're justified...

102
00:07:51,778 --> 00:07:55,240
in firing somebody, because they couldn't
just come out and say that, could they?

103
00:07:55,323 --> 00:07:58,618
No, no. That would just be too honest.
So they've asked us...

104
00:07:58,701 --> 00:08:02,205
You couldn't
possibly care less, could you?

105
00:08:02,288 --> 00:08:04,415
What do you expect?

106
00:08:04,499 --> 00:08:08,753
You can't all of a sudden be my best
friend just because you had a bad day.

107
00:08:10,421 --> 00:08:14,592
I mean, hello, you've barely even
spoken to me for months.

108
00:08:20,181 --> 00:08:23,685
Oh, what?
You're "Mother of the Year"?

109
00:08:23,768 --> 00:08:27,230
You treat her like an employee.
- What?

110
00:08:29,148 --> 00:08:31,943
What?

111
00:08:32,026 --> 00:08:34,696
I'm going
to get some ice cream.

112
00:08:43,371 --> 00:08:45,331
Janie...

113
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:51,462
I'm sorry I haven't
been more available.

114
00:08:51,546 --> 00:08:53,798
I'm just... I...

115
00:08:56,092 --> 00:09:00,013
You know, you don't always
have to wait for me to come to you.

116
00:09:00,096 --> 00:09:03,141
Oh, great.
So now it's my fault?

117
00:09:03,224 --> 00:09:06,644
I didn't say that.
It's nobody's fault. It...

118
00:09:07,854 --> 00:09:11,107
Janie, what happened?
We used to be pals.

119
00:10:50,999 --> 00:10:54,043
I will sell this house today.

120
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:09,434
I will sell this house today.
I will sell this house today.

121
00:11:23,364 --> 00:11:26,367
I will sell this house today.

122
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:37,253
Welcome.
I'm Carolyn Burnham.

123
00:11:37,337 --> 00:11:40,381
This living room
is very dramatic.

124
00:11:40,465 --> 00:11:43,343
<i>Wait till you see</i>
<i>the native stone fireplace!</i>

125
00:11:43,426 --> 00:11:48,932
A simple cream could really lighten things
up. You could even put in a skylight.

126
00:11:51,684 --> 00:11:53,811
Well, why don't we
go into the kitchen?

127
00:11:53,895 --> 00:11:57,273
It's a dream come true
for any cook.

128
00:11:57,357 --> 00:12:00,693
Just filled
with positive energy, huh?

129
00:12:00,777 --> 00:12:06,282
And you'll be surprised how much a ceiling
fan can cut down on your energy costs.

130
00:12:09,244 --> 00:12:13,873
<i>You know, you could have some fun</i>
<i>backyard get-togethers out here.</i>

131
00:12:13,957 --> 00:12:17,335
The ad said this pool was lagoon-like.
There's nothing lagoon-like about it.

132
00:12:17,418 --> 00:12:21,881
Except for maybe the bugs.
There aren't even any plants out here.

133
00:12:21,965 --> 00:12:24,884
What do you call this?
Is this not a plant?

134
00:12:24,968 --> 00:12:28,388
If you have a problem with the plants, I
can always call my landscape architect.

135
00:12:28,471 --> 00:12:33,059
- Solved.
- I mean, I think "lagoon," I think waterfall, tropical.

136
00:12:33,142 --> 00:12:36,104
This is a cement hole.

137
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,148
Uh...

138
00:12:39,232 --> 00:12:42,360
I have some tiki torches
in the garage.

139
00:13:13,892 --> 00:13:17,645
Shut up! Stop it!
You weak... You baby!

140
00:13:17,729 --> 00:13:20,690
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up!

141
00:14:05,818 --> 00:14:07,946
Who are you looking for?

142
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:10,657
My parents are coming tonight.

143
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,410
They're trying to, you know,
take an active interest in me.

144
00:14:14,494 --> 00:14:17,455
Gross. I hate it
when my mom does that.

145
00:14:17,539 --> 00:14:21,543
They're such assholes. Why can't
they just have their own lives?

146
00:14:24,504 --> 00:14:28,633
What makes you sure she wants us
to be there? Did she ask us to come?

147
00:14:28,716 --> 00:14:32,095
Of course not. She doesn't want us
to know how important this is to her.

148
00:14:32,178 --> 00:14:34,305
But she's been practicing
for weeks.

149
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:38,685
I'll bet she's going to resent it, and I'm
missing the James Bond marathon on T.N.T.

150
00:14:38,768 --> 00:14:43,815
Lester, this is important. I'm sensing a
real distance growing between you and Jane.

151
00:14:43,898 --> 00:14:46,693
"Growing"?
She hates me.

152
00:14:46,776 --> 00:14:50,780
- She's just willful.
- She hates you too.

153
00:14:58,705 --> 00:15:01,791
- Excuse me. Sorry. I'm sorry.
- Pardon me.

154
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,335
Hi! Patty!

155
00:15:04,419 --> 00:15:07,380
<i>Now, for your halftime entertainment,</i>

156
00:15:07,463 --> 00:15:11,801
<i>Rockwell High's award-winning</i>
<i>Dancing Spartanettes!</i>

157
00:15:11,885 --> 00:15:14,512
We can leave
right after this, right?

158
00:17:28,062 --> 00:17:30,648
Shit. They're still here.

159
00:17:30,732 --> 00:17:32,817
Janie!

160
00:17:32,901 --> 00:17:35,111
Hey, I really enjoyed that.

161
00:17:35,195 --> 00:17:38,156
- Congratulations, honey. You were great.
- <i>I didn't win anything.</i>

162
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:41,910
- Hi. I'm Lester, Janie's dad.
- Oh, hi.

163
00:17:44,537 --> 00:17:47,165
This is my friend,
Angela Hayes.

164
00:17:47,248 --> 00:17:50,627
Okay. Good to meet you.

165
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:56,007
<i>You were also good tonight,</i>
<i>very... precise.</i>

166
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:59,010
- Thanks.
- Nice to meet you, Angela.

167
00:17:59,093 --> 00:18:01,804
Honey...
I am so proud of you.

168
00:18:01,888 --> 00:18:05,683
You know, I watched you very closely.
You didn't screw up once.

169
00:18:06,768 --> 00:18:09,938
Okay, uh, we have to go.

170
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:12,565
- So what are you girls doing now?
- Dad.

171
00:18:12,649 --> 00:18:15,902
- We're going out for pizza.
- Really? Do you need a ride? We can give you a ride.

172
00:18:15,985 --> 00:18:19,697
- I have a car. You want to come with us?
- Thanks, but I have a car.

173
00:18:19,781 --> 00:18:23,576
You <i>have</i> a car.
That's great. That's great.

174
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,538
Janie's thinking about
getting a car, too, soon, aren't you?

175
00:18:26,621 --> 00:18:29,958
Dad, Mom's waiting for you.

176
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,546
Well, it was very nice
meeting you, Angela.

177
00:18:34,629 --> 00:18:37,090
<i>Any friend of Janie's...</i>

178
00:18:37,173 --> 00:18:41,678
<i>is a... friend of mine.</i>

179
00:18:44,848 --> 00:18:48,810
Well... I'll be
seeing you around, then.

180
00:18:52,647 --> 00:18:57,277
Could he be any more...
pathetic?

181
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,321
I think he's sweet.

182
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:05,618
And I think he and your mother
have not had sex in a long time.

183
00:19:22,093 --> 00:19:25,180
<i>It's the weirdest thing.</i>

184
00:19:25,263 --> 00:19:28,725
<i>I feel like I've been in a coma</i>
<i>for about 20 years...</i>

185
00:19:28,808 --> 00:19:31,978
<i>and I'm just now waking up.</i>

186
00:20:02,342 --> 00:20:05,720
<i>Spec-tacular.</i>

187
00:20:14,562 --> 00:20:17,941
I'm so sorry
my dad was weird tonight.

188
00:20:19,901 --> 00:20:21,861
That's okay.

189
00:20:21,945 --> 00:20:24,280
I'm used to guys
drooling over me.

190
00:20:25,365 --> 00:20:27,825
It started
when I was about 12.

191
00:20:27,909 --> 00:20:30,995
I'd go to dinner
with my parents.

192
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:34,207
Every Thursday night: Red Lobster.

193
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:37,252
Every guy there would stare at me
when I walked in.

194
00:20:37,335 --> 00:20:39,504
And I knew
what they were thinking,

195
00:20:39,587 --> 00:20:43,508
just like I knew guys at school thought
about me when they jerked off.

196
00:20:43,591 --> 00:20:46,344
- Vomit.
- No. I liked it.

197
00:20:46,427 --> 00:20:51,015
I still like it. If people I don't even
know look at me and want to fuck me,

198
00:20:51,099 --> 00:20:55,270
it means I really have a shot
at being a model.

199
00:20:55,353 --> 00:20:57,647
Which is great,

200
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:01,776
because there's nothing worse in life
than being ordinary.

201
00:21:06,072 --> 00:21:08,491
I really think
it'll happen for you.

202
00:21:09,576 --> 00:21:11,494
I know.

203
00:21:11,578 --> 00:21:16,249
Because everything that was meant
to happen, does... eventually.

204
00:21:40,857 --> 00:21:43,401
Asshole.

205
00:22:48,591 --> 00:22:52,053
Hello? Hello?

206
00:23:08,278 --> 00:23:10,530
- Hello?
- Why'd you call me?

207
00:23:10,613 --> 00:23:12,532
I didn't.

208
00:23:12,615 --> 00:23:15,159
Well, my phone just rang and
I answered it, and somebody hung up.

209
00:23:15,243 --> 00:23:19,873
- And I star-69'ed, and I called you
back. - Well, I was in the shower.

210
00:23:23,751 --> 00:23:25,879
Oh, gross!

211
00:23:41,728 --> 00:23:44,355
<i>Ricky! Breakfast!</i>

212
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:48,443
Be right there.

213
00:23:56,659 --> 00:23:58,536
- Mom.
- Hello.

214
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,956
I don't eat bacon, remember?

215
00:24:03,124 --> 00:24:06,085
I'm sorry.
I must've forgotten.

216
00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:19,140
What's new in the world, Dad?

217
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:23,019
This country
is going straight to hell.

218
00:24:30,026 --> 00:24:32,904
- Are you expecting anyone?
- No.

219
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:38,243
No.

220
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:47,252
- Hi.
- Welcome to the neighborhood.

221
00:24:47,335 --> 00:24:49,546
- It's just a little something from our garden.
- Except for the pasta.

222
00:24:49,629 --> 00:24:52,257
- We got that at Fallaci's.
- Right. It's unbelievably fresh.

223
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:55,927
You just... You drop it
in the water, and it's done.

224
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:59,848
Jim Olmeyer. Two doors down.
Welcome to the neighborhood.

225
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:02,267
Colonel Frank Fitts,
U.S. Marine Corps.

226
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:05,979
- It's nice to meet you. This is my partner...
- Jim Berkley, but call me J.B.

227
00:25:06,062 --> 00:25:09,357
Let's cut to chase, okay?
What are you guys selling?

228
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,528
- We...
- Nothing. We just wanted to say hi to our new neighbors.

229
00:25:13,611 --> 00:25:19,158
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You said you're
partners, so what's your business?

230
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:24,789
Well... he is a tax attorney.

231
00:25:24,873 --> 00:25:27,876
And he's an anesthesiologist.

232
00:25:36,551 --> 00:25:41,014
How come these faggots
always have to rub it in your face?

233
00:25:41,097 --> 00:25:44,184
How can they
be so shameless?

234
00:25:45,643 --> 00:25:48,855
That's the whole thing, Dad.

235
00:25:48,938 --> 00:25:52,233
They don't feel that's anything
to be ashamed of.

236
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:55,862
Well, it is.

237
00:25:57,572 --> 00:26:01,910
- Yeah, you're right.
- Don't placate me like I'm your mother, boy.

238
00:26:04,871 --> 00:26:07,707
Forgive me, sir,
for speaking so bluntly,

239
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:10,835
but those fags make me want
to puke my fucking guts out.

240
00:26:18,593 --> 00:26:23,765
Well, me too, son.
Yeah. Me too.

241
00:26:28,811 --> 00:26:32,774
<i>I'm serious. He just</i>
<i>pulled down his pants and yanked it out.</i>

242
00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:36,528
- <i>You know, like, "Say hello to Mr. Happy."</i>
- Gross!

243
00:26:36,611 --> 00:26:41,449
- It wasn't gross. It was kind of cool.
- So did you do it with him?

244
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:45,870
<i>Of course. He's a really</i>
<i>well-known photographer.</i>

245
00:26:45,954 --> 00:26:48,706
He shoots for <i>Elle</i> on,
like, a regular basis.

246
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:53,545
- It would've been majorly stupid of me to turn him down.
- You are a total prostitute.

247
00:26:53,628 --> 00:26:57,757
Hey, that's how
things really are.

248
00:26:57,841 --> 00:27:01,678
You just don't know because you're
this pampered little suburban chick.

249
00:27:01,761 --> 00:27:05,348
<i>So are you. You've only been</i>
<i>in</i> Seventeen <i>once, and you looked fat.</i>

250
00:27:05,431 --> 00:27:09,102
So stop acting like you're
goddamn Christy Turlington!

251
00:27:11,437 --> 00:27:13,356
Cunt!

252
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:18,319
I am so sick of people
taking their insecurities out on me.

253
00:27:20,029 --> 00:27:24,325
- <i>Oh, my God. That's the pervert who filmed me last night.</i>
- Him?

254
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:27,453
<i>Jane. No way.</i>
<i>He's a total lunatic.</i>

255
00:27:27,537 --> 00:27:29,455
- Do you know him?
- Yeah.

256
00:27:29,539 --> 00:27:31,749
We were on the same lunch shift
when I was in ninth grade,

257
00:27:31,833 --> 00:27:35,378
and he would always save
the most random, weird things.

258
00:27:35,461 --> 00:27:39,841
And then one day,
he was just, like, gone.

259
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:45,763
And then Connie Cardullo told me that his
parents had to put him in a mental institution.

260
00:27:45,847 --> 00:27:47,974
Why? What did he do?

261
00:27:48,057 --> 00:27:50,935
What do you mean?

262
00:27:51,019 --> 00:27:55,148
Well, they can't put you away
just for saying weird things.

263
00:27:57,567 --> 00:28:02,697
You total slut.
You've got a crush on him.

264
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,575
- What? Please!
- You are defending him. You love him.

265
00:28:05,658 --> 00:28:08,953
- You want to have, like, 10,000 of his babies.
- Shut up.

266
00:28:09,037 --> 00:28:13,291
<i>Hi. My name's Ricky.</i>
<i>I just moved next door to you.</i>

267
00:28:13,374 --> 00:28:15,418
I know.

268
00:28:15,501 --> 00:28:19,631
I kind of remember this creepy incident
where you were filming me last night?

269
00:28:19,714 --> 00:28:23,801
- I didn't mean to scare you. I just think you're interesting.
- <i>Thanks.</i>

270
00:28:23,885 --> 00:28:28,515
But I really don't need to have some
psycho obsessing about me right now.

271
00:28:29,557 --> 00:28:33,561
I'm not obsessing.
I'm just curious.

272
00:28:48,701 --> 00:28:50,662
What a freak.

273
00:28:50,745 --> 00:28:54,040
And why does he dress
like a Bible salesman?

274
00:28:54,123 --> 00:28:57,252
He's, like, so confident.

275
00:28:57,335 --> 00:29:00,380
<i>That can't be real.</i>

276
00:29:00,463 --> 00:29:03,007
I don't believe him.

277
00:29:03,091 --> 00:29:07,178
I mean, he didn't even,
like, look at me once.

278
00:29:12,308 --> 00:29:16,396
- <i>How'd you get in the Army?</i>
- <i>Sergeant, I got three reasons for being in the Army.</i>

279
00:29:16,479 --> 00:29:20,525
First, I'm patriotic. Second, I love
my country. And third, they nailed me.

280
00:29:34,956 --> 00:29:36,875
Hey.

281
00:29:39,961 --> 00:29:43,631
- What's going on here?
- Bend all the way down. Here comes the Bull of the Woods.

282
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:49,137
I'm sorry. What?

283
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:52,599
Mom, nobody said anything.

284
00:29:52,682 --> 00:29:55,143
Oh. I'm sorry.

285
00:30:01,649 --> 00:30:03,693
Everyone here is with their spouse
or significant other.

286
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:06,821
- How would it look if I showed up with no one?
- You always end up ignoring me.

287
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:10,408
Now, listen to me.
This is an important business function.

288
00:30:10,491 --> 00:30:13,661
As you know, my business
is selling an image,

289
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:16,080
and part of my job
is to live that image.

290
00:30:16,164 --> 00:30:20,627
Honey, do me a favor and say whatever you
want to say and spare me the propaganda.

291
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:23,630
All right.
Hi, Shirley!

292
00:30:25,173 --> 00:30:28,051
Listen. Just do me a favor.
Act happy tonight.

293
00:30:28,134 --> 00:30:32,931
- I am happy, honey!
- You're not... Oh, that's Buddy!

294
00:30:33,014 --> 00:30:36,476
- <i>Buddy! Buddy! Hi!</i>
- Hi.

295
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,020
Good to see you again.

296
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:42,607
- It's so good to see you too, Catherine.
- Carolyn.

297
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:45,652
Oh, Carolyn! Of course.
How are you?

298
00:30:45,735 --> 00:30:49,697
- Very well, thank you. Hello, Christy.
- Hello.

299
00:30:50,865 --> 00:30:53,743
- My husband, Lester.
- It's a pleasure.

300
00:30:53,826 --> 00:30:58,957
Oh, we've met before, actually. This
thing last year. Christmas at the Sheraton.

301
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,292
Oh, yeah!

302
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:04,504
Oh, it's okay.
I wouldn't remember me either.

303
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:11,052
Honey, don't be weird.

304
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:13,972
- All right, honey. I won't be weird.
- Okay.

305
00:31:14,055 --> 00:31:17,308
I'll be whatever
you want me to be.

306
00:31:17,392 --> 00:31:19,894
Well, oka...

307
00:31:29,737 --> 00:31:33,825
- We have a very healthy relationship.
- I see.

308
00:31:37,245 --> 00:31:40,373
Well, I don't know about you guys,
but I need a drink.

309
00:31:40,456 --> 00:31:43,167
Ohh.

310
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:48,756
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Put a little more in there, cowboy.

311
00:32:04,606 --> 00:32:09,903
<i>Excuse me. Don't you live on Robin Hood</i>
<i>Trail? The house with the red door?</i>

312
00:32:09,986 --> 00:32:14,908
- Yeah.
- I'm Ricky Fitts. I just moved in the house next to you.

313
00:32:14,991 --> 00:32:19,245
Oh. Hi, Ricky Fitts.
I'm Lester Burnham.

314
00:32:19,329 --> 00:32:21,873
Hi, Lester Burnham.

315
00:32:31,966 --> 00:32:35,386
- Do you party?
- Excuse me?

316
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:38,681
Do you get high?

317
00:32:41,226 --> 00:32:45,980
You know, I probably wouldn't even tell
you this if I weren't a little tipsy, but...

318
00:32:47,482 --> 00:32:50,318
I'm in complete awe of you.

319
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:52,820
I mean, your firm...

320
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:56,908
is hands-down the Rolls-Royce
of local real estate firms,

321
00:32:56,991 --> 00:33:00,495
and your personal
sales record is...

322
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:04,624
It's very intimidating.

323
00:33:04,707 --> 00:33:09,712
You know, I'd love to sit down
with you and just pick your brain,

324
00:33:09,796 --> 00:33:12,674
if you'd ever be willing.

325
00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:17,762
You know, I suppose technically
I'm the competition,

326
00:33:17,846 --> 00:33:21,558
but I mean, hey,
I don't flatter myself...

327
00:33:21,641 --> 00:33:25,144
that I'm even
in the same league as you.

328
00:33:25,228 --> 00:33:27,438
I don't.

329
00:33:27,522 --> 00:33:29,482
I'd love to.

330
00:33:31,067 --> 00:33:33,987
- Really?
- Absolutely.

331
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:37,365
Call my secretary.
Have her schedule a lunch.

332
00:33:38,908 --> 00:33:41,703
I'll do that.
Thank you.

333
00:33:47,876 --> 00:33:51,379
Did you ever see that movie
where the body is walking around...

334
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:54,674
carrying its own head, and then
the head goes down on that babe?

335
00:33:54,757 --> 00:33:57,635
<i>Re-Animator.</i>

336
00:33:59,888 --> 00:34:01,848
Look.

337
00:34:01,931 --> 00:34:05,310
I'm not paying you to do whatever
it is you're doing out here.

338
00:34:05,393 --> 00:34:08,313
Fine. So don't pay me.

339
00:34:08,396 --> 00:34:10,481
Excuse me?

340
00:34:10,565 --> 00:34:15,486
I quit, so you don't have
to pay me. Now leave me alone.

341
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:19,991
Asshole.

342
00:34:24,621 --> 00:34:27,832
I think you just
became my personal hero.

343
00:34:27,916 --> 00:34:31,377
Doesn't that make you nervous,
just quitting your job like that?

344
00:34:33,087 --> 00:34:36,299
Well, I guess when
you're all of, what, 16...

345
00:34:36,382 --> 00:34:40,845
Eighteen. I just do
these gigs as a cover.

346
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:44,015
I have other sources of income.

347
00:34:44,098 --> 00:34:46,726
But my dad interferes less
in my life when I pretend...

348
00:34:46,809 --> 00:34:50,146
to be an upstanding young citizen
with a respectable job.

349
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:52,315
Lester?

350
00:34:55,151 --> 00:34:59,364
- What are you doing?
- Honey, this is... Ricky Fitts.

351
00:34:59,447 --> 00:35:03,284
This is Ricky Fitts.

352
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:08,706
I'm Ricky Fitts. I just moved
into the house next to you.

353
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:11,793
I go to school
with your daughter.

354
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:14,504
- With Jane?
- Yeah.

355
00:35:14,587 --> 00:35:17,298
- Really?
- Jane.

356
00:35:17,382 --> 00:35:21,970
Hi. I'm ready to go.
I'll meet you out front.

357
00:35:26,015 --> 00:35:29,978
Oh, I'm in trouble.

358
00:35:31,354 --> 00:35:34,440
Nice meeting you, Ricky.
Thanks for the thing.

359
00:35:34,524 --> 00:35:37,402
Anytime. Lester?

360
00:35:37,485 --> 00:35:41,072
If you want any more,
you know where I live.

361
00:35:54,502 --> 00:35:58,882
Oh, shit. They're home. Quick.
Let's go up to my room.

362
00:35:58,965 --> 00:36:01,426
I should say hi
to your dad.

363
00:36:01,509 --> 00:36:04,637
I don't want to be rude.

364
00:36:16,357 --> 00:36:18,568
Nice suit.

365
00:36:19,694 --> 00:36:21,696
You're looking good,
Mr. Burnham.

366
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:25,533
Last time I saw you,
you looked kind of wound up.

367
00:36:29,245 --> 00:36:31,539
Ooh, is that root beer?

368
00:37:31,099 --> 00:37:33,184
I love root beer,
don't you?

369
00:37:35,645 --> 00:37:37,564
- Hey.
- Hi, Mom.

370
00:37:37,647 --> 00:37:39,858
- Hi.
- Remember Angela?

371
00:37:39,941 --> 00:37:42,026
Yes, of course.

372
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:45,864
I forgot to tell you. She's going
to spend the night. Is that okay?

373
00:37:53,788 --> 00:37:57,375
- <i>Sorry about my dad.</i>
- <i>Don't be. I think it's funny.</i>

374
00:37:57,458 --> 00:38:02,505
Yeah, to you he's just another guy
who wants to jump your bones.

375
00:38:02,589 --> 00:38:07,427
But to me, he's just...
too embarrassing to live.

376
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:12,640
Well, your mom's the one
who's embarrassing. What a phony.

377
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:15,977
- But your dad's actually kind of cute.
- <i>Shut up.</i>

378
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:19,814
<i>He is. If he just</i>
<i>worked out a little, he'd be hot.</i>

379
00:38:19,898 --> 00:38:21,858
- Shut up!
- Come on.

380
00:38:21,941 --> 00:38:26,821
Like you've never sneaked a peek at him in
his underwear? I bet he's got a big dick.

381
00:38:26,905 --> 00:38:29,240
<i>You are so grossing me out right now.</i>

382
00:38:29,324 --> 00:38:32,577
<i>If he built up his chest</i>
<i>and arms, I would totally fuck him.</i>

383
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:36,915
I would. I would suck
your dad's big fat dick,

384
00:38:36,998 --> 00:38:40,084
and then I'd fuck him until
his eyes rolled back in his head.

385
00:38:40,168 --> 00:38:43,838
Jane, shh. What was that noise?

386
00:38:46,508 --> 00:38:49,177
- I swear I heard something.
- Yeah.

387
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,222
That was the sound of you
being a huge, disgusting pig.

388
00:38:52,305 --> 00:38:54,766
No, I'm serious.

389
00:38:54,849 --> 00:38:57,602
See?

390
00:38:57,685 --> 00:39:00,980
- Oh, my God. Jane.
- <i>What is it?</i>

391
00:39:04,067 --> 00:39:07,487
<i>It's that psycho next door.</i>

392
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:09,739
Jane, what if he worships you?

393
00:39:09,822 --> 00:39:14,953
What if he's got a shrine with pictures of you
surrounded by dead people's heads and stuff?

394
00:39:15,036 --> 00:39:18,498
Shit. I bet
he's filming us right now.

395
00:39:18,581 --> 00:39:20,542
Really?

396
00:40:51,132 --> 00:40:55,053
Welcome to
<i>America's Weirdest Home Videos.</i>

397
00:41:19,494 --> 00:41:22,705
<i>Ricky?</i>

398
00:41:22,789 --> 00:41:25,124
Coming, Dad.

399
00:41:25,208 --> 00:41:28,753
<i>You know I don't like</i>
<i>locked doors in my house, boy.</i>

400
00:41:34,342 --> 00:41:37,929
- I'm sorry. I must've locked it by accident.
- Mm.

401
00:41:39,013 --> 00:41:41,641
So what's up?

402
00:41:43,726 --> 00:41:46,479
I... I need a urine sample.

403
00:41:46,563 --> 00:41:48,481
Wow.

404
00:41:48,565 --> 00:41:51,276
It's been six months already.

405
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:54,445
Can I give it to you in the morning?
I just took a whiz.

406
00:41:54,529 --> 00:41:56,656
Yeah. I suppose.

407
00:42:00,577 --> 00:42:03,371
Y-You know...

408
00:42:10,879 --> 00:42:14,716
Well, good night, son.

409
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:23,076
I've been waiting for you.

410
00:43:43,847 --> 00:43:46,391
You've been working out,
haven't you?

411
00:43:46,474 --> 00:43:48,643
I can tell.

412
00:43:50,144 --> 00:43:53,231
I was hoping you could
give me a bath.

413
00:43:53,314 --> 00:43:55,859
I'm very, very dirty.

414
00:44:28,808 --> 00:44:31,060
What are you doing?

415
00:44:32,395 --> 00:44:34,439
Nothing.

416
00:44:34,522 --> 00:44:37,108
- You were masturbating.
- I was not.

417
00:44:37,192 --> 00:44:39,986
Yes, you were.

418
00:44:40,069 --> 00:44:43,823
Oh, all right.
So shoot me. I was whacking off.

419
00:44:43,907 --> 00:44:47,493
That's right. I was choking
the bishop, chafing the carrot.

420
00:44:47,577 --> 00:44:50,496
You know, saying "hi"
to my monster.

421
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:52,499
That's disgusting.

422
00:44:52,582 --> 00:44:55,710
Well, excuse me, but some of us still
have blood pumping through our veins.

423
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:58,046
- So do I.
- Really?

424
00:44:58,129 --> 00:45:02,467
Well, I'm the only one who seems
to be doing anything about it.

425
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:06,137
Lester, I refuse to live like this!

426
00:45:06,221 --> 00:45:08,181
This is not a marriage.

427
00:45:08,264 --> 00:45:11,351
This hasn't been
a marriage for years,

428
00:45:11,434 --> 00:45:14,395
but you were happy as long
as I kept my mouth shut.

429
00:45:14,479 --> 00:45:16,523
Well, guess what.
I've changed.

430
00:45:16,606 --> 00:45:19,192
And the new me whacks off
when he feels horny...

431
00:45:19,275 --> 00:45:22,070
'cause you're obviously not going
to help me out in that department.

432
00:45:22,153 --> 00:45:24,822
I see. You think you're the
only one who's sexually frustrated.

433
00:45:24,906 --> 00:45:28,034
I'm not? Well, then,
come on, baby. I'm ready.

434
00:45:28,117 --> 00:45:30,286
Don't you mess
with me, mister.

435
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:33,498
I will divorce you so fast,
it'll make your head spin.

436
00:45:33,581 --> 00:45:35,750
On what grounds?

437
00:45:35,834 --> 00:45:38,419
I'm not a drunk.
I don't fuck other women.

438
00:45:38,503 --> 00:45:40,922
I don't mistreat you.
I've never hit you.

439
00:45:41,005 --> 00:45:43,591
I don't even try to touch you,
since you made it so abundantly clear...

440
00:45:43,675 --> 00:45:45,969
just how unnecessary
you consider me to be!

441
00:45:47,971 --> 00:45:51,391
<i>But... I did support you</i>
<i>when you got your license.</i>

442
00:45:51,474 --> 00:45:55,562
And some people might think that
entitles me to half of what's yours.

443
00:45:55,645 --> 00:45:58,481
Oh!

444
00:45:58,565 --> 00:46:02,318
So, turn out the light
when you come back to bed, okay?

445
00:46:13,788 --> 00:46:16,708
<i>It's a great thing</i>
<i>when you realize you still have...</i>

446
00:46:16,791 --> 00:46:19,377
<i>the ability</i>
<i>to surprise yourself.</i>

447
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:23,423
<i>Makes you wonder what else you can do</i>
<i>that you've forgotten about.</i>

448
00:46:23,506 --> 00:46:25,466
Hey, guys.

449
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:27,969
Lester. I didn't know you ran.

450
00:46:28,052 --> 00:46:30,388
- I just started.
- Good for you.

451
00:46:30,471 --> 00:46:34,559
I figured you guys might be able to give
me some pointers. I need to shape up, fast.

452
00:46:34,642 --> 00:46:37,437
Are you looking to just lose weight,
or do you want to have...

453
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,440
increased strength
and flexibility as well?

454
00:46:40,523 --> 00:46:43,985
I... I want
to look good naked.

455
00:46:58,875 --> 00:47:03,588
<i>Oh, what is this?</i>
<i>Fuckin' gay pride parade?</i>

456
00:47:03,671 --> 00:47:05,757
Hey! Yo, Ricky.

457
00:47:09,177 --> 00:47:13,932
My entire life is passing before my eyes,
and those two have barely broken a sweat.

458
00:47:14,015 --> 00:47:17,268
Sorry. Hi. Lester Burnham.
I live next door. We haven't met.

459
00:47:17,352 --> 00:47:19,354
Colonel Frank Fitts,
U.S. Marine Corps.

460
00:47:19,437 --> 00:47:22,524
Oh, whoa. Well.

461
00:47:22,607 --> 00:47:24,859
Welcome to the neighborhood, sir.

462
00:47:28,821 --> 00:47:31,783
Ricky, uh...

463
00:47:31,866 --> 00:47:35,453
I was thinking about the, uh...
I was gonna... The movie we talked about.

464
00:47:35,537 --> 00:47:37,455
- <i>Re-Animator.</i>
- Yeah!

465
00:47:37,539 --> 00:47:41,292
You want to borrow it?
Okay. It's up in my room. Come on.

466
00:47:52,303 --> 00:47:54,889
- Can you hold this for a sec?
- Sure.

467
00:47:54,973 --> 00:47:59,060
I don't think my dad would try to come in
while someone else is here, but you never know.

468
00:47:59,143 --> 00:48:02,188
- What is this?
- Urine.

469
00:48:02,272 --> 00:48:06,651
I have to take a drug test every
six months just to make sure I'm clean.

470
00:48:06,734 --> 00:48:09,654
Are you kidding?
You just smoked with me last night.

471
00:48:09,737 --> 00:48:11,823
It's not mine.

472
00:48:11,906 --> 00:48:15,660
One of my clients is a nurse
in a pediatrician's office.

473
00:48:15,743 --> 00:48:19,330
Cut her a deal,
she keeps me in clean piss.

474
00:48:21,416 --> 00:48:23,418
You like Pink Floyd?

475
00:48:24,961 --> 00:48:27,422
I like a lot of music.

476
00:48:28,631 --> 00:48:33,011
Man, I haven't listened
to this album in years.

477
00:48:33,094 --> 00:48:35,513
How much do you want?

478
00:48:35,597 --> 00:48:39,517
I don't know. It's been a while.
Um, how much is an ounce?

479
00:48:43,188 --> 00:48:46,107
This is totally decent,
and it's 300.

480
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:49,360
Wow!

481
00:48:49,444 --> 00:48:52,030
This shit is
top of the line.

482
00:48:52,113 --> 00:48:55,742
It's called G-13. It's genetically
engineered by the U.S. government.

483
00:48:55,825 --> 00:48:59,621
It's extremely potent, but
a completely mellow high. No paranoia.

484
00:49:00,663 --> 00:49:03,583
Is that what we smoked
last night?

485
00:49:03,666 --> 00:49:06,294
This is all I ever smoke.

486
00:49:10,131 --> 00:49:13,635
- How much?
- Two grand.

487
00:49:13,718 --> 00:49:15,970
Jesus!

488
00:49:16,054 --> 00:49:18,890
Things have changed since 1973.

489
00:49:18,973 --> 00:49:22,727
- You don't have to pay now. I know you're good for it.
- Thanks.

490
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:25,146
There's a card in there
with my beeper number.

491
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:28,566
<i>Beep me anytime, day or night.</i>

492
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:30,860
And I only accept cash.

493
00:49:30,944 --> 00:49:34,739
Now I know how you can afford
all this equipment.

494
00:49:34,822 --> 00:49:39,744
God. When I was your age, I flipped burgers
all summer just to buy an eight-track.

495
00:49:39,827 --> 00:49:43,873
- That sucks.
- No, actually it was great.

496
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:48,461
All I did was party
and get laid.

497
00:49:50,088 --> 00:49:53,174
I had my whole life
ahead of me.

498
00:49:55,051 --> 00:49:59,389
My dad thinks I pay for all
this with catering jobs.

499
00:49:59,472 --> 00:50:02,433
Never underestimate
the power of denial.

500
00:50:35,508 --> 00:50:39,596
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

501
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:42,515
Uh-oh. Mom's mad.

502
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:44,642
Bench presses.

503
00:50:44,726 --> 00:50:49,355
I'm going to whale on my pecks,
and then I'm going to do my back.

504
00:50:49,439 --> 00:50:53,318
I see you're smoking pot now.
I... I'm so glad.

505
00:50:53,401 --> 00:50:55,862
I think using illegal
psychotropic substances...

506
00:50:55,945 --> 00:50:58,448
is a very positive example
to set for our daughter.

507
00:50:58,531 --> 00:51:02,785
You're one to talk, you bloodless,
money-grubbing freak.

508
00:51:03,995 --> 00:51:05,997
Uh... Lester!

509
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,124
You have such hostility in you.

510
00:51:08,208 --> 00:51:12,462
Do you mind? I'm trying to work
out here. Unless... you want to spot me.

511
00:51:12,545 --> 00:51:16,132
Lester, you will not
get away with this.

512
00:51:16,216 --> 00:51:19,344
You can be sure of that.

513
00:51:19,427 --> 00:51:23,014
That's... what...

514
00:51:23,097 --> 00:51:25,183
you... think.

515
00:51:25,433 --> 00:51:28,895
"My job consists of
basically masking...

516
00:51:28,978 --> 00:51:32,690
"my contempt for
the assholes in charge...

517
00:51:32,774 --> 00:51:36,402
"and at least once a day
retiring to the men's room...

518
00:51:36,486 --> 00:51:38,655
"so I can jerk off...

519
00:51:38,738 --> 00:51:41,366
"while I fantasize
about a life...

520
00:51:41,449 --> 00:51:44,869
that doesn't so closely
resemble hell."

521
00:51:44,953 --> 00:51:48,665
Well, you obviously have no interest
in saving yourself.

522
00:51:48,748 --> 00:51:52,919
Brad, for 14 years, I've been a whore
for the advertising industry.

523
00:51:53,002 --> 00:51:56,714
The only way I could save myself now
is if I start firebombing.

524
00:51:56,798 --> 00:52:00,510
Whatever. Management wants you
gone by the end of the day.

525
00:52:00,593 --> 00:52:03,721
Just what sort of severance package
is management prepared to offer me,

526
00:52:03,805 --> 00:52:06,349
considering the information
I have about our editorial director...

527
00:52:06,432 --> 00:52:08,351
buying pussy
with company money?

528
00:52:08,434 --> 00:52:11,145
<i>Which I think</i>
<i>would interest the I.R.S.,</i>

529
00:52:11,229 --> 00:52:13,273
since it technically
constitutes fraud.

530
00:52:13,356 --> 00:52:16,276
And I'm sure that some of our
advertisers and rival publications...

531
00:52:16,359 --> 00:52:20,655
might like to know about it as well,
not to mention... Craig's wife.

532
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:26,953
- What do you want?
- One year's salary <i>with</i> benefits.

533
00:52:27,036 --> 00:52:30,206
That's not going to happen.

534
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:33,626
What do you say I throw in a little
sexual harassment charge to boot?

535
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:37,463
Against who?

536
00:52:37,547 --> 00:52:39,382
Against you.

537
00:52:39,465 --> 00:52:42,969
<i>Can you prove that you</i>
<i>didn't offer to save my job...</i>

538
00:52:43,052 --> 00:52:45,597
if I let you blow me?

539
00:52:50,685 --> 00:52:54,105
Man... you are
one twisted fuck.

540
00:52:55,523 --> 00:52:58,735
Nope. I'm just
an ordinary guy...

541
00:52:58,818 --> 00:53:01,529
with nothing to lose.

542
00:53:06,492 --> 00:53:08,453
Yeah.

543
00:53:13,958 --> 00:53:16,586
- Carolyn.
- Buddy.

544
00:53:16,669 --> 00:53:20,882
- I am so sorry to have kept you waiting.
- Oh.

545
00:53:20,965 --> 00:53:23,343
Christy left for New York
this morning.

546
00:53:23,426 --> 00:53:26,888
Let's just say things were
a little... hectic around the house.

547
00:53:26,971 --> 00:53:30,475
- What's she doing in New York?
- She's moving there.

548
00:53:30,558 --> 00:53:32,560
Yes, we are splitting up.

549
00:53:32,644 --> 00:53:35,230
Buddy. I'm so sorry.

550
00:53:35,313 --> 00:53:38,983
Yes. According to her, I'm...

551
00:53:39,067 --> 00:53:41,069
too focused on my career.

552
00:53:41,152 --> 00:53:44,155
As if being driven to succeed is...

553
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:47,951
some sort of a character flaw.

554
00:53:48,034 --> 00:53:51,996
Well, she certainly did take advantage
of the lifestyle my success afforded her.

555
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,582
Ooh! Ha. Wow.

556
00:53:56,417 --> 00:53:59,587
- Ah, it's for the best.
- Mm-hmm.

557
00:53:59,671 --> 00:54:04,175
When I saw you two at the party the
other night, you seemed perfectly happy.

558
00:54:04,259 --> 00:54:06,928
Well, call me crazy,

559
00:54:07,011 --> 00:54:11,516
but it is my philosophy
that in order to be successful,

560
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:14,352
one <i>must</i> project
an image of success...

561
00:54:14,435 --> 00:54:16,521
<i>at all times.</i>

562
00:54:35,999 --> 00:54:39,002
<i>What are you doing?</i>

563
00:54:39,085 --> 00:54:42,714
- <i>I was filming this dead bird.</i>
- Why?

564
00:54:42,797 --> 00:54:45,008
<i>Because it's beautiful.</i>

565
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:51,181
I think maybe you forgot
your medication today, mental boy.

566
00:54:53,141 --> 00:54:55,101
<i>Hi, Jane.</i>

567
00:54:55,185 --> 00:54:57,604
I want you to stop filming me.

568
00:54:59,606 --> 00:55:01,524
Okay.

569
00:55:01,608 --> 00:55:04,152
Well, whatever. This is boring.

570
00:55:04,235 --> 00:55:06,946
Let's go.

571
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:10,408
- Do you need a ride?
- <i>Are you crazy?</i>

572
00:55:10,492 --> 00:55:13,787
I don't want to end up hacked to pieces
in a Dumpster somewhere.

573
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:17,332
It's okay. I'll walk.
But thanks.

574
00:55:17,415 --> 00:55:19,793
He doesn't want to go anyway.
Let's go.

575
00:55:21,127 --> 00:55:24,798
- <i>Come on, Jane.</i>
- I think I'm going to walk too.

576
00:55:24,881 --> 00:55:27,008
<i>What?</i>

577
00:55:27,092 --> 00:55:31,012
Jane, that's, like,
almost a mile.

578
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:47,070
<i>Oh, God!</i>

579
00:55:47,153 --> 00:55:49,572
I love it! Oh! Oh!

580
00:55:49,656 --> 00:55:52,909
- You like getting nailed by the King?
- Oh, yes, I love it!

581
00:55:52,993 --> 00:55:55,787
- Fuck me, Your Majesty! Aah!
- Ohh!

582
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:57,914
- Who's the King?
- Oh! You are!

583
00:56:41,416 --> 00:56:43,752
<i>Smile. You're at Mr. Smiley's.</i>

584
00:56:43,835 --> 00:56:45,754
What?

585
00:56:45,837 --> 00:56:50,091
Would you like to try our new bacon and egg
fajita for $1.29 for a limited time only?

586
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:53,094
Uh, no, but thank you.

587
00:56:53,178 --> 00:56:57,182
I'd like the Big Barn Burger,
Smiley Fries and an orange soda.

588
00:56:57,265 --> 00:56:59,726
Please drive up to the window.
Thank you.

589
00:57:01,603 --> 00:57:05,231
Smile. You're at Mr. Smiley's.
That'll be 4.98, please.

590
00:57:07,567 --> 00:57:09,819
- Would you like some Smiley sauce?
- <i>No, no...</i>

591
00:57:09,903 --> 00:57:12,572
<i>Actually, I'd like</i>
<i>to fill out an application.</i>

592
00:57:12,656 --> 00:57:16,618
- There's no jobs for manager. It's just for counter.
- Good.

593
00:57:16,701 --> 00:57:21,748
I'm looking for the least possible
amount of responsibility.

594
00:57:23,875 --> 00:57:26,169
I don't think
you'd fit in here.

595
00:57:26,252 --> 00:57:29,381
I have fast food experience.

596
00:57:29,464 --> 00:57:31,758
Yeah, like 20 years ago.

597
00:57:31,841 --> 00:57:35,720
I'm sure there've been amazing
technological advances in the industry,

598
00:57:35,804 --> 00:57:38,390
but surely you must have
some sort of training program.

599
00:57:38,473 --> 00:57:41,267
It seems unfair to presume
I won't be able to learn.

600
00:57:45,647 --> 00:57:48,942
- That was exactly what I needed...
- Mm.

601
00:57:51,903 --> 00:57:54,948
the "royal treatment,"
so to speak.

602
00:57:57,325 --> 00:58:00,578
I was so stressed out. Ah!

603
00:58:00,662 --> 00:58:03,331
- Ah! Ah.
- Mm.

604
00:58:06,626 --> 00:58:09,379
Know what I do
when I feel like that?

605
00:58:09,462 --> 00:58:11,756
What?

606
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:14,759
- I fire a gun.
- Really?

607
00:58:14,843 --> 00:58:17,721
Oh, yeah. I go to this
little firing range downtown,

608
00:58:17,804 --> 00:58:22,142
and I... just pop off
a few rounds.

609
00:58:22,225 --> 00:58:26,146
- I've never fired a gun before.
- Well, you've gotta try it.

610
00:58:26,229 --> 00:58:29,149
Nothing makes you feel
more powerful.

611
00:58:31,234 --> 00:58:33,570
Well...

612
00:58:33,653 --> 00:58:35,822
almost nothing.

613
00:58:40,201 --> 00:58:43,705
- So, do you like your new house?
- I like it.

614
00:58:43,788 --> 00:58:47,292
The people who used to live there fed these
stray cats, so they were always around,

615
00:58:47,375 --> 00:58:50,045
and it drove
my mother nuts.

616
00:58:50,128 --> 00:58:54,090
And then she cut down
their tree.

617
00:58:54,174 --> 00:58:56,259
Is that a funeral?

618
00:58:56,343 --> 00:59:00,638
Yeah. Have you ever
known anybody who died?

619
00:59:00,722 --> 00:59:03,641
No. Have you?

620
00:59:03,725 --> 00:59:05,810
No.

621
00:59:05,894 --> 00:59:08,730
But I did see this homeless woman
who froze to death once...

622
00:59:08,813 --> 00:59:11,232
just laying there
on the sidewalk.

623
00:59:11,316 --> 00:59:13,568
She looked really sad.

624
00:59:26,581 --> 00:59:29,668
I got that homeless woman
on videotape.

625
00:59:29,751 --> 00:59:31,836
Why would you film that?

626
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:35,674
- Because it was amazing.
- What's amazing about it?

627
00:59:35,757 --> 00:59:39,886
When you see something like that,
it's like God is looking right at you,

628
00:59:39,969 --> 00:59:41,971
just for a second,

629
00:59:42,055 --> 00:59:44,891
and if you're careful,
you can look right back.

630
00:59:44,974 --> 00:59:47,811
And what do you see?

631
00:59:47,894 --> 00:59:49,896
Beauty.

632
01:00:05,745 --> 01:00:08,873
Mom, I want you
to meet somebody.

633
01:00:12,711 --> 01:00:15,630
- Mom.
- Yes?

634
01:00:17,882 --> 01:00:22,012
I want you to meet somebody.
This is Jane.

635
01:00:22,095 --> 01:00:24,389
- <i>Hi.</i>
- Oh, my.

636
01:00:24,472 --> 01:00:27,976
I apologize for the way
things look around here.

637
01:00:37,986 --> 01:00:40,530
<i>This is where my dad hides out.</i>

638
01:00:40,613 --> 01:00:43,074
<i>I take it he's got a thing for guns.</i>

639
01:00:44,617 --> 01:00:48,580
You gotta see
this one thing.

640
01:00:48,663 --> 01:00:52,083
My dad would kill me
if he knew I was in here.

641
01:00:52,167 --> 01:00:54,169
Did you steal his keys?

642
01:00:54,252 --> 01:00:57,172
No. One of my clients
is a locksmith.

643
01:00:57,255 --> 01:01:01,217
He was short on cash one night,
so I let him pay me in trade.

644
01:01:14,439 --> 01:01:16,608
Turn it over.

645
01:01:19,861 --> 01:01:22,530
Oh, my God.

646
01:01:22,614 --> 01:01:25,033
It's, like, official state china
of the Third Reich.

647
01:01:25,116 --> 01:01:29,037
There's a whole subculture
of people who collect this Nazi shit.

648
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:31,623
But my dad just has
this one thing.

649
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:47,055
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

650
01:01:47,138 --> 01:01:50,141
No, you're scared of me.

651
01:01:51,226 --> 01:01:53,395
No, I'm not.

652
01:01:53,478 --> 01:01:57,982
<i>You want to see the most beautiful thing</i>
<i>I've ever filmed?</i>

653
01:02:20,714 --> 01:02:23,133
It was one of those days...

654
01:02:23,216 --> 01:02:26,177
where it's a minute
away from snowing,

655
01:02:28,388 --> 01:02:31,349
and there was this electricity
in the air.

656
01:02:33,810 --> 01:02:36,396
You can almost hear it.

657
01:02:36,479 --> 01:02:38,565
Right?

658
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:46,156
And this bag was just...

659
01:02:46,239 --> 01:02:49,034
dancing with me,

660
01:02:51,036 --> 01:02:55,915
like a little kid
begging me to play with it,

661
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:58,585
for 15 minutes.

662
01:03:02,047 --> 01:03:06,134
That's the day I realized
that there was this...

663
01:03:06,217 --> 01:03:10,138
entire life behind things...

664
01:03:13,266 --> 01:03:17,354
<i>and this incredibly</i>
<i>benevolent force...</i>

665
01:03:17,437 --> 01:03:21,733
<i>that wanted me to know that there</i>
<i>was no reason to be afraid...</i>

666
01:03:23,318 --> 01:03:25,528
<i>ever.</i>

667
01:03:27,739 --> 01:03:30,367
<i>Video's a poor excuse, I know,</i>

668
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:35,622
<i>but it helps me remember.</i>

669
01:03:39,334 --> 01:03:41,753
<i>I need to remember.</i>

670
01:03:48,635 --> 01:03:51,888
Sometimes there's so much...

671
01:03:51,971 --> 01:03:54,849
beauty...

672
01:03:54,933 --> 01:03:57,352
in the world.

673
01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:02,232
I feel like
I can't take it...

674
01:04:05,402 --> 01:04:08,238
and my heart...

675
01:04:08,321 --> 01:04:10,865
is just going to...

676
01:04:10,949 --> 01:04:13,284
cave in.

677
01:04:59,789 --> 01:05:03,376
Oh, my God.
What time is it?

678
01:05:10,342 --> 01:05:12,969
- Sorry I'm late.
- No, that's quite all right, dear.

679
01:05:13,053 --> 01:05:15,930
Your father and I were
just discussing his day at work.

680
01:05:16,014 --> 01:05:18,433
Why don't you tell
our daughter about it, honey?

681
01:05:18,516 --> 01:05:21,561
Janie, today I quit my job.

682
01:05:21,644 --> 01:05:24,564
Then I told my boss to go fuck himself, and
then I blackmailed him for almost $60,000.

683
01:05:24,647 --> 01:05:26,483
- Pass the asparagus.
- <i>Your father seems to think...</i>

684
01:05:26,566 --> 01:05:29,027
this kind of behavior
is something to be proud of.

685
01:05:29,110 --> 01:05:31,863
And your mother seems to prefer that I
go through life like a fucking prisoner...

686
01:05:31,946 --> 01:05:34,199
while she keeps my dick
in a Mason jar under the sink.

687
01:05:34,282 --> 01:05:36,868
How dare you speak to me
that way in front of her?

688
01:05:36,951 --> 01:05:39,537
And I marvel that you can be
so contemptuous of me...

689
01:05:39,621 --> 01:05:42,123
on the same day
that you lose your job!

690
01:05:42,207 --> 01:05:44,376
I didn't lose it. It's not like,
"Whoops, where did my job go?"

691
01:05:44,459 --> 01:05:46,378
I quit!
Pass the asparagus.

692
01:05:46,461 --> 01:05:49,714
<i>Oh, oh, oh! And I want to thank you for</i>
<i>putting me under the added pressure...</i>

693
01:05:49,798 --> 01:05:51,841
of being the sole
breadwinner now.

694
01:05:51,925 --> 01:05:53,843
- I already have a job.
- <i>No, no!</i>

695
01:05:53,927 --> 01:05:56,513
<i>Don't give a second thought</i>
<i>as to who's going to pay the mortgage.</i>

696
01:05:56,596 --> 01:05:58,848
We'll leave it up to Carolyn. "You're going
to take care of everything now, Carolyn?"

697
01:05:58,932 --> 01:06:00,684
"Yes. I don't mind."

698
01:06:00,767 --> 01:06:03,395
<i>"Everything? You don't mind having</i>
<i>the sole responsibility?</i>

699
01:06:03,478 --> 01:06:06,064
Your husband feels he can just
quit his job, and you don't..."

700
01:06:06,147 --> 01:06:08,358
Will someone please pass me
the fucking asparagus?

701
01:06:08,441 --> 01:06:11,027
- I'm not going to be a part of this.
- Sit down!

702
01:06:31,423 --> 01:06:34,759
I am sick and tired of being treated
like I don't exist.

703
01:06:34,843 --> 01:06:38,930
You two do whatever you want to do whenever
you want to do it, and I don't complain.

704
01:06:39,014 --> 01:06:42,267
- All I want...
- Oh, you don't complain? Oh, please! Excuse me!

705
01:06:42,350 --> 01:06:45,270
I must be psychotic then!
If you don't complain, what is this?

706
01:06:45,353 --> 01:06:49,733
<i>Yeah, let's bring in the laugh meter</i>
<i>and see how loud it gets on that one.</i>

707
01:07:00,452 --> 01:07:02,746
Don't interrupt me, honey.

708
01:07:16,718 --> 01:07:18,720
And another thing.

709
01:07:18,803 --> 01:07:21,389
From now on, we're going
to alternate our dinner music,

710
01:07:21,473 --> 01:07:24,059
because, frankly...
and I don't think I'm alone here...

711
01:07:24,142 --> 01:07:27,520
I am really tired
of this Lawrence Welk shit.

712
01:07:36,112 --> 01:07:38,782
- Go away.
- <i>Please.</i>

713
01:07:38,865 --> 01:07:40,992
<i>Please let me in.</i>

714
01:07:49,626 --> 01:07:52,671
Look, I wish that you hadn't witnessed
that awful scene tonight,

715
01:07:52,754 --> 01:07:54,673
but in a way, I'm glad.

716
01:07:54,756 --> 01:07:58,385
Why? So I could see
what freaks you and Dad really are?

717
01:07:58,468 --> 01:08:00,553
Me?

718
01:08:02,138 --> 01:08:04,891
Tsk. God.

719
01:08:04,974 --> 01:08:07,602
Oh, Christ. Mom.

720
01:08:07,686 --> 01:08:10,563
No, I'm glad because, uh...

721
01:08:12,816 --> 01:08:18,279
because you're old enough now to learn
the most important lesson in life:

722
01:08:18,363 --> 01:08:22,534
You cannot count
on anyone except yourself.

723
01:08:27,372 --> 01:08:30,542
You cannot count on
anyone except yourself.

724
01:08:32,002 --> 01:08:34,838
You know, it's sad but true,

725
01:08:34,921 --> 01:08:37,298
and the sooner you learn it,
the better.

726
01:08:37,382 --> 01:08:41,302
Look, Mom, I really don't feel like
having a Kodak moment here.

727
01:08:41,386 --> 01:08:44,222
You ungrateful little brat!

728
01:08:44,305 --> 01:08:47,350
Just look at everything
you have!

729
01:08:47,434 --> 01:08:50,020
When I was your age,
I lived in a duplex!

730
01:08:50,103 --> 01:08:54,065
We didn't even have
our own house.

731
01:10:53,685 --> 01:10:55,603
You little bastard!

732
01:10:55,687 --> 01:10:57,605
<i>Dad, no, I just...</i>

733
01:10:57,689 --> 01:10:59,774
How did you get in there?

734
01:10:59,858 --> 01:11:01,693
How? How?

735
01:11:03,653 --> 01:11:05,989
Come on! Get up!
Come on!

736
01:11:06,072 --> 01:11:07,907
Get up!

737
01:11:07,991 --> 01:11:09,993
<i>Fight back,</i>
<i>you little pussy!</i>

738
01:11:10,076 --> 01:11:12,787
- No, sir, I won't fight you.
- How?

739
01:11:12,871 --> 01:11:15,832
- How did you get in there?
- I picked the lock, sir.

740
01:11:15,915 --> 01:11:19,586
What were you looking for, huh?
Money? Are you on dope again?

741
01:11:19,669 --> 01:11:23,465
No, sir. I wanted to show
my girlfriend your Nazi plate.

742
01:11:23,548 --> 01:11:25,342
A girlfriend?

743
01:11:25,425 --> 01:11:28,094
Yes, sir. She lives next door.

744
01:11:41,024 --> 01:11:43,693
<i>Her name's Jane.</i>

745
01:12:02,671 --> 01:12:05,590
This is for
your own good, boy.

746
01:12:07,926 --> 01:12:12,597
You have no respect for other
people's things and for authority...

747
01:12:12,681 --> 01:12:14,724
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

748
01:12:14,808 --> 01:12:18,978
Can't just go around doing
whatever you feel like.

749
01:12:19,062 --> 01:12:21,481
You can't.
There are rules in life.

750
01:12:21,564 --> 01:12:24,317
Yes, sir.

751
01:12:26,277 --> 01:12:29,698
You need structure, yeah.
You need...

752
01:12:29,781 --> 01:12:32,701
- Discipline.
- Yes, sir. Thank you for trying to teach me.

753
01:12:32,784 --> 01:12:35,120
Don't give up on me, Dad.

754
01:12:39,916 --> 01:12:41,835
Oh, Ricky.

755
01:12:46,798 --> 01:12:49,467
You stay out of there.

756
01:13:36,973 --> 01:13:39,225
- Whoo!
- I gotta say, Mrs. Burnham,

757
01:13:39,309 --> 01:13:43,271
when you first came here, I thought you
would be hopeless, but you're a natural.

758
01:13:43,355 --> 01:13:46,900
Well, all I know is
I love shooting this gun.

759
01:15:00,098 --> 01:15:02,017
What?

760
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:04,728
Uh, whose car is that
out front?

761
01:15:04,811 --> 01:15:07,314
Mine. 1970 Pontiac Firebird,

762
01:15:07,397 --> 01:15:10,233
the car I've always wanted,
and now I have it.

763
01:15:10,317 --> 01:15:13,028
- I rule!
- Uh-huh. Where's the Camry?

764
01:15:13,111 --> 01:15:15,196
I traded it in.

765
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:19,576
- Shouldn't you have consulted me first?
- Hm, let me think.

766
01:15:19,659 --> 01:15:21,911
No. You never drove it.

767
01:15:23,705 --> 01:15:26,708
Have you done something different?
You look great.

768
01:15:31,838 --> 01:15:33,757
Where's Jane?

769
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,051
Jane not home.

770
01:15:42,599 --> 01:15:44,517
We have...

771
01:15:47,145 --> 01:15:50,190
the whole house...

772
01:15:50,273 --> 01:15:52,817
to ourselves.

773
01:15:54,986 --> 01:15:57,822
Christ, Carolyn.

774
01:15:57,906 --> 01:16:00,325
When did you become so...

775
01:16:01,993 --> 01:16:05,038
joyless?

776
01:16:05,121 --> 01:16:07,707
Joyless?

777
01:16:07,791 --> 01:16:10,335
I am not joyless.

778
01:16:10,418 --> 01:16:13,004
There happens to be
a lot about me...

779
01:16:13,088 --> 01:16:17,008
that you don't know,
Mr. Smarty Man.

780
01:16:17,092 --> 01:16:20,428
There's plenty of joy
in my life.

781
01:16:22,847 --> 01:16:25,350
Whatever happened to that girl...

782
01:16:28,353 --> 01:16:34,109
who used to fake seizures
at frat parties when she got bored?

783
01:16:34,192 --> 01:16:39,030
Who used to run up to the roof
of our first apartment building...

784
01:16:39,114 --> 01:16:41,866
to flash
the traffic helicopters?

785
01:16:41,950 --> 01:16:46,621
Have you totally forgotten about her?

786
01:16:46,705 --> 01:16:48,873
Because I haven't.

787
01:17:01,970 --> 01:17:05,223
Lester, you're going
to spill beer on the couch.

788
01:17:12,314 --> 01:17:14,232
So what?
It's just a couch.

789
01:17:16,568 --> 01:17:18,862
This is a $4,000 sofa,

790
01:17:18,945 --> 01:17:20,864
upholstered in Italian silk.

791
01:17:20,947 --> 01:17:23,033
This is not just a couch.

792
01:17:23,116 --> 01:17:26,870
It's just... a... couch!

793
01:17:26,953 --> 01:17:29,164
This isn't life!

794
01:17:29,247 --> 01:17:31,416
This is just stuff,

795
01:17:31,499 --> 01:17:34,085
and it's become more important
to you than living.

796
01:17:34,169 --> 01:17:36,379
Well, honey,
that's just nuts.

797
01:17:45,430 --> 01:17:47,932
I'm only trying to help you!

798
01:17:53,063 --> 01:17:55,857
Don't.

799
01:17:55,940 --> 01:17:58,026
<i>Why?</i>

800
01:18:00,779 --> 01:18:03,281
It's weird watching myself.

801
01:18:03,365 --> 01:18:05,784
I don't like how I look.

802
01:18:08,370 --> 01:18:11,289
<i>I can't believe you don't know</i>
<i>how beautiful you are.</i>

803
01:18:11,373 --> 01:18:15,377
Look. I'm not going
to sit here for that shit.

804
01:18:23,802 --> 01:18:26,721
Ha! How does it feel now?

805
01:18:26,805 --> 01:18:28,765
Fine.

806
01:18:28,848 --> 01:18:30,850
You don't feel naked?

807
01:18:32,227 --> 01:18:34,479
I <i>am</i> naked.

808
01:18:34,562 --> 01:18:36,982
You know what I mean.

809
01:18:46,074 --> 01:18:49,160
So tell me about
being in the hospital.

810
01:18:52,163 --> 01:18:56,167
When I was 15,
my dad caught me smoking dope.

811
01:18:56,251 --> 01:19:01,423
He totally freaked and decided
to send me to military school.

812
01:19:01,506 --> 01:19:05,010
I told you this whole thing
about structure and discipline, right?

813
01:19:05,093 --> 01:19:08,680
Of course,
I got kicked out.

814
01:19:08,763 --> 01:19:11,182
Dad and I had
this huge fight.

815
01:19:11,266 --> 01:19:14,394
<i>He hit me.</i>

816
01:19:14,477 --> 01:19:18,440
<i>And the next day at school,</i>
<i>some kid made a crack about my haircut,</i>

817
01:19:20,233 --> 01:19:22,360
and I just snapped.

818
01:19:26,031 --> 01:19:29,409
I wanted to kill him.

819
01:19:29,492 --> 01:19:31,870
I would've... killed him...

820
01:19:33,872 --> 01:19:36,458
if they hadn't pulled me off.

821
01:19:39,544 --> 01:19:43,590
That's when my dad
put me in the hospital.

822
01:19:43,673 --> 01:19:47,510
They drugged me up and left me
in there for two years.

823
01:19:48,970 --> 01:19:51,306
<i>Wow.</i>

824
01:19:51,389 --> 01:19:54,434
<i>You must really hate him.</i>

825
01:19:54,517 --> 01:19:57,187
No.

826
01:19:57,270 --> 01:19:59,439
He's not a bad man.

827
01:19:59,522 --> 01:20:04,152
Well, you'd better believe I'd hate my
dad if he did something like that to me.

828
01:20:04,235 --> 01:20:06,029
<i>Wait.</i>

829
01:20:06,112 --> 01:20:08,406
I already do hate my dad.

830
01:20:10,241 --> 01:20:12,369
Why?

831
01:20:14,371 --> 01:20:17,957
He's a total asshole;
he's got this crush on my friend Angela,

832
01:20:18,041 --> 01:20:20,251
and it's disgusting.

833
01:20:20,335 --> 01:20:23,880
You'd rather he had the crush on you.

834
01:20:23,963 --> 01:20:26,257
Gross. No.

835
01:20:29,636 --> 01:20:34,140
But it'd be nice if I was anywhere near
as important to him as she is.

836
01:20:37,227 --> 01:20:42,148
I know you think my dad's harmless,
but you're wrong.

837
01:20:42,232 --> 01:20:45,485
He's doing massive
psychological damage to me.

838
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:47,737
How?

839
01:20:47,821 --> 01:20:51,366
<i>Well, now I, too,</i>
<i>need structure,</i>

840
01:20:51,449 --> 01:20:54,619
a little fucking discipline.

841
01:21:05,171 --> 01:21:07,841
I'm serious, though.

842
01:21:07,924 --> 01:21:10,844
How could he not
be damaging me?

843
01:21:12,804 --> 01:21:15,724
I need a father
who's a role model,

844
01:21:15,807 --> 01:21:18,393
not some horny geek boy
who's going to spray his shorts...

845
01:21:18,476 --> 01:21:23,189
whenever I bring a girlfriend
home from school.

846
01:21:23,273 --> 01:21:25,525
What a lame-o.

847
01:21:27,986 --> 01:21:31,156
Someone really should just...
put him out of his misery.

848
01:21:34,617 --> 01:21:37,329
Want me to kill him for you?

849
01:21:46,004 --> 01:21:48,173
Yeah. Would you?

850
01:21:49,924 --> 01:21:51,885
It'll cost you.

851
01:21:51,968 --> 01:21:54,637
I've been baby-sitting
since I was about ten.

852
01:21:54,721 --> 01:21:57,265
I've got almost $3,000.

853
01:21:59,851 --> 01:22:02,604
Of course I was saving it up
for a boob job.

854
01:22:04,105 --> 01:22:06,274
<i>But...</i>

855
01:22:19,788 --> 01:22:23,208
<i>You know, that's not</i>
<i>a very nice thing to do...</i>

856
01:22:25,585 --> 01:22:28,046
<i>hiring someone</i>
<i>to kill your dad.</i>

857
01:22:30,757 --> 01:22:35,428
Well, I guess I'm not
a very nice girl then, am I?

858
01:22:57,909 --> 01:23:00,620
You know I'm not serious, right?

859
01:23:01,705 --> 01:23:03,748
Of course.

860
01:23:18,388 --> 01:23:22,267
You know how lucky we are
to have found each other?

861
01:23:27,022 --> 01:23:29,482
<i>Remember those posters that said...</i>

862
01:23:29,566 --> 01:23:33,945
<i>"Today is the first day</i>
<i>of the rest of your life"?</i>

863
01:23:34,029 --> 01:23:38,616
<i>Well, that's true</i>
<i>with every day except one...</i>

864
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:40,910
<i>the day you die.</i>

865
01:24:19,949 --> 01:24:21,743
<i>Jane, hurry up.</i>

866
01:24:21,826 --> 01:24:24,913
I've got a very important
appointment.

867
01:24:24,996 --> 01:24:29,167
- Is it okay if Angela sleeps over tonight?
- She's always welcome.

868
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:33,630
I thought you two had a fight. I haven't
seen her around here in a while.

869
01:24:40,595 --> 01:24:42,555
What?

870
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:45,725
I've been too embarrassed
to bring her over,

871
01:24:45,809 --> 01:24:48,395
because of you and that way
that you behave.

872
01:24:48,478 --> 01:24:51,815
- What are you talking about? I've barely even spoken to her.
- <i>Dad!</i>

873
01:24:51,898 --> 01:24:55,235
You stare at her all the time
like you're drunk!

874
01:24:55,318 --> 01:24:57,570
- <i>It's disgusting!</i>
- You better watch yourself,

875
01:24:57,654 --> 01:25:02,325
or you're going to turn into
a real bitch just like your mother!

876
01:25:04,577 --> 01:25:06,496
Oh, fuck.

877
01:25:14,421 --> 01:25:16,923
You ready to go?

878
01:25:17,007 --> 01:25:19,175
Oh, I-I don't need a ride.

879
01:25:19,259 --> 01:25:21,678
I'm going with Jane
and her mom.

880
01:25:28,685 --> 01:25:30,603
Oh, morning!

881
01:25:30,687 --> 01:25:32,647
<i>Yo, Ricky!</i>

882
01:25:32,731 --> 01:25:35,650
- How's it going?
- Pretty decent, Mr. Burnham.

883
01:25:35,734 --> 01:25:37,861
Hey. Wait.

884
01:26:56,439 --> 01:26:59,359
<i>I need that Super Smiley</i>
<i>with cheese ASAP!</i>

885
01:26:59,442 --> 01:27:02,320
- You need more than that, my little hombre.
- <i>May I take your order?</i>

886
01:27:02,404 --> 01:27:05,407
- <i>Oh, yeah! What's good here?</i>
- <i>Nothing.</i>

887
01:27:05,490 --> 01:27:08,535
<i>Oh, well, then I guess</i>
<i>we'll just have to be bad, won't we?</i>

888
01:27:08,618 --> 01:27:11,955
I'll have a Double Smiley sandwich,

889
01:27:12,038 --> 01:27:14,541
- <i>curly fries and a vanilla shake.</i>
- <i>Make that two.</i>

890
01:27:14,624 --> 01:27:18,461
<i>That'll be 7.98. Please</i>
<i>drive up to the window. Thank you.</i>

891
01:27:18,545 --> 01:27:22,966
I think we deserve a little junk food
after the workout we had this morning.

892
01:27:24,968 --> 01:27:28,471
- Did you know that?
- Thank you. I'm flattered.

893
01:27:28,555 --> 01:27:31,182
Smile!
You're at Mr. Smiley's!

894
01:27:32,809 --> 01:27:35,895
Would you like to try our new beef
and cheese pot pie on a stick?

895
01:27:35,979 --> 01:27:38,440
Just $1.99 for
a limited time only.

896
01:27:38,523 --> 01:27:43,486
- We were just at a seminar. Buddy, this is my...
- <i>Her husband.</i>

897
01:27:43,570 --> 01:27:45,989
We've met before,
but something tells me...

898
01:27:46,072 --> 01:27:48,450
you're going
to remember me this time.

899
01:27:48,533 --> 01:27:50,577
<i>Whoa!</i>

900
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:53,663
You are so busted.

901
01:27:53,747 --> 01:27:55,790
This really doesn't concern you.

902
01:27:55,874 --> 01:28:00,587
Well, actually, Janine is senior
drive-thru manager, so you are on her turf.

903
01:28:02,881 --> 01:28:07,427
So, this makes sense.

904
01:28:07,510 --> 01:28:09,971
- Oh, Lester...
- <i>Honey, it's okay.</i>

905
01:28:10,055 --> 01:28:13,808
I want you to be happy.
Would you like Smiley Sauce with that?

906
01:28:13,892 --> 01:28:15,810
- Lester, just stop it!
- <i>No, no.</i>

907
01:28:15,894 --> 01:28:17,979
You...

908
01:28:18,063 --> 01:28:21,149
don't get to tell me
what to do...

909
01:28:21,232 --> 01:28:23,610
ever again.

910
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:39,542
I'm sorry.

911
01:28:41,002 --> 01:28:43,922
I guess we should
cool it for a while.

912
01:28:46,007 --> 01:28:49,135
I'm facing a potentially
very expensive divorce.

913
01:28:49,219 --> 01:28:52,138
No, no,
I understand completely.

914
01:28:52,222 --> 01:28:54,557
It's...

915
01:28:54,641 --> 01:28:59,854
"In order to be successful, one must
project an image of success at all times."

916
01:29:26,172 --> 01:29:28,425
Stop it. Stop it.

917
01:30:07,130 --> 01:30:10,425
Shit.

918
01:30:17,390 --> 01:30:19,476
I have to run next door.

919
01:30:19,559 --> 01:30:23,647
Jane left her geometry book in my bag,
and she needs it to do her homework.

920
01:30:32,405 --> 01:30:37,160
So you and psycho boy are fucking on,
like, a regular basis now, right?

921
01:30:37,243 --> 01:30:39,245
No.

922
01:30:39,329 --> 01:30:42,415
Come on. You can tell me.
Does he have a big dick?

923
01:30:42,499 --> 01:30:46,920
I'm not going to talk about his dick
with you, okay? It's not like that.

924
01:30:47,003 --> 01:30:50,340
Not like what?
Doesn't he have one?

925
01:30:50,423 --> 01:30:52,676
Why don't you want
to talk about it?

926
01:30:52,759 --> 01:30:56,137
- I tell you every detail about every guy that I fuck.
- Yeah.

927
01:30:56,221 --> 01:31:01,059
Maybe you shouldn't, all right? Maybe I
really don't want to hear about all that.

928
01:31:01,142 --> 01:31:04,854
So now that you have a boyfriend,
you're, like, above it?

929
01:31:04,938 --> 01:31:08,942
We got to get you
a real man.

930
01:31:28,878 --> 01:31:32,465
- You got any papers?
- Yeah, in the cigar box right over there.

931
01:31:32,549 --> 01:31:36,136
Put up a fight, dude. You are such a
pushover. "No, I can't, really. Okay."

932
01:31:36,219 --> 01:31:38,471
You should learn
to roll a joint.

933
01:32:42,619 --> 01:32:44,788
<i>Oh! Hi.</i>

934
01:32:44,871 --> 01:32:47,874
- <i>Where's Mom?</i>
- Don't know.

935
01:32:47,957 --> 01:32:51,211
- Hi, Mr. Burnham.
- Hi.

936
01:32:51,294 --> 01:32:55,715
Wow, look at you.
Have you been working out?

937
01:32:55,799 --> 01:32:58,468
Some.

938
01:33:02,013 --> 01:33:04,307
You can really tell.

939
01:33:06,726 --> 01:33:08,812
Look at those arms.

940
01:33:13,274 --> 01:33:15,485
You like... muscles?

941
01:33:17,070 --> 01:33:21,992
I should probably
go see what Jane's up to.

942
01:33:33,128 --> 01:33:35,380
<i>Where did you get that?</i>

943
01:33:37,340 --> 01:33:40,427
- <i>From my job.</i>
- Don't lie to me.

944
01:33:43,054 --> 01:33:46,016
Now, I saw you with him.

945
01:33:46,099 --> 01:33:48,518
You were watching me?

946
01:33:49,686 --> 01:33:51,938
What does he make you do?

947
01:33:52,022 --> 01:33:54,482
Oh.

948
01:33:54,566 --> 01:33:57,319
Dad, you don't really think
me and Mr. Burnham...

949
01:33:57,402 --> 01:34:00,613
Don't you laugh at me!

950
01:34:00,697 --> 01:34:05,618
I will not sit back and watch
my only son become a cock sucker!

951
01:34:05,702 --> 01:34:07,620
Jesus, what is it with you?

952
01:34:10,373 --> 01:34:12,709
I swear to God...

953
01:34:12,792 --> 01:34:15,503
I'll throw you out of this house
and never look at you again!

954
01:34:15,587 --> 01:34:19,632
- You mean that.
- You're damn straight I do!

955
01:34:19,716 --> 01:34:23,636
I'd rather you were dead
than be a fuckin' faggot!

956
01:34:34,814 --> 01:34:37,067
You're right.

957
01:34:40,403 --> 01:34:43,365
- I suck dick for money.
- Boy, don't start.

958
01:34:43,448 --> 01:34:47,327
- Two thousand dollars. I'm that good.
- Get out!

959
01:34:47,410 --> 01:34:51,873
You should see me fuck. I'm the
best piece of ass in three states.

960
01:34:51,956 --> 01:34:55,752
Damn it, get out!
I don't ever want to see you again.

961
01:35:01,675 --> 01:35:05,679
What a sad...
old man you are.

962
01:35:06,930 --> 01:35:08,848
Get out.

963
01:35:34,749 --> 01:35:38,378
Mom... I'm leaving.

964
01:35:38,461 --> 01:35:40,630
Okay.

965
01:35:43,299 --> 01:35:45,301
Wear a raincoat.

966
01:35:52,392 --> 01:35:55,312
I wish things would have
been better for you.

967
01:35:59,316 --> 01:36:01,318
Take care of Dad.

968
01:36:33,266 --> 01:36:35,810
<i>...disinvesting problems of power...</i>

969
01:36:35,894 --> 01:36:38,730
<i>and removing their ability</i>
<i>to make us afraid.</i>

970
01:36:38,813 --> 01:36:42,150
<i>This is the secret</i>
<i>to "Me-Centered Living."</i>

971
01:36:42,233 --> 01:36:44,944
<i>Only by taking</i>

972
01:36:45,028 --> 01:36:47,405
<i>for your actions</i>
<i>and their solutions...</i>

973
01:36:47,489 --> 01:36:51,451
<i>will you ever break free</i>
<i>from the constant cycle of victimhood.</i>

974
01:36:51,534 --> 01:36:56,956
You are only a victim if you choose
to be a victim. We all have the power...

975
01:36:57,040 --> 01:36:59,668
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>we can be friends any more!</i>

976
01:36:59,751 --> 01:37:01,670
<i>You're too uptight about sex.</i>

977
01:37:01,753 --> 01:37:05,090
Just don't fuck my dad,
all right?

978
01:37:05,173 --> 01:37:07,300
- Please?
- Why not?

979
01:37:07,384 --> 01:37:10,804
Dad, leave us alone!

980
01:37:10,887 --> 01:37:13,348
<i>It's me.</i>

981
01:37:13,431 --> 01:37:16,726
- If I had to leave tonight, would you come with me?
- What?

982
01:37:16,810 --> 01:37:20,397
If I had to go to New York to live,
tonight, would you come with me?

983
01:37:22,065 --> 01:37:24,109
Yes.

984
01:37:24,192 --> 01:37:28,655
<i>You guys can't be serious. You're just</i>
<i>a kid, and he's, like, a mental case.</i>

985
01:37:28,738 --> 01:37:32,659
- <i>You'll end up living in a box on the street.</i>
- I'm no more a kid than you are.

986
01:37:32,742 --> 01:37:35,954
- <i>We can use my plastic surgery money.</i>
- We won't have to.

987
01:37:36,037 --> 01:37:39,749
I have over $40,000. I know people
in the city that can help us get set up.

988
01:37:39,833 --> 01:37:43,003
- What, other drug dealers?
- Yes.

989
01:37:43,086 --> 01:37:46,089
- You'd be out of your mind to go with him.
- Why do you even care?

990
01:37:46,172 --> 01:37:49,175
- Because you're my friend.
- She's not your friend.

991
01:37:49,259 --> 01:37:51,511
She's someone you use
to feel better about yourself.

992
01:37:51,594 --> 01:37:55,015
- Go fuck yourself, psycho!
- Hey, shut up, bitch!

993
01:37:55,098 --> 01:37:58,184
- Jane, he's a freak!
- Well, then so am I!

994
01:37:58,268 --> 01:38:01,604
We'll always be freaks,
and we'll never be like other people!

995
01:38:01,688 --> 01:38:05,400
And you'll never be a freak
'cause you're just... too perfect!

996
01:38:05,483 --> 01:38:09,779
Yeah, well,
at least I'm not ugly.

997
01:38:11,614 --> 01:38:13,742
Yes, you are.

998
01:38:13,825 --> 01:38:17,370
And you're boring,
and you're totally ordinary,

999
01:38:17,454 --> 01:38:20,040
<i>and you know it.</i>

1000
01:38:22,417 --> 01:38:24,586
You two deserve each other.

1001
01:39:25,271 --> 01:39:27,691
Jesus, man,
you're soaked.

1002
01:39:38,284 --> 01:39:42,205
You want me to get Ricky?
He's in Jane's room.

1003
01:39:43,540 --> 01:39:45,667
Are you okay?

1004
01:39:45,750 --> 01:39:47,711
Where's your wife?

1005
01:39:49,254 --> 01:39:51,339
Uh, I don't know.

1006
01:39:51,423 --> 01:39:55,385
Probably out fucking that dorky
Prince of Real Estate asshole.

1007
01:39:56,720 --> 01:39:59,306
And you know what?

1008
01:39:59,389 --> 01:40:01,349
I don't care.

1009
01:40:11,735 --> 01:40:14,654
Your wife is
with another man, and...

1010
01:40:14,738 --> 01:40:16,823
you don't care?

1011
01:40:19,075 --> 01:40:21,494
Nope.

1012
01:40:21,578 --> 01:40:24,331
Our marriage is just for show.

1013
01:40:24,414 --> 01:40:27,584
A commercial
for how normal we are...

1014
01:40:27,667 --> 01:40:29,878
when we're anything but.

1015
01:40:37,510 --> 01:40:39,679
Jesus, man,
you are shaking.

1016
01:40:39,763 --> 01:40:43,600
We really ought to get you
out of these clothes.

1017
01:40:43,683 --> 01:40:46,519
Yeah.

1018
01:40:46,603 --> 01:40:49,689
It's okay.

1019
01:40:52,108 --> 01:40:55,362
I... am...

1020
01:40:55,445 --> 01:40:58,448
You just tell me what you need.

1021
01:41:01,660 --> 01:41:04,204
It's okay.

1022
01:41:19,552 --> 01:41:21,805
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1023
01:41:25,392 --> 01:41:27,852
I'm sorry.

1024
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:30,438
Y-You got the wrong idea.

1025
01:42:07,350 --> 01:42:09,853
<i>"I refuse to be a victim."</i>

1026
01:42:09,936 --> 01:42:12,188
<i>When this becomes your mantra,</i>

1027
01:42:12,272 --> 01:42:15,233
<i>constantly reinforcing</i>
<i>your new non...</i>

1028
01:42:17,944 --> 01:42:21,364
I refuse to be a victim!

1029
01:43:05,116 --> 01:43:08,370
I hope you don't mind
if I play the stereo.

1030
01:43:08,453 --> 01:43:10,705
<i>Not at all.</i>

1031
01:43:10,789 --> 01:43:13,458
Bad night?

1032
01:43:13,541 --> 01:43:16,628
<i>Not really bad, just...</i>

1033
01:43:16,711 --> 01:43:18,713
strange.

1034
01:43:18,797 --> 01:43:23,510
<i>Believe me, it couldn't possibly be</i>
<i>any stranger than mine.</i>

1035
01:43:30,642 --> 01:43:34,562
Jane and I had a fight.

1036
01:43:34,646 --> 01:43:36,773
It was about you.

1037
01:43:39,401 --> 01:43:42,529
<i>She's mad at me because...</i>

1038
01:43:42,612 --> 01:43:44,906
I said I think you're sexy.

1039
01:43:46,992 --> 01:43:49,077
Do you want a sip?

1040
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:51,746
Sure.

1041
01:44:19,441 --> 01:44:22,944
So.

1042
01:44:23,028 --> 01:44:26,239
You gonna tell me?

1043
01:44:29,701 --> 01:44:32,245
What do you want?

1044
01:44:35,206 --> 01:44:38,960
I don't know.

1045
01:44:39,044 --> 01:44:43,590
You... don't know?

1046
01:44:43,673 --> 01:44:47,135
What do you want?

1047
01:44:47,218 --> 01:44:50,221
Are you kidding?

1048
01:44:50,305 --> 01:44:53,516
I want you.

1049
01:44:56,186 --> 01:44:59,898
I've wanted you since
the first moment I saw you.

1050
01:45:02,317 --> 01:45:05,862
You are the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.

1051
01:45:13,495 --> 01:45:16,831
You don't think I'm ordinary?

1052
01:45:18,708 --> 01:45:22,629
You couldn't be ordinary if you tried.

1053
01:45:25,048 --> 01:45:27,801
Thank you.

1054
01:45:27,884 --> 01:45:32,472
I don't think there's anything
worse than being ordinary.

1055
01:45:49,990 --> 01:45:52,492
I refuse to be a victim.

1056
01:45:52,575 --> 01:45:55,996
I refuse to be a victim.
I refuse to be a victim.

1057
01:45:56,079 --> 01:45:58,164
Lester,

1058
01:45:58,248 --> 01:46:01,042
I have something
I have to say to you.

1059
01:46:49,966 --> 01:46:53,219
Are you scared?

1060
01:46:53,303 --> 01:46:55,764
I don't get scared.

1061
01:46:58,391 --> 01:47:01,144
My parents will try
to find me.

1062
01:47:01,227 --> 01:47:04,272
Mine won't.

1063
01:47:24,501 --> 01:47:27,462
This is my first time.

1064
01:47:29,964 --> 01:47:32,092
You're kidding.

1065
01:47:32,175 --> 01:47:34,177
I'm sorry.

1066
01:47:34,260 --> 01:47:36,888
I still want to do it.

1067
01:47:36,972 --> 01:47:40,266
I just... thought
I should tell you...

1068
01:47:40,350 --> 01:47:42,560
in case you wondered why I...

1069
01:47:42,644 --> 01:47:45,480
I wasn't... better.

1070
01:47:58,660 --> 01:48:00,912
What's wrong?

1071
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:10,755
<i>I thought you said</i>
<i>I was beautiful.</i>

1072
01:48:10,839 --> 01:48:12,882
You <i>are</i> beautiful.

1073
01:48:15,593 --> 01:48:19,222
You are so... beautiful.

1074
01:48:22,559 --> 01:48:25,020
And I would be a very...

1075
01:48:25,103 --> 01:48:27,063
lucky man.

1076
01:48:28,398 --> 01:48:31,026
I feel so stupid.

1077
01:48:31,109 --> 01:48:33,611
Don't.

1078
01:48:33,695 --> 01:48:36,740
- Shh.
- I'm sorry.

1079
01:48:36,823 --> 01:48:40,827
You have nothing
to be sorry about.

1080
01:48:40,910 --> 01:48:43,830
It's okay.

1081
01:48:43,913 --> 01:48:47,208
Everything's okay.

1082
01:49:02,265 --> 01:49:05,018
Wow, I was starving.

1083
01:49:05,101 --> 01:49:09,606
- Do you want me to make you another one?
- No, no, no. I'm fine.

1084
01:49:09,689 --> 01:49:12,025
You sure?

1085
01:49:12,108 --> 01:49:17,113
I'm still a little weirded out,
but I feel better. Thanks.

1086
01:49:20,575 --> 01:49:24,287
- How's Jane?
- What do you mean?

1087
01:49:25,789 --> 01:49:28,249
I mean,

1088
01:49:28,333 --> 01:49:30,710
how's her life?

1089
01:49:30,794 --> 01:49:32,921
Is she happy?

1090
01:49:33,004 --> 01:49:36,174
Is she miserable?

1091
01:49:36,257 --> 01:49:40,804
I'd really like to know, and she'd die
before she'd ever tell me about it.

1092
01:49:43,139 --> 01:49:46,393
She's, uh...

1093
01:49:46,476 --> 01:49:49,521
She's really happy.

1094
01:49:49,604 --> 01:49:53,149
She thinks she's in love.

1095
01:50:03,868 --> 01:50:07,163
Good for her.

1096
01:50:08,999 --> 01:50:10,917
How are you?

1097
01:50:18,883 --> 01:50:22,345
It's been a long time
since anybody asked me that.

1098
01:50:28,768 --> 01:50:31,479
I'm great.

1099
01:50:37,193 --> 01:50:40,196
I've gotta go to the bathroom.

1100
01:50:52,959 --> 01:50:55,295
I'm great.

1101
01:51:29,579 --> 01:51:32,666
Man, oh man.

1102
01:51:34,542 --> 01:51:37,379
Man, oh man, oh man.

1103
01:52:12,622 --> 01:52:15,083
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1104
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,127
Wow.

1105
01:53:00,712 --> 01:53:03,465
<i>I had always</i>
<i>heard your entire life flashes...</i>

1106
01:53:03,548 --> 01:53:07,427
<i>in front of your eyes</i>
<i>the second before you die.</i>

1107
01:53:07,510 --> 01:53:10,263
<i>First of all,</i>
<i>that one second...</i>

1108
01:53:10,347 --> 01:53:13,099
<i>isn't a second at all.</i>

1109
01:53:13,183 --> 01:53:15,268
<i>It stretches on forever,</i>

1110
01:53:15,352 --> 01:53:18,188
<i>like an ocean of time.</i>

1111
01:53:20,148 --> 01:53:23,151
<i>For me, it was</i>
<i>lying on my back...</i>

1112
01:53:23,234 --> 01:53:27,113
<i>at Boy Scout camp,</i>
<i>watching falling stars.</i>

1113
01:53:35,497 --> 01:53:38,750
<i>And yellow leaves</i>
<i>from the maple trees...</i>

1114
01:53:38,833 --> 01:53:41,252
<i>that lined our street.</i>

1115
01:53:50,053 --> 01:53:53,306
<i>Or my grandmother's hands</i>
<i>and the way her skin...</i>

1116
01:53:53,390 --> 01:53:55,725
<i>seemed like paper.</i>

1117
01:54:02,983 --> 01:54:06,736
<i>And the first time</i>
<i>I saw my cousin Tony's...</i>

1118
01:54:06,820 --> 01:54:09,781
<i>brand-new Firebird.</i>

1119
01:54:21,501 --> 01:54:23,586
<i>And Janie.</i>

1120
01:54:25,005 --> 01:54:26,923
<i>And Janie.</i>

1121
01:54:58,913 --> 01:55:01,291
<i>And... Carolyn.</i>

1122
01:55:06,296 --> 01:55:10,050
<i>I guess I could be pretty pissed off</i>
<i>about what happened to me,</i>

1123
01:55:10,133 --> 01:55:15,639
<i>but it's hard to stay mad when</i>
<i>there's so much beauty in the world.</i>

1124
01:55:15,722 --> 01:55:20,894
<i>Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing</i>
<i>it all at once and it's too much.</i>

1125
01:55:20,977 --> 01:55:26,066
<i>My heart fills up like a balloon</i>
<i>that's about to burst.</i>

1126
01:55:26,149 --> 01:55:30,236
<i>And then I remember</i>
<i>to relax...</i>

1127
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:33,406
<i>and stop trying</i>
<i>to hold on to it.</i>

1128
01:55:33,490 --> 01:55:37,077
<i>And then it flows</i>
<i>through me like rain,</i>

1129
01:55:37,160 --> 01:55:40,830
<i>and I can't feel anything</i>
<i>but gratitude...</i>

1130
01:55:40,914 --> 01:55:43,083
<i>for every single moment...</i>

1131
01:55:43,166 --> 01:55:47,087
<i>of my stupid little life.</i>

1132
01:55:47,170 --> 01:55:50,590
<i>You have no idea what</i>
<i>I'm talking about, I'm sure.</i>

1133
01:55:50,674 --> 01:55:52,676
<i>But don't worry.</i>

1134
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:56,096
<i>You will someday.</i>

1135
01:55:57,760 --> 01:56:12,760
<i> Hope, you enjoyed the movie!</i>
<i>       regards, shock... </i>
