2
00:00:58,484 --> 00:01:03,447
All right, everyone! This is a stickup!
Don't anybody move!

3
00:01:04,573 --> 00:01:06,450
Now empty that safe.

4
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,041
- Money, money, money!
- Stop it! Stop it, you mean old potato.

5
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:17,253
Quiet, Bo Peep,
or your sheep get run over!

6
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:19,213
Help! Baa! Help us!

7
00:01:19,338 --> 00:01:23,009
Oh, no, not my sheep!
Somebody, do something!

8
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,435
<i>Reach for the sky.</i>

9
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,562
Oh, no! Sheriff Woody!

10
00:01:34,687 --> 00:01:37,356
I'm here to stop you,
One-Eyed Bart.

11
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:41,736
- How'd you know it was me?
- Are you gonna come quietly?

12
00:01:41,861 --> 00:01:42,862
You can't touch me, Sheriff.

13
00:01:42,862 --> 00:01:46,574
I brought my attack dog with
the built-in force field.

14
00:01:46,699 --> 00:01:50,244
Well, I brought my dinosaur
who eats force-field dogs.

15
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:52,413
- Yipe, yipe, yipe, yipe!

16
00:01:52,997 --> 00:01:56,834
You're going to jail, Bart.
Say good-bye to the wife and tater tots.

17
00:02:06,135 --> 00:02:08,429
You saved the day again, Woody.

18
00:02:08,554 --> 00:02:11,432
<i>You're my favorite deputy.</i>

19
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:17,605
<i># You've got a friend in me #</i>

20
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,690
Come on, let's wrangle up
the cattle.

21
00:02:19,815 --> 00:02:22,693
<i># When the road looks
rough ahead #</i>

22
00:02:22,818 --> 00:02:26,739
<i># And you're miles and miles
from your nice, warm bed #</i>

23
00:02:26,864 --> 00:02:27,740
Round 'em up, cowboy.

24
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,118
<i># Just remember what your old pal said #</i>

25
00:02:31,243 --> 00:02:33,079
<i># Boy, you've got a friend in me #</i>

26
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:34,956
Yee-haw!

27
00:02:35,081 --> 00:02:37,291
<i># Yeah, you've got a friend in me #</i>

28
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,502
Hey, cowboy!

29
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:43,714
<i># Some other folks might be
a little bit smarter than I am #</i>

30
00:02:43,714 --> 00:02:45,549
<i># Big and stronger too #</i>

31
00:02:45,675 --> 00:02:46,509
Come on, Woody.

32
00:02:46,509 --> 00:02:47,969
<i># Maybe #</i>

33
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:53,140
<i># But none of them will ever
love you the way I do #</i>

34
00:02:53,266 --> 00:02:55,851
<i># It's me and you, boy #</i>

35
00:02:55,977 --> 00:02:59,230
<i># And as the years go by #</i>

36
00:02:59,355 --> 00:03:03,442
<i># Our friendship will never die #</i>

37
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:08,781
<i># You're gonna see
it's our destiny #</i>

38
00:03:08,906 --> 00:03:10,324
<i># You've got a friend in me #</i>

39
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:11,742
All right!

40
00:03:11,867 --> 00:03:14,078
<i># Yeah, you've got a friend in me #</i>

41
00:03:14,078 --> 00:03:16,747
Score!

42
00:03:16,872 --> 00:03:18,165
<i># You've got a friend in me #</i>

43
00:03:17,957 --> 00:03:19,458
Wow! Cool!

44
00:03:19,584 --> 00:03:22,670
- What do you think?
- Oh, this looks great, Mom!

45
00:03:22,795 --> 00:03:23,671
Okay, birthday boy.

46
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:26,048
We saw that at the store!
I asked you for it!

47
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:27,341
- I hope I have enough places.
- Wow, look at that! That's so...

48
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:28,551
- Oh, my gosh, you got...
- One, two... four.

49
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:31,012
Yeah,
I think that's going to be enough.

50
00:03:31,053 --> 00:03:33,264
- Can we leave this up 'til we move?
- Well, sure.

51
00:03:33,306 --> 00:03:34,390
- We can leave it up.
- Yeah!

52
00:03:34,473 --> 00:03:35,516
Now go get Molly.

53
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:36,726
Your friends are gonna
be here any minute.

54
00:03:36,767 --> 00:03:39,770
- Okay!
- It's party time, Woody.

55
00:03:40,104 --> 00:03:42,982
<i>Yee-haw!</i>

56
00:03:49,238 --> 00:03:51,574
Howdy, little lady.

57
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,038
<i>Somebody's poisoned
the water hole.</i>

58
00:03:57,955 --> 00:04:00,750
Come on, Molly.
Oh, you're getting heavy.

59
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,085
See you later, Woody!

60
00:04:10,468 --> 00:04:14,096
Pull my string!
The birthday party's today?

61
00:04:15,306 --> 00:04:18,434
Okay, everybody,
coast is clear!

62
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:27,401
Ages three and up.
It's on my box.

63
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:29,236
<b>"Ages three and up."</b>

64
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:31,614
I'm not supposed to be
baby-sitting Princess Drool.

65
00:04:44,085 --> 00:04:46,796
Hey, Hamm, look.
I'm Picasso!

66
00:04:46,921 --> 00:04:50,341
- I don't get it.
- You uncultured swine.

67
00:04:50,466 --> 00:04:53,344
What are you looking at,
ya hockey puck?

68
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:59,934
- Uh, hey, Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
- Sir! No, sir!

69
00:05:00,059 --> 00:05:02,061
Okay. Hey, thank you.
At ease.

70
00:05:04,272 --> 00:05:08,484
- Hey, uh, Slinky?
- Right here, Woody. I-I'm red this time.

71
00:05:08,526 --> 00:05:09,944
No, S-Slink...

72
00:05:09,944 --> 00:05:11,487
Oh, well, all right.
You can be red if you want.

73
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:13,990
N-Not now, Slink.
I got some bad news.

74
00:05:14,115 --> 00:05:17,201
- Bad news?
- Shh, shh, shh!

75
00:05:17,243 --> 00:05:19,120
Just gather everyone up for a
staff meeting, and be happy.

76
00:05:19,537 --> 00:05:20,579
Got it.

77
00:05:20,496 --> 00:05:22,582
Be happy!

78
00:05:22,707 --> 00:05:27,086
Staff meeting, everybody!
Snake, Robot, podium, please.

79
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:32,592
Hey, Etch. Draw!

80
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,929
Oh! Got me again.

81
00:05:37,054 --> 00:05:40,600
Etch, you've been working on that draw.
Fastest knobs in the West.

82
00:05:40,725 --> 00:05:44,186
Uh, got a staff meeting,
you guys. Come on, let's go.

83
00:05:44,312 --> 00:05:46,188
Now, where is that... Oh.

84
00:05:46,314 --> 00:05:48,691
Hey, who moved my doodle pad
way over here?

85
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:54,655
- Uh, how're you doin', Rex?
- Were you scared? Tell me honestly.

86
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,699
I was close to being scared
that time.

87
00:05:56,824 --> 00:06:00,494
Oh, I'm going for fearsome here,
but I just don't feel it!

88
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,788
I think I'm just
coming off as annoying.

89
00:06:04,165 --> 00:06:05,958
Ow! Oh, hi, Bo. Hi.

90
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:09,211
I wanted to thank you, Woody,
for saving my flock.

91
00:06:09,337 --> 00:06:11,631
Oh, hey, it was, uh, nothin'.

92
00:06:11,756 --> 00:06:17,011
What do you say I get someone else
to watch the sheep tonight?

93
00:06:17,136 --> 00:06:19,555
Oh, yeah.
I...

94
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,809
Remember, I'm just
a couple of blocks away.

95
00:06:25,186 --> 00:06:27,146
Come on, come on.
Smaller toys up front.

96
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:30,900
Hey, Woody, come on.

97
00:06:37,281 --> 00:06:41,202
Oh, thanks, Mike.
Okay... Oh, whoa. Step back.

98
00:06:41,327 --> 00:06:43,746
- For crying out loud.
- Okay. Thank you.

99
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:47,833
Hello. Check.
That better? Great.

100
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:50,753
Everybody hear me?
Up on the shelf, can you hear me? Great.

101
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:54,215
Okay, first item today:

102
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,426
uh, oh, yeah... has everyone picked
a moving buddy?

103
00:06:57,551 --> 00:06:59,887
- What?
- Moving buddy? You can't be serious.

104
00:06:59,929 --> 00:07:02,223
Well, I didn't know we were
supposed to have one already.

105
00:07:02,223 --> 00:07:04,058
Do we have to hold hands?

106
00:07:04,058 --> 00:07:07,228
- Oh, yeah.
- You guys think this is a big joke.

107
00:07:07,353 --> 00:07:09,397
We've only got one week
left before the move.

108
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,440
I don't want any toys left behind.

109
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:15,319
A moving buddy.
If you don't have one, get one!

110
00:07:15,444 --> 00:07:18,531
All right, next.
Uh, oh, yes.

111
00:07:18,656 --> 00:07:21,826
Tuesday night's plastic
corrosion awareness meeting...

112
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:24,537
was, I think,
a big success,

113
00:07:24,662 --> 00:07:27,456
and we want to thank Mr. Spell
for putting that on for us.

114
00:07:27,582 --> 00:07:30,293
<i>- Thank you, Mr. Spell.
You're welcome.</i>

115
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:33,671
Okay. Uh, oh, yes.
One, uh, minor note here.

116
00:07:33,796 --> 00:07:36,465
Andy's birthday party
has been moved to today.

117
00:07:36,591 --> 00:07:38,259
Uh, next we have...
- Wait a minute.

118
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:39,969
What do you mean the party's today?

119
00:07:40,094 --> 00:07:42,638
- His birthday's not 'til next week!
- What's goin' on down there?

120
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:44,098
Is his mom losin' her marbles?

121
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:47,977
Well, obviously, she wanted to
have the party before the move.

122
00:07:48,102 --> 00:07:49,770
- I'm not worried.
- You shouldn't be worried.

123
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,480
Of course Woody ain't worried.

124
00:07:51,397 --> 00:07:53,691
He's been Andy's favorite
since kindergarten.

125
00:07:53,524 --> 00:07:55,818
- Hey, hey.
- Come on, Potato Head.

126
00:07:55,943 --> 00:07:59,572
If Woody says it's all right, then,
well, darn it, it's good enough for me.

127
00:07:59,697 --> 00:08:02,074
Woody has never
steered us wrong before.

128
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:05,828
Come on, guys. Every Christmas
and birthday we go through this.

129
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:08,998
But what if Andy gets
another dinosaur, a mean one?

130
00:08:09,123 --> 00:08:11,834
I just don't think I could take
that kind of rejection!

131
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:14,211
Hey, listen.
No one's getting replaced.

132
00:08:14,337 --> 00:08:17,173
This is Andy
we're talking about.

133
00:08:17,298 --> 00:08:20,718
It doesn't matter how much
we're played with.

134
00:08:23,471 --> 00:08:26,474
What matters is that we're here
for Andy when he needs us.

135
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:28,517
That's what we're
made for, right?

136
00:08:28,643 --> 00:08:32,521
Pardon me. I hate to break up
the staff meeting, but they're here!

137
00:08:32,647 --> 00:08:35,191
- Birthday guests at three o'clock!
- Stay calm, everyone!

138
00:08:36,734 --> 00:08:40,029
Hey!

139
00:08:40,154 --> 00:08:42,198
Uh, meeting adjourned.

140
00:08:41,072 --> 00:08:44,283
Ho, boy, will you take a
look at all those presents?

141
00:08:44,408 --> 00:08:45,868
I can't see a thing.

142
00:08:49,413 --> 00:08:52,416
Yes, sir. We're next month's
garage sale fodder for sure.

143
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,378
- Any dinosaur-shaped ones?
- Oh, for crying out loud.

144
00:08:55,503 --> 00:08:58,673
- They're all in boxes, you idiot.
- They're getting bigger!

145
00:08:58,798 --> 00:09:00,466
Wait, there's a nice
little one over there.

146
00:09:00,466 --> 00:09:02,176
<i>Hi!</i>

147
00:09:05,263 --> 00:09:07,139
<i> Spell: trash can.
- We're doomed!</i>

148
00:09:07,181 --> 00:09:09,433
All right. All right!

149
00:09:09,517 --> 00:09:12,895
If I send out the troops,
will you all calm down?

150
00:09:12,937 --> 00:09:16,649
- Yes! Yes! We promise!
- Okay! Save your batteries.

151
00:09:16,774 --> 00:09:19,193
Eh, very good, Woody.
That's using the old noodle.

152
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:25,741
Sergeant, establish a recon post
downstairs. Code Red!

153
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:28,786
- You know what to do.
- Yes, sir!

154
00:09:28,911 --> 00:09:30,955
All right, men.
You heard him. Code Red!

155
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,208
Repeat: we are at Code Red.
Recon plan Charlie. Execute!

156
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,377
Let's move, move,
move, move, move!

157
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,777
Okay. Come on, kids.
Everyone in the living room.

158
00:10:01,819 --> 00:10:03,613
It's almost time for the presents.

159
00:10:25,384 --> 00:10:27,595
All right, gangway, gangway.

160
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,806
And this is how we find out...

161
00:10:30,932 --> 00:10:33,142
what is in those presents.

162
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:40,983
Okay! Who's hungry?

163
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:45,029
Here come the chips!
I've got Cool Ranch and barbecue! Ow!

164
00:10:45,154 --> 00:10:50,326
What in the world? Oh!
I thought I told him to pick these up.

165
00:10:50,451 --> 00:10:52,912
Shouldn't they be there by now?
What's taking them so long?

166
00:10:53,037 --> 00:10:56,540
Hey, these guys are professionals.
They're the best.

167
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:59,126
Come on. They're not
lying down on the job.

168
00:11:09,929 --> 00:11:12,056
G-Go on without me.
Just go.

169
00:11:12,056 --> 00:11:15,351
A good soldier never
leaves a man behind.

170
00:11:32,785 --> 00:11:35,454
Okay, everybody.
Come on.

171
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:39,458
Settle down. Now, kids.
Everybody... You sit in a circle.

172
00:11:39,584 --> 00:11:42,044
No, Andy. Andy, you sit
in the middle there.

173
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:46,340
Good. And which present
are you gonna open first?

174
00:11:47,592 --> 00:11:50,261
There they are.

175
00:11:50,386 --> 00:11:51,971
<i>Come in, Mother Bird.
This is Alpha Bravo.</i>

176
00:11:51,971 --> 00:11:53,598
<i>- This is it! This is it!
- Come in, Mother Bird.</i>

177
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,849
<i>- Quiet, quiet, quiet!
- All right</i>

178
00:11:54,849 --> 00:11:57,685
<i>Andy's opening
the first present now.</i>

179
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:01,230
Mrs. Potato Head! Mrs. Potato Head!
Mrs. Potato Head!

180
00:12:01,272 --> 00:12:04,066
<i>- Hey, I can dream, can't I?
- The bow's coming off.</i>

181
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:07,236
<i>He's ripping the wrapping paper.
It's a... It's... It's a...</i>

182
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:09,614
<i>A lunch box.
We've got a lunch box here.</i>

183
00:12:09,739 --> 00:12:11,157
A lunch box?

184
00:12:10,448 --> 00:12:12,575
- A lunch box?
- For the lunch.

185
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,910
<i>Okay, second present.
It appears to be...</i>

186
00:12:15,036 --> 00:12:17,997
<i>- Okay, it's bed sheets.
- Who invited that kid?</i>

187
00:12:23,085 --> 00:12:25,504
Oh! Only one left.

188
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:28,007
<i>- Okay, we're on the last present now.
- Last present!</i>

189
00:12:28,132 --> 00:12:32,845
<i>It's a big one. It's a...
It's a board game! Repeat: Battleship.</i>

190
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,097
- Yay!
- Hallelujah!

191
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:37,141
- Yeah, all right.
- Hey! Watch it!

192
00:12:37,141 --> 00:12:39,101
Sorry there, old spud head.

193
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:42,939
Mission accomplished. Well done, men.
Pack it up. We're goin' home.

194
00:12:43,064 --> 00:12:45,524
So did I tell you? Huh?
Nothin' to worry about.

195
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:49,695
I knew you were right all along, Woody.
Never doubted you for a second.

196
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:53,282
Wait a minute.
Oh, what do we have here? Ohh!

197
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:55,534
Wait!
Turn that thing back on!

198
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,536
<i>Come in, Mother Bird.
Come in, Mother Bird.</i>

199
00:12:57,662 --> 00:13:00,289
<i>Mom has pulled a surprise
present from the closet.</i>

200
00:13:00,414 --> 00:13:03,042
<i>Andy's opening it.
He's really excited about this one.</i>

201
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:05,044
- Mom! What is it?
- It's a huge package.

202
00:13:05,169 --> 00:13:08,297
Oh, get outta the... One of the kids
is in the way. I can't see.

203
00:13:08,422 --> 00:13:11,467
It's a...

204
00:13:12,927 --> 00:13:16,639
It's a what?
What is it?

205
00:13:16,764 --> 00:13:18,140
- Oh, no!
- Oh, ya big lizard!

206
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,558
Now we'll never know what it is!

207
00:13:19,684 --> 00:13:21,060
Way to go, Rex!

208
00:13:21,143 --> 00:13:22,770
- No, no! Turn 'em around!
Turn 'em around!

209
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:23,729
Oh, he's puttin'
'em in backwards.

210
00:13:23,729 --> 00:13:24,981
You're... You're
puttin' 'em in backwards!

211
00:13:25,106 --> 00:13:28,276
Plus is positive,
minus is negative! Oh, let me!

212
00:13:30,236 --> 00:13:32,321
Let's go to my room, guys!

213
00:13:32,363 --> 00:13:35,992
<i>Red alert! Red alert!
Andy is coming upstairs!</i>

214
00:13:35,908 --> 00:13:37,243
<i>- There!
- Juvenile intrusion. </i>

215
00:13:37,243 --> 00:13:39,203
<i>Repeat,
resume your positions now!</i>

216
00:13:39,328 --> 00:13:42,039
Andy's coming, everybody!
Back to your places! Hurry!

217
00:13:42,164 --> 00:13:44,041
Get to your places!
Get to your places!

218
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,294
Where's my ear? Who's seen my ear?
Did you see my ear?

219
00:13:46,419 --> 00:13:50,089
Out of my way! Here I come!
Here I come! Ohh!

220
00:13:59,849 --> 00:14:02,435
Hey, look!
Its lasers light up.

221
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,645
- Take that, Zurg!
- Quick, make a space.

222
00:14:04,645 --> 00:14:06,981
This is where the spaceship lands.

223
00:14:07,106 --> 00:14:09,358
And he does it back, and he does
a karate-chop action.

224
00:14:09,483 --> 00:14:12,361
Come on down, guys!
It's time for games!

225
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:14,822
- We got prizes!
- Oh, yeah!

226
00:14:26,042 --> 00:14:27,793
- What is it?
- Can you see it?

227
00:14:27,793 --> 00:14:29,128
What the heck is up there?

228
00:14:29,253 --> 00:14:32,214
Woody, who's up there
with ya?

229
00:14:33,925 --> 00:14:36,469
Woody, what are you
doing under the bed?

230
00:14:36,594 --> 00:14:37,595
Uh, nothin'.
Uh, nothin'.

231
00:14:37,595 --> 00:14:40,514
I'm sure Andy was just a
little excited, that's all.

232
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,392
Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose.
It's just a mistake!

233
00:14:43,517 --> 00:14:47,271
Well, that mistake is sitting
in your spot, Woody.

234
00:14:47,396 --> 00:14:50,524
- Oh! Have you been replaced?
- Hey, what did I tell you earlier?

235
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,610
No one is getting replaced.

236
00:14:52,735 --> 00:14:56,280
Now, let's all be polite
and give whatever it is up there...

237
00:14:56,405 --> 00:15:00,034
a nice, big
Andy's-room welcome.

238
00:15:25,393 --> 00:15:28,312
Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.
Come in, Star Command.

239
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,941
Star Command, come in.
Do you read me?

240
00:15:32,066 --> 00:15:34,485
Why don't they answer?

241
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,487
My ship!

242
00:15:38,322 --> 00:15:41,575
Blast! This'll take
weeks to repair.

243
00:15:41,701 --> 00:15:44,996
Buzz Lightyear mission log,
stardate 4-0-7-2.

244
00:15:45,121 --> 00:15:48,165
My ship has run off course
en route to sector 12.

245
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,793
I've crash-landed
on a strange planet.

246
00:15:50,918 --> 00:15:53,421
The impact must've awoken me
from hypersleep.

247
00:15:55,673 --> 00:15:58,884
Terrain seems
a bit unstable.

248
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:01,220
No readout yet
if the air is breathable.

249
00:16:01,262 --> 00:16:04,056
And there seems to be no sign
of intelligent life anywhere.

250
00:16:04,265 --> 00:16:06,642
Hello!

251
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:10,438
Whoa! He-Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Did I frighten you?

252
00:16:10,563 --> 00:16:13,816
Didn't mean to. Sorry.
Howdy. My name is Woody...

253
00:16:13,941 --> 00:16:16,110
and this is Andy's room.

254
00:16:16,235 --> 00:16:18,112
That's all I wanted to say.

255
00:16:18,237 --> 00:16:20,531
And also, there has been
a bit of a mix-up.

256
00:16:20,656 --> 00:16:22,992
This is my spot, see...
the bed here.

257
00:16:23,117 --> 00:16:25,578
Local law enforcement.
It's about time you got here.

258
00:16:25,703 --> 00:16:28,456
I'm Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger,
Universe Protection Unit.

259
00:16:28,581 --> 00:16:30,791
My ship has crash-landed
here by mistake.

260
00:16:30,917 --> 00:16:34,545
Yes, it is a mistake, because,
you see, the bed here is my spot.

261
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,547
I need to repair
my turbo boosters.

262
00:16:36,672 --> 00:16:39,508
Do you people still use fossil fuels, or
have you discovered crystallic fusion?

263
00:16:39,634 --> 00:16:42,345
Well, let's see.
We got double-A's.

264
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,972
- Watch yourself! Halt! Who goes there?
- Don't shoot!

265
00:16:45,097 --> 00:16:47,725
- It's okay. Friends.
- Do you know these life-forms?

266
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,519
Yes. They're Andy's toys.

267
00:16:50,645 --> 00:16:52,647
All right, everyone.
You're clear to come up.

268
00:16:52,772 --> 00:16:55,566
I am Buzz Lightyear.
I come in peace.

269
00:16:55,691 --> 00:16:58,903
Oh, I'm so glad
you're not a dinosaur!

270
00:16:59,028 --> 00:17:01,572
All right, thank you.

271
00:17:01,697 --> 00:17:04,200
Now, thank you all
for your kind welcome.

272
00:17:04,325 --> 00:17:07,620
- Say, what's that button do?
- I'll show you.

273
00:17:07,745 --> 00:17:10,164
<i>- Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.
- Wow!</i>

274
00:17:10,289 --> 00:17:13,292
Hey, Woody's got something like that.
His is a pull string, only it's...

275
00:17:13,417 --> 00:17:16,587
- Only it sounds like a car ran over it.
- Oh, yeah, but not like this one.

276
00:17:16,712 --> 00:17:18,756
This is a quality sound system.

277
00:17:18,881 --> 00:17:23,761
Probably all copper wiring, huh? So, uh,
where you from? Singapore? Hong Kong?

278
00:17:23,886 --> 00:17:25,388
Well, no. Actually, l-I'm...

279
00:17:25,388 --> 00:17:28,391
I'm stationed up in the
Gamma Quadrant of Sector Four.

280
00:17:28,516 --> 00:17:32,603
As a member of the elite Universe
Protection Unit of the Space Ranger Corps,

281
00:17:32,728 --> 00:17:35,398
I protect the galaxy
from the threat of invasion...

282
00:17:35,523 --> 00:17:40,278
from the evil Emperor Zurg,
sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance.

283
00:17:40,403 --> 00:17:42,405
Oh, really?
I'm from Playskool.

284
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,865
And I'm from Mattel.
Well, I'm not really from Mattel.

285
00:17:44,991 --> 00:17:47,952
I'm actually from a smaller company that
was purchased in a leveraged buyout.

286
00:17:48,077 --> 00:17:50,830
You'd think they'd never
seen a new toy before.

287
00:17:50,955 --> 00:17:55,918
Well, sure, look at him. He's got more
gadgets on him than a Swiss Army knife.

288
00:17:56,043 --> 00:17:57,795
Ah, ah, ah, ah!
Please be careful.

289
00:17:57,587 --> 00:17:59,547
You don't want to be in the way
when my laser goes off.

290
00:17:59,672 --> 00:18:02,967
Hey, a laser! How come
you don't have a laser, Woody?

291
00:18:03,092 --> 00:18:06,137
It's not a laser. It's a...
It's a little light bulb that blinks.

292
00:18:06,262 --> 00:18:07,805
- What's with him?
- Laser envy.

293
00:18:07,805 --> 00:18:09,348
All right, that's enough!

294
00:18:09,473 --> 00:18:12,602
Look, we're all very impressed
with Andy's new toy.

295
00:18:12,727 --> 00:18:15,271
- Toy?
- T-O-Y. TOY!

296
00:18:15,396 --> 00:18:19,317
Excuse me. l-I think the word
you're searching for is "Space Ranger".

297
00:18:19,442 --> 00:18:23,779
The word I'm searching for I can't say
because there's preschool toys present.

298
00:18:23,904 --> 00:18:25,239
Gettin' kind of tense,
aren't ya?

299
00:18:25,364 --> 00:18:28,451
Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear,
uh, now, I'm curious.

300
00:18:28,576 --> 00:18:31,329
What does a Space Ranger
actually do?

301
00:18:31,454 --> 00:18:37,043
He's not a Space Ranger! He doesn't
fight evil or... or shoot lasers or fly!

302
00:18:37,168 --> 00:18:39,670
Excuse me.

303
00:18:39,795 --> 00:18:43,174
- Wow!
- Oh, impressive wingspan. Very good!

304
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:47,970
Oh, what? What? These are plastic.
He can't fly.

305
00:18:48,095 --> 00:18:51,515
<i>They are a terillium-carbonic
alloy, and I can fly.</i>

306
00:18:51,515 --> 00:18:54,769
- No, you can't.
- Yes, I can.

307
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:55,937
- You can't.
- Can.

308
00:18:55,937 --> 00:18:57,688
Can't. Can't. Can't!

309
00:18:57,813 --> 00:19:00,483
I tell you, I could fly around
this room with my eyes closed!

310
00:19:00,608 --> 00:19:02,610
Okay, then, Mr. Light Beer,
prove it.

311
00:19:02,735 --> 00:19:04,612
All right, then, I will.

312
00:19:04,737 --> 00:19:06,614
Stand back, everyone.

313
00:19:14,163 --> 00:19:18,167
To infinity and beyond!

314
00:19:43,567 --> 00:19:46,654
- Can!
- Whoa!

315
00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:49,282
Oh, wow! You flew
magnificently!

316
00:19:49,407 --> 00:19:53,411
- I found my movin' buddy.
- Thank you. Th-Thank you all. Thank you.

317
00:19:53,536 --> 00:19:57,540
That wasn't flying.
That was falling with style.

318
00:19:57,665 --> 00:20:00,751
Man, the dolls must really go for you.
Can you teach me that?

319
00:20:01,877 --> 00:20:04,797
- Golly bob howdy!
- Oh, shut up!

320
00:20:04,922 --> 00:20:08,050
No, in a couple of days, everything will
be just the way it was. They'll see.

321
00:20:10,344 --> 00:20:12,763
They'll see. I'm still
Andy's favorite toy.

322
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,642
<i># I was on top of the world #

Oh! Finally.

- Hey, who's got my hat?
- Look, I'm Woody. Howdy, howdy, howdy.

355
00:22:26,439 --> 00:22:29,900
Ah-ha. Ah-ha!
Give me that!

356
00:22:30,026 --> 00:22:32,778
Say there, Lizard and Stretchy Dog,
let me show you something.

357
00:22:32,903 --> 00:22:35,489
It looks as though I've been
accepted into your culture.

358
00:22:35,615 --> 00:22:38,576
Your chief, Andy,
inscribed his name on me.

359
00:22:38,701 --> 00:22:41,746
Wow! With permanent ink too!

360
00:22:41,871 --> 00:22:44,749
Well, I must get back
to repairing my ship.

361
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,713
- Don't let it get to you, Woody.
- Uh, let what?

362
00:22:50,838 --> 00:22:52,715
I don't, uh...
What do you mean? Who?

363
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,593
I know Andy's excited
about Buzz,

364
00:22:55,718 --> 00:22:59,347
but you know he'll always have
a special place for you.

365
00:22:59,472 --> 00:23:02,934
- Yeah, like the attic.
- All right! That's it!

366
00:23:04,644 --> 00:23:08,648
<i>- Unidirectional bonding strip.
- Mr. Lightyear wants more tape.</i>

367
00:23:11,108 --> 00:23:14,362
Listen, Light Snack,
you stay away from Andy.

368
00:23:14,487 --> 00:23:18,115
He's mine, and no one
is taking him away from me.

369
00:23:18,241 --> 00:23:22,119
What are you talking about?
Where's that bonding strip?

370
00:23:24,038 --> 00:23:27,833
And another thing:
Stop with this spaceman thing!

371
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:29,126
It's getting on my nerves!

372
00:23:29,252 --> 00:23:31,629
Are you saying you want to
lodge a complaint with Star Command?

373
00:23:31,754 --> 00:23:35,716
Oh-ho-ho! Okay! Ooh, well, so you wanna
do it the hard way, huh?

374
00:23:35,841 --> 00:23:39,595
- Don't even think about it, cowboy.
- Oh, yeah, tough guy?

375
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,109
The air isn't toxic.

376
00:23:53,109 --> 00:23:56,904
How dare you open a spaceman's
helmet on an uncharted planet!

377
00:23:57,029 --> 00:24:01,158
My eyeballs could've been
sucked from their sockets.

378
00:24:01,284 --> 00:24:05,705
You actually think
you're The Buzz Lightyear?

379
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,708
Oh, all this time
I thought it was an act!

380
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:12,378
Hey, guys, look!
It's the real Buzz Lightyear!

381
00:24:12,503 --> 00:24:15,464
- You're mocking me, aren't you?
- Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.

382
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,466
- Buzz, look! An alien!
- Where?

383
00:24:25,516 --> 00:24:27,935
Yes!

384
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,604
Whoa!

385
00:24:29,729 --> 00:24:31,856
- Uh-oh.
- It's Sid!

386
00:24:31,981 --> 00:24:35,318
- Don't move!
- I thought he was at summer camp.

387
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:37,653
They, uh, must have kicked
him out early this year.

388
00:24:37,653 --> 00:24:39,864
Oh, no, not Sid!

389
00:24:39,989 --> 00:24:41,449
Incoming!

390
00:24:43,993 --> 00:24:46,621
- Who is it this time?
- Uh, I can't... I can't tell.

391
00:24:46,746 --> 00:24:48,706
- Hey, where's Lenny?
- Right here, Woody.

392
00:24:48,831 --> 00:24:52,418
Oh, no, I can't bear
to watch one of these again.

393
00:24:52,543 --> 00:24:55,963
- Stay where you are!
- Oh, no, it's a Combat Carl.

394
00:24:56,088 --> 00:24:59,383
- What's going on?
- Nothing that concerns you spacemen

395
00:24:59,383 --> 00:25:01,010
Just us toys.

396
00:25:01,135 --> 00:25:03,846
I'd better take a look
anyway.

397
00:25:03,971 --> 00:25:05,973
Why is that soldier strapped
to an explosive device?

398
00:25:06,098 --> 00:25:09,226
That's why... Sid.

399
00:25:09,352 --> 00:25:13,731
- Hmm, sure is a hairy fellow.
- No, no, that's Scud, you idiot.

400
00:25:13,856 --> 00:25:16,275
That is Sid.

401
00:25:16,984 --> 00:25:19,654
- You mean that happy child?
- That ain't no happy child.

402
00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:23,741
He tortures toys,
just for fun!

403
00:25:26,202 --> 00:25:29,121
Well, then, we've
got to do something.

404
00:25:29,247 --> 00:25:30,498
- What are you doing?
- Get down from there!

405
00:25:30,498 --> 00:25:31,999
I'm gonna teach that boy a lesson.

406
00:25:32,124 --> 00:25:36,128
Yeah, sure. You go ahead.
Melt him with your scary laser.

407
00:25:36,254 --> 00:25:39,340
Be careful with that.
It's extremely dangerous.

408
00:25:39,465 --> 00:25:43,094
He's lighting it!
He's lighting it! Hit the dirt!

409
00:25:43,219 --> 00:25:45,096
Look out!

410
00:25:49,058 --> 00:25:51,602
Yes! He's gone!
He's history!

411
00:25:53,312 --> 00:25:55,273
I could've stopped him.

412
00:25:55,398 --> 00:25:58,609
Buzz, I would love
to see you try.

413
00:25:58,734 --> 00:26:01,195
- Of course, I'd love to see you as a crater.
- Yeah!

414
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,783
- The sooner we move, the better.
- Oh, what a great shot. Yeah!

415
00:26:12,748 --> 00:26:16,127
To infinity and beyond!

416
00:26:16,252 --> 00:26:18,504
Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.

417
00:26:17,587 --> 00:26:20,798
What would you say to dinner
at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?

418
00:26:20,923 --> 00:26:24,468
Pizza Planet? Oh, cool!

419
00:26:24,594 --> 00:26:26,637
Go wash your hands,
and I'll get Molly ready.

420
00:26:26,762 --> 00:26:29,974
- Can I bring some toys?
- You can bring one toy.

421
00:26:30,099 --> 00:26:32,977
- Just one?
- One toy?

422
00:26:38,816 --> 00:26:41,235
Will Andy pick me?

423
00:26:44,405 --> 00:26:46,908
"Don't count on it"?
Ohh!

424
00:27:07,178 --> 00:27:09,513
Buzz! Oh, Buzz!
Buzz Lightyear!

425
00:27:09,639 --> 00:27:12,224
Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness!
We've got trouble!

426
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:14,894
- Trouble? Where?
- Down there. Just down there.

427
00:27:15,019 --> 00:27:17,855
A helpless toy!
It's... It's trapped, Buzz!

428
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:20,107
Then we've no time to lose.

429
00:27:26,072 --> 00:27:28,115
- I don't see anything.
- Uh, he's there.

430
00:27:28,115 --> 00:27:29,450
Just... Just keep looking.

431
00:27:29,492 --> 00:27:32,036
What kind of toy...

432
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,388
- Buzz!
- Buzz!

433
00:27:50,388 --> 00:27:51,305
Buzz!

434
00:27:53,349 --> 00:27:55,309
- I don't see him in the driveway.
- Did you see what happened?

435
00:27:55,434 --> 00:27:58,854
- I think he bounced into Sid's yard!
- Ohh! Buzz!

436
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:05,486
Hey, everyone! R.C.'s trying
to say something. What is it, boy?

437
00:28:05,611 --> 00:28:08,447
- He's saying that this was no accident.
- Huh?

438
00:28:08,573 --> 00:28:10,992
- What do you mean?
- I mean Humpty-Dumpty was pushed.

439
00:28:10,992 --> 00:28:12,535
- No!
- By Woody!

440
00:28:12,535 --> 00:28:13,744
- What?
- What?

441
00:28:13,786 --> 00:28:14,495
Wait a minute.

442
00:28:14,495 --> 00:28:17,790
You... You don't think
I meant to knock Buzz out the window,

443
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,000
Do you?
Potato Head?

444
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,503
That's Mr. Potato Head to you,
you back-stabbin' murderer!

445
00:28:22,628 --> 00:28:25,131
Now, it was an accident, guys.
Come on.

446
00:28:25,256 --> 00:28:27,425
Now, you... you gotta
believe me.

447
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:30,886
We believe ya, Woody.
Right, Rex?

448
00:28:31,012 --> 00:28:33,472
Well, ye... n...
I don't like confrontations.

449
00:28:33,598 --> 00:28:36,809
Where is your honor, dirt bag?
You are an absolute disgrace!

450
00:28:36,934 --> 00:28:39,020
You don't deserve to... Hey!

451
00:28:39,145 --> 00:28:42,106
You couldn't handle Buzz cuttin' in
on your playtime, could you, Woody?

452
00:28:42,231 --> 00:28:46,277
Didn't wanna face the fact that Buzz
just might be Andy's new favorite toy.

453
00:28:46,277 --> 00:28:48,696
So you got rid of him.

454
00:28:48,696 --> 00:28:50,615
Well, what if Andy starts playing with me more, Woody, huh?

455
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,533
You're gonna knock me out
of the window too?

456
00:28:52,575 --> 00:28:56,162
- I don't think we should give him the chance.
- There he is, men.

457
00:28:56,287 --> 00:28:58,623
- Frag him!
- Let's string him up by his pull string!

458
00:28:58,748 --> 00:29:00,917
- I've got dibs on his hat!
- Would you boys stop it?

459
00:29:00,958 --> 00:29:02,460
- Tackle him!
- No, no, no! W-W-Wait!

460
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,669
Boys, stop it!

461
00:29:03,794 --> 00:29:06,422
- I can explain everything.
- Okay, Mom, be right down.

462
00:29:06,547 --> 00:29:08,925
- I've gotta get Buzz.
- Retreat!

463
00:29:14,013 --> 00:29:16,390
- Mom, do you know where Buzz is?
- No, I haven't seen him.

464
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:17,767
Psst!

465
00:29:20,061 --> 00:29:22,438
Andy, I'm heading
out the door!

466
00:29:22,563 --> 00:29:25,024
- But, Mom, I can't find him!
- Honey, just grab some other toy.

467
00:29:25,024 --> 00:29:26,484
Now, come on.

468
00:29:26,609 --> 00:29:28,653
Okay.

469
00:29:33,324 --> 00:29:36,911
I couldn't find my Buzz.
I know I left him right there.

470
00:29:37,036 --> 00:29:39,956
Honey, I'm sure he's around.
You'll find him.

471
00:29:53,761 --> 00:29:56,389
It's too short!
We need more monkeys!

472
00:29:56,514 --> 00:29:59,558
There aren't any more!
That's the whole barrel!

473
00:30:00,935 --> 00:30:02,937
Buzz, the monkeys
aren't working.

474
00:30:03,062 --> 00:30:05,398
We're formulating
another plan!

475
00:30:05,523 --> 00:30:09,235
Stay calm!
Oh, where could he be?

476
00:30:20,663 --> 00:30:23,916
- Can I help pump the gas?
- Sure! I'll even let you drive.

477
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:25,918
- Yeah?
- Yeah, when you're 16.

478
00:30:26,043 --> 00:30:28,087
Yuk, yuk, yuk.
Funny, Mom.

479
00:30:28,212 --> 00:30:32,717
Oh, great. How am I gonna convince
those guys it was an accident?

480
00:30:36,304 --> 00:30:38,180
Buzz!

481
00:30:39,682 --> 00:30:42,268
Buzz! Hah! You're alive!

482
00:30:42,393 --> 00:30:46,939
This is great! Oh, I'm saved!
I'm saved! Andy will find you here.

483
00:30:47,064 --> 00:30:50,276
He'll take us back to the room,
and then you can tell everyone...

484
00:30:50,401 --> 00:30:53,487
that this was all
just a big mistake.

485
00:30:53,613 --> 00:30:56,449
Huh? Right? Buddy?

486
00:30:56,574 --> 00:30:59,952
I just want you to know that even
though you tried to terminate me,

487
00:31:00,077 --> 00:31:02,830
revenge is not an idea
we promote on my planet.

488
00:31:02,955 --> 00:31:06,459
- Oh. Oh, that's good.
- But we're not on my planet.

489
00:31:06,584 --> 00:31:07,877
- Are we?
- No.

490
00:31:14,842 --> 00:31:18,471
Okay. Come on!
You want a piece of me?

491
00:31:24,644 --> 00:31:26,395
<i>Ow!</i>

492
00:31:26,062 --> 00:31:28,147
<i>Buzz... Buzz... Buzz
Lightyear to the rescue.</i>

493
00:31:28,272 --> 00:31:29,482
<i>- Ouch!</i>

494
00:31:28,564 --> 00:31:32,401
- Next stop...
- Pizza Planet. Yeah!

495
00:31:34,445 --> 00:31:36,155
Andy!

496
00:31:44,121 --> 00:31:47,041
Wh... Doesn't he realize
that I'm not there?

497
00:31:48,668 --> 00:31:50,544
I'm lost!

498
00:31:52,004 --> 00:31:54,840
Oh, I'm a lost toy!

499
00:31:58,928 --> 00:32:00,680
Buzz Lightyear mission log.

500
00:32:00,805 --> 00:32:03,849
The local sheriff and I seem to be at
a huge refueling station of some sort.

501
00:32:03,975 --> 00:32:05,893
You!

502
00:32:25,997 --> 00:32:28,374
- According to my navi-computer, the...
- Shut up!

503
00:32:28,499 --> 00:32:31,711
- Just shut up, you idiot!
- Sheriff, this is no time to panic.

504
00:32:31,836 --> 00:32:35,214
This is the perfect time to panic!
I'm lost! Andy is gone!

505
00:32:35,339 --> 00:32:37,675
They're gonna move from their house
in two days, and it's all your fault!

506
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,970
My... My fault? If you hadn't pushed me
out of the window in the first place...

507
00:32:41,095 --> 00:32:45,057
Oh, yeah? Well, if you hadn't shown up in
your stupid little cardboard spaceship...

508
00:32:45,182 --> 00:32:47,310
and taken away everything
that was important to me...

509
00:32:47,435 --> 00:32:49,103
Don't talk to me
about importance.

510
00:32:49,228 --> 00:32:52,106
Because of you, the security
of this entire universe is in jeopardy!

511
00:32:52,231 --> 00:32:54,442
What? What are you
talking about?

512
00:32:54,567 --> 00:32:58,571
Right now, poised at the edge of the galaxy,
Emperor Zurg has been secretly building...

513
00:32:58,696 --> 00:33:02,241
a weapon with the destructive capacity
to annihilate an entire planet!

514
00:33:02,366 --> 00:33:06,454
I alone have information that reveals
this weapon's only weakness.

515
00:33:06,579 --> 00:33:11,417
And you, my friend, are responsible for
delaying my rendezvous with Star Command!

516
00:33:12,877 --> 00:33:15,963
You are a toy!

517
00:33:16,088 --> 00:33:20,092
You aren't the real Buzz Lightyear!
You're a... Uh, you're an action figure!

518
00:33:20,217 --> 00:33:24,221
You are a child's
plaything!

519
00:33:24,347 --> 00:33:29,101
You are a sad, strange little man,
and you have my pity. Farewell.

520
00:33:29,226 --> 00:33:32,772
Oh, yeah? Well,
good riddance, ya loony.

521
00:33:32,897 --> 00:33:36,108
"Rendezvous with Star Command."

522
00:33:36,233 --> 00:33:38,444
<i>- Hey, gas dude!
- You talking to me?</i>

523
00:33:38,486 --> 00:33:39,946
<i>- Pizza Planet?
- Yeah, man. Can you help me?</i>

524
00:33:39,987 --> 00:33:42,490
<i>- D'you know where Cutting Boulevard is?
- Andy!</i>

525
00:33:42,615 --> 00:33:44,492
- Just a moment.
- Oh, no!

526
00:33:44,617 --> 00:33:47,411
I can't show my face
in that room without Buzz.

527
00:33:47,411 --> 00:33:50,831
- Buzz! Buzz, come back!
- Go away.

528
00:33:50,957 --> 00:33:54,126
No, Buzz, you gotta come back!
l...

529
00:33:55,753 --> 00:33:58,214
I found a spaceship!

530
00:33:59,423 --> 00:34:01,550
It's a spaceship, Buzz.

531
00:34:03,427 --> 00:34:07,014
Come on, man, hurry up! Um, like,
the pizzas are getting cold here.

532
00:34:07,139 --> 00:34:10,643
- Oh, yeah, Cutting Boulevard.
- Yeah, yeah. Which way?

533
00:34:10,768 --> 00:34:12,895
Now, you're sure this space
freighter will return...

534
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,981
to its port of origin once
it jettisons its food supply?

535
00:34:15,106 --> 00:34:17,400
Uh-huh. And when we
get there,

536
00:34:17,525 --> 00:34:20,653
we'll be able to find a way
to transport you home.

537
00:34:20,778 --> 00:34:24,323
- Well, then, let's climb aboard.
- No, no, no, wait! Buzz! Buzz!

538
00:34:24,448 --> 00:34:26,409
Let's get in the back.
No one will see us there.

539
00:34:26,534 --> 00:34:29,579
Negative. There are no restraining
harnesses in the cargo area.

540
00:34:29,704 --> 00:34:32,498
- We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
- Yeah, but...

541
00:34:32,623 --> 00:34:35,251
- Buzz! Buzz!
- That's two lefts and a right, huh?

542
00:34:35,376 --> 00:34:37,253
- Yeah.
- Uh, thanks for the directions, okay?

543
00:34:37,378 --> 00:34:39,839
- Yeah, remember, kid...
- Buzz!

544
00:34:52,852 --> 00:34:55,855
"It's safer in the cockpit than
the cargo bay." What an idiot.

545
00:35:20,588 --> 00:35:24,717
<i>Next shuttle lift off scheduled
for T-minus 30 minutes and counting.</i>

546
00:35:29,513 --> 00:35:31,641
<i>You are cleared to enter.</i>

547
00:35:31,766 --> 00:35:34,435
<i>Welcome to Pizza Planet.</i>

548
00:35:34,435 --> 00:35:39,023
<i>The white zone is for eating pizza...
- Sheriff!</i>

549
00:35:39,023 --> 00:35:42,026
Sheriff? There you are.

550
00:35:42,068 --> 00:35:45,404
Now, the entrance is heavily guarded.
We need a way to get inside.

551
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:51,244
Great idea, Woody.
I like your thinkin'.

552
00:35:51,369 --> 00:35:54,038
<i>You are cleared to enter.</i>

553
00:35:54,038 --> 00:35:56,582
<i>- Welcome to Pizza Planet.
- Now!</i>

554
00:35:56,707 --> 00:35:59,543
Quickly, Sheriff!
The air lock is closing.

555
00:35:59,669 --> 00:36:02,380
<i>Jones, party of five,
your shuttle is now boarding...</i>

556
00:36:02,505 --> 00:36:04,465
Mom, can we have
some tokens?

557
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:08,636
- Ow! Watch where you're going!
- Sorry!

558
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:18,479
<i>Nine, Eight, Seven, Six,</i>

559
00:36:18,604 --> 00:36:21,774
<i>Five, Four, Three,</i>

560
00:36:21,899 --> 00:36:23,734
<i>Two, One.</i>

561
00:36:23,776 --> 00:36:27,905
What a spaceport!
Good work, Woody.

562
00:36:36,163 --> 00:36:38,958
- Mom, can I play Black Hole?
Please, please, please!

563
00:36:38,958 --> 00:36:40,251
- Andy!
- Oh, it's so cool!

564
00:36:40,251 --> 00:36:41,919
Now, we need to find a ship
that's headed for Sector 12.

565
00:36:41,961 --> 00:36:44,171
Wait a minute. No, no, no, Buzz.

566
00:36:43,129 --> 00:36:46,048
This way! There's a
special ship. I just saw it.

567
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:47,758
You mean it has hyperdrive?

568
00:36:48,759 --> 00:36:53,681
Hyperactive hyperdrive
and Astro, uh, turf!

569
00:36:53,806 --> 00:36:56,350
- Where is it? l-I don't see the...
- Come on. That's it.

570
00:36:56,475 --> 00:36:58,352
Spaceship!

571
00:36:59,645 --> 00:37:02,315
All right, Buzz,
get ready. And...

572
00:37:02,356 --> 00:37:03,649
Until the universe explodes!

573
00:37:03,649 --> 00:37:06,235
Okay, Buzz, when I say go,
we're gonna jump in the basket.

574
00:37:06,235 --> 00:37:09,530
Buzz!

575
00:37:09,655 --> 00:37:10,865
- Hey, Mom, if I eat all of my pizza,
- No!

576
00:37:10,865 --> 00:37:13,200
Can I have some alien slime?

577
00:37:13,242 --> 00:37:15,369
This cannot be
happening to me!

578
00:37:25,004 --> 00:37:28,716
<i>- A stranger.
- From the outside. Ooh!</i>

579
00:37:28,716 --> 00:37:31,677
Greetings.
I am Buzz Lightyear.

580
00:37:31,802 --> 00:37:36,766
- I come in peace.
- Tell me what it's like outside.

yourself with a slice of pepperoni,</i>

583
00:37:44,398 --> 00:37:48,903
This is an intergalactic emergency.
I need to commandeer your vessel to Sector 12.

584
00:37:49,028 --> 00:37:51,405
Who's in charge here?

585
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:54,408
<i>The claw!</i>

586
00:37:56,494 --> 00:37:57,328
<i>The claw is our master.</i>

587
00:37:57,328 --> 00:37:59,872
<i>- The claw chooses who
will go and who will stay.</i>

588
00:37:59,997 --> 00:38:03,334
<i>- This is ludicrous.
- Hey, bozo, you got a brain in there?</i>

589
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:07,088
<i>Take that!</i>

590
00:38:07,213 --> 00:38:11,175
Oh, no! Sid!
Get down!

591
00:38:13,219 --> 00:38:15,554
- What's gotten into you, Sheriff? I wa...
- You are the one...

592
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,182
<i>- That decided to climb into this...
- Shh! The claw.</i>

593
00:38:18,307 --> 00:38:21,060
<i>It moves.</i>

594
00:38:24,814 --> 00:38:26,899
<i>I have been chosen!</i>

595
00:38:27,024 --> 00:38:30,611
<i>Farewell, my friends.
I go on to a better place.</i>

596
00:38:30,736 --> 00:38:32,613
<i>Gotcha!</i>

597
00:38:34,115 --> 00:38:37,076
<i>A Buzz Lightyear?
No way!</i>

598
00:38:53,384 --> 00:38:56,971
<i>- Yes!
- Buzz! No!</i>

599
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:00,516
<i>Hey!</i>

600
00:39:02,143 --> 00:39:04,270
<i>- He has been chosen.
- He must go. Hey!</i>

601
00:39:04,312 --> 00:39:04,937
<i>- You might anger the claw.</i>

602
00:39:04,937 --> 00:39:07,440
<i>- What are you doing? Stop it!
- The claw! The claw!</i>

603
00:39:07,565 --> 00:39:11,068
<i>- Stop it, you zealots!
- Do not fight the claw.</i>

604
00:39:12,278 --> 00:39:15,197
<i>All right!
Double prizes!</i>

605
00:39:17,825 --> 00:39:20,536
<i>Let's go home and play.</i>

606
00:39:34,425 --> 00:39:37,970
Sheriff, I can see your dwelling
from here. You're almost home.

607
00:39:38,095 --> 00:39:40,389
Nirvana is coming.
The mystic portal awaits.

608
00:39:40,514 --> 00:39:43,017
Will you be quiet?
You guys don't get it, do you?

609
00:39:43,142 --> 00:39:47,146
Once we go into Sid's house,
we won't be coming out!

610
00:39:47,271 --> 00:39:51,442
Whoa, Scud! Hey, boy!
Sit! Good boy.

611
00:39:51,567 --> 00:39:54,904
- Hey, I got something for you, boy.
- Freeze!

612
00:39:56,948 --> 00:39:59,200
Ready, set, now!

613
00:40:00,409 --> 00:40:02,828
Hannah! Hey, Hannah!

614
00:40:02,954 --> 00:40:04,997
- What?
- Did I get my package in the mail?

615
00:40:05,122 --> 00:40:07,500
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

616
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:10,044
I don't know.

617
00:40:10,169 --> 00:40:11,420
- Oh, no, Hannah!
- What?

618
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,672
Look... Janie!

619
00:40:12,588 --> 00:40:13,172
Hey!

620
00:40:13,172 --> 00:40:14,715
- She's sick!
- No, she's not!

621
00:40:14,757 --> 00:40:17,843
- I'll have to perform one of my operations.
- No!

622
00:40:17,969 --> 00:40:20,096
- Not Sid's room. Not there.
- No!

623
00:40:20,221 --> 00:40:22,098
Sid, give her back!

624
00:40:23,307 --> 00:40:25,184
Sid!

625
00:40:25,309 --> 00:40:28,062
- Oh, no! - Mom!
- We have a sick patient here, Nurse.

626
00:40:28,062 --> 00:40:30,690
Prepare the O.R., stat!

627
00:40:32,316 --> 00:40:34,569
Patient is prepped.

628
00:40:36,112 --> 00:40:38,406
No one's ever attempted
a double bypass...

629
00:40:38,531 --> 00:40:41,325
brain transplant before.

630
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:44,370
Now for the tricky part.
Pliers!

631
00:40:44,495 --> 00:40:47,081
I don't believe that man's
ever been to medical school.

632
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,544
Doctor, you've done it!

633
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:54,964
Hannah!

634
00:40:55,089 --> 00:40:57,883
Janie's all better now.

635
00:40:58,009 --> 00:41:01,220
- Mom! Mom!
- She's lying!

636
00:41:01,345 --> 00:41:03,931
Whatever she says,
it's not true!

637
00:41:16,027 --> 00:41:18,738
We are gonna die.
I'm outta here!

638
00:41:23,034 --> 00:41:25,369
Locked!

639
00:41:25,494 --> 00:41:28,164
There's gotta be
another way outta here.

640
00:41:38,841 --> 00:41:42,219
Uh, Buzz, was that you?

641
00:41:51,604 --> 00:41:53,940
Hey, hi there,
little fella.

642
00:41:54,065 --> 00:41:56,108
Come out here.
Do you know a way outta here?

643
00:42:26,764 --> 00:42:29,684
Bu-Bu-Bu-Buzz!

644
00:42:40,778 --> 00:42:43,155
They're cannibals.

645
00:42:46,075 --> 00:42:49,537
Mayday, mayday. Come in,
Star Command. Send reinforcements.

646
00:42:49,662 --> 00:42:52,331
Star Command, do you copy?

647
00:42:52,456 --> 00:42:54,667
I've set my laser
from stun to kill.

648
00:42:54,792 --> 00:42:59,422
Ah, great, great. Yeah, and if anyone
attacks us, we can blink 'em to death.

649
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:07,179
Hey, you guys, I think
I found him. Buzz, is that you?

650
00:43:07,305 --> 00:43:09,599
Whiskers, will you
get out of here!

651
00:43:09,724 --> 00:43:12,560
You're interfering
with a search and rescue!

652
00:43:13,728 --> 00:43:16,063
Look! They're home.

653
00:43:20,943 --> 00:43:24,196
- Mom, have you seen Woody?
- Where was the last place you left him?

654
00:43:24,322 --> 00:43:26,699
- Right here in the van.
- I'm sure he's there.

655
00:43:26,824 --> 00:43:28,492
You're just not looking
hard enough.

656
00:43:28,618 --> 00:43:32,163
He's not here, Mom.
Woody's gone!

657
00:43:32,288 --> 00:43:35,207
- Woody's gone?
- Yeah, boy, the weasel ran away.

658
00:43:35,333 --> 00:43:37,418
Huh? Huh?
I told you he was guilty.

659
00:43:37,543 --> 00:43:41,547
Who would've thought he was
capable of such atrocities?

660
00:43:43,341 --> 00:43:46,052
Oh, Slink,
I hope he's okay.

661
00:43:49,221 --> 00:43:51,724
Oh, a survivor!

662
00:43:51,849 --> 00:43:54,101
Where's the rebel base?
Talk!

663
00:43:56,562 --> 00:43:59,231
I can see your will
is strong.

664
00:44:00,441 --> 00:44:03,778
Well, we have ways
of making you talk.

665
00:44:13,704 --> 00:44:17,416
Where are your
rebel friends now?

666
00:44:17,541 --> 00:44:21,462
- Sid, your Pop Tarts are ready!
- All right!

667
00:44:33,432 --> 00:44:35,893
Are you all right?
I'm proud of you, Sheriff.

668
00:44:36,018 --> 00:44:39,272
A lesser man would've
talked under such torture.

669
00:44:39,397 --> 00:44:41,857
I sure hope this
isn't permanent.

670
00:44:41,983 --> 00:44:44,610
Still no word from Star Command.
We're not that far from the spaceport.

671
00:44:44,735 --> 00:44:47,613
The door. It's open!
We're free!

672
00:44:47,738 --> 00:44:50,199
- Woody, we don't know what's out there!
- I'll tell you wha...

673
00:44:52,577 --> 00:44:54,662
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!
Do something, quick!

674
00:44:54,787 --> 00:44:56,789
Shield your eyes!

675
00:44:59,041 --> 00:45:01,335
It's not working. I recharged it
before I left. l-It should be good for...

676
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:05,131
You idiot, you're a toy!
Use your karate-chop action!

677
00:45:05,256 --> 00:45:05,881
Get away!

678
00:45:05,881 --> 00:45:08,718
Hey! Hey! How're you doin' that?
Stop that!

679
00:45:08,759 --> 00:45:11,679
- Back! Back, you savages! Back!
- Woody, stop it.

680
00:45:11,804 --> 00:45:14,724
Sorry, guys,
but dinner's cancelled.

681
00:45:14,849 --> 00:45:17,310
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.

682
00:45:18,477 --> 00:45:21,564
There's no place like home!

683
00:45:34,368 --> 00:45:36,662
Another stunt like that, cowboy,
and you're gonna get us killed.

684
00:45:36,787 --> 00:45:40,166
- Don't tell me what to do.
- Shh!

685
00:45:58,517 --> 00:46:01,354
<i>Yee-haw! Giddyap, partner!</i>

686
00:46:01,479 --> 00:46:05,566
<i>We got to get this
wagon train a-movin'!</i>

687
00:46:07,401 --> 00:46:09,028
Split up!

688
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:35,304
<i>Calling Buzz Lightyear. Come in,
Buzz Lightyear. This is Star Command.</i>

689
00:46:35,429 --> 00:46:37,306
<i>- Buzz Lightyear, Star Command!
- do you read me?</i>

690
00:46:37,431 --> 00:46:39,558
<i>Buzz Lightyear responding.
Read you loud and clear.</i>

691
00:46:39,684 --> 00:46:42,144
<i>Buzz Lightyear,
planet Earth needs your help!</i>

692
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:44,313
<i>- On the way!
- Buzz Lightyear!</i>

693
00:46:44,438 --> 00:46:48,734
<i>The world's greatest superhero,
now the world's greatest toy!</i>

694
00:46:48,859 --> 00:46:51,737
<i>Buzz has it all!
Locking wrist communicator!</i>

695
00:46:51,862 --> 00:46:54,615
<i>- Calling Buzz Lightyear!
- Karate-chop action!</i>

696
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:56,617
<i>- Wow!
- Pulsating laser light!</i>

697
00:46:56,742 --> 00:46:59,954
<i>- Total annihilation!

<i>And best of all,
high pressure space wings!</i>

701
00:47:07,878 --> 00:47:11,465

00:47:17,597 --> 00:47:20,057
<i>Available at all Al's Toy Barn outlets

<i># Exactly who I am #

711
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:54,508
You are a toy!
You can't fly!

712
00:47:56,636 --> 00:48:01,974

719
00:48:25,331 --> 00:48:28,084

Mom! Mom, have you seen
my Sally doll?

724
00:49:12,086 --> 00:49:13,963
What, dear?
What was that?

725
00:49:15,089 --> 00:49:16,966
Never mind!

726
00:49:24,515 --> 00:49:27,351
Buzz, the coast is clear.
Buzz, where are you?

727
00:49:27,476 --> 00:49:30,897
<i> There's a secret mission
in uncharted space. Let's go.</i>

728
00:49:31,022 --> 00:49:35,526
Really? That is
so interesting.

729
00:49:35,651 --> 00:49:38,487
Would you like some tea,
Mrs. Nesbitt?

730
00:49:38,613 --> 00:49:39,155
Buzz!

731
00:49:39,155 --> 00:49:42,241
It's so nice you could
join us on such late notice.

732
00:49:42,366 --> 00:49:46,370
- Oh, no.
- What a lovely hat, Mrs. Nesbitt.

733
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:49,248
It goes quite well
with your head.

734
00:49:49,373 --> 00:49:52,001
Hannah! Oh, Hannah!

735
00:49:52,126 --> 00:49:56,255
Mom? Please excuse me, ladies.
I'll be right back.

736
00:49:59,216 --> 00:50:01,427
What is it, Mom?

737
00:50:01,552 --> 00:50:03,137
Mom, where are you?

738
00:50:03,262 --> 00:50:05,932
Buzz! Hey! Buzz, are you okay?

739
00:50:06,057 --> 00:50:09,185
Gone! It's all gone.

740
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:12,104
All of it's gone.
Bye-bye. Whoo-whoo. See ya.

741
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:15,983
- What happened to you?
- One minute you're defending the whole galaxy,

742
00:50:16,108 --> 00:50:19,946
and suddenly you find yourself
suckin' down Darjeeling...

743
00:50:20,071 --> 00:50:23,199
with Marie Antoinette
and her little sister.

744
00:50:25,243 --> 00:50:27,578
I think you've had enough tea
for today.

745
00:50:27,703 --> 00:50:30,957
- Let's get you outta here, Buzz.
- Don't you get it?

746
00:50:31,082 --> 00:50:36,087
You see the hat?
I am Mrs. Nesbitt!

747
00:50:36,212 --> 00:50:38,339
Snap out of it, Buzz!

748
00:50:41,425 --> 00:50:43,469
l-l-I'm... I'm sorry, l...
You're right.

749
00:50:43,594 --> 00:50:45,513
I am just a little depressed, that's all.
l...

750
00:50:46,639 --> 00:50:48,641
l-I can get through this.

751
00:50:48,766 --> 00:50:50,226
- Oh, I'm a sham!
- Shh!

752
00:50:50,351 --> 00:50:51,978
- Look at me.
- Quiet, Buzz!

753
00:50:52,103 --> 00:50:54,564
I can't even fly out
of a window.

754
00:50:54,689 --> 00:50:57,733
But the hat looked good?
Tell me the hat looked good.

755
00:50:57,858 --> 00:51:01,028
- The apron is a bit much.
- Out the window!

756
00:51:01,153 --> 00:51:04,907
Buzz, you're a genius!
Come on, come on. This way.

757
00:51:05,032 --> 00:51:08,411
Years of academy training
wasted!

758
00:51:09,328 --> 00:51:11,998
- B-3.
- Miss! G-6.

759
00:51:12,123 --> 00:51:14,375
Ohh! You sunk it!

760
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:17,211
- Are you peeking?
- Oh, quit your whining and pay up.

761
00:51:17,336 --> 00:51:19,297
No, no, not the ear.
Give me the nose. Come on.

762
00:51:19,422 --> 00:51:20,881
How about three out of five?

763
00:51:22,425 --> 00:51:24,468
Hey, guys! Guys!

764
00:51:24,594 --> 00:51:26,846
- Hey!
- Son of a building block!

765
00:51:26,971 --> 00:51:29,181
- It's Woody.
- He's in the psycho's bedroom.

766
00:51:29,307 --> 00:51:31,559
- H-H-Hi!
- Everyone! It's Woody!

767
00:51:31,684 --> 00:51:32,768
- Woody?
- You're kidding!

768
00:51:32,768 --> 00:51:33,894
Woody!

769
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:36,272
We're gonna get out
of here, Buzz.

770
00:51:36,314 --> 00:51:37,857
Buzz?

771
00:51:42,403 --> 00:51:44,071
- Hey, look!
- Woody!

772
00:51:44,196 --> 00:51:46,324
Oh, boy, am I glad
to see you guys!

773
00:51:46,449 --> 00:51:49,035
- I knew you'd come back, Woody!
- What are you doin' over there?

774
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,579
It's a long story, Bo.
I'll explain later.

775
00:51:51,704 --> 00:51:53,497
Here! Catch this!

776
00:51:54,707 --> 00:51:56,000
Whoa! I got it, Woody!

777
00:51:56,125 --> 00:51:58,669
- He got it, Woody!
- Good goin', Slink!

778
00:51:58,794 --> 00:52:01,088
- Now just, just tie it on to somethin'.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

779
00:52:01,213 --> 00:52:02,381
- I got a better idea.
How about we don't?

780
00:52:02,465 --> 00:52:03,132
Hey!

781
00:52:03,257 --> 00:52:06,302
- Potato Head!
- Did you all take stupid pills this morning?

782
00:52:06,427 --> 00:52:08,220
Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz?

783
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:10,056
And now you want
to let him back over here?

784
00:52:10,181 --> 00:52:12,308
No! No, no. No, no, no, no, no.
You got it...

785
00:52:12,433 --> 00:52:14,518
You got it all wrong,
Potato Head.

786
00:52:14,644 --> 00:52:16,771
Buzz is fine. Buzz is
right here. He's with me.

787
00:52:16,896 --> 00:52:19,523
- You are a liar!
- No, I'm not!

788
00:52:19,649 --> 00:52:21,567
Buzz, come over here and j-just
tell the nice toys

789
00:52:21,567 --> 00:52:23,527
that you're...
that you're not dead.

790
00:52:27,031 --> 00:52:30,243
Just a sec! Buzz, will you
get up here and give me a hand?

791
00:52:33,746 --> 00:52:35,790
That's very funny, Buzz.
This is serious!

792
00:52:35,915 --> 00:52:37,959
Hey, Woody, where'd ya go?

793
00:52:38,084 --> 00:52:40,586
He's lying. Buzz ain't there.

794
00:52:40,711 --> 00:52:46,050
Oh, hi, Buzz. Why don't you
say hello to the guys over there?

795
00:52:46,175 --> 00:52:49,512
Hiya, fellas!
To infinity and beyond!

796
00:52:49,637 --> 00:52:51,389
Hey, look! It's Buzz!

797
00:52:51,514 --> 00:52:56,727
Yeah! Hey, Buzz, let's show the guys
our new secret best-friends handshake.

798
00:52:56,852 --> 00:52:59,146
- Give me five, man!
- Something's screwy here.

799
00:52:59,272 --> 00:53:02,358
So you see, we're friends now,
guys. Aren't we, Buzz?

800
00:53:02,483 --> 00:53:04,235
You bet. Give me a hug.

801
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:08,573
- Oh, I love you too.
- See? It is Buzz.

802
00:53:08,698 --> 00:53:11,576
- Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
- Wait just a minute.

803
00:53:11,701 --> 00:53:14,161
- What are you tryin' to pull?
- Nothin'.

804
00:53:18,624 --> 00:53:20,501
- Oh, that is disgusting.
- Murderer!

805
00:53:20,626 --> 00:53:22,878
- No! No, no, no, no, no!
- You murdering dog!

806
00:53:23,004 --> 00:53:25,089
- It's not what you think, I swear!
- Save it for the jury!

807
00:53:25,214 --> 00:53:27,508
I hope Sid pulls
your voice box out, you creep.

808
00:53:27,633 --> 00:53:30,720
No! No! No, no! Don't leave!
Don't leave! Y-Ya gotta help us, please!

809
00:53:30,761 --> 00:53:34,223
- You don't know what it's like over here!
- Come on, let's get out of here.

810
00:53:34,348 --> 00:53:36,809
Go back to your lives, citizens.
Show's over.

811
00:53:36,934 --> 00:53:39,312
Come back! Slink!

812
00:53:39,437 --> 00:53:43,524
Slink, please!
Please listen to me!

813
00:53:43,649 --> 00:53:45,860
No! No, come back!

814
00:53:46,986 --> 00:53:49,780
Slinky!

815
00:53:58,205 --> 00:54:00,041
Buzz!

816
00:54:00,166 --> 00:54:02,460
Go away, you disgusting freaks!

817
00:54:04,086 --> 00:54:06,213
All right, back!
Back, you cannibals!

818
00:54:11,135 --> 00:54:14,805
He is still alive and you're...
you're not gonna get him, you monsters!

819
00:54:14,931 --> 00:54:16,849
What are you doin'?

820
00:54:19,226 --> 00:54:21,437
Hey. Hey, they fixed you.

821
00:54:25,233 --> 00:54:28,611
But... But they're cannibals.
We saw them eat those other toys.

822
00:54:37,536 --> 00:54:40,957
Uh, sorry. l-l-I thought
that you were gonna,

823
00:54:41,082 --> 00:54:43,292
you kn...
you know, eat my friend.

824
00:54:43,417 --> 00:54:45,711
Hey, no, no. Hey. Hey!
What's wrong?

825
00:54:45,836 --> 00:54:48,047
- Sid!
- Not now, Mom! I'm busy!

826
00:54:48,172 --> 00:54:50,132
Sid!

827
00:54:50,258 --> 00:54:52,635
Buzz, come on, get up!
Use your legs!

828
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:56,055
Fine! Let Sid trash you!
But don't blame me!

829
00:54:58,015 --> 00:55:01,102
It came! It finally came!

830
00:55:04,188 --> 00:55:06,065
"The Big One."

831
00:55:08,776 --> 00:55:13,573
"Extremely dangerous.
Keep out of reach of children."

832
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:18,536
Cool! What am I gonna blow?

833
00:55:18,661 --> 00:55:21,706
Man! Hey, where's that
wimpy cowboy doll?

834
00:55:35,803 --> 00:55:37,763
Yes.

835
00:55:37,888 --> 00:55:41,183
I've always wanted to put
a spaceman into orbit.

836
00:55:51,819 --> 00:55:53,195
Yes.

837
00:55:57,074 --> 00:55:59,452
Oh, no!

838
00:56:01,662 --> 00:56:03,873
Oh, man!

839
00:56:10,046 --> 00:56:11,881
Sid Phillips reporting.

840
00:56:12,006 --> 00:56:16,177
Launch of the shuttle has been delayed due to
adverse weather conditions at the launch site.

841
00:56:16,302 --> 00:56:19,305
Tomorrow's forecast? Sunny.

842
00:56:20,681 --> 00:56:22,558
Sweet dreams.

843
00:56:27,688 --> 00:56:31,067
I looked everywhere, honey,
but all I could find was your hat.

844
00:56:31,192 --> 00:56:33,361
W-What if we leave them behind?

845
00:56:33,486 --> 00:56:35,363
Oh, don't worry, honey.

846
00:56:35,488 --> 00:56:38,950
I'm sure we'll find Woody and
Buzz before we leave tomorrow.

847
00:56:47,291 --> 00:56:50,378
- I need air.
- Will you quit moving around?

848
00:56:50,503 --> 00:56:54,215
I'm sorry. It's just that I get...
I get so nervous before I travel.

849
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:56,801
How did I get stuck with you
as a moving buddy?

850
00:56:56,926 --> 00:56:58,761
Everyone else was picked.

851
00:57:05,768 --> 00:57:08,104
Oh, Woody.

852
00:57:08,229 --> 00:57:12,024
If only you could see
how much Andy misses you.

853
00:57:24,328 --> 00:57:27,331
Psst! Psst! Hey, Buzz!

854
00:57:34,088 --> 00:57:37,425
Hey. Get over here and see
if you can get this tool box off me.

855
00:57:40,803 --> 00:57:43,556
Oh, come on, Buzz, l...

856
00:57:43,681 --> 00:57:46,559
Buzz, I can't do this
without you.

857
00:57:46,684 --> 00:57:47,894
I need your help.

858
00:57:49,478 --> 00:57:52,690
I can't help.
I can't help anyone.

859
00:57:52,815 --> 00:57:55,651
Why, sure you can, Buzz.
You can get me out of here.

860
00:57:55,776 --> 00:57:58,738
And then I'll get that rocket off you
and we'll make a break for Andy's house.

861
00:57:58,863 --> 00:58:02,116
Andy's house, Sid's house.
What's the difference?

862
00:58:02,241 --> 00:58:06,495
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall.
Y-You must not be thinking clearly.

863
00:58:06,621 --> 00:58:10,374
No, Woody, for the first time
I am thinking clearly.

864
00:58:10,499 --> 00:58:13,085
You were right all along.
I'm not a Space Ranger.

865
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:17,214
I'm just a toy.
A stupid little insignificant toy.

866
00:58:17,214 --> 00:58:18,424
Whoa. Hey.
Wait a minute.

867
00:58:18,633 --> 00:58:22,261
Being a toy is a lot better than
being a, a Space Ranger.

868
00:58:22,303 --> 00:58:24,305
- Yeah, right.
- No, it is.

869
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:27,850
Look, over in that house is a kid
who thinks you are the greatest,

870
00:58:27,975 --> 00:58:30,519
and it's not because
you're a Space Ranger, pal.

871
00:58:30,645 --> 00:58:34,273
It's because you're a toy.
You are his toy.

872
00:58:34,398 --> 00:58:37,944
- But why would Andy want me?
- Why would Andy want you?

873
00:58:38,069 --> 00:58:41,155
Look at you!
You're a Buzz Lightyear!

874
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,283
Any other toy would give up
his moving parts just to be you.

875
00:58:44,408 --> 00:58:47,954
You've got wings!
You glow in the dark! You talk!

876
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:51,916
Your helmet does that...
that... that "whoosh" thing.

877
00:58:52,041 --> 00:58:54,210
You are a cool toy.

878
00:58:58,005 --> 00:59:01,425
As a matter of fact,
you're too cool.

879
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:04,679
I mean... I mean, what chance
does a toy like me have...

880
00:59:04,804 --> 00:59:07,974
against a Buzz Lightyear
action figure?

881
00:59:08,099 --> 00:59:10,810
All I can do is...

882
00:59:10,935 --> 00:59:13,271
<i>There's a snake in my boots!</i>

883
00:59:15,439 --> 00:59:19,151
Why would Andy ever want to
play with me when he's got you?

884
00:59:21,279 --> 00:59:25,116
I'm the one that should be
strapped to that rocket.

885
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:52,810
Listen, Buzz, forget about me. You
should get out of here while you can.

886
01:00:05,281 --> 01:00:08,117
- Buzz, what are you doin'? I thought you...
- Come on, Sheriff.

887
01:00:08,242 --> 01:00:11,704
There's a kid over in that house who needs us.
Now let's get you out of this thing.

888
01:00:11,829 --> 01:00:13,414
- Hit it!
- Yes, sir!

889
01:00:16,292 --> 01:00:18,336
Come on, Buzz, we can do it.

890
01:00:24,508 --> 01:00:28,054
- Woody! It's the moving van!
- We gotta get out of here now.

891
01:00:33,142 --> 01:00:34,602
Come on, Buzz.

892
01:00:36,562 --> 01:00:38,940
All right.

893
01:00:39,065 --> 01:00:42,360
- Buzz. Hey, I'm out!
- Almost there.

894
01:00:46,948 --> 01:00:49,867
I wanna ride the pony.

895
01:00:51,035 --> 01:00:53,537
Whew.

896
01:00:53,663 --> 01:00:56,624
Woody. Woody, are you all right?

897
01:00:57,875 --> 01:01:00,419
No, I'm fine. I'm okay.

898
01:01:11,138 --> 01:01:12,765
Oh, yeah!

899
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:15,351
Time for liftoff! Whoo!

900
01:01:17,395 --> 01:01:22,066
To infinity and beyond!
Whoo-hoo!

901
01:01:29,699 --> 01:01:31,742
Back! Back!

902
01:01:31,867 --> 01:01:34,078
Down! Down!

903
01:01:34,203 --> 01:01:37,081
Okay, what do I do?
Come on, Woody, think.

904
01:01:39,834 --> 01:01:42,169
Guys!

905
01:01:42,295 --> 01:01:44,797
No, no, no, no, wait!
Wait. Listen. Please!

906
01:01:44,922 --> 01:01:49,135
There's a good toy down there and he's...
he's gonna be blown to bits in a few minutes,

907
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:51,178
all because of me.

908
01:01:51,304 --> 01:01:52,680
We gotta save him.

909
01:01:53,931 --> 01:01:55,725
But I need your help.

910
01:02:03,232 --> 01:02:05,693
Please. He's my friend.

911
01:02:06,944 --> 01:02:09,739
He's the only one I've got.

912
01:02:22,752 --> 01:02:24,128
Thank you.

913
01:02:24,253 --> 01:02:26,339
Okay, I think I know
what to do.

914
01:02:26,464 --> 01:02:30,551
We're going to have to break a few rules,
but if it works it'll help everybody.

915
01:02:42,521 --> 01:02:45,274
Houston to Mission Control.
Come in, Control.

916
01:02:45,399 --> 01:02:48,110
Launchpad is being constructed.

917
01:02:50,571 --> 01:02:53,199
All right, listen up.
I need Pump Boy here.

918
01:02:53,324 --> 01:02:55,326
Ducky, here. Legs?

919
01:02:56,327 --> 01:02:58,329
You're with Ducky.

920
01:02:58,454 --> 01:03:00,623
RollerBob and I don't move
'til we get the signal. Clear?

921
01:03:01,832 --> 01:03:04,210
Okay. Let's move!

922
01:03:25,356 --> 01:03:27,483
Wind the frog!

923
01:03:48,546 --> 01:03:50,715
Wait for the signal.

924
01:04:06,063 --> 01:04:07,523
Go!

925
01:04:10,985 --> 01:04:12,945
All right, let's go!

926
01:04:13,070 --> 01:04:15,072
I'll get it!

927
01:04:15,197 --> 01:04:17,450
Now!

928
01:04:17,575 --> 01:04:19,869
I'm coming, I'm coming.

929
01:04:28,336 --> 01:04:30,129
Whoa! Scud!

930
01:04:34,342 --> 01:04:35,801
Stupid dog.

931
01:04:43,809 --> 01:04:45,519
Lean back!

932
01:04:49,941 --> 01:04:53,319
Uh, Mission Control, is the launchpad
construction complete?

933
01:04:53,444 --> 01:04:56,489
Uh, roger. Rocket is now
secured to guide wire.

934
01:04:56,614 --> 01:05:00,159
We are currently obtaining
the ignition sticks.

935
01:05:00,201 --> 01:05:02,245
Countdown will commence momentarily.
Stand by.

936
01:05:02,245 --> 01:05:04,247
Let's go.

937
01:05:04,372 --> 01:05:07,041
Hey, Mom!
Where are the matches?

938
01:05:07,166 --> 01:05:09,877
- Oh, wait, here they are. Never mind!
- Woody! Great!

939
01:05:10,002 --> 01:05:11,796
- Help me out of this thing.
- Shh!

940
01:05:11,921 --> 01:05:15,007
- What?
- It's okay. Everything's under control.

941
01:05:16,509 --> 01:05:19,679
- Woody, what are you doing?
- Houston, all systems are go.

942
01:05:19,804 --> 01:05:22,014
Requesting permission to launch.

943
01:05:23,224 --> 01:05:25,810
Hey. How'd you get out here?

944
01:05:27,311 --> 01:05:30,189
Oh, well. You and I
can have a cookout later.

945
01:05:33,943 --> 01:05:36,654
Houston, do we have
permission to launch?

946
01:05:36,779 --> 01:05:38,489
Uh, roger. Permission granted.

947
01:05:38,614 --> 01:05:42,243
You are confirmed
at T-minus ten seconds...

948
01:05:43,369 --> 01:05:44,912
and counting.

949
01:05:45,037 --> 01:05:48,749
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

950
01:05:48,874 --> 01:05:53,629
six, five, four, three,
two, one...

951
01:05:53,754 --> 01:05:57,508
<i>Reach for the sky.</i>

952
01:05:57,633 --> 01:06:02,054
<i>- Huh?
- This town ain't big enough for the two of us.</i>

953
01:06:02,179 --> 01:06:03,556
What?

954
01:06:03,681 --> 01:06:06,225
<i>Somebody's poisoned
the water hole.</i>

955
01:06:06,350 --> 01:06:10,438
<i>- It's busted.
- Who are you calling "busted,"buster?</i>

956
01:06:10,563 --> 01:06:12,356
<i>- Huh?
- That's right.</i>

957
01:06:12,481 --> 01:06:16,027
<i>- I'm talking to you, Sid Phillips.
- Huh?</i>

958
01:06:16,152 --> 01:06:18,988
<i>We don't like
bein' blown up, Sid.</i>

959
01:06:19,113 --> 01:06:21,699
<i>- Or smashed. Or ripped apart.
- We?</i>

960
01:06:21,824 --> 01:06:24,118
<i>That's right. Your toys.</i>

961
01:06:25,536 --> 01:06:29,248
Mama! Mama!

962
01:06:29,373 --> 01:06:32,501
Mama! Mama!

963
01:06:54,398 --> 01:06:56,234
Mama!

964
01:06:56,359 --> 01:07:00,655
<i>From now on you must take
good care of your toys,</i>

965
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:04,951
<i>because if you don't,
we'll find out, Sid.</i>

966
01:07:05,076 --> 01:07:10,706
<i>We toys can see everything.</i>

967
01:07:12,166 --> 01:07:14,502
So play nice.

968
01:07:21,092 --> 01:07:24,553
We did it! We did it! Yes!

969
01:07:24,679 --> 01:07:27,223
The toys! The toys are alive!

970
01:07:27,348 --> 01:07:29,809
N-Nice toy.

971
01:07:32,937 --> 01:07:36,357
What's wrong, Sid? Don't you
want to play with Sally?

972
01:07:38,276 --> 01:07:40,444
Nice work, fellas. Good job.

973
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:43,155
Coming out of the ground... what a touch.
That was a stroke of genius.

974
01:07:43,281 --> 01:07:44,907
Woody.

975
01:07:46,284 --> 01:07:48,160
Thanks.

976
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:51,539
Everybody say, "Bye, House!"

977
01:07:51,664 --> 01:07:53,541
- Woody! The van!
- Bye, House.

978
01:07:56,794 --> 01:07:58,504
We gotta run! Thanks, guys!

979
01:08:01,924 --> 01:08:03,259
Quick!

980
01:08:07,930 --> 01:08:09,640
Just go! I'll catch up!

981
01:08:31,454 --> 01:08:32,663
Come on!

982
01:08:48,137 --> 01:08:49,388
You can do it, Woody!

983
01:08:54,727 --> 01:08:56,646
I made it.

984
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:05,112
Ow! Get away, you stupid dog!
Down! Down!

985
01:09:05,238 --> 01:09:07,365
Hold on, Woody!

986
01:09:08,866 --> 01:09:10,618
I can't do it.

987
01:09:10,743 --> 01:09:13,287
Take care of Andy for me!

988
01:09:13,412 --> 01:09:16,040
No!

989
01:09:16,165 --> 01:09:17,583
Buzz!

990
01:09:44,735 --> 01:09:46,112
- Ow!
- Are we there already?

991
01:09:46,153 --> 01:09:47,280
- Woody?
- Woody!

992
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:48,406
- How did you...
- How'd he get here?

993
01:09:48,531 --> 01:09:51,158
- Where have you... What happened... Ow!
- What's goin' on?

994
01:09:51,284 --> 01:09:54,870
- What's the... What's he takin'?
- Aha! There you are!

995
01:09:54,996 --> 01:09:56,539
Hey, what's he doing?

996
01:10:00,042 --> 01:10:01,586
He's at it again!

997
01:10:13,389 --> 01:10:15,558
- Get him!
- Come on!

998
01:10:16,893 --> 01:10:18,060
Get him!

999
01:10:23,024 --> 01:10:24,984
Aah! Aah! No! No!

1000
01:10:29,363 --> 01:10:32,575
No, no, no, no, wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1001
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:34,535
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1002
01:10:34,535 --> 01:10:36,370
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1003
01:10:39,874 --> 01:10:41,459
Pig pile!

1004
01:11:03,397 --> 01:11:05,816
- Get out of that car!
- Move it!

1005
01:11:07,401 --> 01:11:09,862
- Whew.
- No, please! You don't understand!

1006
01:11:09,987 --> 01:11:12,865
Buzz is out there!
We gotta help him!

1007
01:11:12,990 --> 01:11:16,369
- Toss him overboard!
- No, no, no, no! Wait! Aaah!

1008
01:11:18,871 --> 01:11:21,749
- Hooray!
- So long, Woody!

1009
01:11:26,170 --> 01:11:28,923
- Ohh, Woody!
- Ohh!

1010
01:11:29,048 --> 01:11:32,885
- Oh! Well, thanks for the ride!
- Look out! Aaaah!

1011
01:11:35,972 --> 01:11:38,266
Now let's catch up
to that truck!

1012
01:11:45,481 --> 01:11:48,276
- Guys! Guys! Woody's riding R.C.!
- What?

1013
01:11:48,401 --> 01:11:50,319
And Buzz is with him!

1014
01:11:50,444 --> 01:11:51,946
- Ohh!
- What? Buzz?

1015
01:11:54,532 --> 01:11:57,702
It is Buzz!
Woody was telling the truth!

1016
01:11:57,827 --> 01:12:00,871
- What have we done?
- Great! Now I have guilt!

1017
01:12:00,997 --> 01:12:04,375
We're almost there!

1018
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:08,546
- Rocky, the ramp!
- Come on, Woody, Buzz! You can do it!

1019
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:17,054
Look out!

1020
01:12:17,179 --> 01:12:19,724
Quick! Hold on to my tail!

1021
01:12:24,353 --> 01:12:26,272
Atta boy, Slink!

1022
01:12:26,397 --> 01:12:29,400
Uhh! Woody!

1023
01:12:29,525 --> 01:12:31,569
- Woody, speed up!
- Speed up!

1024
01:12:31,694 --> 01:12:34,530
The batteries!
They're running out!

1025
01:12:34,655 --> 01:12:36,532
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1026
01:12:37,867 --> 01:12:41,162
- Whoa!
- Aaaah!

1027
01:12:41,287 --> 01:12:43,623
<i># Hakuna Matata</i>

1028
01:12:43,748 --> 01:12:46,417
<i># What a wonderful phrase</i>

1029
01:12:50,463 --> 01:12:52,715
I can't hold on much longer!

1030
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:55,051
Slink, hang on!

1031
01:12:56,469 --> 01:12:58,095
Ouch!

1032
01:13:10,274 --> 01:13:12,193
Great.

1033
01:13:14,695 --> 01:13:17,615
- Woody! The rocket!
- The match!

1034
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:20,952
Yes! Thank you, Sid!

1035
01:13:28,292 --> 01:13:30,586
No! No, no! No!

1036
01:13:30,711 --> 01:13:32,088
No!

1037
01:13:32,213 --> 01:13:35,591
Oh, no, no, no,

1038
01:13:35,716 --> 01:13:39,303
no, no, no, no!

1039
01:13:39,428 --> 01:13:41,305
No!

1040
01:13:50,189 --> 01:13:53,234
- Woody, what are you doing?
- Hold still, Buzz.

1041
01:13:56,195 --> 01:13:59,365
You did it! Next stop, Andy.

1042
01:13:59,490 --> 01:14:02,159
Wait a minute.
I just lit a rocket.

1043
01:14:02,285 --> 01:14:04,161
Rockets explode!

1044
01:14:13,629 --> 01:14:16,674
I should've held on longer.

1045
01:14:16,799 --> 01:14:19,385
Look! Look! It's Woody and Buzz
coming up fast!

1046
01:14:20,511 --> 01:14:22,263
Woody!

1047
01:14:30,688 --> 01:14:32,565
Run! Take cover!

1048
01:14:39,405 --> 01:14:41,908
Aah! This is the part
where we blow up!

1049
01:14:42,033 --> 01:14:44,118
Not today.

1050
01:14:55,212 --> 01:14:57,298
Hey, Buzz! You're flying!

1051
01:14:57,423 --> 01:15:00,718
This isn't flying.
This is falling with style.

1052
01:15:03,721 --> 01:15:07,600
To infinity and beyond!

1053
01:15:13,105 --> 01:15:15,942
Uh, Buzz, we missed the truck.

1054
01:15:16,067 --> 01:15:17,944
We're not aiming for the truck.

1055
01:15:24,909 --> 01:15:26,577
- Hey! Wow!
- What? What is it?

1056
01:15:26,702 --> 01:15:28,496
Woody!
Buzz!

1057
01:15:27,870 --> 01:15:30,081
Oh, great! You found 'em.
Where were they?

1058
01:15:30,081 --> 01:15:32,041
- Here in the car!
- See?

1059
01:15:32,083 --> 01:15:35,544
Now, what did I tell you?
Right where you left 'em.

1060
01:15:44,554 --> 01:15:47,431
- Which one can I open first?
- Let's let Molly open one.

1061
01:15:53,854 --> 01:15:56,566
<i>- Frankincense, this is Myrrh.
- Hey, heads up, everybody!</i>

1062
01:15:56,691 --> 01:15:59,068
- It's show time!
- Oh! It's time!

1063
01:16:01,487 --> 01:16:05,491
Oh. Bo. There's gotta be a less
painful way to get my attention.

1064
01:16:05,616 --> 01:16:08,744
<i>Merry Christmas, Sheriff.</i>

1065
01:16:08,869 --> 01:16:11,289
<i>- Say, isn't that mistletoe?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

1066
01:16:14,166 --> 01:16:17,295
Maybe Andy'll get another
dinosaur, like a leaf eater.

1067
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:21,048
That way I could play
the, uh, dominant predator!

1068
01:16:21,173 --> 01:16:24,051
<i>- Quiet, everyone, quiet.
- Molly's first present is...</i>

1069
01:16:24,176 --> 01:16:25,636
<i>Mrs. Potato Head!</i>

1070
01:16:25,761 --> 01:16:28,180
<i>Repeat, a Mrs. Potato Head!</i>

1071
01:16:28,306 --> 01:16:31,851
- Way to go, Idaho!
- Gee, I'd better shave.

1072
01:16:36,814 --> 01:16:40,318
<i>Come in, Frankincense. Andy is now
opening his first present. It's...</i>

1073
01:16:41,777 --> 01:16:43,446
<i>- Buzz. Buzz Lightyear.
- I can't quite...</i>

1074
01:16:43,571 --> 01:16:45,656
- You are not worried, are you?
- Me? No.

1075
01:16:45,781 --> 01:16:49,535
<i>- make out...
- No. No, no, no, no, no, no. Mm-mmm.</i>

1076
01:16:49,660 --> 01:16:51,787
<i>A large box.
It's, it's, it's...</i>

1077
01:16:51,913 --> 01:16:54,540
- Are you?
- Oh, now, Buzz.

1078
01:16:54,665 --> 01:16:58,794
What could Andy possibly get
that is worse than you?

1079
01:17:00,338 --> 01:17:03,841
Oh, what is it? What is it?
Wow! A puppy!

1080
01:17:18,940 --> 01:17:21,359
<i># You've got a friend in me #</i>
