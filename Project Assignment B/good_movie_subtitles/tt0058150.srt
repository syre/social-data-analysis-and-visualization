00:02:45,351 --> 00:02:46,726
Yahoo!

2
00:03:03,867 --> 00:03:05,034
Congratulations.

3
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:06,452
Thank you.

4
00:03:06,536 --> 00:03:09,246
Mr. Ramirez and
his friends will
be out of business.

5
00:03:09,331 --> 00:03:13,792
At least he won't be using
heroin-flavored bananas
to finance revolutions.

6
00:03:14,502 --> 00:03:16,544
Don't go back to
your hotel, señor.

7
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:18,546
They'll be watching it.

8
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,924
There's a plane leaving
for Miami in an hour.

9
00:03:21,008 --> 00:03:23,759
I'll be on it, but
first I have some

10
00:03:23,843 --> 00:03:25,552
unfinished business
to attend to.

11
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,273
Hmm.

12
00:03:45,446 --> 00:03:46,989
Forgive me.

13
00:03:47,073 --> 00:03:49,241
Why do you always
wear that thing?

14
00:03:49,325 --> 00:03:52,077
I have a slight
inferiority complex.

15
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:54,704
Where was I?
Oh, yes.

16
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,338
Shocking.

17
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,635
Positively shocking.

18
00:05:21,116 --> 00:05:23,618
Goldfinger

19
00:05:26,496 --> 00:05:28,038
He's the man

20
00:05:28,122 --> 00:05:31,124
The man with
the Midas touch

21
00:05:33,503 --> 00:05:35,962
A spider's touch

22
00:05:38,715 --> 00:05:42,134
Such a cold finger

23
00:05:45,347 --> 00:05:46,680
Beckons you

24
00:05:46,765 --> 00:05:50,433
To enter his web of sin

25
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:55,021
But don't go in

26
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:02,152
Golden words
he will pour
in your ear

27
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:07,449
But his lies can't
disguise what you fear

28
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:10,284
For a golden girl

29
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:13,204
Knows when he's kissed her

30
00:06:13,288 --> 00:06:16,290
It's the kiss of death

31
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:20,001
From Mr. Goldfinger

32
00:06:23,214 --> 00:06:24,798
Pretty girl

33
00:06:24,882 --> 00:06:28,926
Beware of this heart of gold

34
00:06:30,262 --> 00:06:34,473
This heart is cold

35
00:06:36,226 --> 00:06:40,645
Golden words
he will pour
in your ear

36
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:45,191
But his lies can't
disguise what you fear

37
00:06:45,276 --> 00:06:48,027
For a golden girl

38
00:06:48,112 --> 00:06:50,946
Knows when he's kissed her

39
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:54,116
It's the kiss of death

40
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,578
From Mr. Goldfinger

41
00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:02,248
Pretty girl

42
00:07:02,332 --> 00:07:07,753
Beware of this heart of gold

43
00:07:07,838 --> 00:07:12,549
This heart is cold

44
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:16,720
He loves only gold

45
00:07:17,263 --> 00:07:21,599
Only gold

46
00:07:21,683 --> 00:07:25,519
He loves gold

47
00:07:25,687 --> 00:07:30,191
He loves only gold

48
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:33,943
Only gold

49
00:07:34,528 --> 00:07:36,528
He loves gold

50
00:08:57,144 --> 00:08:58,186
How's this?

51
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:00,730
- That's nice.
- Very nice.

52
00:09:00,815 --> 00:09:02,232
Just here?

53
00:09:02,316 --> 00:09:03,984
No, a little lower,
darling.

54
00:09:04,068 --> 00:09:06,610
I thought I'd find you
in good hands.

55
00:09:07,696 --> 00:09:08,696
Felix!

56
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,531
Felix, how are you?

57
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:12,658
Dink, meet
Felix Letter.
Hello.

58
00:09:12,742 --> 00:09:14,742
Felix, say hello to Dink.
Hi, Dink.

59
00:09:14,827 --> 00:09:16,369
Dink, say goodbye
to Felix.

60
00:09:16,453 --> 00:09:18,121
Hmm?
Man talk.

61
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:25,294
You must be slipping, 007,
letting the opposition
get that close to you.

62
00:09:25,378 --> 00:09:27,462
They got a lot closer
to you in Jamaica,
didn't they?

63
00:09:27,547 --> 00:09:29,464
But what's on your mind?
I'm on holiday.

64
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:31,591
Not any more, you're not.
Signal from London.

65
00:09:31,676 --> 00:09:33,135
Might have known M
wouldn't book me into

66
00:09:33,219 --> 00:09:35,720
the best hotel
in Miami Beach
out of pure gratitude.

67
00:09:35,804 --> 00:09:38,222
He asked us to keep
an eye on him for you.

68
00:09:38,307 --> 00:09:39,974
Auric Goldfinger.

69
00:09:40,058 --> 00:09:41,642
Sounds like
a French nail varnish.

70
00:09:41,727 --> 00:09:43,978
He's British,
but he doesn't
sound like it.

71
00:09:44,062 --> 00:09:47,272
Big operator.
Worldwide interests, all
apparently quite reputable.

72
00:09:47,356 --> 00:09:49,149
Owns one of the finest
stud farms in the States.

73
00:09:49,233 --> 00:09:50,942
What's the tie-up
with Washington?

74
00:09:51,027 --> 00:09:53,069
He's clean, as far as
CIA is concerned.

75
00:09:53,154 --> 00:09:55,113
And where do I find him?

76
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:05,039
That's his pigeon
waiting for him now.

77
00:10:05,123 --> 00:10:06,789
Goldfinger's
been taking him
to the cleaners

78
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:08,666
every day
for a week.

79
00:10:11,587 --> 00:10:14,047
Morning, Mr. Simmons.
Ready for our little game?

80
00:10:14,131 --> 00:10:15,214
Sure, I'm ready.

81
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:16,466
When you're 10 grand
in the hole,

82
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,008
you're ready
for anything.

83
00:10:18,092 --> 00:10:20,344
Could I have
my usual seat?

84
00:10:20,428 --> 00:10:22,220
You and your suntan.

85
00:10:22,305 --> 00:10:24,473
That Goldfinger's
a fabulous card player.

86
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:25,932
Same stakes?

87
00:10:26,017 --> 00:10:28,601
Let's double it.
$5 a point.

88
00:10:32,105 --> 00:10:33,147
Did you say five?

89
00:10:33,231 --> 00:10:35,566
My luck's got to
change sometime.

90
00:10:35,942 --> 00:10:36,984
Okay.

91
00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:40,653
I'll get back to the
office and cable M
you're on the job.

92
00:10:40,738 --> 00:10:42,030
You can fill me in
on the rest at dinner.

93
00:10:42,114 --> 00:10:44,157
Fine, I'll call you later.

94
00:11:00,672 --> 00:11:01,672
Four.

95
00:11:01,757 --> 00:11:02,965
So soon?

96
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,175
How many?

97
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:09,471
Seven,
12, 18, 32, 44.

98
00:11:19,148 --> 00:11:20,272
Miss?

99
00:11:21,691 --> 00:11:23,609
Hey, what do you...

100
00:11:23,819 --> 00:11:26,237
That's Mr. Goldfinger's
suite.

101
00:11:26,321 --> 00:11:27,738
Yes, I know.

102
00:11:29,949 --> 00:11:31,616
You're very sweet.

103
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:38,915
He just drew
the king of clubs.

104
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:40,958
That makes
his count 59.

105
00:11:42,085 --> 00:11:45,170
He's got a diamond run,
8, 9, 10.

106
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:48,507
He's holding on to
the six of spades,

107
00:11:48,591 --> 00:11:50,716
so I guess he thinks
you want it.

108
00:11:50,801 --> 00:11:53,261
That last draw
was the eight
of hearts.

109
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,931
He needs
kings and queens.

110
00:11:58,976 --> 00:11:59,976
Who are you?

111
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,685
Bond. James Bond.

112
00:12:14,781 --> 00:12:16,407
Come on,
come on.

113
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,452
Ah, that's
more like it.

114
00:12:20,871 --> 00:12:22,495
What's your name?

115
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,663
Jill.

116
00:12:23,747 --> 00:12:24,831
Jill who?

117
00:12:24,915 --> 00:12:26,583
Jill Masterson.

118
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:30,962
Tell me, Jill,
why does he do it?

119
00:12:31,046 --> 00:12:32,713
He likes to win.

120
00:12:32,797 --> 00:12:34,381
Why do you do it?

121
00:12:34,883 --> 00:12:36,216
He pays me.

122
00:12:36,551 --> 00:12:38,302
Is that all
he pays you for?

123
00:12:38,386 --> 00:12:40,471
And for being
seen with him.

124
00:12:40,847 --> 00:12:42,306
Just seen?

125
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:43,723
Just seen.

126
00:12:44,766 --> 00:12:46,225
I'm so glad.

127
00:12:49,771 --> 00:12:51,105
You're much too

128
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:54,191
nice to be mixed up
in anything like this,
you know.

129
00:12:58,988 --> 00:13:00,489
Now hear this,
Goldfinger.

130
00:13:00,573 --> 00:13:02,782
Your luck has
just changed.

131
00:13:02,867 --> 00:13:04,742
I doubt very much if
the Miami Beach police

132
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:07,453
would take kindly
to what you're doing.

133
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,165
Nod your head
if you agree.

134
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,791
Nod!

135
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,544
Good. Now start losing,
Goldfinger.

136
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:20,089
Shall we say,
$10,000?

137
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:23,884
No, let's be generous.
Let's make it 15,000.

138
00:13:26,846 --> 00:13:28,764
May I see?

139
00:13:35,604 --> 00:13:38,439
Well, I can see this
is really my day.

140
00:13:39,358 --> 00:13:40,441
Gin.

141
00:13:48,282 --> 00:13:49,699
Over and out.

142
00:13:50,409 --> 00:13:53,578
That should keep
him occupied for
quite some time.

143
00:13:53,663 --> 00:13:55,788
I'm beginning to
like you, Mr. Bond.

144
00:13:55,872 --> 00:13:58,207
Oh, call me James.

145
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:01,961
More than
anyone I've met in
a long time, James.

146
00:14:03,255 --> 00:14:05,922
Well, what on earth
are we going to
do about it?

147
00:14:06,006 --> 00:14:07,549
Yes, what?

148
00:14:07,633 --> 00:14:09,050
I'll tell you
at dinner.

149
00:14:09,134 --> 00:14:10,301
Where?

150
00:14:11,053 --> 00:14:13,429
Well, I know the
best place in town.

151
00:14:33,574 --> 00:14:36,866
Station W.E.B.S. brings you
the latest in world news.

152
00:14:36,951 --> 00:14:40,245
Washington. At the White House
this afternoon,

153
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:43,373
the President said
he was entirely satisfied...

154
00:14:47,335 --> 00:14:49,169
That makes
two of us.

155
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,510
Hello.

156
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:57,844
Letter here.

157
00:14:57,928 --> 00:14:59,679
Oh, Felix.
Well, now?

158
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:02,056
What's that? Dinner?

159
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,602
No. Look, I'm sorry.
I can't.

160
00:15:05,686 --> 00:15:07,103
Something big's come up.

161
00:15:07,187 --> 00:15:08,395
Right...

162
00:15:09,147 --> 00:15:10,939
Uh, how about breakfast?

163
00:15:11,024 --> 00:15:12,024
Okay.

164
00:15:12,108 --> 00:15:13,817
Not too early.

165
00:15:13,901 --> 00:15:15,277
I'll call you
around 9:00.

166
00:15:15,361 --> 00:15:16,945
Yes, 9:00 will be fine.

167
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,988
So long, James.
Good night, Felix.

168
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,584
It's lost its chill.

169
00:15:36,797 --> 00:15:37,797
Why, you...

170
00:15:37,882 --> 00:15:40,549
It's all right, there's
another in the fridge.

171
00:15:40,634 --> 00:15:41,675
Who needs it?

172
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,303
My dear girl, there
are some things that
just aren't done,

173
00:15:44,387 --> 00:15:47,181
such as drinking
Dom Perignon '53

174
00:15:47,265 --> 00:15:50,475
above a temperature of
38 degrees Fahrenheit.

175
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:54,103
That's as bad as listening to
the Beatles without earmuffs.

176
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:58,232
Now, where is
this passion juice?

177
00:16:36,643 --> 00:16:37,768
Jill?

178
00:17:19,432 --> 00:17:20,807
Yes, Mr. Bond?

179
00:17:20,891 --> 00:17:24,101
Beach 79432,
room 119.

180
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:32,651
Hello?

181
00:17:32,736 --> 00:17:35,278
Hello, Felix?
Get over here right away.

182
00:17:35,696 --> 00:17:37,029
What's up?

183
00:17:37,114 --> 00:17:38,281
The girl's dead.

184
00:17:38,365 --> 00:17:39,532
Dink?

185
00:17:39,616 --> 00:17:41,743
No. Masterson,
Jill Masterson,

186
00:17:42,244 --> 00:17:44,119
and she's
covered in paint.

187
00:17:44,203 --> 00:17:45,746
Gold paint.

188
00:17:56,173 --> 00:17:59,133
Gold? All over?

189
00:17:59,718 --> 00:18:01,427
She died of
skin suffocation.

190
00:18:01,511 --> 00:18:04,013
It's been known to happen
to cabaret dancers.

191
00:18:04,097 --> 00:18:06,264
It's all right
so long as you leave
a small bare patch

192
00:18:06,348 --> 00:18:09,017
at the base of
the spine to allow
the skin to breathe.

193
00:18:09,101 --> 00:18:10,602
Someone
obviously didn't.

194
00:18:10,686 --> 00:18:12,270
And I know who.

195
00:18:16,483 --> 00:18:19,109
This isn't a personal
vendetta, 007.

196
00:18:19,861 --> 00:18:21,653
It's an assignment,
like any other

197
00:18:21,738 --> 00:18:25,281
and if you can't
treat it as such,
coldly and objectively,

198
00:18:25,365 --> 00:18:27,366
008 can replace you.

199
00:18:29,703 --> 00:18:31,788
You've hardly distinguished
yourself, have you?

200
00:18:31,872 --> 00:18:35,082
You were supposed to
observe Mr. Goldfinger,
not borrow his girlfriend.

201
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:37,083
Instead of that,
Goldfinger goes
off to Europe,

202
00:18:37,168 --> 00:18:39,503
and it's only by
the grace of God,
your friend Letter,

203
00:18:39,587 --> 00:18:41,797
and my intervention with
the British embassy
in Washington,

204
00:18:41,881 --> 00:18:44,216
that you're not in
the custody of the
Miami Beach police.

205
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,926
Sir, I'm aware of
my shortcomings,

206
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,386
but I'm prepared to
continue this assignment

207
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,806
in the spirit
you suggest,

208
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:54,016
if I knew
what it was about.

209
00:18:55,227 --> 00:18:56,351
Sir.

210
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:59,562
What do you
know about gold?
Not paint, bullion.

211
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,232
I know it
when I see it.

212
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:05,652
Meet me here at 7:00.
Black tie.

213
00:19:15,453 --> 00:19:17,995
Now, what do you know
about gold, Moneypenny?

214
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,832
Oh, the only gold
I know about is
the kind you wear.

215
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:23,292
You know,
on the third finger
of your left hand.

216
00:19:23,377 --> 00:19:25,086
Mmm-hmm.
One of these days

217
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,420
we really must
look into that.

218
00:19:26,505 --> 00:19:27,504
Well, what about
tonight?

219
00:19:27,588 --> 00:19:29,756
You'll come around
for dinner,

220
00:19:29,841 --> 00:19:32,467
and I'll cook you
a beautiful angel cake.

221
00:19:32,552 --> 00:19:34,094
Well, nothing
would give me
greater pleasure,

222
00:19:34,178 --> 00:19:37,596
but unfortunately I do have
a business appointment.

223
00:19:37,806 --> 00:19:41,225
That's the flimsiest excuse
you've ever given me.

224
00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:44,395
Ah, well, some girls
have all the luck.

225
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:45,479
Who is she,
James?

226
00:19:45,564 --> 00:19:46,730
She is me,
Miss Moneypenny,

227
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:50,400
and kindly omit the
customary by-play
with 007.

228
00:19:50,484 --> 00:19:52,902
He's dining with me,
and I don't want him
to be late.

229
00:19:54,196 --> 00:19:56,197
So there's hope
for me yet.

230
00:19:57,783 --> 00:20:01,201
Moneypenny, won't you
ever believe me?

231
00:20:04,122 --> 00:20:06,206
We here at the Bank
of England, Mr. Bond,

232
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,833
are the official
depository for
gold bullion

233
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:12,211
just as Fort Knox,
Kentucky, is for
the United States.

234
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:14,046
We know, of course,
the amounts we
each hold,

235
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:16,173
we know the amounts
deposited in
other banks,

236
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:19,134
and we can estimate
what is being held
for industrial purposes.

237
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,720
This enables
the two governments to
establish, respectively,

238
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,055
the true value of
the dollar and the pound.

239
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,143
Consequently, we are
vitally concerned with
unauthorized leakages.

240
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,394
I take it
you mean smuggling?

241
00:20:30,478 --> 00:20:31,645
Yes.

242
00:20:32,355 --> 00:20:36,066
Gold, gentlemen,
which can be melted
down and recast,

243
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,818
is virtually untraceable,

244
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,820
which makes it,
unlike diamonds,
ideal for smuggling,

245
00:20:40,905 --> 00:20:43,323
attracting the biggest
and most ingenious
criminals.

246
00:20:43,407 --> 00:20:45,158
Thank you, Brunskill.
That'll be all.

247
00:20:45,242 --> 00:20:46,784
Thank you, sir.

248
00:20:47,202 --> 00:20:50,746
Have a little more of this
rather disappointing brandy.

249
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,122
What's the matter
with it?

250
00:20:52,206 --> 00:20:53,999
I'd say it was
a 30-year-old Fine

251
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,335
indifferently
blended, sir...

252
00:20:57,503 --> 00:20:59,421
With an overdose
of Bons Bois.

253
00:20:59,505 --> 00:21:02,423
Colonel Smithers
is giving the
lecture, 007.

254
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:07,386
Gentlemen, Mr. Goldfinger
has gold bullion on deposit

255
00:21:07,471 --> 00:21:10,139
in Zurich, Amsterdam,
Caracas, and Hong Kong.

256
00:21:10,223 --> 00:21:13,433
Worth 20 million pounds.
Most of it came
from this country.

257
00:21:13,517 --> 00:21:14,893
Why move it?

258
00:21:14,977 --> 00:21:17,103
Because the price
of gold varies from
country to country.

259
00:21:17,188 --> 00:21:18,647
If you buy it here
at $30 an ounce,

260
00:21:18,731 --> 00:21:21,857
you can sell it in, say,
Pakistan at $110

261
00:21:21,942 --> 00:21:23,233
and triple your money.

262
00:21:23,318 --> 00:21:26,362
Providing, of course,
you have the facilities
for melting it down.

263
00:21:26,446 --> 00:21:27,488
And has he?

264
00:21:27,572 --> 00:21:28,906
Apart from being
a legitimate
bullion dealer,

265
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,908
Mr. Goldfinger poses...

266
00:21:31,534 --> 00:21:33,034
No, that's not
quite fair.

267
00:21:33,118 --> 00:21:37,914
Is, among his many other
interests, a legitimate
international jeweler.

268
00:21:37,998 --> 00:21:39,457
He's legally entitled

269
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:42,626
to operate modest
metallurgical
installations.

270
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,503
His British one
is down in Kent.

271
00:21:44,587 --> 00:21:45,921
As yet, we have
failed to discover

272
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:48,465
how he transfers
his gold overseas.

273
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:50,384
And Lord knows
we've tried.

274
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:54,053
If your department
can establish that
it is done illegally,

275
00:21:54,137 --> 00:21:55,721
then the bank could
institute proceedings

276
00:21:55,806 --> 00:21:57,306
to recover the bulk
of his holdings.

277
00:21:57,391 --> 00:22:00,309
I think it's time
Mr. Goldfinger
and I met.

278
00:22:00,394 --> 00:22:01,894
Socially,
of course.

279
00:22:01,979 --> 00:22:04,396
I was hoping
you'd say that.

280
00:22:05,189 --> 00:22:06,982
It might lead
to a business talk,

281
00:22:07,066 --> 00:22:08,817
Mr. Goldfinger's
kind of business.

282
00:22:08,901 --> 00:22:10,193
I'll need some
sort of bait.

283
00:22:10,277 --> 00:22:12,445
I quite agree. This is
the only one we have

284
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,279
from the Nazi hoard
at the bottom of
Lake Toplitz

285
00:22:14,364 --> 00:22:15,823
in the Salzkammergut.

286
00:22:15,907 --> 00:22:18,200
But there are
undoubtedly others.

287
00:22:19,077 --> 00:22:22,037
Mr. Bond can make
whatever use of it
he thinks fit,

288
00:22:22,122 --> 00:22:23,997
providing he returns it,
of course.

289
00:22:24,081 --> 00:22:26,582
It's worth £5,000.

290
00:22:30,212 --> 00:22:33,965
You'll draw it from Q branch
with the rest of your
equipment in the morning.

291
00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:35,382
Of course, sir.

292
00:22:50,814 --> 00:22:51,814
Morning, Q.

293
00:22:51,898 --> 00:22:54,525
Good morning, 007.
This way, please.

294
00:22:55,943 --> 00:22:57,861
My, we are busy
this morning.

295
00:23:03,576 --> 00:23:05,576
It's not
perfected yet.

296
00:23:05,952 --> 00:23:07,161
Where's
my Bentley?

297
00:23:07,245 --> 00:23:09,371
Oh, it's had its day,
I'm afraid.

298
00:23:09,456 --> 00:23:10,497
But it's never
let me down.

299
00:23:10,582 --> 00:23:12,374
M's orders, 007.

300
00:23:12,751 --> 00:23:16,919
You'll be using
this Aston Martin DB5,
with modifications.

301
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:19,964
Now, pay attention,
please.

302
00:23:20,466 --> 00:23:22,216
Windscreen,
bulletproof.

303
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:24,802
As are the side
and the rear windows.

304
00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:28,055
Revolving number plates,
naturally.

305
00:23:28,139 --> 00:23:30,182
Valid all countries.

306
00:23:30,975 --> 00:23:34,561
Here's a nice little
transmitting device
called a homer.

307
00:23:34,645 --> 00:23:37,354
You prime it by pressing
that back like this.

308
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:40,941
You see? The smaller model
is now standard field issue,

309
00:23:41,026 --> 00:23:43,360
to be fitted into
the heel of your shoe.

310
00:23:43,445 --> 00:23:45,488
Its larger brother
is magnetic.

311
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,572
Right.

312
00:23:47,656 --> 00:23:49,657
To be concealed in
the car you're trailing

313
00:23:49,742 --> 00:23:51,993
while you keep
out of sight.

314
00:23:52,745 --> 00:23:56,706
Reception on
the dashboard here.

315
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:01,627
Auto-visual.
Range, 150 miles.

316
00:24:01,711 --> 00:24:04,171
- Ingenious.
- And useful, too.

317
00:24:04,255 --> 00:24:07,299
Allow a man to stop off
for a quick one en route.

318
00:24:07,383 --> 00:24:10,259
It has not been
perfected after years
of patient research

319
00:24:10,344 --> 00:24:12,595
entirely for
that purpose, 007.

320
00:24:14,264 --> 00:24:16,682
And incidentally,
we'd appreciate
its return,

321
00:24:16,767 --> 00:24:18,850
along with all
your other equipment,

322
00:24:18,935 --> 00:24:21,645
intact, for once,
when you return
from the field.

323
00:24:21,729 --> 00:24:22,771
Well, you'd be surprised

324
00:24:22,855 --> 00:24:26,566
the amount of wear and tear
that goes on out there
in the field.

325
00:24:26,651 --> 00:24:27,692
Anything else?

326
00:24:27,777 --> 00:24:29,652
Well, I won't keep you
for more than an hour or so,

327
00:24:29,736 --> 00:24:31,654
if you give me your
undivided attention.

328
00:24:31,738 --> 00:24:34,990
We've installed some
rather interesting
modifications.

329
00:24:35,867 --> 00:24:37,743
You see this arm here?

330
00:24:38,702 --> 00:24:42,372
Now, open the top,
and inside are your
defense mechanism controls.

331
00:24:42,456 --> 00:24:46,709
Smoke screen, oil slick,
rear bulletproof screen,

332
00:24:47,044 --> 00:24:49,628
and left and right
front-wing machine guns.

333
00:24:49,712 --> 00:24:52,047
Now, this one I'm
particularly keen about.

334
00:24:52,132 --> 00:24:53,715
You see the gear lever here?

335
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,467
Now, if you take
the top off,

336
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,803
you'll find
a little red button.

337
00:24:59,139 --> 00:25:00,930
Whatever you do,
don't touch it.

338
00:25:01,014 --> 00:25:02,098
And why not?

339
00:25:02,182 --> 00:25:04,475
'Cause you'll release
this section of the roof

340
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,812
and engage and then
fire the passenger
ejector seat.

341
00:25:09,439 --> 00:25:11,231
Ejector seat?
You're joking.

342
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:14,442
I never joke
about my work, 007.

343
00:25:20,074 --> 00:25:21,323
Ready, Blacking?

344
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:24,702
Yes, sir.
There's an old member
dropped by, sir.

345
00:25:24,786 --> 00:25:28,038
Same handicap as yours,
I wondered if you'd
rather play with him.

346
00:25:28,123 --> 00:25:29,331
Where is he?

347
00:25:29,416 --> 00:25:30,915
Mr. Bond?
Yes?

348
00:25:31,417 --> 00:25:33,293
This is
Mr. Goldfinger.

349
00:25:37,214 --> 00:25:39,924
How do you do?

350
00:25:41,551 --> 00:25:44,052
You can go straight off,
the first tee is clear.

351
00:25:44,137 --> 00:25:46,597
Fine.
I'll get Hawker to carry
for you, Mr. Bond.

352
00:25:46,681 --> 00:25:47,723
Well, that'll
be splendid.

353
00:25:47,807 --> 00:25:49,141
Shall we make it
a shilling a hole?

354
00:25:49,225 --> 00:25:50,434
Mmm-hmm.

355
00:25:51,643 --> 00:25:52,643
I'll take some tees.

356
00:25:52,728 --> 00:25:54,145
Yes, of course.

357
00:25:58,358 --> 00:26:00,693
Oh, you must excuse
Oddjob, Mr. Bond.

358
00:26:00,777 --> 00:26:03,236
He's an admirable
manservant, but mute.

359
00:26:03,321 --> 00:26:05,197
He's not
a very good caddie.

360
00:26:05,281 --> 00:26:08,867
Golf is not yet
the national game
of Korea, hey?

361
00:26:20,795 --> 00:26:23,463
This meeting is not
a coincidence, hmm?

362
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:27,383
What's your game,
Mr. Bond?

363
00:26:31,931 --> 00:26:33,138
My game?

364
00:26:33,806 --> 00:26:36,225
You didn't come here
to play golf.

365
00:26:56,327 --> 00:26:59,579
The 1940 smelt from
the Weigenhaler foundry
at Essen.

366
00:26:59,664 --> 00:27:00,914
Part of a smelt
of 600.

367
00:27:00,998 --> 00:27:02,666
They vanished in 1944.

368
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,667
When the Nazis
were on the run.

369
00:27:04,751 --> 00:27:06,126
And you have
access to more?

370
00:27:06,211 --> 00:27:08,295
Yes, from the
same source.

371
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,797
Interesting.

372
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:11,882
Two holes to go.

373
00:27:11,967 --> 00:27:13,717
Yes, and all square.

374
00:27:14,302 --> 00:27:16,552
Then you have no objection
to increasing the stakes?

375
00:27:16,637 --> 00:27:18,554
No, what do you
have in mind?

376
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:21,516
The bar of gold
you have with
you, naturally.

377
00:27:23,018 --> 00:27:24,519
It's worth £5,000.

378
00:27:24,603 --> 00:27:27,020
Oh, I'll stake
the cash equivalent.

379
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,190
Naturally.

380
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:36,946
Strict rules of golf?

381
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:40,491
But of course.

382
00:28:12,896 --> 00:28:15,231
Oh, bad luck.
You're in the rough.

383
00:28:23,906 --> 00:28:26,700
Oh, what a pity.
Here it is.

384
00:28:26,784 --> 00:28:29,577
No, it's not.
He plays
a Slazenger 1.

385
00:28:31,288 --> 00:28:33,205
Strict rules of golf,
Goldfinger.

386
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:34,540
Five minutes
are almost up.

387
00:28:34,624 --> 00:28:37,709
A lost ball will
cost you a stroke
and distance.

388
00:28:50,347 --> 00:28:51,347
Aha!

389
00:28:51,431 --> 00:28:52,556
Uh-oh.

390
00:28:54,142 --> 00:28:56,602
I'm still training him
as a caddie.

391
00:28:58,437 --> 00:29:00,104
Successfully, too.

392
00:29:01,774 --> 00:29:03,775
Slazenger
Number 1?

393
00:29:03,859 --> 00:29:04,942
Good.

394
00:29:06,904 --> 00:29:10,197
If that's
his original ball,
I'm Arnold Palmer.

395
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:11,782
It isn't.

396
00:29:11,866 --> 00:29:13,241
How do you know?

397
00:29:13,326 --> 00:29:15,077
I'm standing on it.

398
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:18,996
Why, you crafty old...

399
00:29:19,289 --> 00:29:20,539
Leave it.

400
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:23,417
The ball you
found, sir?

401
00:29:23,502 --> 00:29:25,294
Yes, Slazenger 7.

402
00:29:26,505 --> 00:29:29,422
Let's have a little fun
with Mr. Goldfinger.

403
00:29:33,594 --> 00:29:35,553
Would you like me
to mark it or
knock it in?

404
00:29:35,638 --> 00:29:36,930
Play it.

405
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,391
This for a half.

406
00:29:39,475 --> 00:29:40,808
That's right.

407
00:29:56,073 --> 00:29:57,907
One to go.
That'll be
the clincher.

408
00:29:57,991 --> 00:29:59,075
Fine.

409
00:30:00,285 --> 00:30:01,785
Did you switch
them, sir?

410
00:30:01,869 --> 00:30:03,161
Uh-huh.

411
00:30:03,246 --> 00:30:05,080
Then we've got him.

412
00:30:05,164 --> 00:30:07,499
If he doesn't
notice the switch.

413
00:30:12,337 --> 00:30:13,629
It's your honor, sir!

414
00:30:13,713 --> 00:30:15,256
It's all right.

415
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:43,114
Down in five.

416
00:30:43,198 --> 00:30:46,117
I have to sink this
to halve the game,
right?

417
00:30:51,457 --> 00:30:52,831
You win, Goldfinger.

418
00:30:52,915 --> 00:30:55,125
It seems I'm
too good for you.

419
00:30:56,294 --> 00:30:57,377
Hmm.

420
00:30:57,962 --> 00:31:00,255
You play a Slazenger 1,
don't you?

421
00:31:00,339 --> 00:31:01,631
Yes, why?

422
00:31:01,716 --> 00:31:03,424
Well, this is
a Slazenger 7.

423
00:31:03,508 --> 00:31:05,509
Here's my Penfold Hearts.

424
00:31:05,719 --> 00:31:08,637
You must have played the
wrong ball somewhere
on the 18th fairway.

425
00:31:08,722 --> 00:31:10,473
We are playing
strict rules,

426
00:31:10,557 --> 00:31:13,391
so I'm afraid you lose
the hole and the match.

427
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,802
She's a beauty.

428
00:31:52,887 --> 00:31:54,720
Phantom III, '37,
isn't she?

429
00:31:54,804 --> 00:31:57,056
You are a clever,
resourceful man,
Mr. Bond.

430
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,140
Why, thank you.

431
00:31:58,225 --> 00:31:59,183
Perhaps too clever.

432
00:31:59,267 --> 00:32:00,851
Twice our paths
have crossed,

433
00:32:00,936 --> 00:32:02,603
let's leave it
at that.

434
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:05,355
I should think our
first meeting would
have convinced you.

435
00:32:05,439 --> 00:32:06,731
Oh, I see.

436
00:32:06,815 --> 00:32:10,276
You're worried
about me not giving
you a return game.

437
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:12,695
Both of us know
perfectly well

438
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,822
what we're talking
about, Mr. Bond.

439
00:32:14,907 --> 00:32:17,324
But I see that
it is necessary
to remind you.

440
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,659
Oddjob!

441
00:32:20,787 --> 00:32:22,871
Many people have tried
to involve themselves

442
00:32:22,956 --> 00:32:25,123
in my affairs,
unsuccessfully.

443
00:32:39,929 --> 00:32:43,306
Remarkable. But what
does the club secretary
have to say?

444
00:32:43,391 --> 00:32:45,392
Oh, nothing,
Mr. Bond.

445
00:32:45,476 --> 00:32:46,976
I own the club.

446
00:32:49,104 --> 00:32:52,106
I assume you want
the check made
out to cash?

447
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:54,733
That would be
perfectly satisfactory.

448
00:32:59,488 --> 00:33:01,114
Goodbye, Mr. Bond.

449
00:33:03,158 --> 00:33:05,326
Oh, I believe
this is yours.

450
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:43,152
May I have your
attention, please?

451
00:33:43,236 --> 00:33:46,989
British United Air Ferries
announcing final call

452
00:33:47,073 --> 00:33:51,909
for the departure of their
DS-400 flight to Geneva.

453
00:33:57,041 --> 00:34:00,334
British United Air Ferries
announce the departure

454
00:34:00,418 --> 00:34:04,129
of their DS-400 flight
to Geneva.

455
00:34:04,213 --> 00:34:05,213
Mr. Bond?

456
00:34:05,298 --> 00:34:06,423
That's all right,
I've got you booked out

457
00:34:06,507 --> 00:34:08,592
on the next flight to Geneva
leaving in half an hour.

458
00:34:08,718 --> 00:34:11,052
Oh, thank you
very much.
Right, sir.

459
00:35:29,999 --> 00:35:31,834
Discipline, 007.

460
00:35:33,794 --> 00:35:35,294
Discipline.

461
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:49,833
Are you all right?

462
00:37:49,917 --> 00:37:53,086
Here, let me help you.
You know, you're lucky
to be alive.

463
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,587
No thanks to you.

464
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:57,841
You should have
pulled over further.

465
00:37:58,466 --> 00:38:00,133
Look at them!

466
00:38:00,218 --> 00:38:02,719
A double blowout.
I've never seen
one of these before.

467
00:38:02,804 --> 00:38:04,680
How could new tires...

468
00:38:04,764 --> 00:38:07,057
Defect of some kind,
most likely.

469
00:38:07,141 --> 00:38:09,559
Anyway, I'm so glad
it's only the car
and not you.

470
00:38:09,643 --> 00:38:11,561
You don't look
like the sort of girl
who should be ditched.

471
00:38:11,645 --> 00:38:14,188
Never mind that.
Please take me to
the nearest garage.

472
00:38:14,273 --> 00:38:18,067
Certainly. By the way,
my name is Bond...

473
00:38:18,151 --> 00:38:20,569
Um, as quickly
as possible.

474
00:38:28,703 --> 00:38:29,785
I'll take that.

475
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:31,453
Yes, of course.

476
00:38:37,961 --> 00:38:39,794
What's your name,
by the way?

477
00:38:39,879 --> 00:38:41,087
Soames.

478
00:38:41,171 --> 00:38:42,714
Tilly Soames.

479
00:38:44,717 --> 00:38:46,634
Here for the
hunting season?

480
00:38:47,511 --> 00:38:49,804
I had a case just
like that one.

481
00:38:52,682 --> 00:38:54,600
It's for my ice skates.

482
00:38:55,476 --> 00:38:56,977
Lovely sport.

483
00:38:58,855 --> 00:39:00,563
Where do you skate?

484
00:39:00,647 --> 00:39:02,315
St. Moritz.

485
00:39:02,733 --> 00:39:06,027
I didn't know
there was ice there
this time of the year.

486
00:39:06,111 --> 00:39:07,153
There's a garage.

487
00:39:20,666 --> 00:39:22,166
I've had an accident.

488
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:36,971
How long will it take?
Thank you.

489
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,393
They say it will
take 24 hours to
get new tires.

490
00:39:43,478 --> 00:39:44,561
There's a hotel nearby.

491
00:39:44,646 --> 00:39:45,771
Oh, jump in.
I'll run you down.

492
00:39:45,855 --> 00:39:47,773
That won't be
necessary.

493
00:39:48,191 --> 00:39:50,525
Well, I hate to
leave you here alone.

494
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:52,443
I can take care
of myself.

495
00:39:52,527 --> 00:39:54,445
Yes, I'm sure
you can.

496
00:39:54,738 --> 00:39:56,864
Well, don't
forget to write.

497
00:41:54,263 --> 00:41:56,389
Smuggling is an art,
Mr. Ling.

498
00:41:56,474 --> 00:41:58,223
And art requires...

499
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:02,478
In this case,
the bodywork of
my Rolls Royce

500
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:04,188
is 18-carat gold.

501
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:07,982
We dismantle it here,

502
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:10,818
reduce the gold in
this special furnace
to ingots,

503
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:15,656
which in turn will be
released on the board and
weigh approximately two tons.

504
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:19,451
I make six trips a year
to the continent

505
00:42:19,535 --> 00:42:21,328
in the Rolls Royce,
Mr. Ling.

506
00:42:21,412 --> 00:42:24,331
It would be wiser
to suspend your
other activities.

507
00:42:24,415 --> 00:42:26,333
Now, Mr. Ling,
please assure
your principals

508
00:42:26,417 --> 00:42:29,293
Operation Grand Slam
will have my undivided
attention.

509
00:42:29,377 --> 00:42:32,171
Now, there are
certain matters
we must discuss.

510
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:33,351
Let me go! You're
breaking my back!

511
00:43:33,894 --> 00:43:35,436
What the hell
are you doing here?

512
00:43:35,521 --> 00:43:36,855
I want to kill him!

513
00:43:36,939 --> 00:43:38,565
Kill who?
Goldfinger.

514
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:39,649
Well, I want him alive.

515
00:43:39,733 --> 00:43:42,484
I want him dead.
He killed my sister.

516
00:43:42,569 --> 00:43:44,528
T.M. Tilly Masterson.

517
00:43:45,029 --> 00:43:46,280
I knew your
sister, Jill.

518
00:43:46,364 --> 00:43:47,406
I know what he did
to her in Miami.

519
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:49,408
No, you don't.
Let me go!

520
00:43:49,492 --> 00:43:51,325
If you wanted to kill him,
why did you shoot at me?

521
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:53,077
I didn't. I was
shooting at him.

522
00:43:53,162 --> 00:43:54,662
Well, you're a lousy shot.

523
00:43:55,789 --> 00:43:57,373
Somebody else
around here isn't.

524
00:43:57,457 --> 00:43:58,457
Come on.

525
00:44:07,425 --> 00:44:09,968
Quick. Get in the car.
I'll take care of him.

526
00:46:08,993 --> 00:46:11,119
Run for that bracken
when I tell you.

527
00:46:20,962 --> 00:46:22,045
Now!

528
00:50:25,766 --> 00:50:27,600
Good evening, 007.

529
00:50:29,228 --> 00:50:31,020
My name is
James Bond.

530
00:50:33,023 --> 00:50:36,608
And members of your
curious profession
are few in number.

531
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:40,153
You have been recognized,

532
00:50:40,613 --> 00:50:42,364
let's say, by one of
your opposite numbers,

533
00:50:42,448 --> 00:50:44,407
who is also
licensed to kill.

534
00:50:44,492 --> 00:50:46,700
Oh, that interesting car
of yours!

535
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:51,455
I, too, have a new toy,

536
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:53,624
but considerably
more practical.

537
00:50:53,708 --> 00:50:56,043
You are looking at
an industrial laser

538
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:59,546
which emits
an extraordinary light
not to be found in nature.

539
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:02,048
It can project
a spot on the moon,

540
00:51:03,175 --> 00:51:06,427
or at closer range
cut through solid metal.

541
00:51:06,512 --> 00:51:07,970
I will show you.

542
00:51:35,121 --> 00:51:37,122
This is gold,
Mr. Bond.

543
00:51:38,373 --> 00:51:41,417
All my life, I've been
in love with its color,

544
00:51:41,501 --> 00:51:44,169
its brilliance,
its divine heaviness.

545
00:51:45,422 --> 00:51:48,840
I welcome any enterprise
that will increase my stock.

546
00:51:50,092 --> 00:51:52,010
Which is considerable.

547
00:51:54,263 --> 00:51:55,805
I think you've made
your point, Goldfinger.

548
00:51:55,889 --> 00:51:58,266
Thank you for
the demonstration.

549
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:00,934
Choose your next
witticism carefully,
Mr. Bond.

550
00:52:01,019 --> 00:52:02,769
It may be your last.

551
00:52:05,773 --> 00:52:07,691
The purpose of
our two previous
encounters

552
00:52:07,775 --> 00:52:09,109
is now very
clear to me.

553
00:52:09,193 --> 00:52:10,943
I do not intend
to be distracted
by another.

554
00:52:11,028 --> 00:52:12,695
Good night, Mr. Bond.

555
00:52:15,198 --> 00:52:17,283
Do you expect me
to talk?

556
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:20,452
No, Mr. Bond.
I expect you to die.

557
00:52:20,536 --> 00:52:22,037
There is nothing
you can talk
to me about

558
00:52:22,121 --> 00:52:24,080
that I don't
already know.

559
00:52:37,218 --> 00:52:39,637
You're forgetting
one thing.

560
00:52:39,721 --> 00:52:42,305
If I fail to report,
008 replaces me.

561
00:52:43,098 --> 00:52:45,558
I trust he will
be more successful.

562
00:52:50,105 --> 00:52:51,813
But he knows
what I know.

563
00:52:51,898 --> 00:52:53,899
You know nothing,
Mr. Bond.

564
00:52:55,234 --> 00:52:58,528
Operation Grand Slam,
for instance.

565
00:53:22,467 --> 00:53:24,802
Two words
you may have overheard,

566
00:53:24,886 --> 00:53:27,846
which cannot possibly have
any significance to you

567
00:53:27,931 --> 00:53:30,265
or anyone in your
organization.

568
00:53:30,350 --> 00:53:32,767
Can you afford to
take that chance?

569
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:49,741
You are quite right,
Mr. Bond.

570
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:52,119
You are worth
more to me alive.

571
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,817
Who are you?

572
00:54:28,402 --> 00:54:30,319
My name
is Pussy Galore.

573
00:54:33,323 --> 00:54:35,073
I must be dreaming.

574
00:54:46,001 --> 00:54:47,668
I thought
I'd wake up dead.

575
00:54:47,753 --> 00:54:50,296
Tranquilizer gun.
Knock-out shot.

576
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:51,547
I see.

577
00:54:54,176 --> 00:54:57,051
Well, I'm delighted
to be here.

578
00:54:59,388 --> 00:55:02,515
And by the way,
where is here?

579
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:05,727
35,000 feet,
flying southwest
over Newfoundland.

580
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:09,438
Oh, that explains
the humming.

581
00:55:09,522 --> 00:55:11,607
The humming means you're
in Mr. Goldfinger's

582
00:55:11,691 --> 00:55:13,984
Lockheed Jetstar
heading for Baltimore,

583
00:55:14,068 --> 00:55:15,444
and you're his guest.

584
00:55:15,528 --> 00:55:16,861
I'm honored.

585
00:55:17,237 --> 00:55:20,364
I never realized he
enjoyed my company
that much.

586
00:55:20,783 --> 00:55:23,326
I don't suppose it'll be
all fun and games.

587
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:24,911
Mei-lei.

588
00:55:25,829 --> 00:55:28,371
Can I do something
for you, Mr. Bond?

589
00:55:28,831 --> 00:55:31,249
Just a drink.
A martini.

590
00:55:31,334 --> 00:55:33,126
Shaken, not stirred.

591
00:55:36,005 --> 00:55:37,046
Won't you join me?

592
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:38,255
Not on duty.

593
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:40,841
I'm Mr. Goldfinger's
personal pilot.

594
00:55:41,843 --> 00:55:43,302
You are?

595
00:55:43,386 --> 00:55:45,721
And just how personal
is that?

596
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:49,432
I'm a damned good pilot.

597
00:55:49,517 --> 00:55:50,517
Period.

598
00:55:50,601 --> 00:55:52,143
Well, that's
good news.

599
00:55:52,228 --> 00:55:54,395
By the way,
where is our host?

600
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,105
He flew on ahead.

601
00:55:59,234 --> 00:56:00,526
Thank you.

602
00:56:06,825 --> 00:56:09,408
Well, here's to
Operation Grand Slam.

603
00:56:14,331 --> 00:56:16,707
This should be
a memorable flight.

604
00:56:17,167 --> 00:56:19,000
You can turn off
the charm.

605
00:56:19,085 --> 00:56:20,460
I'm immune.

606
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:38,352
We'll be landing
in Baltimore,

607
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:40,103
our port of entry into
the United States,

608
00:56:40,187 --> 00:56:41,771
in 55 minutes.

609
00:56:43,107 --> 00:56:48,278
Mei-Lei, I would
like to arrive more
appropriately dressed.

610
00:56:48,612 --> 00:56:51,196
Did any of my luggage
survive with me?

611
00:56:51,781 --> 00:56:53,031
Ah.

612
00:56:53,116 --> 00:56:55,117
And my
attaché case?

613
00:56:55,869 --> 00:56:58,328
Black attaché case
damaged when examined.

614
00:56:58,413 --> 00:56:59,663
So sorry.

615
00:56:59,998 --> 00:57:02,039
Apology is
quite unnecessary.

616
00:57:09,131 --> 00:57:11,965
Sydney, tell Mei-Lei
to keep an eye on him.

617
00:58:49,805 --> 00:58:51,639
We'll be landing
in 20 minutes.

618
00:58:51,723 --> 00:58:54,557
Do you want
to play it easy
or the hard way?

619
00:58:54,976 --> 00:58:56,309
And this isn't
a tranquilizer.

620
00:58:56,394 --> 00:58:59,896
Now, Pussy, you know
a lot more about
planes than guns.

621
00:58:59,981 --> 00:59:02,148
That's a Smith and Wesson .45,

622
00:59:02,233 --> 00:59:03,858
and if you fired
at this close range,

623
00:59:03,943 --> 00:59:05,985
the bullet will
pass through me
and the fuselage

624
00:59:06,069 --> 00:59:08,195
like a blowtorch
through butter.

625
00:59:08,279 --> 00:59:09,405
The cabin will
depressurize,

626
00:59:09,489 --> 00:59:12,700
and we'll both be
sucked into outer
space together.

627
00:59:12,909 --> 00:59:15,159
But if that's how you want
to enter the United States,
you're welcome.

628
00:59:15,244 --> 00:59:17,537
As for me, I prefer
the easier way.

629
00:59:17,621 --> 00:59:18,746
That's very sensible.

630
00:59:18,831 --> 00:59:21,916
Oh, besides, there's always
so much going on around
Mr. Goldfinger.

631
00:59:22,001 --> 00:59:25,585
I wouldn't dream
of not accepting
his hospitality.

632
00:59:26,337 --> 00:59:28,547
He'll be glad
to see you, too.

633
00:59:29,382 --> 00:59:31,717
You like close shaves,
don't you?

634
00:59:36,763 --> 00:59:40,391
Washington, sir,
on the green scrambler.

635
00:59:41,184 --> 00:59:42,351
M here.
Letter, sir.

636
00:59:42,436 --> 00:59:43,394
Letter!

637
00:59:43,478 --> 00:59:46,771
It's about 007, sir.
We picked up his
homer signal.

638
00:59:46,856 --> 00:59:49,065
It's monitored into
Friendship Airport,
Baltimore,

639
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:50,150
where he's just landed.

640
00:59:50,234 --> 00:59:52,694
Baltimore?
Nice of him
to let us know.

641
00:59:52,778 --> 00:59:54,529
Last we heard,
he was in Switzerland.

642
00:59:54,613 --> 00:59:56,947
He came in on
a private jet,
ex-Geneva,

643
00:59:57,032 --> 00:59:59,366
registered to
our old friend,
Auric Goldfinger.

644
00:59:59,492 --> 01:00:01,785
Well, I'm glad he's
making progress.
Yes, sir.

645
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:03,162
Keep an eye on him for us.

646
01:00:03,246 --> 01:00:06,373
Their flight plan gives
Blue Grass Field, Kentucky,
as their final destination.

647
01:00:06,458 --> 01:00:09,167
Don't charge in on him
and spoil anything,
will you?

648
01:00:09,251 --> 01:00:11,294
He's evidently well
on top at the moment.

649
01:00:33,482 --> 01:00:35,983
- Mr. Bond, please.
- Of course.

650
01:00:37,527 --> 01:00:38,693
Any time.

651
01:00:40,488 --> 01:00:41,863
Thank you.

652
01:00:54,125 --> 01:00:56,502
Do mind your step,
Captain.

653
01:00:56,586 --> 01:00:58,712
Just keep
playing it easy.

654
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:04,467
Mei-Lei, will you see
everything's all right
with Mr. Goldfinger?

655
01:01:04,551 --> 01:01:07,845
Of course.
And I'll see the
supplies are here soon.

656
01:01:26,071 --> 01:01:27,404
Talented chaps.

657
01:01:27,489 --> 01:01:29,824
They should be.
I trained them.

658
01:01:30,533 --> 01:01:31,699
Come on.

659
01:01:32,034 --> 01:01:34,119
You're a woman of
many parts, Pussy.

660
01:01:34,203 --> 01:01:36,579
I believe that the bourbon
and branch water's
rather splendid

661
01:01:36,664 --> 01:01:38,289
here in Kentucky.

662
01:01:38,374 --> 01:01:41,542
Well, now that
we're both off
duty, perhaps...

663
01:01:48,216 --> 01:01:49,466
Manners, Oddjob.

664
01:01:49,551 --> 01:01:52,552
I thought you always
took your hat off
to a lady.

665
01:01:54,388 --> 01:01:56,430
You know, he kills
little girls like you.

666
01:01:56,515 --> 01:01:58,182
Little boys, too.

667
01:02:44,099 --> 01:02:46,559
Well?
Dress rehearsal went
like a dream, Skipper.

668
01:02:46,643 --> 01:02:48,895
Good. You'll get
your final briefing
tonight.

669
01:02:48,979 --> 01:02:50,897
That'll be all for now.

670
01:03:02,491 --> 01:03:04,033
Ya! Ha! Ha! Ha!

671
01:03:20,758 --> 01:03:24,010
Ah, welcome to
Auric Stud, Mr. Bond.

672
01:03:24,802 --> 01:03:26,762
Lovely animal,
isn't she?

673
01:03:27,347 --> 01:03:29,598
Certainly better bred
than the owner.

674
01:03:29,682 --> 01:03:32,309
Show Mr. Bond
to his quarters,
please.

675
01:04:33,865 --> 01:04:35,032
Felix?

676
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,287
Maybe we should
just drop in on him.

677
01:04:40,371 --> 01:04:41,538
He'll shout
if he needs us.

678
01:04:48,128 --> 01:04:49,795
They're all here,
Mr. Goldfinger.

679
01:04:49,879 --> 01:04:52,381
Huh? Oh, yes. yes.

680
01:04:52,465 --> 01:04:53,924
Thank you, Kisch.

681
01:05:03,309 --> 01:05:06,519
That guy Solo's
going to wear
a hole in his shoes.

682
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,234
Hey, I like this!

683
01:05:15,528 --> 01:05:16,737
Hey! Wait!

684
01:05:16,821 --> 01:05:17,988
Gentlemen!

685
01:05:18,072 --> 01:05:21,657
Goldfinger, why weren't we
told that New York and the
West Coast were in on this?

686
01:05:21,742 --> 01:05:23,159
Look who's talking.

687
01:05:23,243 --> 01:05:25,536
I do not do business
with Chicago.

688
01:05:25,620 --> 01:05:28,205
I thought we had
a private business
deal to settle.

689
01:05:28,290 --> 01:05:30,832
Now I find I'm attending
a hood's convention.

690
01:05:30,916 --> 01:05:34,336
Goldfinger,
I made a delivery.
Where is my money?

691
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:35,879
I made a delivery, too.

692
01:05:35,963 --> 01:05:38,506
You all made
the deliveries
we contracted for.

693
01:05:38,591 --> 01:05:41,091
And you owe me
1 million bucks.

694
01:05:41,885 --> 01:05:46,055
I owe each of you
a million in
gold bullion.

695
01:05:46,139 --> 01:05:48,474
So pay!

696
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:51,893
Gentlemen, you can have
the million today...

697
01:05:54,396 --> 01:05:56,481
Or 10 millions tomorrow.

698
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:58,775
Did you say
10 million?

699
01:05:58,984 --> 01:06:01,401
As soon as my bank opens
in the morning.

700
01:06:01,486 --> 01:06:03,570
Banks don't open
on Sunday.

701
01:06:04,238 --> 01:06:05,739
My bank will.

702
01:06:12,913 --> 01:06:15,456
What's with that
trick pool table?

703
01:06:25,466 --> 01:06:26,549
Cover him!

704
01:06:26,634 --> 01:06:28,968
Hey, cover
those doors!

705
01:06:29,053 --> 01:06:31,345
Turn those
lights back on!

706
01:06:31,679 --> 01:06:34,139
What are you
trying to pull,
Goldfinger?

707
01:06:34,224 --> 01:06:36,809
There's no cause
for alarm, gentlemen.

708
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:43,231
I don't like being
cooped up like this.

709
01:06:43,315 --> 01:06:45,733
What's that map
doing there?

710
01:06:55,410 --> 01:06:56,993
This is my bank,

711
01:06:57,787 --> 01:07:01,331
the gold depository
at Fort Knox, gentlemen.

712
01:07:01,416 --> 01:07:04,834
In its vaults
are $15 billion,

713
01:07:06,211 --> 01:07:10,506
the entire gold supply
of the United States.

714
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:12,632
Knock off Fort Knox?

715
01:07:15,177 --> 01:07:16,636
Got a key or
something?

716
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,012
Of a kind.

717
01:07:18,389 --> 01:07:22,016
There are 35,000 troops
stationed around there!

718
01:07:23,017 --> 01:07:24,268
41,000.

719
01:07:24,352 --> 01:07:27,521
And who's going to
say boo to them,
Goldfinger?

720
01:07:27,605 --> 01:07:29,314
Hey,
what's going on here?
Hey, what is this?

721
01:07:29,399 --> 01:07:30,691
The floor!

722
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:34,026
What is this,
a merry-go-round?

723
01:07:53,588 --> 01:07:56,213
Man has climbed
Mount Everest,

724
01:07:57,007 --> 01:07:59,967
gone to the bottom
of the ocean.

725
01:08:00,051 --> 01:08:02,595
He has fired rockets
to the moon,

726
01:08:02,679 --> 01:08:03,846
split the atom,

727
01:08:03,930 --> 01:08:07,891
achieved miracles
in every field of
human endeavor

728
01:08:08,267 --> 01:08:09,726
except crime!

729
01:10:15,007 --> 01:10:17,925
The underworld
will rock with applause
for centuries.

730
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:20,135
- Cut the commercial.
- Yeah, get to the point.

731
01:10:20,219 --> 01:10:21,428
You're wasting my
time, Goldfinger.

732
01:10:21,512 --> 01:10:23,096
The depository
is impregnable.

733
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:26,224
Look, the joint is bombproof,
electrified, lousy with...

734
01:10:26,309 --> 01:10:27,809
Bear with me, please!

735
01:10:27,893 --> 01:10:30,769
Fort Knox is a bank,
like any other.

736
01:10:30,854 --> 01:10:32,605
Larger,
better-protected perhaps,

737
01:10:32,689 --> 01:10:34,940
but, nonetheless,
a bank.

738
01:10:35,025 --> 01:10:38,444
It can be, I think
the expression is,
blown.

739
01:10:39,195 --> 01:10:42,488
My plan is foolproof,
gentlemen.

740
01:10:42,573 --> 01:10:45,283
I call it
Operation Grand Slam.

741
01:10:45,576 --> 01:10:48,536
I have devoted
15 years of my
life to it.

742
01:10:49,538 --> 01:10:52,664
Every detail has been
scrupulously prepared.

743
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:55,083
Every eventuality
has been considered.

744
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:57,836
We'll operate on
a split-second schedule.

745
01:10:58,212 --> 01:11:00,505
Your organization,
Mr. Midnight,
brought the consignment

746
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:03,549
of these canisters
across the Canadian
border.

747
01:11:03,634 --> 01:11:05,968
They contain Delta 9.

748
01:11:06,053 --> 01:11:07,178
- Delta 9?
- What's that?

749
01:11:07,262 --> 01:11:12,015
An invisible nerve gas
which disperses 15 minutes

750
01:11:12,099 --> 01:11:18,271
after inducing complete
unconsciousness
for 24 hours.

751
01:11:20,316 --> 01:11:22,650
Tomorrow at dawn,

752
01:11:22,734 --> 01:11:26,487
the flying circus
of my personal pilot,
Miss Pussy Galore,

753
01:11:26,571 --> 01:11:29,406
will spray it
into the atmosphere.

754
01:11:31,409 --> 01:11:35,953
Once the population,
including the military,
has been immobilized,

755
01:11:36,038 --> 01:11:37,455
my task force,

756
01:11:37,539 --> 01:11:39,165
which Mr. Strap
had his people

757
01:11:39,249 --> 01:11:41,751
smuggle across
the Rio Grande
from Mexico,

758
01:11:41,835 --> 01:11:45,837
will approach Fort Knox
in motorized equipment

759
01:11:45,922 --> 01:11:47,381
along Bullion Boulevard

760
01:11:47,465 --> 01:11:49,925
which runs past
the depository here,

761
01:11:50,218 --> 01:11:52,594
and intersects with
Gold Vault Road.

762
01:11:53,595 --> 01:11:56,681
This fence surrounding
the depository,

763
01:11:56,765 --> 01:12:00,059
as Mr. Strap reminded us,
is electrified.

764
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:02,478
It will be dynamited.

765
01:12:03,188 --> 01:12:06,356
My task force will then
move to the main entrance
and demolish it.

766
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:07,857
How, may I ask?

767
01:12:08,693 --> 01:12:10,902
You made that possible,
Mr. Solo,

768
01:12:10,986 --> 01:12:13,987
by arranging through your
considerable influence
in shipping circles

769
01:12:14,072 --> 01:12:15,864
to bring through customs
uninspected

770
01:12:15,949 --> 01:12:19,118
a consignment labeled
"machine parts."

771
01:12:19,327 --> 01:12:22,121
All that will then remain
is to descend to the vaults,

772
01:12:22,205 --> 01:12:23,914
where the bullion
is stored.

773
01:12:23,998 --> 01:12:25,456
I've heard enough.
Let him finish.

774
01:12:25,541 --> 01:12:29,669
If you have no objection,
I'll take my money now.

775
01:12:29,753 --> 01:12:30,920
What's the matter, Solo,

776
01:12:31,004 --> 01:12:33,005
too big for you
to handle?

777
01:12:40,388 --> 01:12:43,140
Gentlemen, we must respect
Mr. Solo's decision.

778
01:12:43,224 --> 01:12:46,058
Please excuse me
for a few minutes
while I take care of him.

779
01:12:46,143 --> 01:12:48,269
Make yourselves
comfortable.

780
01:13:04,285 --> 01:13:08,328
How do we get it out?
That's the
bit I want to hear.

781
01:13:21,967 --> 01:13:23,134
Pussy.

782
01:13:24,428 --> 01:13:26,137
Who taught you judo?

783
01:13:26,512 --> 01:13:28,180
The gun you took.

784
01:13:31,225 --> 01:13:32,768
Oh, the gun.

785
01:13:33,686 --> 01:13:35,395
The gun, of course.

786
01:13:45,405 --> 01:13:48,531
We must have
a few fast falls
together sometime.

787
01:14:05,423 --> 01:14:08,132
Hey, Strap, if he's got
the right answers,

788
01:14:08,217 --> 01:14:10,134
you and me don't even
have to be there.

789
01:14:10,219 --> 01:14:12,094
The boys can
handle everything.

790
01:14:18,935 --> 01:14:20,644
Hey, they closed up
the fireplace.

791
01:14:20,728 --> 01:14:21,937
What's going on?

792
01:14:22,021 --> 01:14:23,313
I don't like this.
Hey, what the...

793
01:14:23,397 --> 01:14:24,981
What's going on here?

794
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:31,237
The gas!

795
01:14:56,135 --> 01:14:59,346
Such a pity you did not
choose to remain with
the others, Mr. Solo.

796
01:14:59,430 --> 01:15:00,763
However...

797
01:15:05,435 --> 01:15:08,437
Ah, Mr. Bond, I thought
you were resting
in your quarters.

798
01:15:08,522 --> 01:15:12,190
Oh, they are delightful,
but it's much too nice
to stay indoors.

799
01:15:12,275 --> 01:15:15,944
I ran into Miss Galore,
and she suggested
that we join you.

800
01:15:16,904 --> 01:15:18,196
Mr. Solo, Mr. Bond,

801
01:15:18,281 --> 01:15:20,240
another of my
distinguished guests.
Hello.

802
01:15:20,324 --> 01:15:22,074
Leaving us so soon,
Mr. Solo?

803
01:15:22,158 --> 01:15:24,076
Unfortunately,
he has a pressing
engagement.

804
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:26,829
Yeah. I'd like
to get started,
Goldfinger.

805
01:15:26,913 --> 01:15:27,872
Boy!

806
01:15:27,956 --> 01:15:29,498
Ah, when you gotta go,
you gotta go.

807
01:15:29,583 --> 01:15:32,166
My plane will get you
to New York on time...

808
01:15:32,251 --> 01:15:34,043
With your
excess luggage.

809
01:15:35,379 --> 01:15:36,629
Allow me.

810
01:15:38,215 --> 01:15:40,008
My chauffeur's
an excellent driver.

811
01:15:40,092 --> 01:15:42,634
You'll be at the airport
in a few minutes.

812
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,969
Goodbye, Mr. Solo.

813
01:15:44,053 --> 01:15:45,429
Some other time, perhaps.

814
01:15:45,513 --> 01:15:47,306
Happy landings,
old boy.

815
01:15:53,604 --> 01:15:55,563
I found him
under the model.

816
01:15:57,649 --> 01:16:01,110
Operation Grand Slam.
I did enjoy your briefing.

817
01:16:05,323 --> 01:16:06,656
So did I.

818
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:26,466
He's on the move!

819
01:16:50,906 --> 01:16:52,949
Slow down.
Don't crowd him.

820
01:17:10,048 --> 01:17:12,716
Are you blind or something?
You missed the turn.

821
01:17:44,162 --> 01:17:46,413
They've turned
to the right just
ahead here somewhere.

822
01:18:02,345 --> 01:18:04,513
Where's this old pal
of yours headed?

823
01:18:04,597 --> 01:18:07,432
10 will get you 1,
it's a drink or a dame.

824
01:20:16,508 --> 01:20:17,716
Dead.

825
01:20:17,801 --> 01:20:19,051
Mechanical failure,
maybe.

826
01:20:19,136 --> 01:20:20,469
Unless he switched
it off.

827
01:20:20,554 --> 01:20:22,345
Why would he
do that?

828
01:20:24,890 --> 01:20:27,100
Drive to the farm.
It's all we can do.

829
01:20:27,184 --> 01:20:28,351
Right.

830
01:20:39,070 --> 01:20:40,404
Thank you.

831
01:20:43,448 --> 01:20:45,408
Your share of
Operation Grand Slam

832
01:20:45,492 --> 01:20:48,244
will make you a very
rich woman, my dear.

833
01:20:48,579 --> 01:20:51,372
Why else would I be
in it, Mr. Goldfinger?

834
01:20:52,332 --> 01:20:54,833
You'll retire to
England, I suppose?

835
01:20:54,917 --> 01:20:57,878
No, I've spotted
a little island
in the Bahamas.

836
01:20:58,129 --> 01:21:01,590
I'll hang up a sign,
"No trespassing,"

837
01:21:01,757 --> 01:21:03,632
and go back to nature.

838
01:21:06,094 --> 01:21:07,344
Yes, Kisch?

839
01:21:07,429 --> 01:21:10,181
Two men in a car
with binoculars.

840
01:21:10,265 --> 01:21:12,474
Touts looking
for racing tips.

841
01:21:17,646 --> 01:21:19,647
There's another
possibility, however.

842
01:21:19,732 --> 01:21:21,649
Kisch, ask Mr. Bond
to join us.

843
01:21:21,734 --> 01:21:24,193
We were quite right to
spare Mr. Bond's life
in Switzerland

844
01:21:24,277 --> 01:21:26,445
if those gentlemen
are his friends.

845
01:21:26,529 --> 01:21:29,364
Let's convince them
he needs no assistance.

846
01:21:30,992 --> 01:21:32,367
For their benefit,
Pussy,

847
01:21:32,452 --> 01:21:34,952
let's make him
as happy as possible.

848
01:21:35,871 --> 01:21:39,040
I suggest you change
into something
more suitable.

849
01:21:39,750 --> 01:21:41,083
Certainly.

850
01:21:41,668 --> 01:21:43,628
Business
before pleasure.

851
01:22:03,521 --> 01:22:05,022
He wants you.

852
01:22:14,073 --> 01:22:16,573
Ah, Mr. Bond.
Sit down, please.

853
01:22:16,658 --> 01:22:18,075
Mint julep?

854
01:22:18,368 --> 01:22:20,077
Traditional,
but satisfying.

855
01:22:20,161 --> 01:22:21,245
Yes, thanks.

856
01:22:21,329 --> 01:22:23,830
Sour mash, but not
too sweet, please.

857
01:22:26,125 --> 01:22:28,334
You disappoint me,
Goldfinger.

858
01:22:28,627 --> 01:22:30,836
You know
Operation Grand Slam
simply won't work.

859
01:22:30,921 --> 01:22:33,839
And incidentally,
Delta 9 nerve gas
is fatal.

860
01:22:35,467 --> 01:22:38,176
You are unusually
well-informed,
Mr. Bond.

861
01:22:38,261 --> 01:22:40,720
You'll kill 60,000
people uselessly.

862
01:22:41,138 --> 01:22:44,307
American motorists
kill that many
every two years.

863
01:22:44,517 --> 01:22:48,060
Yes, well, I've
worked out a few
statistics of my own.

864
01:22:48,144 --> 01:22:54,066
$15 billion
in gold bullion
weighs 10,500 tons.

865
01:22:54,150 --> 01:22:59,112
60 men would take
12 days to load it
onto 200 trucks.

866
01:22:59,863 --> 01:23:01,739
Now, at the most,
you're gonna have
two hours

867
01:23:01,824 --> 01:23:04,325
before the Army,
Navy, Air Force,
Marines move in

868
01:23:04,410 --> 01:23:06,452
and make you put it back.

869
01:23:07,037 --> 01:23:09,830
Who mentioned anything
about removing it?

870
01:23:14,085 --> 01:23:15,919
The julep tart
enough for you?

871
01:23:16,004 --> 01:23:18,963
You plan to break into
the world's largest bank,

872
01:23:19,673 --> 01:23:21,716
but not to steal anything?

873
01:23:22,426 --> 01:23:23,509
Why?

874
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:25,928
Go on, Mr. Bond.

875
01:23:26,013 --> 01:23:28,805
Mr. Ling,
the red Chinese agent
at the factory,

876
01:23:28,889 --> 01:23:31,433
he's a specialist
in nuclear fission.

877
01:23:33,978 --> 01:23:35,478
But of course!

878
01:23:36,605 --> 01:23:38,732
His government's
given you a bomb.

879
01:23:38,816 --> 01:23:40,733
I prefer to call it
an atomic device.

880
01:23:40,817 --> 01:23:43,193
It's small,
but particularly dirty.

881
01:23:43,653 --> 01:23:45,154
Cobalt and iodine?

882
01:23:45,238 --> 01:23:46,530
Precisely.

883
01:23:46,614 --> 01:23:49,324
If you explode it in
Fort Knox, the, uh,

884
01:23:50,617 --> 01:23:54,704
entire gold supply
of the United States
will be radioactive for...

885
01:23:55,873 --> 01:23:57,165
57 years.

886
01:23:57,499 --> 01:23:59,125
58, to be exact.

887
01:24:00,043 --> 01:24:03,837
I apologize, Goldfinger.
It's an inspired deal.

888
01:24:03,921 --> 01:24:07,257
They get what they want,
economic chaos in the West,

889
01:24:07,467 --> 01:24:10,551
and the value of your gold
increases many times.

890
01:24:10,635 --> 01:24:14,013
I conservatively
estimate 10 times.

891
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:16,015
Brilliant.

892
01:24:17,559 --> 01:24:20,560
But the atomic device,
as you call it,

893
01:24:21,604 --> 01:24:24,272
is already obviously
in this country.

894
01:24:24,648 --> 01:24:25,982
Obviously.

895
01:24:27,193 --> 01:24:30,612
But bringing it to
Fort Knox undetected

896
01:24:31,071 --> 01:24:32,821
could be risky,
very risky.

897
01:24:32,906 --> 01:24:35,824
On the contrary, Mr. Bond,
the risk is all on your side.

898
01:24:37,118 --> 01:24:39,495
If the authorities
should attempt
to locate it,

899
01:24:39,579 --> 01:24:41,704
who knows where it might
be exploded, eh?

900
01:24:41,789 --> 01:24:44,707
Perhaps the Polaris
submarine pens
at New London,

901
01:24:46,085 --> 01:24:48,002
Cape Kennedy,

902
01:24:48,629 --> 01:24:49,879
near the White House.

903
01:24:49,963 --> 01:24:54,132
But we are speculating idly.
Operation Grand Slam
will be successful.

904
01:24:54,217 --> 01:24:56,718
You will be there
to see for yourself.

905
01:24:56,803 --> 01:24:59,096
Too closely for comfort,
I'm afraid.

906
01:25:10,649 --> 01:25:13,608
Forgive me, Mr. Bond,
but I must arrange to
separate my gold

907
01:25:13,692 --> 01:25:15,568
from the late Mr. Solo.

908
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:19,322
As you said, he had
a pressing engagement.

909
01:25:20,491 --> 01:25:23,325
Ah, very chic,
Miss Galore.
Don't you agree?

910
01:25:23,410 --> 01:25:25,369
Please entertain
Mr. Bond for me,
Pussy.

911
01:25:25,453 --> 01:25:27,621
I'll join
you both later.

912
01:25:33,168 --> 01:25:35,503
Well, how about it,
handsome?

913
01:25:35,587 --> 01:25:38,756
Don't you think it's time
we got to know each other
socially?

914
01:25:38,841 --> 01:25:40,675
Well, the new
Miss Galore.

915
01:25:40,759 --> 01:25:43,510
Where do you hide
your gold knuckles
in this outfit?

916
01:25:43,594 --> 01:25:46,638
Oh, I never carry weapons
after business hours.

917
01:25:46,973 --> 01:25:47,973
Yeah?

918
01:25:48,057 --> 01:25:49,641
So you're off duty.

919
01:25:49,725 --> 01:25:51,726
I'm completely
defenseless.

920
01:25:53,688 --> 01:25:54,979
So am I.

921
01:26:01,361 --> 01:26:03,195
That's my James.

922
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:05,155
Beautiful place
Goldfinger has here.

923
01:26:05,239 --> 01:26:07,699
Yes. I'm glad
you're enjoying it.

924
01:26:08,367 --> 01:26:11,202
Too bad
it all has to end
tomorrow morning.

925
01:26:12,955 --> 01:26:14,913
He's quite mad,
you know.

926
01:26:16,791 --> 01:26:19,209
Well, now,
what do we have here?

927
01:26:21,296 --> 01:26:24,214
007 seems to have
the situation
well in hand.

928
01:26:25,215 --> 01:26:27,592
Come on, I'm bushed.
Let's get back
to the motel.

929
01:26:27,885 --> 01:26:29,302
You're quite a girl, Pussy.

930
01:26:29,386 --> 01:26:31,596
I'm strictly
the outdoor type.

931
01:26:31,805 --> 01:26:34,974
I'd like to think you're
not in all of this caper.

932
01:26:35,516 --> 01:26:38,101
Skip it. I'm not
interested.
Let's go.

933
01:26:38,853 --> 01:26:41,897
What would it take
for you to see
things my way?

934
01:26:42,190 --> 01:26:44,232
A lot more
than you've got.

935
01:26:44,817 --> 01:26:46,150
How do you know?

936
01:26:46,234 --> 01:26:47,985
I don't want to know.

937
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:51,322
Isn't it customary

938
01:26:51,406 --> 01:26:53,991
to grant
a condemned man
his last request?

939
01:26:54,075 --> 01:26:55,951
You've asked for this.

940
01:27:02,833 --> 01:27:04,083
Get up.

941
01:27:05,961 --> 01:27:07,169
Certainly.

942
01:27:15,637 --> 01:27:16,762
Ooh!

943
01:27:24,102 --> 01:27:25,811
There.

944
01:27:25,896 --> 01:27:27,687
Now, let's both play.

945
01:27:55,965 --> 01:27:58,049
Pussy Galore
to Champagne leader.

946
01:27:58,133 --> 01:27:59,800
Commence
Rock-a-bye Baby.

947
01:27:59,884 --> 01:28:01,176
Good luck.

948
01:28:23,197 --> 01:28:25,407
Speed, 220.

949
01:28:25,491 --> 01:28:27,450
Wind check, westerly.

950
01:28:40,129 --> 01:28:42,130
Champagne leader
to Champagne section.

951
01:28:42,214 --> 01:28:43,840
Commence dive now.

952
01:28:53,057 --> 01:28:55,100
Ready for
Rock-a-bye Baby.

953
01:28:55,268 --> 01:28:57,269
Commence spray
on countdown.

954
01:28:58,146 --> 01:28:59,104
Five,

955
01:28:59,188 --> 01:29:02,023
four, three, two,

956
01:29:02,649 --> 01:29:03,691
zero.

957
01:30:48,245 --> 01:30:51,205
Champagne leader
to Grand Slam
task force leader.

958
01:30:51,289 --> 01:30:52,540
The baby is asleep.

959
01:30:52,791 --> 01:30:55,375
I repeat,
the baby is asleep.

960
01:30:55,459 --> 01:30:57,794
We're going
home now. Out.

961
01:34:04,714 --> 01:34:05,922
Chafoo.

962
01:35:26,454 --> 01:35:27,704
Good morning, Mr. Bond.

963
01:35:27,789 --> 01:35:30,499
For once, you're exactly
where I want you.

964
01:36:38,728 --> 01:36:40,854
The bomb's here.
Let's get moving, brigadier.

965
01:36:40,938 --> 01:36:42,022
Right, Jack. Move in.

966
01:36:42,106 --> 01:36:44,149
Move in, commando tactics.

967
01:36:44,442 --> 01:36:47,569
Minimum offensive fire
until I signal bomb
has been neutralized.

968
01:36:47,903 --> 01:36:49,278
Minimum offensive fire...
Come on.

969
01:36:49,362 --> 01:36:51,697
...Until I signal
bomb has been
neutralized.

970
01:36:51,990 --> 01:36:54,199
Bomb disposal unit
to accompany dog.

971
01:37:28,982 --> 01:37:30,440
Goodbye, Mr. Bond.

972
01:38:05,181 --> 01:38:07,182
Mr. Ling, it is merely
a matter of timing...

973
01:38:34,374 --> 01:38:35,541
Goldfinger!

974
01:38:37,043 --> 01:38:38,794
Please, Mr. Gold...

975
01:38:40,588 --> 01:38:42,672
He's one of them!
So's the girl!
I'll get her!

976
01:38:42,756 --> 01:38:44,507
You get the door open!

977
01:38:58,146 --> 01:38:59,521
We're trapped.

978
01:38:59,605 --> 01:39:00,647
The bomb.

979
01:39:00,731 --> 01:39:02,274
I'll take the fuse out.

980
01:39:04,067 --> 01:39:05,609
Don't be a fool.

981
01:39:05,694 --> 01:39:07,778
You can be a hero.
I'm not!

982
01:39:11,408 --> 01:39:12,992
No! No!

983
01:44:33,198 --> 01:44:36,324
- Come on, you boys!
- Get going! Hurry up!

984
01:44:56,594 --> 01:44:58,052
What kept you?

985
01:44:58,762 --> 01:45:01,598
You okay, James?
Where's your
butler friend?

986
01:45:01,765 --> 01:45:04,267
Oh, he blew a fuse.

987
01:45:04,351 --> 01:45:07,644
Three more ticks and
Mr. Goldfinger would
have hit the jackpot.

988
01:45:07,729 --> 01:45:08,812
Did you get him?

989
01:45:08,897 --> 01:45:10,147
Not yet,
but he won't get far.

990
01:45:10,231 --> 01:45:11,231
And Pussy?

991
01:45:11,316 --> 01:45:13,317
She helped us
switch the gas
in the canisters.

992
01:45:13,401 --> 01:45:16,111
By the way,
what made her
call Washington?

993
01:45:18,739 --> 01:45:21,407
I must have appealed
to her maternal instincts.

994
01:45:29,290 --> 01:45:32,626
Come on, James.
Get aboard. You can't keep
the President waiting.

995
01:45:32,710 --> 01:45:35,378
Special plane, lunch
at the White House.
How come?

996
01:45:35,463 --> 01:45:37,963
The President wants
to thank you
personally.

997
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:39,590
Oh, it was nothing,
really.

998
01:45:39,674 --> 01:45:41,800
I know that,
but he doesn't.

999
01:45:42,761 --> 01:45:44,762
I suppose I'll be able
to get a drink here?

1000
01:45:44,846 --> 01:45:46,889
I told the stewardess
liquor for three.

1001
01:45:46,973 --> 01:45:48,014
Who are
the other two?

1002
01:45:48,098 --> 01:45:49,599
Oh, there are
no other two.

1003
01:45:49,683 --> 01:45:51,809
Goodbye, Felix.
So long, James.
Good luck.

1004
01:45:51,894 --> 01:45:53,686
Thank you, brigadier.
Good luck.

1005
01:46:25,883 --> 01:46:28,468
I'm glad to have you
aboard, Mr. Bond.

1006
01:46:28,803 --> 01:46:32,096
Well, congratulations
on your promotion,
Goldfinger.

1007
01:46:32,847 --> 01:46:35,015
Are you having lunch
at the White House,
too?

1008
01:46:35,100 --> 01:46:37,726
In two hours,
I shall be in Cuba.

1009
01:46:38,478 --> 01:46:42,230
And you have interfered
with my plans for the
last time, Mr. Bond.

1010
01:46:42,356 --> 01:46:44,649
It's very dangerous
to fire guns in planes.

1011
01:46:44,733 --> 01:46:47,151
I even had to warn
Pussy about it.

1012
01:46:47,695 --> 01:46:48,945
By the way, where is she?

1013
01:46:49,029 --> 01:46:50,862
I will deal with her later.

1014
01:46:50,947 --> 01:46:54,157
At the moment, she is
where she ought to be.
At the controls.

1015
01:47:40,743 --> 01:47:41,909
Pussy.

1016
01:47:43,494 --> 01:47:45,037
What happened?
Where's Goldfinger?

1017
01:47:45,121 --> 01:47:46,788
Playing his golden harp.

1018
01:47:49,751 --> 01:47:50,876
It's no good!

1019
01:48:26,075 --> 01:48:27,158
Oh, no, you don't.

1020
01:48:28,911 --> 01:48:31,954
This is no time
to be rescued.

1021
01:48:51,598 --> 01:48:54,433
Goldfinger

1022
01:48:56,936 --> 01:48:58,353
He's the man

1023
01:48:58,437 --> 01:49:01,731
The man with
the Midas touch

1024
01:49:04,026 --> 01:49:06,777
A spider's touch

1025
01:49:09,239 --> 01:49:12,533
Such a cold finger

1026
01:49:15,953 --> 01:49:17,328
Beckons you

1027
01:49:17,413 --> 01:49:20,623
To enter his web of sin

1028
01:49:22,793 --> 01:49:26,461
But don't go in

1029
01:49:28,005 --> 01:49:32,008
He loves only gold

1030
01:49:32,719 --> 01:49:34,719
Only gold

1031
01:49:41,393 --> 01:49:45,563
He loves gold
