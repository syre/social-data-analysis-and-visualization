1
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:19,872
It is believed that the indictment is only one of a series

2
00:02:19,956 --> 00:02:24,793
to be handed down as the result of a special grand jury investigation.

3
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,005
Graverobbing in Texas is this hour's top news story.

4
00:02:28,089 --> 00:02:32,301
An informant led officers of the Muerto County Sheriff's Department to a cemetery

5
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:36,555
just outside the small rural Texas community of Newt early this morning.

6
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,225
Officers there discovered what appeared to be a grisly work of art,

7
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:44,897
the remains of a badly decomposed body wired to a large monument.

8
00:02:44,981 --> 00:02:48,984
A second body was found in a ditch near the perimeter of the cemetery.

9
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:53,113
Subsequent investigation has revealed at least a dozen empty crypts,

10
00:02:53,198 --> 00:02:56,408
and it's feared more will turn up as the probe continues.

11
00:02:56,493 --> 00:03:01,205
Deputies report that in some instances, only parts of a corpse had been removed,

12
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:04,041
the head or in some cases the extremities removed,

13
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,585
the remainder of the corpse left intact.

14
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:10,464
Evidence indicates the robberies have occurred over a period of time.

15
00:03:10,548 --> 00:03:14,718
Sheriff Jesus Maldonado refused to give details of the ghoulish case

16
00:03:14,803 --> 00:03:17,179
and said only that he did have strong evidence

17
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:20,307
linking the crime to elements outside the state.

18
00:03:20,391 --> 00:03:23,685
Area residents have reportedly converged on the cemetery,

19
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,688
fearing the remains of relatives have been removed.

20
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:30,859
No suspects are in custody, as the investigation at the scene continues.

21
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:34,780
Oil storage units continue to burn out of control

22
00:03:34,864 --> 00:03:38,867
at the huge Texaco refinery near the Texas-Louisiana border.

23
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,620
Three storage units exploded into flames during the night,

24
00:03:41,704 --> 00:03:45,165
killing at least three workers and injuring a dozen more.

25
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,378
Fire-fighting units in three Texas cities continue to battle the holocaust,

26
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:52,047
in an effort to confine 40-foot flames.

27
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:56,927
Smoke from the fire is visible to Houston residents some 60 miles to the south.

28
00:03:57,011 --> 00:03:59,680
Health officials in San Francisco reluctantly admit

29
00:03:59,764 --> 00:04:02,349
they may have a cholera epidemic on their hands.

30
00:04:02,433 --> 00:04:06,937
Some 40 cases of the highly infectious disease have been confirmed.

31
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:13,986
...is responsible for spread of the disease.

32
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,822
Houston police are puzzled over an outbreak of violence

33
00:04:16,906 --> 00:04:19,366
apparently touched off by a suicide.

34
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:23,996
A young man, reportedly angered by a local television blackout of a sports event,

35
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,832
jumped from the tenth-story window of his apartment.

36
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:31,003
A second man allegedly threatened to leap to his death from the same window,

37
00:04:31,087 --> 00:04:33,172
but was restrained by police.

38
00:04:33,256 --> 00:04:36,508
Witnesses to the incident reportedly heard the man jump...

39
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,521
She offered no explanation for the attack.

40
00:04:49,606 --> 00:04:54,651
The lieutenant was treated for minor wounds at the hospital and released.

41
00:04:54,736 --> 00:04:59,489
A 16-story building under construction in downtown Atlanta collapsed today,

42
00:04:59,574 --> 00:05:01,950
killing at least 29 persons.

43
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:06,038
The engineering firm responsible for the structural design of the building

44
00:05:06,122 --> 00:05:08,916
could offer no explanation for the collapse.

45
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,212
The construction firm says there's no logical reason for the collapse

46
00:05:13,296 --> 00:05:15,881
and suspects sabotage.

47
00:05:15,965 --> 00:05:18,926
Police in Gary, Indiana, have been unable to identify

48
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,136
the bodies of a young man and woman...

49
00:05:26,517 --> 00:05:29,144
...stab wounds and their features carved away.

50
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:31,355
The man's genitals had been removed,

51
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,900
and police first identified the victims as two women.

52
00:05:52,794 --> 00:05:54,169
OK?

53
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,155
Franklin!

54
00:06:26,035 --> 00:06:28,578
Ah!

55
00:06:32,834 --> 00:06:36,211
- Are you OK? - I was... Shit.

56
00:06:39,048 --> 00:06:40,132
OK.

57
00:06:40,216 --> 00:06:43,969
This heat is just driving me crazy. I don't know if I can take much more.

58
00:06:44,053 --> 00:06:47,764
Listen, the condition of retrogradation is contrary or inharmonious to

59
00:06:47,849 --> 00:06:51,226
the regular direction of actual movement in the zodiac

60
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:54,062
and is, in that respect, evil.

61
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,940
Hence, when malefic planets are in retrograde -

62
00:06:57,025 --> 00:07:01,236
and Saturn's malefic, OK? - their maleficence is increased.

63
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:03,989
Have you been doing those word power columns?

64
00:07:04,073 --> 00:07:06,450
It just means that Saturn's a bad influence.

65
00:07:06,534 --> 00:07:10,912
It's just particularly a bad influence now because it's in retrograde.

66
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:14,082
- You believe that stuff she's hawking me? - I don't know.

67
00:07:33,061 --> 00:07:36,396
My granddaddy's buried here. Did anything happen to him?

68
00:07:36,481 --> 00:07:39,149
- What's your granddaddy's name? - That big feller

69
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:42,819
at the stand with that flashlight in his hand, that's the sheriff.

70
00:07:42,904 --> 00:07:46,031
You tell him your granddaddy's buried in there.

71
00:07:46,115 --> 00:07:47,741
- He'll let you in. - Thank you.

72
00:07:47,825 --> 00:07:51,995
I'm gonna run off with your girl a minute. Honey, I'll get you the sheriff.

73
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,165
Let us through. This girl's granddaddy's buried here.

74
00:07:55,249 --> 00:07:58,001
Been in there the whole time, unbeknownst to Clyde.

75
00:07:58,086 --> 00:08:01,004
Clyde didn't know, either. They didn't know why...

76
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:04,925
Things happen hereabout they don't tell about.

77
00:08:07,345 --> 00:08:09,930
I see things.

78
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:18,146
You see, they say it's just an old man talking.

79
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:21,483
You laugh at an old man.

80
00:08:22,443 --> 00:08:26,488
There's them that laughs and knows better.

81
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:37,958
They're sure. The man said they could tell if the grave had been dug up.

82
00:08:38,042 --> 00:08:42,629
Franklin, don't worry. I saw it myself. It didn't look dug up to me.

83
00:08:46,676 --> 00:08:49,970
- Oh, what's that? - What smells?

84
00:08:52,181 --> 00:08:54,182
What is that stench?

85
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,643
Roll up the window.

86
00:08:58,479 --> 00:09:02,441
Hey, that's the old slaughterhouse.

87
00:09:02,525 --> 00:09:06,319
That's where Grandpa used to sell his cattle.

88
00:09:06,404 --> 00:09:10,240
We got an uncle that works at one of those places outside of Ft. Worth.

89
00:09:10,324 --> 00:09:15,787
That's where they kill them. They bash them in the head with a sledgehammer.

90
00:09:15,872 --> 00:09:19,875
- That's awful. - It usually wouldn't kill 'em on the first lick.

91
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:40,353
They'd start squealing and freaking out, and they'd have to bash 'em three times.

92
00:09:40,438 --> 00:09:44,065
They'd skin them sometimes before they were even dead.

93
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:48,111
That's horrible. People shouldn't kill animals for food.

94
00:09:48,196 --> 00:09:50,155
They don't do it like that anymore.

95
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:54,493
Now they got this big gun that shoots a bolt into their skull, then retracts it.

96
00:09:54,577 --> 00:09:57,078
It's just boom! It goes boom! And boom!

97
00:09:57,163 --> 00:10:00,123
Franklin, I like meat. Please change the subject.

98
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:03,835
- Boom! - That's terrible. It's still going on.

99
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:08,256
Oh, man, it's hot in here.

100
00:10:14,764 --> 00:10:17,015
- Hitchhiker. - Should we pick him up?

101
00:10:17,099 --> 00:10:20,435
- Yeah. He'll asphyxiate out there. - What does he look like?

102
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,188
Son of a bitch is gonna smell like a slaughterhouse.

103
00:10:23,272 --> 00:10:26,149
Oh, give the guy a break. He can sit by Franklin.

104
00:10:26,234 --> 00:10:28,193
- What do you want to do? - He's weird-looking.

105
00:10:28,277 --> 00:10:29,903
- Pick him up, man. - No!

106
00:10:48,798 --> 00:10:51,675
Well, I think we just picked up Dracula.

107
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:54,553
- Where you headed, man? - South.

108
00:10:54,637 --> 00:10:56,680
You work at that place?

109
00:10:56,764 --> 00:10:58,557
Oh, no.

110
00:10:58,641 --> 00:11:02,811
- How did you get stuck way out here? - I was at the slaughterhouse.

111
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:06,731
- My uncle works for the slaughterhouse. - My brother worked there.

112
00:11:06,816 --> 00:11:09,025
My-my grandfather too.

113
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:12,904
My family's always been in meat.

114
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,574
A whole family of Draculas.

115
00:11:16,325 --> 00:11:19,119
Hey, man, did you go in that slaughter room?

116
00:11:19,203 --> 00:11:21,871
Where they shoot the cattle with that big air gun?

117
00:11:21,956 --> 00:11:26,459
- Oh, that-that-that gun's no good. - I was in there once with my uncle.

118
00:11:26,544 --> 00:11:29,254
The old way with a sledge.

119
00:11:30,631 --> 00:11:33,008
See, that was better. They died better that way.

120
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:35,135
How come? I thought the gun was better.

121
00:11:35,219 --> 00:11:37,429
Oh, no, no.

122
00:11:37,513 --> 00:11:41,016
With the new way, the people are put out of jobs.

123
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,101
You do that?

124
00:11:43,185 --> 00:11:44,519
Look.

125
00:11:50,026 --> 00:11:52,444
- I was the killer. - Damn.

126
00:11:52,528 --> 00:11:55,780
- Let me see them. - They don't send the heads away.

127
00:11:55,865 --> 00:11:57,949
- You took these, huh? - Yeah.

128
00:11:58,034 --> 00:11:59,701
Franklin.

129
00:12:01,245 --> 00:12:04,748
See, they make head cheese.

130
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:06,708
They...

131
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:10,128
they take the head,

132
00:12:10,212 --> 00:12:12,964
and they boil it, except for the tongue,

133
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:16,718
and they scrape all the flesh away from the bone.

134
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:19,721
They use everything. They don't throw nothing way.

135
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:21,806
They use the jowls

136
00:12:21,891 --> 00:12:25,769
and the muscles and the eyes and ligaments and everything.

137
00:12:25,853 --> 00:12:27,646
- Oh. - Look at this.

138
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:32,817
The nose and the gums and all the flesh, and they boil it down into a big jelly of fat.

139
00:12:32,902 --> 00:12:35,528
Wow. I didn't know that's what was in that stuff.

140
00:12:35,613 --> 00:12:37,947
It's really good. You like it?

141
00:12:38,574 --> 00:12:41,326
Oh, yeah, sure, I like it. It's good.

142
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,871
It sounds horrible. Could we talk about something else?

143
00:12:44,955 --> 00:12:47,499
You'd like it if you didn't know what was in it.

144
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:50,335
I wouldn't, and I wish you'd stop talking about it.

145
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:51,670
Oh.

146
00:12:51,754 --> 00:12:54,089
Come on, you're making everybody sick.

147
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:56,174
Oh, all right.

148
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:13,900
What are you doing?

149
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,363
Hey, man, put that knife up.

150
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:26,121
Oh!

151
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,248
Oh, come on.

152
00:13:28,332 --> 00:13:31,251
Oh! What are you doing to yourself?

153
00:13:32,253 --> 00:13:35,338
Oh, my God! Why are you doing that?

154
00:13:44,849 --> 00:13:46,474
Put that away.

155
00:14:08,164 --> 00:14:10,165
I have this knife.

156
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:13,001
Put that away, too.

157
00:14:14,336 --> 00:14:17,756
- It's a good knife. - I'm sure it is, man.

158
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,841
Fold it up.

159
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,635
Hey, you took my picture.

160
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:06,554
Hey, you-you could take me to my house.

161
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,140
I live right off this road.

162
00:15:09,225 --> 00:15:13,311
Well, I don't know, man. We're in pretty much of a hurry.

163
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,481
- How close is it? - It's real close.

164
00:15:16,565 --> 00:15:21,236
Well, couldn't you just walk? I mean, if it's so close.

165
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,322
Yeah, you could have dinner with us.

166
00:15:24,406 --> 00:15:28,326
You like head cheese? My brother makes it real good. You'll like it.

167
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:32,288
I think you better push on now. Don't you, Jerry?

168
00:15:32,915 --> 00:15:34,582
Yeah, I'm sorry.

169
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:59,065
It didn't turn out so good.

170
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:03,528
- It's a nice picture. You can pay me now. - Huh?

171
00:16:03,612 --> 00:16:06,531
Two dollars. It's a good picture.

172
00:16:06,615 --> 00:16:10,159
No, man. Franklin, give him back the damn picture.

173
00:16:10,244 --> 00:16:12,704
- He tried to sell him that picture. - You're kidding?

174
00:16:12,788 --> 00:16:14,831
No, I'm serious.

175
00:16:51,952 --> 00:16:54,329
What are you doing?

176
00:16:58,834 --> 00:17:01,294
Hey, Jerry, pull us over!

177
00:17:01,378 --> 00:17:05,048
Hey, man, what's up? What are you doing?

178
00:17:12,222 --> 00:17:14,223
Get out.

179
00:17:40,501 --> 00:17:42,460
Oh, my God.

180
00:17:42,544 --> 00:17:45,505
Oh, I'm about half ready to call a cop.

181
00:17:45,589 --> 00:17:49,425
That's the last goddamn hitchhiker I ever pick up.

182
00:17:55,557 --> 00:17:59,560
Hey, listen to Franklin's horoscope.

183
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:00,895
Oh, Sally.

184
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,399
"Travel in the country, long-range plans

185
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,776
"and upsetting persons around you

186
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:11,239
"could make this a disturbing and unpredictable day.

187
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:15,535
The events in the world are not doing much either to cheer one up."

188
00:18:15,619 --> 00:18:19,247
- That's just perfect. - Franklin, I think that will be all right.

189
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:22,750
And now read Sally's. She's a Capricorn.

190
00:18:30,592 --> 00:18:32,301
Oh, no.

191
00:18:32,386 --> 00:18:34,762
Capricorn's ruled by Saturn.

192
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:40,309
"There are moments when we cannot believe that what is happening is true.

193
00:18:40,394 --> 00:18:43,521
Pinch yourself and you may find out that it is."

194
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,091
Everybody out.

195
00:19:15,304 --> 00:19:17,597
Hurry up, so we can get home.

196
00:19:25,647 --> 00:19:27,899
Here comes somebody.

197
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:35,490
How are you?

198
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:39,994
Would you fill her up, please?

199
00:19:40,496 --> 00:19:42,914
I got no gas.

200
00:19:42,998 --> 00:19:46,167
- You're out of gas? - My tank's empty.

201
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:49,420
The transport won't be here until late this afternoon,

202
00:19:49,505 --> 00:19:53,341
maybe not even until tomorrow morning.

203
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:57,095
Hey, do you know where the old Franklin place is?

204
00:20:01,225 --> 00:20:03,559
- The old Franklin place? - Yeah.

205
00:20:03,644 --> 00:20:06,312
It's an old two-story rock house on a hill.

206
00:20:06,396 --> 00:20:10,858
I think you have to turn on that road back there, but I'm not real sure.

207
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:15,196
Yeah, maybe I seen something like that up that way.

208
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:21,285
Well, now look, you boys don't want to go messing around no old house.

209
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:24,330
Those things is dangerous. You're liable to get hurt.

210
00:20:24,414 --> 00:20:25,998
We'll be careful.

211
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:29,752
You don't want to go fooling around with other folks' property.

212
00:20:29,837 --> 00:20:32,880
Some folks don't like it, and they don't mind showing you.

213
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:36,467
- Oh, my father owns it. - That's your daddy's place, huh?

214
00:20:36,552 --> 00:20:37,510
Yeah.

215
00:20:37,594 --> 00:20:40,805
Look, I got some good barbeque here.

216
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:43,599
Why don't you fellas stick around here a while?

217
00:20:43,684 --> 00:20:47,019
That transport will be by in a little while.

218
00:20:48,564 --> 00:20:51,816
Well, you want to get some barbeque?

219
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:56,988
Them girls, now, they don't want to go messing around an old house.

220
00:20:57,072 --> 00:20:59,615
It's best you stick around here.

221
00:21:10,794 --> 00:21:13,796
We should've asked if there's another gas station around.

222
00:21:13,881 --> 00:21:16,841
Don't you think he would've told us if there was?

223
00:21:16,925 --> 00:21:20,136
Man, it wouldn't hurt to ask, you know?

224
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,263
OK, I'll go ask.

225
00:21:25,976 --> 00:21:29,145
I knew the hell we should've stopped back there for gas.

226
00:21:29,229 --> 00:21:31,731
- Press it. - I'm pulling it down.

227
00:21:31,815 --> 00:21:34,817
- There. - You think this place has room service?

228
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:40,531
Franklin, you maniac, you're tearing up the van.

229
00:21:40,616 --> 00:21:44,535
Um, yeah, I just started doing that.

230
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:51,792
Hey, I bet that's some of that guy's blood.

231
00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:54,879
Look at that. Look at that.

232
00:21:54,963 --> 00:21:58,299
- You think that's blood? - Yeah, I guess so.

233
00:22:00,302 --> 00:22:05,848
Oh, that's blood, all right. And that guy cut the hell out of himself.

234
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:09,060
You think you could do that to yourself?

235
00:22:09,144 --> 00:22:12,897
- I'm not crazy. - Yeah, yeah.

236
00:22:12,981 --> 00:22:18,986
It takes something, though, I mean just to do that to yourself like he did. God!

237
00:22:21,114 --> 00:22:24,242
Hey, you think I said something made him mad?

238
00:22:26,328 --> 00:22:30,456
- Well, what? - Franklin, you're crazier than he was.

239
00:22:32,626 --> 00:22:34,710
Hey, I got us some barbeque.

240
00:22:34,795 --> 00:22:38,673
- Newt's the closest place to get gas. - Aw.

241
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:47,807
Aren't we going out to Grandpa's place? There's a creek. You could go swimming.

242
00:22:47,891 --> 00:22:49,183
Let's go.

243
00:22:49,268 --> 00:22:51,435
Come on, Sally. We're going to Grandpa's place.

244
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,812
Let's go!

245
00:22:52,896 --> 00:22:57,024
Hey, that guy smeared blood all over the van.

246
00:22:57,901 --> 00:23:01,696
- Like he was trying to write something. - What'd he do?

247
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,448
Did he write something on the van?

248
00:23:25,304 --> 00:23:27,346
Let me see your knife.

249
00:23:31,351 --> 00:23:32,351
Thank you.

250
00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:42,320
Franklin, if we run out of gas before we get back to that station,

251
00:23:42,404 --> 00:23:45,323
you're towing us back in your chair.

252
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:58,252
Hey, you think that guy's just trying to scare us

253
00:23:58,337 --> 00:24:01,714
by, you know, blowing up my picture like that?

254
00:24:47,636 --> 00:24:51,263
Oh, I wish they hadn't let the place fall apart.

255
00:24:52,265 --> 00:24:55,351
It looks like the birth place of Bela Lugosi.

256
00:24:55,435 --> 00:24:57,478
- I'm scared. - I'll help you with that.

257
00:24:57,562 --> 00:25:00,689
- See that window over there? - That's strange.

258
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,239
Hey, watch my arms. Watch out.

259
00:25:08,323 --> 00:25:12,076
- Be straight. Come on. Hey. - I'll get you from here.

260
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:16,288
I want to see that smear that guy made.

261
00:25:21,294 --> 00:25:25,840
- Oh, man. - Weird. I wonder if that means something.

262
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:27,925
It's the mark of Zorro. He's going to get you.

263
00:25:28,009 --> 00:25:29,927
- Come on. - Why don't you wash it off?

264
00:25:30,011 --> 00:25:32,430
I want to show you the inside.

265
00:25:33,223 --> 00:25:35,224
- Jerry! - OK.

266
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,562
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.

267
00:25:39,646 --> 00:25:43,315
- Come on, Kirk. - Here, man, you wash it off.

268
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,110
You don't think that guy would try and follow us?

269
00:25:46,194 --> 00:25:48,446
What for?

270
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:01,792
Where's my knife? Kirk?

271
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,173
It looks like it must've been a nursery.

272
00:26:07,257 --> 00:26:10,968
This is my room. I got to stay here one time when I was eight years old.

273
00:26:11,052 --> 00:26:13,929
- Right after my grandmother died. - What happened?

274
00:26:14,014 --> 00:26:17,266
- What happened to my grandmother? - Yeah. She died.

275
00:26:51,593 --> 00:26:54,595
- What do you think of the wallpaper? - It's seen better days.

276
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:57,473
These animals used to talk me to sleep when I was little.

277
00:26:57,557 --> 00:27:00,893
Look at the zebras. I had these fascination for the zebras.

278
00:27:02,646 --> 00:27:04,438
Sally!

279
00:27:31,132 --> 00:27:32,967
Sally!

280
00:28:26,146 --> 00:28:29,148
Hee-hee-hee-hee, hee-hee-hee-hee.

281
00:28:30,567 --> 00:28:32,568
Hee-hee-hee-hee.

282
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:39,408
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee.

283
00:28:40,869 --> 00:28:44,413
Come on, Franklin. It's gonna be a fun trip.

284
00:28:53,006 --> 00:28:57,718
If I have any more fun today, I don't think I'm going to be able to take it.

285
00:29:01,765 --> 00:29:03,432
Aah! Ah!

286
00:29:16,571 --> 00:29:19,740
- Hey, Franklin. - Hey, Franklin. What's wrong?

287
00:29:20,742 --> 00:29:23,035
You said there was a swimming hole around here?

288
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:24,620
Yeah.

289
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:29,083
Well, Pam and I would like to go swimming, man.

290
00:29:30,585 --> 00:29:35,714
Uh, there used to be a trail down between those two old sheds.

291
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:37,800
Come on, we'll find it.

292
00:29:39,928 --> 00:29:45,182
- Are Jerry and Sally going? - No. We'll see you in an hour or so.

293
00:29:46,476 --> 00:29:50,604
Yeah. We'll see you in about an hour or so.

294
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:15,129
Sally?

295
00:30:19,634 --> 00:30:21,343
Sally!

296
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:34,189
Zero in the world.

297
00:30:35,191 --> 00:30:38,152
Just shoot him and put us out of our misery.

298
00:30:39,988 --> 00:30:42,239
- Snakes and spiders! - Stop it!

299
00:30:42,323 --> 00:30:45,617
And scorpions! Man-eating lizards.

300
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:53,375
- Kirk, help. Kirk! - Ow. Ow.

301
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,960
Oh.

302
00:30:55,962 --> 00:30:57,671
Crap.

303
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,469
This must be it.

304
00:31:03,553 --> 00:31:06,096
Oh, are you OK?

305
00:31:06,181 --> 00:31:09,433
How the hell did Franklin ever get down here, anyway?

306
00:31:09,517 --> 00:31:13,270
Somebody must've carried him when he was little.

307
00:31:13,354 --> 00:31:15,689
Franklin never was little.

308
00:31:24,908 --> 00:31:26,992
Gasoline.

309
00:31:27,535 --> 00:31:32,414
I can leave him my guitar, give him a couple bucks. We're coming back anyway.

310
00:31:32,499 --> 00:31:36,043
I can pick up my guitar, give him a couple more dollars and bring him some gas.

311
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:39,213
They don't want your guitar. They won't want to sell us gas.

312
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:41,673
Let's just go back now.

313
00:32:23,466 --> 00:32:25,759
Hey, come here.

314
00:32:25,844 --> 00:32:27,886
Come here and look at this.

315
00:32:52,829 --> 00:32:55,455
- A generator. - What?

316
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,500
A generator! For electricity.

317
00:33:01,296 --> 00:33:04,423
Hey, hello in there! Is anybody here?

318
00:33:48,968 --> 00:33:51,011
Hello, is anybody home?

319
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,785
I got something for you.

320
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:19,915
Ah!

321
00:34:19,999 --> 00:34:20,999
Ooh!

322
00:34:21,876 --> 00:34:23,877
Let's go!

323
00:34:27,674 --> 00:34:40,769
Hello?

324
00:34:41,896 --> 00:34:44,356
- Hey, Pam, come look at this. - What? No!

325
00:34:48,611 --> 00:34:50,237
Hello?

326
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:55,659
Is anybody home?

327
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:58,161
Hello?

328
00:35:09,549 --> 00:35:11,550
Hey, Pam.

329
00:35:18,433 --> 00:35:20,058
Hello?

330
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:44,916
Kirk?

331
00:35:58,681 --> 00:36:00,182
Kirk!

332
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:20,827
Kirk?

333
00:36:44,727 --> 00:36:46,311
Kirk.

334
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,191
Kirk?

335
00:36:59,826 --> 00:37:01,493
Kirk?

336
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,896
Oh! Oh, God!

337
00:39:02,156 --> 00:39:04,449
Kirk! Kirk!

338
00:40:27,325 --> 00:40:29,617
He's gonna get you, Franklin.

339
00:40:29,702 --> 00:40:34,497
- You don't think it means anything? - We'll protect you.

340
00:40:34,582 --> 00:40:38,460
- I'll bet it's about me. - He's gonna kill you, Franklin.

341
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:44,257
- It probably doesn't mean anything, huh? - You worry too much.

342
00:40:45,217 --> 00:40:49,012
He couldn't find us anyway. I mean, he doesn't even know our names.

343
00:40:49,096 --> 00:40:51,639
I gave him your name. I told him where you live.

344
00:40:51,724 --> 00:40:54,351
I even gave him your zip code. He's gonna kill you.

345
00:40:54,435 --> 00:40:56,019
Jerry.

346
00:40:57,146 --> 00:41:00,357
- What are you doing? - I can't find my knife.

347
00:41:00,441 --> 00:41:03,735
That knife won't do you any good. He likes that knife.

348
00:41:03,819 --> 00:41:05,904
When did you have it last?

349
00:41:07,448 --> 00:41:10,867
Well, I didn't have it last. You had it last.

350
00:41:10,951 --> 00:41:13,536
I gave it to you. Remember? What did you do with it?

351
00:41:13,621 --> 00:41:16,039
I don't know. Didn't I give it back to you?

352
00:41:16,123 --> 00:41:19,209
No. I didn't have it when I got out of the van.

353
00:41:19,293 --> 00:41:24,047
- You just never gave it back to me. - All right, I'll look for it.

354
00:41:24,131 --> 00:41:28,593
I think I'll walk down to the creek before it gets too dark. How do I get there?

355
00:41:28,677 --> 00:41:33,098
Well, there's a trail down there between them two old sheds.

356
00:41:33,182 --> 00:41:36,434
- Can I go, too? - I think you'd better stay here.

357
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:39,562
All right.

358
00:41:47,196 --> 00:41:49,197
I can't find it.

359
00:41:56,455 --> 00:41:58,915
Are you mad at me?

360
00:41:58,999 --> 00:42:01,501
No, I'm not mad at you.

361
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:06,840
You really are mad, huh?

362
00:42:08,342 --> 00:42:10,844
Oh, I don't blame you.

363
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:12,178
I'm...

364
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:14,055
Kirk!

365
00:42:24,191 --> 00:42:27,819
You really didn't want me to come, did you?

366
00:42:27,903 --> 00:42:31,197
Oh, Franklin, I'm just tired.

367
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:33,491
It's been a long day.

368
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:40,123
Sally, did you believe in all that stuff

369
00:42:40,207 --> 00:42:44,961
that Pam was telling about Saturn and retrograde and all that?

370
00:42:45,045 --> 00:42:49,382
I don't know. Everything means something, I guess.

371
00:42:49,467 --> 00:42:50,925
Yeah.

372
00:42:54,889 --> 00:42:57,974
You don't think that guy would try and follow us, do you?

373
00:42:58,058 --> 00:43:01,686
Well, I mean, there's no way that he could follow us.

374
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:08,109
He's probably afraid Kirk will kill him.

375
00:43:14,617 --> 00:43:15,783
Sally?

376
00:43:15,868 --> 00:43:17,952
What now?

377
00:43:21,248 --> 00:43:22,957
Nothing.

378
00:43:25,461 --> 00:43:27,462
Never mind.

379
00:43:32,593 --> 00:43:34,302
Kirk!

380
00:44:04,291 --> 00:44:05,792
Hello?

381
00:44:09,797 --> 00:44:11,798
Is anybody home?

382
00:44:15,844 --> 00:44:18,388
Excuse me, I'm looking for some friends.

383
00:44:18,472 --> 00:44:19,973
Hello?

384
00:44:25,104 --> 00:44:27,146
Is anybody here?

385
00:44:30,317 --> 00:44:31,818
Damn.

386
00:44:49,003 --> 00:44:50,336
Kirk?

387
00:44:51,672 --> 00:44:55,383
Are you guys in there?

388
00:44:57,344 --> 00:45:00,930
Hey, guys, quit playing games. Quit goofing on me.

389
00:45:09,481 --> 00:45:11,524
Pam, is that you?

390
00:45:15,362 --> 00:45:17,363
OK, you guys.

391
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:23,828
Come on out. Come on!

392
00:45:35,215 --> 00:45:36,716
Kirk?

393
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:39,839
They must be lost. They don't have a flashlight or anything.

394
00:47:39,923 --> 00:47:43,217
If they're not back in a minute, we've got to go look for them.

395
00:47:43,302 --> 00:47:45,803
Well, what if we get lost, too?

396
00:47:47,347 --> 00:47:50,266
Sally, we ought to go to that gas station and get help.

397
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:53,352
I'm not leaving here without Jerry.

398
00:47:55,022 --> 00:47:57,064
Jerry!

399
00:47:58,525 --> 00:48:00,735
Jerry!

400
00:48:00,819 --> 00:48:03,237
Jerry!

401
00:48:04,823 --> 00:48:08,242
Jerry!

402
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:11,496
- Jerry! - Jerry!

403
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:14,040
Hey!

404
00:48:18,212 --> 00:48:21,506
They'll probably be back in a minute or so.

405
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,968
Sally, we ought to go to that gas station.

406
00:48:28,597 --> 00:48:30,264
Sally?

407
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:33,976
I think we ought to go.

408
00:48:37,272 --> 00:48:39,398
Are the keys in the van?

409
00:48:41,735 --> 00:48:46,072
- Could I see the flashlight for a minute? - What for?

410
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:49,784
Let me see the flashlight. I'll go look for them. You don't have to go.

411
00:48:49,868 --> 00:48:52,620
Sally, don't go. I don't think that's a good idea.

412
00:48:52,704 --> 00:48:57,917
I don't think you ought to go. I'm going to honk the horn one more time.

413
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:00,002
- Just give me the flashlight. - No.

414
00:49:00,087 --> 00:49:04,465
Now, I'm gonna honk the horn, and we're gonna wait a minute,

415
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:07,343
and then if they don't come, we'll go.

416
00:49:07,427 --> 00:49:09,428
All right?

417
00:49:14,852 --> 00:49:18,354
Sally, they took the keys. We don't have any keys.

418
00:49:18,438 --> 00:49:21,315
They took the keys with them.

419
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:25,236
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Franklin!

420
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:28,322
- Jerry took the keys with him! - Give me that flashlight!

421
00:49:28,407 --> 00:49:32,785
No, Sally, we can't go! Look, what if they came back and we weren't here?

422
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:36,747
- Give me that flashlight! - No, I've got to take the flashlight.

423
00:49:36,832 --> 00:49:41,460
- I'm gonna go look for them. - All right, all right, I'll go with you.

424
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:45,506
No, Sally. Come on, I'll go with you, but I'm gonna keep the flashlight.

425
00:49:45,591 --> 00:49:48,259
- Give me the flashlight! - Look, I'll go with you.

426
00:49:48,343 --> 00:49:51,429
I can't push you down that hill!

427
00:49:51,513 --> 00:49:55,391
Sally, look, I know. Oh!

428
00:49:55,475 --> 00:50:00,146
- I'll go with you, but I'm going to hold... - Never mind, I'll just go without it.

429
00:50:01,189 --> 00:50:06,444
All right, all right. Sally, wait! Sally, wait a minute! I'm coming with you.

430
00:50:06,528 --> 00:50:09,655
Sally? Hold up a minute now.

431
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,741
All right, let's go.

432
00:50:11,825 --> 00:50:13,910
Let's go. I'll go with you.

433
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,830
Sally, I can't keep up with you.

434
00:50:17,915 --> 00:50:19,916
Sally?

435
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,168
Sally, wait a minute.

436
00:50:28,675 --> 00:50:30,676
Hold up.

437
00:50:38,852 --> 00:50:42,647
Jerry!

438
00:50:42,731 --> 00:50:53,991
Jerry!

439
00:50:55,369 --> 00:50:57,119
Jerry!

440
00:50:57,871 --> 00:51:01,624
Jerry!

441
00:51:07,214 --> 00:51:09,382
Wait.

442
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:13,803
- I thought I heard something. - There's a light.

443
00:51:13,887 --> 00:51:15,888
- Yeah? - Yes.

444
00:51:17,224 --> 00:51:20,476
Oh, it looks like a house.

445
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:23,854
Well, come on, push. Come on, push.

446
00:51:23,939 --> 00:51:26,440
Push down. There.

447
00:51:32,072 --> 00:51:36,283
- It's a house. - Yeah? I can't see it very well.

448
00:51:36,368 --> 00:51:39,620
Oh, Franklin, this is impossible.

449
00:51:39,705 --> 00:51:42,623
Come on, Sally.

450
00:51:42,708 --> 00:51:45,501
Get back and push down.

451
00:51:45,585 --> 00:51:47,628
This is impossible.

452
00:51:50,757 --> 00:51:52,842
I hear something out there.

453
00:51:54,261 --> 00:51:55,720
Look.

454
00:51:59,349 --> 00:52:01,517
- Hey, Jerry! - Jerry!

455
00:52:01,601 --> 00:52:03,644
Jerry!

456
00:52:11,194 --> 00:52:13,529
Sally, I hear something. Stop. Stop.

457
00:54:19,239 --> 00:54:21,240
Somebody, please!

458
00:54:22,075 --> 00:54:23,868
Help!

459
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:27,329
Help me, please!

460
00:54:29,541 --> 00:54:32,418
Somebody, help me!

461
00:54:58,111 --> 00:55:10,206
Help!

462
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:12,791
Please! Please! Please help me!

463
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:14,960
Please!

464
00:57:46,321 --> 00:57:48,822
Help! Help me!

465
00:57:48,907 --> 00:57:50,491
Help!

466
00:57:53,453 --> 00:57:55,788
Help! Help!

467
00:57:55,872 --> 00:57:57,164
Help!

468
00:57:59,125 --> 00:58:01,877
Help! Help me!

469
00:58:01,961 --> 00:58:05,172
Help me! Oh, God! Help, help!

470
00:58:05,256 --> 00:58:08,050
Close the door. Help me.

471
00:58:08,134 --> 00:58:10,677
Whoa, there, whoa, whoa.

472
00:58:10,762 --> 00:58:13,555
- Come over here. - Somebody's trying to kill me.

473
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:16,475
Help, help...

474
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:19,061
Calm down. You're all right, you're OK.

475
00:58:19,145 --> 00:58:21,688
- Oh, now, take it easy. - Call the police.

476
00:58:21,773 --> 00:58:23,941
- He might come. - Now, what happened?

477
00:58:24,025 --> 00:58:28,028
- He... he... he killed... - Now, now, take it easy.

478
00:58:28,113 --> 00:58:31,073
He killed Franklin. I don't know. Call the police!

479
00:58:31,157 --> 00:58:34,451
- Take it easy. - And Jerry.

480
00:58:34,536 --> 00:58:37,871
I... I don't-I don't know what happened to the others.

481
00:58:37,956 --> 00:58:40,165
There's nobody out there now.

482
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:43,168
Come on. Come on now, take it easy. Come on, take it easy.

483
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:45,921
- Oh, please. - What happened?

484
00:58:46,005 --> 00:58:49,591
Please. Call the police.

485
00:58:49,676 --> 00:58:52,678
There's no phone here.

486
00:58:52,804 --> 00:58:57,433
We... we have to drive over to Childress.

487
00:58:57,517 --> 00:59:00,102
Yeah, yeah. Now, you take it easy.

488
00:59:00,186 --> 00:59:03,105
Take it easy now. I'll get the truck.

489
00:59:03,189 --> 00:59:05,941
- Now, now, take it easy. Take it easy. - Don't go.

490
00:59:06,025 --> 00:59:08,444
Take it easy.

491
00:59:16,244 --> 00:59:20,080
Weather is expected to be warm to partly cloudy tomorrow

492
00:59:20,165 --> 00:59:22,583
with no chance of precipitation.

493
00:59:22,667 --> 00:59:26,336
The high today will be in the upper 90s and a low tonight of 81 degrees.

494
00:59:26,421 --> 00:59:30,466
Current temperature is 96 with winds out the southeast at three miles a hour.

495
00:59:30,550 --> 00:59:34,261
Humidity 98, barometer is at 29.9 and rising.

496
00:59:34,345 --> 00:59:38,432
Acting on a tip, the Muerto County sheriff's office

497
00:59:38,516 --> 00:59:42,519
began an investigation early this morning in the Muerto County Cemetery

498
00:59:42,604 --> 00:59:45,814
opening crypts where there was evidence of tampering.

499
00:59:45,899 --> 00:59:50,903
The sheriff's deputies found a reported dozen coffins robbed of their contents.

500
00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:52,654
According to the sheriff,

501
00:59:52,739 --> 00:59:56,450
there were cadavers in which the heads and extremities were removed,

502
00:59:56,534 --> 01:00:01,413
and others in which only a hand or foot had been removed.

503
01:00:01,498 --> 01:00:04,333
Maldonado has information linking the robberies

504
01:00:04,417 --> 01:00:08,337
to a large and well-organized West Coast jewel theft ring

505
01:00:08,421 --> 01:00:13,509
but declined to suggest any reason for them to mutilate the cadavers.

506
01:00:33,821 --> 01:00:36,698
- What are you doing? - You ain't got no need to worry.

507
01:00:36,783 --> 01:00:37,824
No!

508
01:00:37,909 --> 01:00:41,870
You just cooperate, young lady, and we'll have no trouble.

509
01:00:43,248 --> 01:00:45,666
- Now, listen... - What do you want?

510
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:51,255
Now, there's no need to do that. Nobody's going to hurt you.

511
01:00:51,339 --> 01:00:52,798
No!

512
01:01:07,897 --> 01:01:10,065
No! No! No!

513
01:02:59,425 --> 01:03:01,635
Had to lock up and get the lights.

514
01:03:01,719 --> 01:03:05,764
Cost of electricity is enough to drive a man out of business.

515
01:03:34,752 --> 01:03:37,838
Uh, I hope you're not too uncomfortable down there.

516
01:03:42,969 --> 01:03:48,557
You got nothing to worry about. You just take it easy, and we'll be there soon.

517
01:03:52,562 --> 01:03:56,398
Now, now, now, now.

518
01:03:56,482 --> 01:03:59,651
There's no need to do that, no.

519
01:04:26,846 --> 01:04:29,723
We'll be over this in a bit.

520
01:04:30,767 --> 01:04:32,768
Hang on.

521
01:04:41,778 --> 01:04:42,986
Halfwits.

522
01:04:48,701 --> 01:04:51,036
Little coon shits.

523
01:04:58,085 --> 01:05:01,630
Come here, you nap-haired idiot!

524
01:05:01,714 --> 01:05:04,800
- Where have you been? - I've been out on the road.

525
01:05:04,884 --> 01:05:08,845
You damn fool, you almost got caught over at Duke's.

526
01:05:08,930 --> 01:05:12,015
No, no, they didn't see me. They don't know nothing.

527
01:05:12,099 --> 01:05:15,644
I told you to stay away from that graveyard!

528
01:05:54,267 --> 01:05:57,978
I told you and I told you,

529
01:05:58,062 --> 01:06:01,857
I told you never to leave your brother alone, you...

530
01:06:02,108 --> 01:06:06,361
Get in there and get that girl out of the car. Come on, get her out of the car.

531
01:06:06,445 --> 01:06:10,282
Get her out of there.

532
01:06:10,366 --> 01:06:13,743
Hopefully your brother didn't let any of those kids get away.

533
01:06:13,828 --> 01:06:16,705
Get her in there. We'll have the whole county out here.

534
01:06:16,789 --> 01:06:19,291
Don't you got any self-respect?

535
01:06:21,794 --> 01:06:25,046
Look what your brother did to the door!

536
01:06:25,131 --> 01:06:28,049
He's got no pride in his home?

537
01:06:28,134 --> 01:06:30,135
Get her in there.

538
01:06:35,349 --> 01:06:38,476
You've been a fool, you!

539
01:06:39,478 --> 01:06:42,022
You better get them other kids.

540
01:06:42,106 --> 01:06:44,524
Where are they, huh?

541
01:06:56,662 --> 01:06:58,496
You're a damn fool, you.

542
01:07:03,878 --> 01:07:05,337
Oh!

543
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:07,756
I thought you was in a hurry.

544
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:15,305
Where are the kids? Where are they? Show me!

545
01:07:19,852 --> 01:07:22,979
- None of 'em get away? - Uh-uh-uh.

546
01:07:23,064 --> 01:07:25,690
- Are you sure? - Uh-huh.

547
01:07:30,488 --> 01:07:31,947
You...

548
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:36,242
You damn fool! You ruined the door!

549
01:07:45,878 --> 01:07:48,088
Hey, you did good. She's a nice girl.

550
01:07:48,172 --> 01:07:52,300
You nitwit, get upstairs and get your grandpa.

551
01:08:08,567 --> 01:08:12,737
Now, now, young lady, you just take it easy there now.

552
01:08:12,822 --> 01:08:16,741
Look, we'll fix you some supper in a few minutes. Huh?

553
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:21,621
Get back in there!

554
01:08:25,001 --> 01:08:27,043
Get in there!

555
01:08:32,216 --> 01:08:34,801
Now, you just take it easy.

556
01:08:34,885 --> 01:08:36,886
Take it easy.

557
01:08:37,513 --> 01:08:40,557
We'll have you something to eat right away.

558
01:09:06,667 --> 01:09:08,626
Hey.

559
01:09:08,711 --> 01:09:10,795
Hey, Leatherface.

560
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:13,256
Give me a hand with Grandpa.

561
01:09:28,814 --> 01:09:30,523
Careful.

562
01:10:08,479 --> 01:10:10,688
Look, Grandpa, look, look.

563
01:10:37,508 --> 01:10:39,801
Here, here!

564
01:12:25,032 --> 01:12:26,866
Shut up!

565
01:12:26,951 --> 01:12:28,701
Quiet!

566
01:12:29,453 --> 01:12:31,496
You act like a pack of hounds.

567
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:34,165
We were just having fun.

568
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:36,542
You think this is a party?

569
01:12:37,294 --> 01:12:38,836
Please.

570
01:12:40,339 --> 01:12:42,340
You can make them stop.

571
01:12:42,424 --> 01:12:44,717
No, he can't.

572
01:12:44,802 --> 01:12:47,220
Shut your mouths.

573
01:12:47,972 --> 01:12:50,723
Can't be helped, young lady.

574
01:12:50,808 --> 01:12:54,185
- Oh, please, you can't let them kill me. - Shut up.

575
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:56,312
Don't pay him no mind.

576
01:13:02,486 --> 01:13:05,238
You like this face?

577
01:13:18,294 --> 01:13:22,797
You're crazy! You've got to make them stop!

578
01:13:23,882 --> 01:13:24,841
Please!

579
01:13:24,925 --> 01:13:27,468
He's nothing. He's just the cook.

580
01:13:28,387 --> 01:13:31,139
Shut up, you bitch hog.

581
01:13:32,850 --> 01:13:36,394
Me and Leatherface do all the work. He don't like it.

582
01:13:36,478 --> 01:13:38,855
Ain't that right? You're just the cook!

583
01:13:38,939 --> 01:13:41,816
Shut your mouth!

584
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:45,153
You don't understand nothing.

585
01:13:45,237 --> 01:13:48,948
I understand you ain't nothing. Me and him do all the work!

586
01:13:49,033 --> 01:13:51,868
I just can't take no pleasure in killing.

587
01:13:55,164 --> 01:14:00,460
Well, there's just some things you got to do. Don't mean you have to like it.

588
01:14:00,544 --> 01:14:03,379
Oh, please. Please.

589
01:14:04,423 --> 01:14:07,592
What do you want? I'll do anything. Anything.

590
01:14:09,970 --> 01:14:13,598
I'll do... I'll do anything you want.

591
01:15:17,579 --> 01:15:20,081
Don't need to torture the poor girl.

592
01:15:20,165 --> 01:15:24,460
You just shut up! Remember you're just the cook, and me and him will handle this.

593
01:15:24,545 --> 01:15:27,630
Then get on with it. I won't have this.

594
01:15:30,926 --> 01:15:34,595
We ain't in no hurry because you ain't going no place.

595
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:36,431
No.

596
01:15:36,515 --> 01:15:40,101
You hear me? It might hurt you, but it don't mean much.

597
01:15:43,355 --> 01:15:45,565
No sense in waiting.

598
01:15:45,649 --> 01:15:47,817
I got to open up the room.

599
01:15:48,777 --> 01:15:53,906
I been... I been thinking about letting Grandpa have some fun.

600
01:15:53,991 --> 01:15:56,200
You always said he's the best.

601
01:15:56,285 --> 01:15:58,286
He's the best, all right.

602
01:15:59,121 --> 01:16:04,584
Let's let him have a whack. Hey, Grandpa, we going to let you have this one.

603
01:16:14,428 --> 01:16:16,512
Just let him have a whack.

604
01:16:19,391 --> 01:16:23,686
Now, you just hush. It won't hurt none.

605
01:16:25,230 --> 01:16:29,150
Why, old Grandpa is the best killer there ever was.

606
01:16:29,234 --> 01:16:32,778
Why, it never took more than one lick, they say.

607
01:16:32,863 --> 01:16:36,073
Why, he did 60 in five minutes once.

608
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:39,535
They say he could've done more if the hook and pull gang

609
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:43,456
could've gotten the beeves out of the way faster.

610
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:46,584
Now, now, don't you cry none.

611
01:16:46,668 --> 01:16:49,337
Old Grandpa's the best. It won't hurt a bit.

612
01:16:52,925 --> 01:16:55,343
No! No!

613
01:17:00,349 --> 01:17:05,228
No! No!

614
01:17:05,312 --> 01:17:09,357
No! Oh, please don't!

615
01:17:09,441 --> 01:17:12,818
Please! Please! Please don't!

616
01:17:12,903 --> 01:17:15,112
No, no! No!

617
01:17:25,165 --> 01:17:26,624
No!

618
01:17:27,626 --> 01:17:30,336
Hit her, Grandpa!

619
01:17:34,883 --> 01:17:36,968
Hit her, Grandpa!

620
01:17:37,636 --> 01:17:39,554
Hit her! Come on, Grandpa.

621
01:17:41,598 --> 01:17:43,599
Hit her!

622
01:17:44,643 --> 01:17:47,019
Hit that bitch.

623
01:17:47,688 --> 01:17:49,772
Hit her, Grandpa!

624
01:17:50,732 --> 01:17:52,733
Come on!

625
01:17:56,071 --> 01:17:58,072
Come on, Grandpa, hit that bitch.

626
01:17:58,156 --> 01:18:01,576
Careful there. Come on, Grandpa.

627
01:18:02,953 --> 01:18:05,079
Get her Grandpa, get her.

628
01:18:05,831 --> 01:18:08,082
Go ahead, go ahead! Get her!

629
01:18:19,970 --> 01:18:22,096
Come on.

630
01:18:22,180 --> 01:18:25,725
- Give me the hammer. I'll get her. - Get her, get her, Grandpa.

631
01:18:25,809 --> 01:18:29,103
- Give me that hammer. - Hit her, hit her, Grandpa.

632
01:18:29,187 --> 01:18:32,064
- I'll kill her. Let me get her. - Hit the bitch.

633
01:19:54,189 --> 01:19:56,357
Help!

634
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:56,041
Help!

635
01:21:16,938 --> 01:21:18,689
Go!

636
01:21:19,483 --> 01:21:21,025
Go
