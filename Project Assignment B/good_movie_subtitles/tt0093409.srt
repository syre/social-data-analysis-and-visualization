1
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,361
Surprise!

2
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,572
Happy Birthday, Daddy!

3
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,625
Make a wish!

4
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,961
I wish....
I'm not going to tell you.

5
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,088
Come on, blow them out!

6
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:04,720
Give me some sugar, girl.

7
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:08,223
One more candle and the smoke alarm
would've gone off.

8
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,062
The big 5-0.

9
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:19,443
You know, your beard's getting gray.
Kind of makes you look old.

10
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,528
It's all right. I still love you.

11
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,281
Bye, Pa.

12
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,766
Good morning!

13
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,978
-Where's Rianne?
-She's upstairs.

14
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,106
Good morning.

15
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,358
-That's my bacon!
-It's mine now.

16
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,735
Don't you close doors around here?

17
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,654
Baby, what's this on my tie?

18
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,740
That is an ugly spot.

19
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,201
Thanks. Sharp as a tack.

20
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,871
I'm thinking of going on Jeopardy.

21
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,915
Just don't take any questions
about cooking.

22
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:45,172
Don't step in the egg!

23
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:49,885
What am I thinking? I should have
checked the floor for egg!

24
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:55,223
Do you know a man named
Michael Hunsaker?

25
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,187
Jesus! Michael Hunsaker!

26
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,481
-What did he want?
-Your office called.

27
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,941
He's tried to reach you for three days.

28
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,027
I haven't talked to him in...

29
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,155
...twelve years!

30
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,324
Wait a minute.

31
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,534
That would make me...

32
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:16,912
...fifty!

33
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,039
That means that you're--

34
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,625
We're not gonna discuss it.

35
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,543
Forget the eggs.

36
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,549
How come I never heard
of Michael Hunsaker?

37
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,510
Just never talked about him.

38
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,220
Vietnam buddy?

39
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,555
Eat your own cake. Vietnam buddy.

40
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,226
Nick and the kids
left without me.

41
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:42,938
He left without you? Come on,
I never get enough of my baby.

42
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:46,816
This is my New Year's Eve dress.
Do you like it? Isn't it cool?

43
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,443
It's beautiful.

44
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,197
Have a good birthday.

45
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,457
Goddamn heartbreaker!

46
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,597
Happy birthday, Rog!

47
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,608
We got a hooker.

48
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,487
No, it's Dixie. Would you please
tell these bozos to lay off?

49
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:33,989
You bozos, lay off.

50
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,992
Had a jumper here last night.
She saw it happen.

51
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,119
Get her statement, send her home.

52
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,038
Thanks. I'm beat.
You know how it is.

53
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,499
All dressed up, no one to blow.

54
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:48,295
You're hilarious!
I can't believe you damn cops!

55
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,214
The jumper's name is Amanda Hunsaker.

56
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,633
Age 22.

57
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:57,887
Prostitute. One arrest,
no convictions. Born in Tennessee.

58
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,806
-Parents--
-What was the name?

59
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,684
The parents.

60
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,312
Michael and Claire.

61
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:07,814
You know them?

62
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,860
Right. Find out who bought it,
who's paying the bilIs.

63
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,696
-That will take some looking into.
-So look!

64
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,141
Hello, honey.

65
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,853
Give me the number
for Michael Hunsaker.

66
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,773
The man we talked about?
Your Vietnam buddy?

67
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:53,193
-You just mentioned him this morning.
-What's wrong?

68
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,695
His daughter just dove out a window.

69
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,826
I got it.

70
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,139
Good, huh? Tasty? Smooth?

71
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:29,104
-Yeah, that's good.
-You better fucking believe it.

72
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,398
Let's do it. How much?

73
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,358
How much for how much?

74
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,276
For all of it.

75
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,613
You want it all? He wants it all.

76
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,741
-All right!
-Maybe a nice tree to put it under.

77
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,993
You want a tree?

78
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,745
I'll tell you what.

79
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,915
I'll give you the best tree
on the lot for nothing.

80
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,626
But the shit's gonna cost you...

81
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,628
... a hundred.

82
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:54,879
That much?

83
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,798
That's a fair price.

84
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,427
You only live once.

85
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,637
Get this together here.

86
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,724
20, 40...

87
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,142
... 50, 70....

88
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:10,520
-What the fuck?
-Hey, man!

89
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,231
Shut up, I'm losing count.

90
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,151
93, 94, 95, 96....

91
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:17,902
Forget it, dumbshit!

92
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,238
One hundred thousand!

93
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,949
One hundred thousand dollars!

94
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,952
A hundred thousand?

95
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:30,665
I can't afford that. Not on my salary.
But look, I got a better idea.

96
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:35,462
Let me say I take the whole stash
off your hands for free...

97
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,674
... and you assholes go to jail.
What do you say?

98
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:45,680
I could read you your rights, but you
already know what your rights are.

99
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,894
This badge ain't real.

100
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,437
You ain't real.

101
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:55,106
You sure are a crazy son of a bitch.

102
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:58,526
I'm crazy?

103
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,696
You think I am crazy?

104
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,490
I'll show you....

105
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,038
That's a real badge, I'm a real cop
and this is a real gun.

106
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:12,373
Okay, pal.

107
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,375
Noses in the dirt, assholes!

108
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,014
Where's your buddy?

109
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,061
What do you got?

110
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:36,648
Three down and one loose.
He's got a red shirt.

111
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,316
Okay, let's go.

112
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:43,238
Freeze! Give me the gun! Up, up!

113
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,865
How's it feel, sucker?

114
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,408
Shoot him!

115
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:48,618
Drop it!

116
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,537
Shoot him! Shoot him!

117
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,331
-Shut the fuck up!
-Shoot this prick!

118
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,043
Shoot him! Somebody
shoot this prick!

119
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,753
Shoot me.

120
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,297
Shut up! Put them down!

121
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,759
-I warn you! I'm going to shoot you!
-Shoot him!

122
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,761
Shut the fuck up! Shut up!

123
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,138
Shoot me! Shoot him!

124
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,064
Get him out of there.

125
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,067
It ain't worth it.

126
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,286
Hey, wait up already!

127
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,436
Merry Christmas!

128
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,507
I miss you...

129
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,845
...Victoria Lynn.

130
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,819
That's silly, isn't it?

131
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,410
I'll see you later.

132
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,164
I'll see you much later.

133
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:12,006
Once more with feeling on three.

134
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:17,011
Damn it, Cooley. Do it on three,
or go on the street.

135
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,268
Silent night

136
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,897
Are you telling me
Riggs is playing a game?

137
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:31,609
Sure. He wants the cash.
But he'll come around.

138
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:34,195
That's a very dangerous
attitude to take.

139
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:39,117
Remember, his wife of 11 years
was just killed in a car accident.

140
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:43,246
-He pulIs his gun when he shouldn't.
-I know all about him.

141
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,705
He's a tough bastard.

142
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:48,209
He's on the edge. I'm telling you,
he may be psychotic.

143
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,378
That's a bunch of psych bulIshit.

144
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,422
You're making a mistake
by keeping him in the field.

145
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:55,424
The man is suicidal.

146
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:58,511
You're sure of that diagnosis?
You have no doubts?

147
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,429
There are no absolutes in life.

148
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,266
End of discussion.
We're going to wait.

149
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,227
lf he offs himself,
then we'll know I was wrong.

150
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:09,772
You're making a mistake,
because if you're wrong--

151
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,656
Asshole!

152
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,784
Roger, you're
way behind the times.

153
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:25,955
The guys in the 80s aren't tough.
They're sensitive people.

154
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:29,375
They show emotions around women,
shit like that.

155
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,670
I think I'm an 80s man.

156
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,422
How do you figure?

157
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,090
Last night...

158
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,467
... I cried in bed. How's that?

159
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,222
Were you with a woman?

160
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:47,101
I was alone. Why do you think
I was crying? Merry Christmas.

161
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,478
Sounds like an 80s man to me.

162
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,690
-News on the Hunsaker case.
-That was quick.

163
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:56,319
So was the autopsy.
They're not calling it a suicide.

164
00:19:56,945 --> 00:20:00,907
Surprise, surprise. The coroner
found evidence she used barbiturates.

165
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,117
Brilliant detective work.

166
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,994
There were pilIs all over.

167
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,622
Right. That's not the surprise.

168
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:10,458
The surprise is the pilIs were doctored.

169
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,502
The capsules were loaded
with drain cleaner.

170
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:14,962
She'd have died anyway.

171
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,130
This case stinks.

172
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:20,134
You know,
you looked younger with the beard.

173
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,136
Thanks, captain.

174
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,097
You shaved the beard.

175
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:26,807
Some detective.

176
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,643
Two more things.

177
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,979
The condition
of the sheets indicates...

178
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:35,316
... someone eIse was
in bed with Amanda. That's "A."

179
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,651
What's "B"?

180
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:40,029
"B" is, you're breaking in
a new partner on this.

181
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,489
Partner again?

182
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:45,117
Some cat on loan from Dope.
Real burnout, on the edge.

183
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,494
Perfect.

184
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,081
Gun!

185
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,714
Rog, meet your new partner.

186
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,179
I'm too old for this shit.

187
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,936
There are those who
say you're a good cop.

188
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,562
I try.

189
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:18,276
I heard about the little
stunt yesterday. Pretty heroic.

190
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,196
I pulled your file.

191
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:26,284
Said you worked in the Phoenix
project in Vietnam. That right?

192
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:29,453
Assassination stuff.
It's over, you know.

193
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,247
What is?

194
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:32,957
The war.

195
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,792
Yes, I know.

196
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,794
Just thought I'd remind you.

197
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,257
That's some serious shit you carry.

198
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,385
Be my guest.

199
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:52,977
9mm Beretta. Takes 15 in the mag,
one up the pipe...

200
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,897
...wide ejection port, no feed jams.

201
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,399
What have you got?

202
00:21:58,608 --> 00:21:59,734
Four-inch Smith.

203
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,403
Six-shooter?

204
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,573
A lot of old-timers carry those.

205
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:12,580
File aIso said you're heavy
into martial arts.

206
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:16,167
Tai chi and all that killer stuff.

207
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:19,795
I suppose we have to register you
as a lethal weapon.

208
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:24,508
Let's just cut the shit.
We both know why I was transferred.

209
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,096
Everybody thinks I'm suicidal,
so nobody wants to work with me.

210
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,766
Some think I'm faking
to draw psycho pension...

211
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:35,978
... so nobody wants to work with me.
Basically, I'm fucked.

212
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,271
Guess what?

213
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:40,191
-I don't want to work with you.
-Then don't.

214
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:44,612
Ain't got no choice.
Looks like we both got fucked.

215
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,780
Terrific.

216
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:51,702
God hates me, is what it is.

217
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:55,039
Hate Him back. It works for me.

218
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:15,643
-Good afternoon, Mr. Mendez.
-How you doing?

219
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,144
Did you pat him down?

220
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:20,022
-We went through this already.
-Go through it again.

221
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,524
Who are you?

222
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,860
That's hardly important,
but you may call me Mr. Joshua.

223
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,153
Let's go.

224
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,697
Great, swell. Mr. Joshua, huh?

225
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,371
General, Mr. Mendez is here.

226
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:42,878
You call this music? I can get
a better band for half the price.

227
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:46,882
I don't want to hear any of this shit.
Let's get it right.

228
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:51,220
Mr. Mendez, how are you?

229
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,763
I'm fine.

230
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:55,891
Where did you get him?
Psychos "R" Us?

231
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,518
I don't think you're funny.

232
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:00,479
I don't think this whole
goddamn setup is funny.

233
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,399
You're using mercenaries.
Tell me I'm wrong!

234
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,025
You're not wrong.

235
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,695
And you expect me to trust these bozos?

236
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,239
My people are loyal to me.

237
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,074
BulIshit.

238
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:13,576
Do you smoke?

239
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,828
What does that have to do with it?

240
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:16,996
Do you smoke?!

241
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:20,541
Give me your lighter.

242
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,751
-My lighter?
-Your lighter!

243
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,545
Okay. Right here.

244
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,297
Here. Take it.

245
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,258
What the fuck is wrong with you guys?

246
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:30,885
Shut your mouth!

247
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,511
Shut up!

248
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,263
And don't move.

249
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:41,020
Mr. Joshua, your left arm, please.

250
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:53,949
Hey, you guys are fucking gone.
You know what I am saying?

251
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:56,285
Jesus Christ, man!

252
00:24:57,287 --> 00:25:00,623
You guys are fucking
crazy, man. Come on!

253
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,546
Have Endo look at that, Mr. Joshua.

254
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,841
Yes, sir.

255
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,470
You wish to do business with us, yes?

256
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:15,930
Jesus Christ!

257
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:18,557
You wish to make a purchase, yes?

258
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,061
Yes, yes! Jesus Christ, yes.

259
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:27,858
You guys are out there like
fucking Pluto, man. You're gone!

260
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:32,279
The heroin will be here Friday night.
We'll make delivery at that time.

261
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,698
Have the money ready, and no tricks.

262
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:38,285
lf you try anything,
you'll have to talk to Mr. Joshua.

263
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,830
Right. Joshua. I got you.

264
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:44,333
Merry Christmas.

265
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:47,503
Yeah, right. You too, pal.

266
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,516
Mike...

267
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:06,480
...the autopsy report showed
that Amanda was poisoned.

268
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,817
Even if she hadn't jumped,
she'd still be dead.

269
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:14,196
She was murdered.

270
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,035
Jesus!

271
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:27,418
I can't take this.
I just can't take this.

272
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,549
Why did you try
to get in touch with me?

273
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,388
I heard that you were....

274
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,559
Somebody told me you were
working out here.

275
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,896
I thought you could get her out.

276
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,857
Get her out of what?

277
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:57,406
Get her out of the stuff she was into.
She was making...

278
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,408
...videotapes.

279
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,578
Pornographic...

280
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,873
...videotapes.

281
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:10,294
I thought maybe you could just
get her out. Help her.

282
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,434
Easy, Mike.

283
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,193
You owe me, Roger.

284
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,320
Remember?

285
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:44,995
I remember.

286
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:49,124
I want you to find whoever's
responsible for this...

287
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:52,628
... however many of them there are.

288
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:59,218
I know you can do it.
Just find them and kill them.

289
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,928
I'm a police officer.

290
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:04,139
I don't give a shit
that you're a police officer!

291
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,600
Kill them! Just kill them!

292
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,311
Wait. Wait, Rog.

293
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,980
Come on. You find them
and you kill them.

294
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:15,359
You can do that. You owe me.

295
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:20,781
I owe you.

296
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,535
Gotta go, man.

297
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:34,795
What did he mean
when he said you owed him?

298
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,381
We served together in 1965.

299
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:41,468
la Drang Valley. Saved my life.
Took a bayonet in the lungs.

300
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:44,388
-That was nice of him.
-I thought so.

301
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:47,766
-Want me to drive?
-You're supposed to be suicidal.

302
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,769
Anybody who drives
in this town is suicidal.

303
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:55,065
All units, possible jumper
at Santa Monica and Orlando.

304
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:57,818
7-A-21, handle code two.

305
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,531
-All units, come in, please.
-Gotcha!

306
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,409
-What's the number of the car?
-3-William-56.

307
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:09,663
3-William-56 en route.
I love this job! It's so exciting!

308
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,541
Copy.
Police psychologist on the way.

309
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,587
Hey, boss, can we put the sirens on?

310
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,020
Guys, I'm glad you're here.

311
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:35,689
-Where's the psychologist?
-Stuck in traffic.

312
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,024
Who's this guy?

313
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:41,445
Name's McCleary. He was at an
office party and just went outside.

314
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:44,615
-You think he'll go?
-Seems serious enough. Who knows?

315
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,743
-I can handle this.
-Are you qualified?

316
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,120
-I've done it before.
-You're elected.

317
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:54,041
-No guns, just bring him down.
-Roger.

318
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:55,959
10-4.

319
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:14,770
-Who are you?
-Riggs, homicide.

320
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,897
He's over there on the ledge.

321
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,660
Merry Christmas.

322
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:32,663
Leave me alone!

323
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,081
What are you doing?

324
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:35,916
None of your damn business!

325
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,252
Fair enough.

326
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:41,588
I'm just going to
come out there, okay?

327
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:44,383
Don't!
You touch me, I'm gonna jump!

328
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,095
Take it easy, for chrissake!

329
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,639
I don't like this
any better than you do.

330
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:53,267
I can't stand heights.

331
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:54,768
This makes me dizzy.

332
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,437
Just give me a chance
to talk to you.

333
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:02,276
I'm gonna stand
on the ledge with you.

334
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:05,112
Don't go. Not out on the ledge.

335
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:09,408
You're not the first guy
to think of this, you know.

336
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,536
A lot of people got problems
during this season.

337
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:16,039
-You know shit!
-No, you're wrong, pal.

338
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:18,709
You know nothing! Don't touch me!

339
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,627
I didn't do anything wrong!

340
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,797
I know that. It's not like
you're murdering anyone.

341
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,966
-That's right!
-That's right.

342
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,969
The only one I hurt is me! Me!

343
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,805
That's right. I know
you're hurting. I get it.

344
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,558
Don't come near me!

345
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:37,227
Give me a break.
My boss is watching me.

346
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:40,188
I got to make it look
like I'm trying to save you.

347
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,024
Come on.

348
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:47,070
I'm just gonna stand here
and talk to you. That's all.

349
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,198
You won't try nothing?

350
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:52,701
I'm square with you.
I won't try a thing.

351
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:57,039
You think I want to fall off?
I promise, I'll just talk to you.

352
00:31:58,499 --> 00:31:59,750
All right.

353
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:03,712
Here, you want a cigarette?
Come on, let's smoke, okay?

354
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,214
Go on, take it.

355
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:08,842
Take our time and both die of cancer.

356
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,485
See this key?

357
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,195
Bye-bye!

358
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,863
You're crazy!

359
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:34,034
You can jump, but you'd take me
with you, making you a murderer.

360
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,495
-You bastard!
-You'd be killing a cop.

361
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:38,246
Yeah, a psycho nut cop!

362
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:40,624
I'm still a cop.
You coming in?

363
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,543
-I'm jumping!
-Do you really wanna jump?

364
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:47,089
Do you wanna?
That's fine with me. Come on!

365
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:49,049
Let's do it, asshole.

366
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:50,884
I want to do it.

367
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,065
Shit!

368
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,116
You want to go up again?

369
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,076
Come on, it was great.

370
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,747
Help me! Help me loose!

371
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,916
He's trying to kill me!

372
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:26,628
Did you see that?
He's out of his mind! He's crazy!

373
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:29,089
I want my cuffs back.

374
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:32,426
-Don't you touch me!
-What the fuck did you just do?

375
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,929
I controlled the jump!
You wanted him down? He's down!

376
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,305
Come here!

377
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,307
Come here with me!

378
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,362
Get in here!

379
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,120
Okay, no bulIshit!
You want to kill yourself?

380
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,581
Shut up! Yes or no?
You want to die?

381
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:05,000
I got the job done!

382
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:07,169
Just answer the question!

383
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,296
What do you want to hear, man?

384
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:12,132
That sometimes I think about
eating a bullet?

385
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,676
Well, I do!

386
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:18,138
I got a special one for the occasion,
with a hollow point.

387
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:21,850
Make sure it blows
the back of my goddamn head out!

388
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,353
Every day I wake up and think
of a reason not to do it.

389
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,814
Every single day.

390
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:31,818
And you know why I don't?
This is gonna make you laugh.

391
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:35,155
The job. Doing the job.
That's the reason.

392
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:39,117
-You want to die!
-I don't. I'm not afraid of it.

393
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:43,413
Here, take my gun. Don't nibble
on the barrel, pull the trigger.

394
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:46,041
Be my guest!
Go ahead, if you're serious!

395
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,168
You shouldn't tempt me.

396
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:52,881
In your mouth. Bullet may go
through your ear and not kill you.

397
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,175
Under the chin's just as good!

398
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:15,195
You're not trying
to draw a psycho pension.

399
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,907
You really are crazy.

400
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:27,541
I'm hungry. I'm gonna go
and get something to eat.

401
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:43,431
I don't know. He's hurting. There's
something eating away at this guy.

402
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:48,061
I think he's on the edge.
I think Riggs has a death wish.

403
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:52,232
Terrific. So you're
saying I should worry?

404
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,235
I think you should worry.

405
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:57,779
When he goes,
you don't want to be near him.

406
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,907
Thank you, doctor.
You've been very helpful.

407
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,742
You're welcome.

408
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:10,000
I'm too old for this shit.

409
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:13,920
You hungry?

410
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,922
No! I'm not hungry.

411
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,925
-Want me to drive?
-No! I'll drive!

412
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,343
Get in that side!

413
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:21,928
You drive.

414
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:33,607
You get a bad personal call? What
is it? Did the stock market crash?

415
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,484
Don't worry. Here, have a French fry.

416
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:47,120
Fifty years old. What a birthday.
Fifty years old!

417
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:52,167
Been on the force 20 years, not
a scratch on me. Got a wife, kids...

418
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:57,505
... house, boat. I can kiss it all
goodbye because of your death wish.

419
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:58,798
My life is over.

420
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,634
Would you just shut up here!

421
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:03,803
Why are you talking to me anyway?
I'm a dead man!

422
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:09,267
I was driving before you were
an itch in your daddy's pants.

423
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,565
-I didn't know that.
-Know what?

424
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:17,901
That it was your birthday today.

425
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,654
It was yesterday.

426
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:24,032
Well, happy birthday for yesterday.

427
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:29,329
Sincerely. Happy birthday, man.

428
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:30,664
Thanks.

429
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:37,170
Maybe we'll stay alive long enough
for me to buy you a present.

430
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,174
Don't thank me now.

431
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:45,512
It's the least I can do after
all the kindness you've shown me.

432
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,735
Are you gonna tell me
where we're going?

433
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,946
Are we together on this?

434
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:08,451
Beverly HilIs. We got an address
on Amanda Hunsaker's meal ticket.

435
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:11,121
Remember, he's not a suspect yet.

436
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,873
So we question him, not damage him.

437
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,626
I won't hurt. You do all the talking.

438
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,336
Let me do all the talking.

439
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,547
Experience counts here.

440
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:26,219
-You're not going to smoke in the car.
-Well, I am.

441
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:31,057
-What? Does this bother you?
-It bothers me.

442
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,642
-Does it?
-Yeah.

443
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:35,895
I'll open a window.

444
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:41,234
That's not the point. I have to watch
out for my lungs, take care of myself.

445
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:44,404
424 1 coming up.

446
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,072
Bingo.

447
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:51,244
-Do we have a warrant?
-We don't need one with the gate club.

448
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,747
Didn't take them long, huh?

449
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,628
Hey, guys, go on in!
Make yourselves at home!

450
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,255
Merry Christmas!

451
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,135
Don't need a warrant with an invitation.

452
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:12,349
I saw this place on
"Lifestyles of the Rich and Shameless."

453
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:23,651
Get the door.

454
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:37,582
Nice and easy.

455
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:43,713
-Looks like the Garden of Eden.
-Look at this!

456
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,466
Paradise.

457
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,471
Isn't that sweet?

458
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,057
I'm thinking probable cause.

459
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,196
Get the girIs!

460
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,949
Okay, asshole!

461
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,284
Move! Come on! Get out!

462
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,328
Fast! Move!

463
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:19,332
Get your hands on that tree
and face each other!

464
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,251
Hands in front of you!

465
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:24,587
-My leg--
-Don't move it, or I'll break your arm.

466
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:26,798
Got them!

467
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,469
Show me your hands!

468
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,304
Right now!

469
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,765
Put your hands out there!

470
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:41,980
See how easy that was?

471
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:45,733
Boom! Still alive.
Now we question him. You know why?

472
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:49,362
Because I didn't shoot him
or jump off a building with him.

473
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,030
The building guy lived.

474
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,866
The point being, no killing.

475
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,326
-No killing, right.
-Right.

476
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,537
Piece of cake. Now I'm happy.

477
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,498
Read him his rights.
I'll stand here being happy.

478
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:04,127
He's got a gun!

479
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,548
You ever met anybody you didn't kill?

480
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:56,054
Well, I haven't killed you yet.

481
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:00,058
Don't do me no favors.

482
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:01,935
Don't you worry.

483
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:17,617
The coroner gave the body
a ride downtown.

484
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,746
I guess we can get out of here.

485
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:29,254
I'm sorry about that shit
I said out there.

486
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:33,925
You saved my life. Thank you.

487
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,724
I bet that hurt to say.

488
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,478
You'll never know.

489
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:49,065
Let's get a bite to eat.

490
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,650
Get my shoes on.

491
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:04,372
-Mom, Rog is coming.
-Okay, Carrie.

492
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:17,510
Here's my welcoming committee!
Where's my daughter? Which one--?

493
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:21,139
-Come on, Daddy.
-This one's my daughter!

494
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:24,309
Home, both of you. Dinnertime.

495
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:26,311
How are you doing?

496
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:28,187
I am doing all right.

497
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,189
Is that a crook?

498
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:33,192
No, this is my new partner, Martin.

499
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:39,324
I'm glad you're home at a sensible hour.

500
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,327
Well, I try to be a sensible dad.

501
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,329
Come on in, Martin.

502
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,165
Yeah, close the door.

503
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:51,711
Hello, Nick. Get your legs
off the arm of the couch.

504
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:57,383
How you doing? Is Mommy
in the kitchen? Let's sneak up on her.

505
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,558
Hello, baby!
I want you to meet--

506
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:08,645
I'd like you to meet
Daddy's new partner.

507
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:10,480
-Martin Riggs.
-How are you?

508
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:13,691
-This is my wife, Trish.
-Pleased to meet you.

509
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:16,069
Martin's going to join us for dinner.

510
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:19,030
-Roast okay with you?
-What's for dinner?

511
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:22,033
We'll see what's for dinner.

512
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:25,703
This is a brown, sticky--

513
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:27,580
It's roast.

514
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:30,249
How about a brown, roast-like substance?

515
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,378
-Roger, you're being an asshole.
-I try not to be.

516
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:35,463
-Want a drink?
-What do you got?

517
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,757
We have Canadian Mist....

518
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:42,178
-You like Canadian Mist?
-Honey, it's in the back.

519
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:47,725
How come we didn't have fish?
I thought we had fish tonight.

520
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,602
Don't worry about the fish.

521
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:51,896
Getting defensive--
Ever go fishing?

522
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:55,108
Not since I was a kid.
I used to go spearfishing.

523
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:58,444
All I caught was a cold.

524
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:02,532
I got that boat out there.

525
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,867
Rianne, get the dessert.

526
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:08,454
Rianne! Your mother said
get the dessert.

527
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:10,998
-Get the dessert. Get to it!
-Shut up.

528
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:16,587
Catalina Island. Nothing exciting,
but I catch my allotment.

529
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:21,300
You can catch a few things out there.
I caught my wife out there.

530
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,512
Nice fishing out there.

531
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:26,264
Mr. Riggs, care for a tart?

532
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,474
Thank you, yes. Call me Martin.

533
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,978
Mr. Riggs.

534
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:33,604
Sit down.

535
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:37,567
Rianne, it's not the first time
we've had company.

536
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:47,118
My name is Carrie, I'm no fairy
My sister's cherry

537
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:49,787
She's in love with a guy
named Martin--

538
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:52,165
Nicholas!

539
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:54,959
Come on. It was really good!

540
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:57,628
Yeah, Dad! Why don't you try it?

541
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,088
It was good.

542
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:03,176
Yeah, there you go.

543
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,928
I'm gonna find a partner
My name is Roger

544
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:09,849
And I need to be modger
And a secret hodger

545
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:12,101
You need some help.

546
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:13,811
I am awful!

547
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:31,704
Hey, sarge! Thanks for
taking out the garbage.

548
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:35,166
But, honey, I'm entertaining our guest.

549
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,171
What do you think?

550
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:43,633
It's nice. You know
anything about boats?

551
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:46,552
-I know what they cost.
-Can you sail this?

552
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:49,806
What's wrong with you?
It's not a sailboat.

553
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:51,849
That's what I thought.

554
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:57,021
There's no trick. That's the front,
that's the back, water all around.

555
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:59,982
Why you gotta make things
so complicated?

556
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:07,824
I don't. Things get complicated
all by themselves.

557
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:10,493
You mean
Amanda Hunsaker's murder, huh?

558
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:12,745
Did I mention that? I didn't.

559
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:15,873
Didn't have to.
I can read your mind.

560
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,877
What's the matter with you?

561
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:22,755
-Why is there a problem?
-There's no problem.

562
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:25,216
You got one dead girl
and one dead guy.

563
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:29,887
The guy kilIs the girl. We kill him
because he wants us to be dead guys.

564
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,014
That's easy for you to say.

565
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,268
A sugar daddy is dealing drugs.

566
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:39,063
She said, did or saw something
she wasn't supposed to.

567
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:42,567
He pitches her off the balcony
into the sweet by-and-by.

568
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:45,945
That's why he came at us
with a shotgun today.

569
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:50,241
I'm sorry. It's just a little too neat.
I can't swallow it.

570
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:54,537
Of course it's neat.
What's wrong with neat? I like neat.

571
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:58,291
By neat, you mean simple.

572
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:02,587
-You okay?
-Watch out!

573
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:04,755
What button did you push?

574
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:07,633
Where's my manual?

575
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:11,387
Is this what you're
looking for, captain?

576
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:12,930
You asshole!

577
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:17,602
Didn't mean to interrupt one of those
intellectual conversations....

578
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:20,730
Mark asked me to a club tomorrow night.

579
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:24,108
-You're grounded. You know that.
-Please, Daddy?

580
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:25,443
Which one is Mark?

581
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:28,070
-The blond one.
-With pits in his face?

582
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:29,989
Those are dimples.

583
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:34,201
Pits. When he smiles, I can see
through his head. The answer is no.

584
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:35,995
Have a heart, Rog.

585
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:39,749
Hey, buddy. She smoked pot
in the house. She's grounded.

586
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:43,711
Why can I have a beer
and I can't smoke a joint?

587
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:45,212
It's not coke, you know.

588
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:49,300
I'll tell you why.
Because now, at this moment...

589
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:52,803
... beer is legal, grass ain't.
Right or wrong?

590
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:55,264
-It's wrong.
-Right.

591
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:04,231
They sit there drinking six-packs
and I get grounded.

592
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,443
I'm gonna go home.

593
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:10,529
Did we resolve anything here tonight?

594
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,698
Yeah, we resolved plenty.

595
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:16,285
We know your wife
takes out the garbage...

596
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,288
...your daughter smokes grass
and it's illegal...

597
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:23,501
... and you don't know
a lot about boats.

598
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:30,299
You got a hell of a nice family there.

599
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:31,634
Thank you.

600
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,512
I enjoyed the meal. Thanks a lot.

601
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:38,015
BulIshit. But thanks anyway.

602
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:46,148
You don't trust me at all, do you?

603
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:52,363
I tell you what. You make it through
tomorrow without killing anybody...

604
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:56,534
...especially me or yourself,
then I'll start trusting you.

605
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,204
Fair enough.

606
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:06,794
I do it real good, you know.

607
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:08,421
Do what?

608
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:15,886
When I was 19, I did a guy
in Laos from 1000 yards out.

609
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:18,556
A rifle shot in high wind.

610
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,518
Maybe eight...

611
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:26,230
...or even ten guys in the world
could have made that shot.

612
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:33,362
It's the only thing I was ever good at.

613
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:37,074
See you tomorrow.

614
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:40,619
Yeah, see you.

615
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:49,628
You really like my wife's cooking?

616
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:57,219
No.

617
00:50:58,388 --> 00:50:59,638
See you tomorrow.

618
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:27,083
Get out of there, Burbank.

619
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:48,646
This is cute.

620
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:55,111
What have we got here?
"Police evidence."

621
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:35,711
Morning, Roger.
Here, have some coffee.

622
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:41,050
I've been doing a lot of thinking
about the night Amanda Hunsaker died.

623
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,219
-How did you get in?
-Trish let me in.

624
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,429
-What time is it?
-Daytime.

625
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,557
The night Amanda Hunsaker died, she--

626
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:52,061
What was the name of that hooker
who witnessed the jump?

627
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:55,773
Come on, we got to get up
and catch bad guys today.

628
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,566
I'll get a shower.

629
00:53:57,817 --> 00:54:00,611
What was the name of that hooker?

630
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:04,156
-Century City isn't her usual turf.
-Her name is Dixie!

631
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:08,244
Give me that cup.
And get out of here!

632
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:15,626
Someone was in bed with Amanda
the night she died.

633
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:18,087
Until now, we assumed it was a man.

634
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:20,089
Suppose it was Dixie.

635
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:24,551
Disgusting, but okay. Let's say Dixie
put the drain cleaner in her pilIs.

636
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,262
Say someone paid her.

637
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:31,350
She thinks, "Amanda swallows a couple
downers and she's dead." Then Dixie--

638
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:32,893
lf it was her.

639
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:38,190
lf it was her. She's got plenty of time
to spritz the place up and get out.

640
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:40,442
But Amanda jumps out the window.

641
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:42,653
Or Dixie pushes her.

642
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:45,823
She has to make a quick exit
because the body's public.

643
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:47,574
So she hauIs ass downstairs.

644
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,785
People are saying, "What happened?"

645
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:52,371
Somebody spots her,
and she says, "Shit!"

646
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,873
That's right, she says, "Shit!"

647
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:58,168
The point being that now
she has to cover her ass.

648
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:04,800
So she grabs a flatfoot and says,
"Officer, I saw the whole thing."

649
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,469
Right.

650
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:12,891
That's pretty fucking thin.

651
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,393
That's very thin.

652
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:16,395
Thin's my middle name.

653
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:19,064
Your wife's cooking, I'm not surprised.

654
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:22,067
-What?
-Nothing.

655
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:25,154
Those remarks won't get you
invited to Christmas dinner.

656
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:28,907
My luck's changing
for the better every day.

657
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,662
All right, baby, come to Roger.

658
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,499
Center mass.

659
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:45,549
Read them and weep.

660
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:51,055
Do you sleep with that thing?

661
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:53,098
I would if I slept.

662
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:56,602
Step back. Let me show
what an old man can do.

663
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,730
Just warming up,
just warming up.

664
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:08,947
Watch carefully.

665
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:26,048
Hey! Look at that, will you?
Not bad for an old man.

666
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:28,717
Step aside, old man.

667
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,692
Have a nice day.

668
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:33,824
Shit!

669
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:40,205
The policemen are here!

670
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:44,209
Yeah, you're right.
Hello, policemen!

671
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:51,300
-How you doing?
-Fine.

672
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:54,178
Are you going to bust Dixie?

673
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:57,222
We're just going over there
for a cup of coffee.

674
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:59,600
We're going over here to have breakfast.

675
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:04,813
You're gonna bust Dixie!

676
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:13,363
-Like I said, thin.
-Probably nothing.

677
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:28,754
Did you see that? Wasn't that great?

678
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:33,926
What are you, a fag?

679
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:35,844
Your coat's on fire!

680
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:43,560
-Probably nothing.
-Thin. Very thin.

681
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:48,565
You guys okay? Got all
your fingers and toes?

682
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:50,943
Three William 56.

683
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:54,154
We got a fire and explosion
at 111th and Larch.

684
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:57,324
Request ambulance and fire department.

685
00:58:57,784 --> 00:59:00,118
Do it again! Do it again!

686
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:03,330
-Give me a break, guys.
-Enough, enough!

687
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:05,874
Do you think Dixie was home?

688
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:18,303
What you got?

689
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:20,889
Part of the device.

690
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:23,642
This is artwork.
This is goddamn artwork.

691
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:28,981
This is real pro stuff. I haven't seen
anything like this since the war.

692
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:33,819
The ClA used to hire mercs.
They used the exact same setup.

693
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:36,989
Mercury switches, gaflooey!
That's heavy shit.

694
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:41,535
We got something.
The detective wants to see you.

695
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:52,796
Okay, here it is.

696
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:54,798
Some kids playing this morning...

697
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:57,134
...one saw a guy checking the meter.

698
00:59:57,385 --> 00:59:59,511
-Where?
-Here at Dixie's.

699
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:04,099
He was playing under the porch.
Says he saw the guy pretty good.

700
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:07,811
-It could be a break.
-Those kids are six years old.

701
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:10,522
-You call the gas company?
-Sure did.

702
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:14,484
No one's supposed to check
that meter for at least a month.

703
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:18,905
-Let me handle this.
-Be my guest.

704
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:21,575
He's the little fellow that saw the guy.

705
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:25,579
My name is Detective Murtaugh.
What's yours?

706
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:29,124
-Don't tell him your name.
-He'll put you in jail.

707
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:30,626
You won't see your mom.

708
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:34,755
It's all right. I won't
put you in jail. What's your name?

709
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:38,091
-Don't tell him, Alfred.
-Alfred!

710
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:41,887
This is Alfred! Hey, meet Alfred.
This is Alfred.

711
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:44,765
Alfred, hi! How old are you?

712
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:46,308
Six.

713
01:00:46,684 --> 01:00:50,312
Six years old. I bet you like Go-Bots.

714
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:51,938
Is that a real gun?

715
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:54,358
Yeah, this is a real gun.

716
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:55,984
Do you kill people?

717
01:00:56,277 --> 01:01:00,572
No. lf some guy is hurting someone,
I try to shoot him in the leg...

718
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:02,199
...just to stop him.

719
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:04,951
Mama says policemen shoot black people.

720
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:07,120
-Is it true?
-Yeah, is it true?

721
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,122
Is that true?

722
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:14,002
Maybe we ought to get
the kids some--

723
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:15,587
lce cream.

724
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:17,089
You like ice cream?

725
01:01:23,596 --> 01:01:26,223
No, not you, Alfred.

726
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:33,772
The man you saw,
did you get a good look at him?

727
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:36,316
-I saw him.
-Great!

728
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:41,238
Picture him in your head.
Close your eyes.

729
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:44,074
Think what he looks like.

730
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:45,534
Got it?

731
01:01:45,993 --> 01:01:47,452
Can you draw him?

732
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:51,957
Give me some drawing paper
and crayons.

733
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:54,710
-This is good.
-Can it, man.

734
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:57,295
We're gonna put out
an APB on Big Bird.

735
01:01:57,672 --> 01:02:00,465
"All units. Large
yellow bird, silly voice."

736
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:03,677
You're hilarious, Martin. It's enough.

737
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:05,637
Tell me what he looks like.

738
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:07,931
Was he black?

739
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:10,183
Was he white?

740
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:15,063
Was he tall?

741
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:16,940
Tall like me?

742
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:19,234
What color was his hair? Brown?

743
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:21,945
Black?

744
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:23,947
Blond?

745
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:25,657
His hair was blond.

746
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:30,203
What did he have on?
Did he have jeans on?

747
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:31,663
It was paint.

748
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:33,165
Pained?

749
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:34,833
I don't know.

750
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:38,295
Painted?

751
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:41,506
Painted. A tattoo?

752
01:02:43,134 --> 01:02:46,428
Like Popeye?
A tattoo like Popeye? No?

753
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:48,680
It was that.

754
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:52,642
Like that?

755
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:54,811
Exactly like that?

756
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:58,774
I saw it good. This is it.

757
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:00,358
I remember.

758
01:03:00,818 --> 01:03:02,110
Are you sure?

759
01:03:02,653 --> 01:03:03,945
It had a knife, even.

760
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:18,502
Roger, that's a Special Forces tattoo.

761
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:20,504
Really?

762
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:25,675
A Special Forces tattoo,
mercury switches....

763
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:32,265
What the hell
have we gotten into here?

764
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:38,522
Wonder if there's an opening
in the fire department?

765
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:49,950
Want to tell me about it?

766
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:52,786
-About what?
-Don't bulIshit me.

767
01:03:53,037 --> 01:03:56,456
Your daughter wasn't killed
for something she was into.

768
01:03:56,707 --> 01:03:58,917
She was killed
for something you're into.

769
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:01,878
Stop me if I'm wrong.

770
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:05,257
I don't know what you mean.

771
01:04:06,425 --> 01:04:09,386
Keep your hands
away from your pocket, okay?

772
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:11,888
-Easy, man.
-Fuck easy.

773
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:18,353
You called me the other day
to blow the whistle, right?

774
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:20,647
Blow the whistle on what?

775
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:24,150
You were going to tell all,
so they killed your daughter.

776
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:27,070
Tell me if I'm wrong.
Talk to me!

777
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:29,573
They killed your daughter.

778
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:32,951
They paid off a hooker to poison
your little girl.

779
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:35,245
Chrissake!
I've got another daughter.

780
01:04:35,496 --> 01:04:38,790
-She'll be protected.
-You don't know these people.

781
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:41,084
Acquaint me with them.

782
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:46,339
It goes back to the war.

783
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:53,805
I worked with a group called
"Air America." ClA front.

784
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:58,727
They secretly ran
the entire war out of Laos.

785
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:03,607
I was with a special unit called
"Shadow Company." Trained killers.

786
01:05:03,941 --> 01:05:07,444
When Charlie brought in heroin
to finance the VC government...

787
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:10,488
... Shadow Company burned
the whole thing down.

788
01:05:10,948 --> 01:05:12,782
We killed everybody.

789
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:19,581
We aIso formed a plan.

790
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:21,124
Keep talking.

791
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:30,717
A few years ago, Shadow Company
got together again.

792
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,802
The war was over.

793
01:05:33,804 --> 01:05:36,431
But we still had our sources in Asia.

794
01:05:37,683 --> 01:05:39,726
We've been bringing it in
ever since.

795
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:41,394
Bringing in what?

796
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,855
Heroin.

797
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:46,566
Two major shipments a year.

798
01:05:49,987 --> 01:05:52,364
It's all run by ex-ClA.

799
01:05:53,157 --> 01:05:55,158
Soldiers, mercs.

800
01:05:55,993 --> 01:05:58,078
You son of a bitch!

801
01:05:58,287 --> 01:06:02,207
lf you had cold feet, why did
they kill Amanda? Why not you?

802
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:04,834
-They can't. They need me.
-Why?

803
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:10,131
My company is a perfect front. Makes
everything look great on tax reports.

804
01:06:13,844 --> 01:06:16,179
This is big business, Roger.

805
01:06:21,018 --> 01:06:22,560
Not anymore.

806
01:06:23,688 --> 01:06:25,689
I'm gonna burn it down.

807
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:27,732
You can't. It's too big.

808
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:31,319
These people are trained,
expert killers.

809
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:35,949
Tell me about your next shipment:
Where it's coming in, how many--

810
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:38,868
I can't tell you that, Roger.
I can't.

811
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:44,165
I have another daughter. You can't
protect her. I'm in this too deep.

812
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:07,063
Heroin.
You got off easy, you son of a bitch!

813
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:28,918
You through?

814
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:31,087
I haven't even started.

815
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:35,925
Gen. McAllister, this is Delta One.
We're coming in. Over.

816
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:39,054
-So your mission is accomplished?
-Yes, sir.

817
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:41,473
Mr. Hunsaker is dead, sir.

818
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:44,642
I'm afraid, however,
that another problem exists.

819
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:46,478
What is it? Explain.

820
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:48,730
Hunsaker spoke to the police.

821
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:52,317
-Are they dead?
-No, I missed the opportunity.

822
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:56,446
Very disappointing. So the police
may know the whole operation?

823
01:07:56,655 --> 01:07:58,323
That is correct, sir.

824
01:07:58,949 --> 01:08:01,326
Joshua, it's time
we turned up the heat.

825
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:02,994
Come on home.

826
01:08:21,305 --> 01:08:24,224
What's a nice lrish girl
like you doing out here?

827
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:27,519
I'm looking for a guy,
had this girl in his stable.

828
01:08:27,728 --> 01:08:30,814
-Never seen her.
-She's in your line of work. You sure?

829
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:33,608
-Sure. Why?
-I'm a police officer.

830
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:36,486
Don't worry, I won't drag your
ass to jail--

831
01:09:04,014 --> 01:09:05,390
You wore your vest!

832
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:08,810
That was smart, kid. Come on.

833
01:09:11,021 --> 01:09:13,356
Hold on! I'm on your side.

834
01:09:16,026 --> 01:09:18,444
Son of a bitch, that hurts!

835
01:09:19,113 --> 01:09:21,573
I'm pissed, Roger! Now I'm pissed.

836
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:24,826
Look at your face!

837
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:27,287
Two inches higher,
he'd have hit your head.

838
01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:30,081
Two inches lower,
I'd be a faIsetto for life.

839
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:32,208
I bet you'd sound nice too.

840
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:35,962
-Where's my gun?
-Here.

841
01:09:39,049 --> 01:09:40,758
Oh, shit! Roger!

842
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:43,636
The guy who shot me....

843
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:47,807
The same albino jackrabbit
son of a bitch that did Hunsaker.

844
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:49,726
-You sure?
-I'm sure, man.

845
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:51,853
I never forget an asshole.

846
01:09:52,104 --> 01:09:53,771
I got an idea.

847
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:58,151
We fly first class to Detroit
and lay low for a couple weeks.

848
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,737
Come on, be serious.
What do we do?

849
01:10:00,946 --> 01:10:02,071
What eIse?

850
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:04,991
We bury the fuckers.
And you know what eIse?

851
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:09,329
We do this right, we get famous.
Do shaving ads. GirIs. Money.

852
01:10:10,122 --> 01:10:12,790
With our luck, we'll do
Forest Lawn commerciaIs.

853
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,293
BulIshit! We got the edge.

854
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:20,006
Roger, they think I'm dead.
I'm a corpse.

855
01:10:26,263 --> 01:10:27,680
Brilliant.

856
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:31,476
Brilliant shit!

857
01:10:34,438 --> 01:10:36,147
We got a body for you.

858
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:39,943
He was at Hunsaker's place.
I saw him, he saw me.

859
01:10:40,152 --> 01:10:42,153
Get someone eIse to do it, okay?

860
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:46,616
Captain says give it to you.
About two blocks from your house.

861
01:10:47,117 --> 01:10:50,828
Yeah, sure. He's probably blond
with big dimples.

862
01:10:51,163 --> 01:10:53,498
How did you know that, sarge?

863
01:10:55,292 --> 01:10:56,292
Get in here!

864
01:10:57,795 --> 01:10:58,836
Trouble.

865
01:11:02,174 --> 01:11:06,052
They just gave a description
of the kid my daughter's dating.

866
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:35,707
Let's be dark and quiet.

867
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:19,250
The bastards got my daughter.

868
01:12:30,721 --> 01:12:31,763
What is it?

869
01:12:32,264 --> 01:12:33,264
Nothing.

870
01:12:33,474 --> 01:12:35,016
-What is it?!
-Nothing!

871
01:12:35,267 --> 01:12:38,019
Get back in your room.
Back in your room!

872
01:12:55,329 --> 01:12:57,288
You have a beautiful daughter.

873
01:12:57,498 --> 01:13:00,958
I'd stick by the phone to find out
Where to meet us.

874
01:13:06,965 --> 01:13:08,716
They got my kid.

875
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:12,553
Bastards took my baby.

876
01:13:36,036 --> 01:13:38,663
Sgt. McCaskey, pick up line three.

877
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:41,249
Homicide, McCaskey speaking.

878
01:13:41,458 --> 01:13:42,792
This is KCOP news.

879
01:13:43,001 --> 01:13:47,380
We heard an officer was shot tonight.
Can you give us more information?

880
01:13:47,631 --> 01:13:51,384
Sgt. Martin Riggs was shot and killed.
Who is this?

881
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:53,553
We'll send somebody right over.

882
01:13:58,058 --> 01:14:00,601
Bingo! Riggs is out of the picture.

883
01:14:01,019 --> 01:14:02,770
I want Murtaugh taken alive.

884
01:14:03,313 --> 01:14:04,772
He may not talk.

885
01:14:06,024 --> 01:14:07,942
We have his little girl.
He'll talk.

886
01:14:24,042 --> 01:14:26,878
You know they're gonna kill her,
don't you?

887
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:34,594
And if you want her back,
you'll have to take her away from them.

888
01:14:34,928 --> 01:14:36,220
I know.

889
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:45,563
We do this my way.
You shoot and you shoot to kill.

890
01:14:46,064 --> 01:14:50,526
Get as many as you can.
All you got to do is just not miss.

891
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:52,278
I won't miss.

892
01:14:54,281 --> 01:14:57,200
We're going to get bloody on this one.

893
01:15:01,371 --> 01:15:03,080
Are you really crazy?

894
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:08,127
Or are you as good
as you say you are?

895
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:12,131
You're gonna have to trust me.

896
01:15:16,136 --> 01:15:17,470
Here we go.

897
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:28,439
We don't want your daughter.
We want to know what Hunsaker told you.

898
01:15:28,649 --> 01:15:32,693
Dry lake. Victorville.
Sunrise tomorroW. Be there.

899
01:18:37,921 --> 01:18:39,255
Murtaugh!

900
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:41,298
Yes, that's right.

901
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:43,509
Show me my daughter!

902
01:18:43,802 --> 01:18:46,637
Let me see her, then I'll come quietly.

903
01:18:53,645 --> 01:18:55,312
He wants to see the girl.

904
01:18:55,522 --> 01:18:56,772
Get out.

905
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:03,654
Daddy!

906
01:19:04,156 --> 01:19:06,490
Okay, baby! I'm here.

907
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:08,909
Okay, it's all right.

908
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:10,161
Simple exchange.

909
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:14,749
You come with us,
the girl takes a walk.

910
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,459
Let her go now.

911
01:19:18,712 --> 01:19:22,298
As I say, take your hands
out of your pockets.

912
01:19:22,507 --> 01:19:24,175
Sure thing, pal.

913
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:29,013
It's alive.

914
01:19:31,516 --> 01:19:34,143
Let her go now, or we all die.

915
01:19:34,978 --> 01:19:36,061
Take him!

916
01:19:36,396 --> 01:19:37,646
He has a grenade!

917
01:19:37,898 --> 01:19:40,858
He's bluffing!
He wouldn't risk killing his daughter.

918
01:19:41,651 --> 01:19:43,194
lf she's gonna die...

919
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:46,864
... she's gonna die with me.
My way, not yours.

920
01:19:52,037 --> 01:19:56,415
Come on, Roger, get out of the way.
Move to your left. Come on!

921
01:19:56,666 --> 01:19:58,125
Put the pin back in.

922
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:02,463
Officer Murtaugh, don't be foolish.
Look at the hardware.

923
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:04,423
Move to your left.

924
01:20:10,096 --> 01:20:13,599
Look at the firepower.
You're grounded. Riggs is gone.

925
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:16,143
Put the pin back in the grenade.

926
01:20:16,353 --> 01:20:17,937
lf you come closer...

927
01:20:18,438 --> 01:20:19,730
...then we all die.

928
01:20:21,274 --> 01:20:22,942
I don't think so.

929
01:20:30,951 --> 01:20:32,743
Come on, honey.

930
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:35,830
Just a smoker.

931
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:37,289
Bingo.

932
01:20:42,462 --> 01:20:44,380
-Where is he?
-It's Riggs.

933
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,134
Rianne, get in the car!

934
01:20:50,804 --> 01:20:52,513
Get in the fucking car!

935
01:21:10,490 --> 01:21:11,991
Go, Rianne, go!

936
01:21:12,325 --> 01:21:15,077
Come on, cottontail,
stick your head up.

937
01:21:16,538 --> 01:21:19,039
That's it, you son of a bitch.
Good night.

938
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:25,421
Don't try it, son.
You're not that fast.

939
01:21:27,424 --> 01:21:29,258
Hello, Joshua. Hello, Joshua.

940
01:21:29,467 --> 01:21:31,218
-Yes, sir.
-I got Riggs.

941
01:21:32,012 --> 01:21:34,722
He's got Riggs. Go get the girl!

942
01:22:10,133 --> 01:22:12,134
Throw your weapon down!

943
01:22:12,385 --> 01:22:14,720
Put your hands behind your head!

944
01:22:18,808 --> 01:22:22,478
You're Gen. Peter McAllister,
commander of Shadow Company.

945
01:22:22,896 --> 01:22:25,564
I see we've heard of each other.

946
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:29,318
Yep. It'll almost be a shame
when I nail you.

947
01:22:30,236 --> 01:22:34,573
I ran into some of those Shadow Company
pussies in Saigon in '69.

948
01:22:34,866 --> 01:22:36,158
You did, did you?

949
01:23:23,289 --> 01:23:25,124
Leave me alone!

950
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:54,153
Save your strength.
You'll need it.

951
01:23:54,571 --> 01:23:55,571
Who's the Chin?

952
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:59,324
Endo, meet Mr. Martin Riggs.

953
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:03,412
Endo has forgotten more
about dispensing pain...

954
01:24:03,621 --> 01:24:04,872
...than we'll ever know.

955
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:08,500
See, we have a problem.

956
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:10,502
Since we have Murtaugh...

957
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:12,337
...we don't need you.

958
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:16,050
-I believe in being thorough.
-I've heard that about you.

959
01:24:18,261 --> 01:24:20,929
Our problem, and yours too...

960
01:24:21,681 --> 01:24:24,683
... is we have a shipment
of merchandise to deliver.

961
01:24:24,893 --> 01:24:26,769
Why don't you just call it heroin?

962
01:24:28,438 --> 01:24:30,814
It's rather large, this shipment.

963
01:24:31,775 --> 01:24:33,692
It would be unfortunate...

964
01:24:33,902 --> 01:24:36,653
... if we showed up
to deliver our heroin...

965
01:24:37,322 --> 01:24:39,073
... and were surrounded by 50 cops.

966
01:24:39,282 --> 01:24:40,491
That would be too bad.

967
01:24:40,742 --> 01:24:42,284
Yes, it would be.

968
01:24:43,244 --> 01:24:46,163
So we have to find out
all the cops know.

969
01:24:46,372 --> 01:24:49,333
We don't know shit.
You did Hunsaker before he could say--

970
01:24:51,711 --> 01:24:55,255
I wish I could believe you.
Unfortunately, I don't.

971
01:25:00,386 --> 01:25:03,263
Now, if you tell me
everything you know...

972
01:25:03,515 --> 01:25:05,808
... I promise you I'll kill you quick.

973
01:25:07,977 --> 01:25:09,728
I told you everything I know.

974
01:25:16,903 --> 01:25:18,445
What is that thing?

975
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:21,740
I'll tell you.

976
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:24,743
It's electric shock treatment.

977
01:25:26,746 --> 01:25:29,832
We're in for a long night,
because I don't know shit.

978
01:25:32,168 --> 01:25:33,544
We'll see.

979
01:25:42,262 --> 01:25:43,262
Hit him again!

980
01:25:53,231 --> 01:25:54,231
Again!

981
01:25:59,612 --> 01:26:01,155
Tell me about the shipment!

982
01:26:03,575 --> 01:26:06,118
I'm gonna fucking kill both of you!

983
01:26:06,369 --> 01:26:08,745
Very funny.
What about the shipment?

984
01:26:14,419 --> 01:26:16,503
The shipment, Mr. Murtaugh.

985
01:26:16,963 --> 01:26:18,797
Go spit!

986
01:26:20,091 --> 01:26:21,091
Salt.

987
01:26:36,566 --> 01:26:40,402
Go spit, you son of a bitch.
Fuck you!

988
01:26:41,237 --> 01:26:42,863
This is getting nowhere.

989
01:26:43,072 --> 01:26:44,239
Mr. Large.

990
01:26:51,497 --> 01:26:52,831
He knows shit. We're safe.

991
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:55,918
He'd have told us.
Nobody can take that.

992
01:26:56,628 --> 01:26:57,961
Fine.

993
01:26:58,171 --> 01:26:59,588
Badass soldier, huh?

994
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:15,395
Get her up.

995
01:27:20,526 --> 01:27:23,195
Untie me and I'll kill
all of you bastards!

996
01:27:23,404 --> 01:27:25,155
Tell me what you know.

997
01:27:25,365 --> 01:27:28,075
Fuck you, bastard!
I'll kill you!

998
01:27:35,541 --> 01:27:37,334
Sorry, pal.
Say good night.

999
01:27:59,190 --> 01:28:02,442
That's a real good-looking
young woman...

1000
01:28:02,652 --> 01:28:05,028
...you got there, Mr. Murtaugh.

1001
01:28:07,949 --> 01:28:09,157
I've told you everything.

1002
01:28:09,367 --> 01:28:10,867
We'll soon know, won't we?

1003
01:28:11,077 --> 01:28:12,661
I'm warning you.

1004
01:28:13,037 --> 01:28:14,037
Don't.

1005
01:28:14,414 --> 01:28:16,623
Spare me, son. It's over.

1006
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:19,584
There's no more heroes
left in the world.

1007
01:28:25,049 --> 01:28:26,300
Kill that son of a bitch!

1008
01:28:37,770 --> 01:28:39,438
That asshole's getting away!

1009
01:28:39,689 --> 01:28:41,690
Who's fucking next?

1010
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:43,692
McAllister!

1011
01:28:43,943 --> 01:28:45,110
Who's next?

1012
01:28:48,197 --> 01:28:49,781
Pretty thin, huh?

1013
01:28:50,033 --> 01:28:51,491
Anorexic.

1014
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,293
-Let's do what the shepherd did.
-What?

1015
01:29:01,502 --> 01:29:03,295
Get the flock out of here.

1016
01:29:15,224 --> 01:29:16,600
Is it him?

1017
01:29:16,934 --> 01:29:19,061
No. It's not Joshua.

1018
01:30:35,972 --> 01:30:37,806
Halt! Stop! Stop!

1019
01:30:38,015 --> 01:30:40,767
Get out of the fucking car!
Come on, now!

1020
01:30:43,604 --> 01:30:44,688
Police officers!

1021
01:31:01,247 --> 01:31:06,168
I'm a police officer. Give me
some backup and take care of the girl.

1022
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:39,159
-He's going for the freeway!
-You okay?

1023
01:31:43,664 --> 01:31:47,667
Cut over the 3rd Street bridge!
You'll get ahead of him.

1024
01:31:50,796 --> 01:31:52,631
General McAllister...

1025
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:56,343
...time for you to die.

1026
01:32:44,767 --> 01:32:45,934
Hold it!

1027
01:33:08,666 --> 01:33:10,417
Get back in your car!

1028
01:33:32,523 --> 01:33:34,649
Mind if I test-drive your Audi?

1029
01:33:38,279 --> 01:33:40,488
Stop the son of a bitch!

1030
01:33:45,536 --> 01:33:46,536
Shit!

1031
01:33:48,623 --> 01:33:49,956
He got my car!

1032
01:33:52,793 --> 01:33:54,878
-Get back!
-Hey, man, I'm cool.

1033
01:34:06,015 --> 01:34:07,641
Let's get out of here!

1034
01:34:11,604 --> 01:34:12,604
Open the door!

1035
01:34:22,698 --> 01:34:24,991
Kill that cop son of a bitch!

1036
01:34:27,411 --> 01:34:29,829
No way you live. No way.

1037
01:35:55,916 --> 01:35:58,084
-Gangway!
-Hold it now.

1038
01:35:58,335 --> 01:36:00,462
-Police officer.
-Go ahead.

1039
01:36:05,926 --> 01:36:08,720
Well, shit!
What now, kid?

1040
01:36:09,346 --> 01:36:11,973
First thing, we get you to hospital.

1041
01:36:12,516 --> 01:36:14,184
Come on. Let's go.

1042
01:36:15,227 --> 01:36:18,021
Don't breathe this stuff.
You'll see pink elephants.

1043
01:36:18,272 --> 01:36:20,231
The slippery son of a bitch got away!

1044
01:36:20,483 --> 01:36:23,151
-What do you mean he got away?
-Hey, fire me.

1045
01:36:26,322 --> 01:36:27,489
Where you going?

1046
01:36:27,823 --> 01:36:29,699
Sarge, I'm commandeering your car.

1047
01:36:29,950 --> 01:36:31,242
What's the matter?

1048
01:36:31,452 --> 01:36:34,037
My home!
The bastard knows where I live.

1049
01:36:34,246 --> 01:36:36,122
I'll drive, Cochise.

1050
01:36:37,166 --> 01:36:39,834
-I got to look at him!
-He's all right.

1051
01:36:43,214 --> 01:36:45,965
3-W-30 en route to
Sgt. Murtaugh's residence.

1052
01:36:46,217 --> 01:36:48,510
Requesting additional units.

1053
01:37:22,294 --> 01:37:24,128
Excuse me, sir.
May we help you?

1054
01:37:24,630 --> 01:37:25,630
No, thank you.

1055
01:37:52,992 --> 01:37:54,868
Good morning, sir.

1056
01:37:56,078 --> 01:37:58,246
Tell me, what day is it?

1057
01:37:59,623 --> 01:38:01,291
Goddamn Christmas!

1058
01:38:02,835 --> 01:38:05,295
I'll give you a home
to come back to.

1059
01:38:23,397 --> 01:38:25,607
Crazy son of a bitch!

1060
01:38:45,169 --> 01:38:46,794
Give me that. Drop it.

1061
01:38:56,513 --> 01:38:58,014
Looking for the general?

1062
01:38:59,475 --> 01:39:03,311
He's barbecuing his nuts
on Hollywood Boulevard.

1063
01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:12,904
What do you say, Jack?

1064
01:39:13,906 --> 01:39:15,657
Like a shot at the title?

1065
01:39:16,659 --> 01:39:18,326
Don't mind if I do.

1066
01:39:35,010 --> 01:39:39,430
Okay, men! I'm Sgt. Murtaugh.
My responsibility here!

1067
01:39:40,224 --> 01:39:41,891
Watch commander is en route.

1068
01:39:42,142 --> 01:39:45,603
Until then, Sgt. Murtaugh
is in charge on site.

1069
01:39:49,775 --> 01:39:51,859
Just keep the citizens clear.

1070
01:40:03,831 --> 01:40:05,581
Keep everyone back!

1071
01:40:13,841 --> 01:40:16,801
It's Sgt. Riggs' arrest.
I take full responsibility!

1072
01:40:17,011 --> 01:40:19,387
The son of a bitch
killed two of our men!

1073
01:40:25,310 --> 01:40:26,811
Get him, kid!
He's yours!

1074
01:40:41,744 --> 01:40:43,494
Come on, Riggs! Come on!

1075
01:40:52,046 --> 01:40:54,756
You wanna quit now?
You wanna quit?

1076
01:41:04,308 --> 01:41:06,309
Give me your nightstick!

1077
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:17,361
Come on!

1078
01:41:18,197 --> 01:41:19,614
Show me what you got!

1079
01:41:26,538 --> 01:41:28,039
Eat this, sucker!

1080
01:41:53,732 --> 01:41:54,816
Let them take him!

1081
01:41:55,818 --> 01:41:57,318
Let me take him!

1082
01:41:59,488 --> 01:42:01,072
No! Back off!

1083
01:42:39,862 --> 01:42:41,237
Break his fucking neck!

1084
01:42:49,288 --> 01:42:50,288
It's not worth it.

1085
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:57,753
You lose.

1086
01:43:06,388 --> 01:43:08,556
Get that shit off my lawn!

1087
01:43:13,687 --> 01:43:15,062
How you doing, kid?

1088
01:43:40,672 --> 01:43:42,006
I got you.

1089
01:43:42,466 --> 01:43:43,925
I got you, partner.

1090
01:44:20,796 --> 01:44:22,964
Merry Christmas, Victoria Lynn.

1091
01:44:24,716 --> 01:44:26,008
I love you.

1092
01:44:51,159 --> 01:44:52,326
How are you?

1093
01:44:52,995 --> 01:44:55,329
I'm going to be all right. You?

1094
01:44:55,706 --> 01:44:56,998
I'm good.

1095
01:45:00,168 --> 01:45:02,044
Give this to your dad, okay?

1096
01:45:02,379 --> 01:45:05,548
It's a present for him.
Tell him I won't need it anymore.

1097
01:45:06,341 --> 01:45:09,385
-It's a bullet.
-Yeah, it's a bullet.

1098
01:45:10,178 --> 01:45:11,721
He'll understand.

1099
01:45:13,432 --> 01:45:15,516
You want to come in?
We're building.

1100
01:45:17,477 --> 01:45:19,437
No, I gotta go.

1101
01:45:21,773 --> 01:45:23,858
You have a nice Christmas, though.

1102
01:45:24,401 --> 01:45:25,693
Okay. You too.

1103
01:45:26,737 --> 01:45:27,737
Okay. Bye.

1104
01:45:28,030 --> 01:45:29,196
Bye.

1105
01:45:44,212 --> 01:45:46,297
After all we've been through...

1106
01:45:46,506 --> 01:45:50,718
... if you think I'm gonna eat
the world's worst turkey by myself...

1107
01:45:50,969 --> 01:45:52,094
...you're crazy.

1108
01:45:53,221 --> 01:45:56,098
-I'll tell you a little secret.
-What?

1109
01:45:56,308 --> 01:45:57,641
I'm not crazy.

1110
01:46:00,270 --> 01:46:01,270
I know.

1111
01:46:02,105 --> 01:46:03,230
Oh, good. Let's eat.

1112
01:46:04,816 --> 01:46:06,359
Hey, you know something?

1113
01:46:06,568 --> 01:46:08,527
I think your daughter likes me.

1114
01:46:08,779 --> 01:46:11,155
-lf you touch her, I'll kill you.
-You'll try.

1115
01:46:11,406 --> 01:46:14,658
-You mind if I bring a friend?
-Of course, bring a friend.

1116
01:46:23,085 --> 01:46:25,294
I don't think the cat
will like this.

1117
01:46:25,545 --> 01:46:27,588
I'll put five on the mutt.

1118
01:46:36,515 --> 01:46:38,724
I'm too old for this.
