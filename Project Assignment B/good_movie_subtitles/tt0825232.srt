Who's the pretty little lady?

That's Rachel. Youngest of the three.

Big age difference.

Yeah, well, she was a surprise.

326
00:21:13,488 --> 00:21:16,980
We'd hardly gotten the boys out
of the house when she came along.

She's an outstanding violinist.

long enough for the both of us.

Only successful marriage I had
was me and my work.

He called it a "Bucket List."

01:28:51,776 --> 01:28:55,212
Hello, sweetie. Hi.

1269
01:28:55,380 --> 01:28:58,178
CARTER:
<i>Find the Joy in your life, Edward.</i>

1270
01:29:04,422 --> 01:29:06,322
<i>My dear friend...</i>

1271
01:29:06,958 --> 01:29:12,294
<i>... close your eyes</i>
<i>and let the waters take you home.</i>

1272
01:29:14,999 --> 01:29:19,561
Good afternoon.
My name is Edward Cole.

1273
01:29:22,473 --> 01:29:27,570
I don't know what most people say
at these occasions, because...

1274
01:29:28,012 --> 01:29:30,503
...in all honesty, I...

1275
01:29:31,816 --> 01:29:34,785
I've tried to avoid them.

1276
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:41,258
The simplest thing is...

1277
01:29:41,426 --> 01:29:45,522
...I loved him and I miss him.

1278
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:53,930
Carter and I saw the world together.

1279
01:29:55,673 --> 01:29:57,800
Which is amazing...

1280
01:29:57,975 --> 01:30:00,671
...when you think that only
three months ago...

1281
01:30:00,845 --> 01:30:03,678
...we were complete strangers.

1282
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:10,651
I hope...

1283
01:30:12,156 --> 01:30:15,557
...that it doesn't sound
selfish of me...

1284
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:19,992
...but the last months of his life...

1285
01:30:20,164 --> 01:30:23,463
...were the best months of mine.

1286
01:30:25,970 --> 01:30:27,665
He saved my life.

1287
01:30:28,706 --> 01:30:31,800
And he knew it before I did.

1288
01:30:34,679 --> 01:30:39,013
EDWARD:
<i>I'm deeply proud that this man...</i>

1289
01:30:39,183 --> 01:30:43,586
<i>... found it worth his while</i>
<i>to know me.</i>

1290
01:30:45,323 --> 01:30:47,257
<i>In the end...</i>

1291
01:30:47,425 --> 01:30:53,159
<i>... I think it's safe to say that we brought</i>
<i>some Joy to one another's lives.</i>

1292
01:30:53,498 --> 01:30:56,524
<i>So, one day, when...</i>

1293
01:30:57,235 --> 01:31:00,671
<i>... I go to some final resting place...</i>

1294
01:31:01,539 --> 01:31:06,033
<i>... if I happen to wake up</i>
<i>next to a certain wall with a gate...</i>

1295
01:31:06,210 --> 01:31:09,407
<i>... I hope that Carter's there...</i>

1296
01:31:09,580 --> 01:31:11,810
<i>... to vouch for me...</i>

1297
01:31:12,016 --> 01:31:15,008
<i>... and show me the ropes</i>
<i>on the other side.</i>

1298
01:31:21,626 --> 01:31:24,459
CARTER:
<i>Edward Perriman Cole died in May.</i>

1299
01:31:25,630 --> 01:31:28,428
<i>It was a Sunday, in the afternoon...</i>

1300
01:31:28,599 --> 01:31:31,966
<i>... and there wasn't a cloud in the sky.</i>

1301
01:31:32,136 --> 01:31:34,229
<i>He was 81 years old.</i>

1302
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:40,774
<i>Even now, I can't claim to understand</i>
<i>the measure of a life.</i>

1303
01:31:41,579 --> 01:31:44,139
<i>But I can tell you this:</i>

1304
01:31:44,749 --> 01:31:49,083
<i>I know that when he died,</i>
<i>his eyes were closed...</i>

1305
01:31:49,854 --> 01:31:52,414
<i>... and his heart was open.</i>

1306
01:31:53,858 --> 01:31:58,227
<i>And I'm pretty sure he was happy</i>
<i>with his final resting place...</i>

1307
01:31:58,996 --> 01:32:02,295
<i>... because he was buried</i>
<i>on the mountain...</i>

1308
01:32:03,301 --> 01:32:06,099
<i>... and that was against the law.</i>
