You do not go far enough,

I say wipe out Washington

What? And spoil three years
of good public relations?

I have the Americans believing
I am a nice guy.

Welcome home, Frank. Good work
in Beirut. We all heard what you did.

Thank you, Ed. I want to know one thing:

64
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,155
is it true what you
wrote me about Victoria?

65
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,917
I'm afraid so, Frank.
She just ran off with some guy.

They got married last week.

Then it's over. It's all over.
All of this is meaningless.

- Do you know anything about him?
- Not much.

a 50-50 chance of living,

- Ship... Boat...
- That's right. Nordberg. A boat.

we'll go sailing together,

[Whispering] Nordberg,
that's a pretty tall order.

He was such a good man, Frank.

He never wanted to hurt anyone.
Who would do such a thing?

It's hard to tell.

00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,402
Could be a roving gang of thugs,

a blackmailer, an angry husband,
a gay lover...

Frank, get a hold of yourself!

00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:45,129
A good cop, needlessly
cut down and ambushed

129

by some cowardly hoodlums.

- [Frank] You're right, Ed.

00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,717
A parachute not opening,
that's a way to die.

in the gears of a combine,

by a Laplander.

Don't you worry, Wilma,
your husband is going to be all right.

Don't you worry about anything.

00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:16,324
Just think positive.
Never let a doubt enter your mind.

140
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,989
He's right, Wilma, but I wouldn't wait
until the last minute

141
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,998
to fill out those organ donor cards.

[Wilma shrieks]

143

What I'm trying to say is,
as soon as Nordberg is better,

144
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,337
he's welcome back at Police Squad.

145
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,672
Unless he's a drooling vegetable,

146
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,758
- but I think that's only common sense.
- [Wilma shrieks]

147
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,682
Wilma, can you think of any reason

148
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,094
that Nordberg was
at the waterfront last night?

149
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,892
[Sobbing] No.

150
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:49,020
But I found this
at home in a drawer.

151
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,402
A photograph!

"I Luv You" out of Caracas.

153

A Panamanian ship.

154
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:02,658
When Nordberg said "I love you",
he was telling you the name of the ship!

155
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:05,828
I realize that... now.

156
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:09,749
- We'd better check this out.
- I want every available man on this.

157
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,541
I can't spare anybody, Frank.

158

[Car horns honk]

Due to the extraordinary efforts
of some of our civic leaders,

166
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:38,577
Queen Elizabeth has included
the city of Los Angeles

167
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,739
as one of the three cities she will
visit during her American tour.

additional security officers

169
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,707
for the police force
during the Queen's visit?

Protecting the safety of the Queen

is a task that is gladly accepted
by Police Squad.

For no matter how silly the idea
of having a queen might be to us,

as Americans we must be gracious
and considerate hosts.

He was shot six times.

Fortunately, the bullets
missed every vital organ,

until he was found.

So they were able to...

289
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:58,410
So they were able to get him
to the hospital in time?

290
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:02,452
Yes, he's in the intensive care ward
at Our Lady of the Worthless Miracle.

291
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:05,997
Well, this certainly comes
as a shock to me, Lieutenant.

292
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,165
But as you know,
I am not the kind of man

293

who takes this type of thing lightly.

294
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:11,502
And there is no room
in my organization

295

301
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,066
Acres of them.
As far as the eye could see.

302
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,573
But now, of course,
that land is able to generate

303
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:35,736
ten times the amount of profit
per square foot.

304
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:39,489
Are you all right, Lieutenant?

305
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,078
Here, let me get you some Kleenex.

...Been able to tell you anything?

309
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:56,507
Uh, well, of course, he hasn't been
able to tell us a thing so far,

310
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:59,551
but as soon as
he regains consciousness,

311
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:02,186
we'll see if he
can still play the guitar.

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,646
I beg your pardon?

313
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,228
Uh, I've taken up too much
of your time already.

314
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,519
I'd like to look at your
employment records now,

315
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,187
and speak to someone in Personnel.

316
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,606
- If you don't mind, of course.
- Of course.

317
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,734
Dominique, will you please
send in Ms. Spencer.

318
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:17,902
<i>[Dominique]
Yes, sir.</i>

319
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:21,322
As you know, I am quite busy
making last minute arrangements

320
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:22,991
for the royal visit,

321
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:26,707
but I'll have my assistant
provide you with anything you need.

322
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:29,588
You've been very cooperative.
I'll make a note of that in my report.

323
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:31,124
My pleasure.

324
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:39,174
Ah, Ms. Spencer, this is Lieutenant
Frank Drebin from Police Squad.

325
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:43,056
Hello... Mr. Drebin.

326
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,554
Hello.

327
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:53,153
[Grunts]

[thudding]

329
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:13,299
<i>[Frank] Her hair was the color
of gold in old paintings.</i>

330
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,465
<i>She had a full set of curves</i>

331
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:21,053
<i>and the kind of legs
you'd like to suck on for a day.</i>

332
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:26,433
<i>She was giving me a look
I could feel in my hip pocket.</i>

333
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:31,605
<i>Yep, this was starting
to get interesting.</i>

334
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,484
Nice beaver.

335
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,574
Thank you. I just had it stuffed.

336
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,454
Let me help you with that.

337
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,911
This should be
what you're looking for, Lieutenant.

338
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:53,172
The shipping and employment records
for Pier 32.

339
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,582
Thank you.

340
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,260
I've heard police work is dangerous.

341
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:00,763
It is, that's why I carry a big gun.

342
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,970
Aren't you afraid it might
go off accidentally?

343
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:05,476
I used to have that problem.

344
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:07,724
What did you do about it?

345
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:11,311
I just think about baseball.

346
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:16,312
That's a honey of an ankle-bracelet
you have there.

347
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,276
Did it slip down there again?

348
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:22,033
Yes, well...
I'll go through this as fast as I can

349
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,160
and get them back to you tomorrow.

350
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,948
That would be fine, but there's no rush.

351
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,912
I mean, whenever you're through.

352
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:33,204
Thank you. I wish there was
some way I could repay you.

353
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,168
How about dinner?
I know this little out-of-the-way place

354
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:37,550
that serves great Viking food.

355
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,715
That's quite
a tempting offer, Lieutenant,

356
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:43,222
but I'm afraid I'm gonna have to
get my rest this evening,

357
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,848
tomorrow being Arbor Day and all.

358
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:47,760
Of course. Perhaps some other time.

359
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:51,431
- How about a rain check?
- Well, let's just stick to dinner.

360
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:54,771
Thank you for your help, Ms. Spencer.

361
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,528
My pleasure.

362
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:02,191
- Well?
- Mr. Ludwig, you startled me!

363
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:04,326
I'm sorry, my dear.

364
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:07,489
I just wanted to know if you
got the lieutenant what he wanted?

365
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:09,783
Yes, I gave him copies
of the files for Pier 32.

366
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:12,372
Good. That's good.

367
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,631
He is an intriguing fellow, this
Lieutenant Drebin, don't you think?

368
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:21,465
[Scoffs] Well, I don't know.
I've only just met him.

369
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,425
He seems very nice.

370
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:26,716
Jane, I realize
this is an unusual request,

371
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:30,227
but if there is something illegal
going on in this company,

372
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:34,016
I need to know everything about it,
so we can root out any wrongdoers.

373
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,149
That's why I want you to...

374
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:40,654
...well, to get to know
Lieutenant Drebin a little better,

375
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,736
find out what he knows.

376
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,526
Oh, Mr. Ludwig, don't you think
this is best handled by the police?

377
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:49,072
We are letting
the police handle it, my dear!

378
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:51,741
But this company
needs to know the facts quickly,

379
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,251
before anything
gets into the newspapers.

380
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:58,790
Don't forget, I have a responsibility
to the stockholders.

381
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:02,756
Well... if you put it that way...

382
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,722
- Yes, I'll do my best.
- That's better.

383
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:12,265
[Inhales]
I'm sure you will.

when I returned to Police Squad.</i>

386
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,574
<i>I figured I'd stop by
and see what the lab boys</i>

387
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:27,827
<i>had come up with
on Nordberg's jacket,</i>

00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,862
<i>the one they'd found on the docks.</i>

<i>You can tell a lot from fiber samples
if they aren't too wet.</i>

390
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:37,253
<i>And I was hoping in this case
we wouldn't come up dry...</i>

391
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:38,458
Hey, look out!

392

[People screaming]

00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:42,458
Police! Halt!

[Screaming continues]

395
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,260
Anybody catch the license plate?

396
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,726
Anybody get a look at the driver?

[Woman screaming]
Get out of the way!

398
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:04,571
Take the names of everybody here
for questioning.

399
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:08,613
I've got to get... inside.

400

[Crowd clamoring]

401
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,959
Hi, Ed, Ted. You got
those fiber samples yet?

402
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,667
- Sh-sh! We got some action out here.
- What's happening?

403
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:23,332
[Ted] We're testing
that new anti-graffiti wall.

404
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,167
[Ed] It looks like we've got customers.

405
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:27,336
It's set to react when the spray
hits the sensors.

406
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:29,346
[Chattering]

[Frank] You've done it again. Mazel tov!

409
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:37,521
Good work, Ted.
What will you lab boys think of next?

410
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,602
Now that you mention it,

411
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:41,938
here's something
we developed only yesterday.

412
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:45,362
To the casual observer,
an ordinary shoe.

413
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:49,367
But in actuality...
it makes quite a handy weapon.

414
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:52,699
And everything a cop
in the field would need.

415
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,863
We call it the Swiss Army shoe.

416
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,998
That's great, Ted.
What about the fiber samples?

417
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:59,626
Uh, let me just show you
one more thing, Frank.

418
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:01,958
You see these cufflinks I'm wearing?

419
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,714
They're not just cufflinks.

420
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,796
Each one fires a single pin-sized dart,

421
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,586
that knocks out your victim
for a few minutes,

422
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:09,969
but does no permanent damage.

423
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:12,348
- Here, let me demonstrate on Ed.
- Huh?

424
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:17,140
[Groans]
Ted! Why?

425
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,891
Don't worry.
He'll be up and around in no time.

426
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,604
Why don't you take a pair, Frank?

427
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,486
Well, actually, I could use
another pair of cufflinks.

428
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,067
Good, I think you'll like them.

429
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,949
- You want this, chief?
- Yes, thank you, Al.

430
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:33,076
There's something
on the side of your mouth, Al.

431
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:36,830
No, no, the other side.

432
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:40,835
As you requested, Frank, we took some
fiber samples from Nordberg's jacket.

433
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:43,545
I'm afraid it doesn't look good.

434
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,298
- What do you mean?
- Take a look for yourself.

435
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:53,051
- I can't see anything.
- Use your open eye, Frank.

436
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,846
Oh, yeah, I can see it now.

437
00:27:57,009 --> 00:28:00,479
At first glance, it would appear
to be the normal cotton fibers.

438
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,765
When we focused in closer,
we discovered a fine, white powder.

439
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,399
- [Clicking]
- [glass breaking]

440
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:07,232
We tested it. Pure heroin.

441
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:10,398
How well do you know Nordberg?

442
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:13,943
We were partners for nine years
and he's my best friend.

443
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:17,613
I know, Frank, but we can't allow
personal feelings to get in the way.

444
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,031
Are you saying that Nordberg is...?

445
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:22,293
I'm telling you that the Queen
arrives here the day after tomorrow.

446
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:25,455
If the press should pick this up,
with Nordberg still part of the force,

447
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,124
it could be embarrassing
to the police and the city.

448
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,669
I'm sorry, Frank. I'm giving you
24 hours to clear Nordberg.

449
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:45,064
- Mr. Ludwig?
- Yes?

450
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:49,445
- A Mr. Pahpshmir is here.
- Show him in.

451
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,612
Is there something wrong, Mr. Ludwig?

452
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,828
No, no, it's nothing.

453
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:05,335
- Then may we get down to business?
- Certainly. Please have a seat.

454
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:09,377
I can carry out your request.

455
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:13,919
- My price is 20 million dollars.
- Your price is not a problem.

456
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:18,633
But there is concern
on the part of those I represent,

457
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,177
that you would be able to...

458
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,766
...complete so difficult a task.

459
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,858
Tell me, Mr. Pahpshmir,

460
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:32,112
in all the world,
who is the most effective assassin?

461
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:37,076
Well, I would think anyone
who manages to conceal

462
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:38,781
his identity as an assassin.

463
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:44,371
Yes, but there is
an even more ideal assassin.

464
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:49,247

778
00:54:16,837 --> 00:54:18,680
Ethel!

All right, anyone else here
seeing his wife?

781
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:26,977
That's all right. That's OK, Frank.
Let's get in the hall.

782
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:39,318
Are you enjoying yourself, my dear?

783
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:41,908
Oh, Mr. Ludwig,
I'm so excited to be here.

784
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:44,038
I really do appreciate your inviting me.

785
00:54:44,198 --> 00:54:46,371
The pleasure is all mine, my dear.

786
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:50,083
- And perhaps afterwards we can...

- Frank!

788
00:54:52,164 --> 00:54:55,213
You're both right.
Surprised to see me, Mr. Ludwig?

789
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:58,219
This is not the time
or place to talk.

790
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:00,881
It's way past the time we talked.

791
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:04,097
The gloves are off,
I'm playing hardball, Ludwig.

792
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:07,854
It's fourth and fifteen, and
you're looking at a full court press.

793
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:11,893
Mr. Drebin!
If you have evidence, then use it.

794
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:15,939
If not, I am warning you,
get off my back!

795
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:18,732
Or I promise you,
it will cost you dearly.

796

Frank, what's wrong?

797
00:55:23,654 --> 00:55:25,622
A lot of things, sweetie-pie.

798
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:28,785
A little meeting that turned into
a peek-a-boo session with bullets,

799
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:30,749
all set up by someone who's been
playing me like a violin

800
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:32,834
at the annual Saps Convention.

801
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,998
Funny face, I don't know
what you're talking about.

802
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:39,090
My stockyard meeting, butter wings.
Or don't you remember setting that up?

803
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:42,382
But Mr. Ludwig said you called
the meeting off! Believe me, I...

804
00:55:42,548 --> 00:55:44,846
Hum me another one, shnookie lumps!

805
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,885
Frank, it's the truth!

806
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:49,771
It's true what they say:
cops and women don't mix.

807
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:51,853
Like eating a spoonful of Drano.

808
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:55,019
Sure, it'll clean you out,
but it'll leave you hollow inside.

809
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:57,897
Too bad, sugar puff.

810
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:00,824
We could have been something.

811
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:04,612
I was only doing
what I was told to do!

That only makes things easier, princess.

815

To think I trusted you!
I made a big mistake.

816
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:18,255
- Here, you can take this back.
- Whose is that?

817
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,212
- Doesn't matter.
- [man] Hey, watch it!

Take care of yourself, baby.

You're laying on top of the Queen

I even went by your place.

- I was out walking. All night.

Frank, you gotta listen to me!
I have important information for you.

Please believe me. Vincent Ludwig and I,
there was never anything between us.

- What about you?

- Settle down. Take it easy.

You were right all along, Frank.

Ludwig is planning to have someone
assassinate the Queen!

- Where?
- At the baseball game.

863
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:59,415
The Queen will be there this afternoon
as a guest of Ludwig.

I'm supposed to be with him.

Are you telling us that Vincent Ludwig

866
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:05,125
is going to just shoot the Queen
in front of 60,000 fans?

867
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:07,886
No, he said a player's gonna do it,
during the 7th-inning stretch.

868
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:10,844

- I'd better get down there right away.

- I'll go with you.
- No, it's best you stay with Ludwig.

That way we won't
arouse any suspicion.

into enough trouble already.

I don't want you to risk this for me.
I'll go alone.

No! This is gonna get you
back on the force, Frank.

Two can play at that game!

01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:47,505
- You killed him!
- No, no, he's just stunned.

1091
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:49,415
He'll be all right
in a couple of minutes.

Frank... It's horrible!

01:18:27,286 --> 01:18:30,415
- It's so horrible!
- I know, Ed.

1100

I must kill... Frank Drebin.

I must kill Frank Drebin.

1104

No, no, don't shoot!

1105
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:04,744
Jane... it's me...

1106
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:08,335
<i>Funny face.</i>

1107
01:19:08,494 --> 01:19:12,249
- <i>[Jane] I must kill Frank Drebin.</i>
- [man] Hey, look! Up there!

1108
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:14,462
<i>[Frank] You love Frank Drebin.</i>

1109
01:19:14,625 --> 01:19:16,969
<i>And Frank Drebin loves you.</i>

1110
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:19,421
<i>Jane, listen to me.</i>

1111
01:19:20,673 --> 01:19:22,266
<i>If you don't love me,
you might as well pull that trigger,</i>

1112
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:27,225
because without you,
I wouldn't want to live anyway.

1113
01:19:29,056 --> 01:19:30,774
I've finally found
someone I can love...

1114
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:35,946
...a good, clean love...
without utensils.

1115
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:39,985
I must kill Frank Drebin.

1116
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:42,824
It's a topsy-turvy world, Jane,

1117
01:19:42,987 --> 01:19:46,412
and maybe the problems of two people
don't amount to a hill of beans,

1118
01:19:46,573 --> 01:19:50,828
but this is our hill
and these are our beans.

1119
01:19:52,413 --> 01:19:55,667
Jane, since I met you, I notice
things I never knew were there before,

1120
01:19:55,833 --> 01:20:00,680
<i>birds singing, dew glistening
on a newly-formed leaf...</i>

<i>...stoplights...</i>

1122
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:06,685
- I must kill...
- Jane, this morning...

1123
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:10,063
I bought something for you.

1124
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:12,725
It's not very much...

1125
01:20:13,559 --> 01:20:16,233
...but pretty good
for an honest policeman's salary.

1126
01:20:17,938 --> 01:20:19,861
It's an engagement ring.

1127
01:20:20,024 --> 01:20:21,992
I would have given it to you earlier,

1128
01:20:22,151 --> 01:20:25,371
<i>but I wanted to wait
until we were alone.</i>

1129
01:20:29,575 --> 01:20:32,579
- I...
- I love you, Jane.

1130
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:39,843
Oh, Frank!

1131
01:20:52,264 --> 01:20:54,517
I'm sorry!

1132
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:08,364
I'm sorry I yelled at you
yesterday, I really am.

1133
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:12,869
Drebin!

1134
01:21:13,035 --> 01:21:15,709
I was wrong about you.

1135
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:19,921
This city, and I guess the whole world,
owes you a debt of gratitude.

1136
01:21:20,084 --> 01:21:21,131
Thank you, Mayor.

1137
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:25,298
And Monday morning
we want you back at Police Squad...

1138
01:21:25,464 --> 01:21:27,592
...with a promotion
to captain, of course.

1139
01:21:27,758 --> 01:21:29,977
- Mayor...
- But don't thank me.

1140
01:21:30,928 --> 01:21:33,477
There's someone else
here who wants to thank you.

1141
01:21:33,639 --> 01:21:35,892
- Nordberg!
- Hiya, buddy!

1142
01:21:36,058 --> 01:21:38,857
The doc says I should be on my feet
and as good as new in a week!

1143
01:21:39,019 --> 01:21:42,990
- And back on the force!
- Nordberg, that's wonderful!

1144
01:21:43,148 --> 01:21:44,149
Whoa!

1145
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:47,320
Oh, Frank! Everyone should
have a friend like you!

1146
