1
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,999
I was bruised and battered
I couldn't tell what I felt

2
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:47,899
I was unrecognizable to myself

3
00:00:48,701 --> 00:00:51,601
Saw my reflection in a window

4
00:00:51,501 --> 00:00:53,901
And didn't know my own face

5
00:00:53,901 --> 00:00:56,902
So, brother, I'm gonna leave

6
00:00:56,802 --> 00:01:02,103
Wastin' away on the streets
of Philadelphia

7
00:01:18,205 --> 00:01:19,505
This one?

8
00:01:19,404 --> 00:01:23,606
I walked the avenue
till my legs felt like stone

9
00:01:23,506 --> 00:01:27,207
I heard voices of friends
vanished and gone

10
00:01:28,306 --> 00:01:33,006
At night I hear the blood
in my veins

11
00:01:33,908 --> 00:01:37,609
Just as black and whispery
as the rain

12
00:01:37,508 --> 00:01:40,709
On the streets of Philadelphia

13
00:01:59,613 --> 00:02:02,813
Ain't no angel gonna greet me

14
00:02:03,612 --> 00:02:07,712
It's just you and I
my friend

15
00:02:09,313 --> 00:02:12,714
And my clothes don't fit me no more

16
00:02:12,513 --> 00:02:18,114
I walked a thousand miles
just to slip this skin

17
00:02:21,615 --> 00:02:25,215
Night has fallen
I'm lyin' awake

18
00:02:25,116 --> 00:02:29,216
I can feel myself fadin' away

19
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:34,617
So, will you receive me, brother
with your faithless kiss

20
00:02:34,518 --> 00:02:38,918
Or will we leave each other
alone like this

21
00:02:38,817 --> 00:02:42,418
On the streets of Philadelphia

22
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:26,826
This "pestilent dust"counselor refers
to has appeared on only three occasions.

23
00:03:26,726 --> 00:03:30,726
Each time it was tested,
and the results: Limestone.

24
00:03:30,527 --> 00:03:32,627
It's messy, but innocuous.

25
00:03:35,727 --> 00:03:38,827
- "Innocuous"?
- Defined by Webster's as harmless.

26
00:03:38,828 --> 00:03:42,329
I know what it means.
May I? Thank you.

27
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:43,629
Your Honor...

28
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,130
imagine how the children in this
neighborhood are being made to feel.

29
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,130
The constant pounding of construction
ringing in their ears...

30
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:58,530
as this skyscraper...
a tribute to mankind's greed...

31
00:03:58,432 --> 00:04:02,532
grows daily, casting an ominous shadow
over their lives...

32
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:05,932
filling them with dread even as
they are surrounded by this toxic dust.

33
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:09,233
Your Honor, Kendall Construction...

34
00:04:09,133 --> 00:04:12,834
builds neighborhoods,
it doesn't destroy them.

35
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:15,833
Granting a restraining order against
this construction site will...

36
00:04:15,834 --> 00:04:18,534
throw 753 Philadelphians
out of work...

37
00:04:18,534 --> 00:04:22,634
and lend validation to this contemptible
and groundless nuisance suit.

38
00:04:22,535 --> 00:04:24,636
It's an example
of the rapacious litigation...

39
00:04:24,536 --> 00:04:27,536
that today is tearing
at the very fabric of our society.

40
00:04:27,436 --> 00:04:30,136
Let's not go off the deep end,
gentlemen.

41
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:34,237
You've made an articulate and
compelling presentation, Mr. Miller...

42
00:04:34,137 --> 00:04:36,437
but I don't believe
you've proven irreparable harm.

43
00:04:36,337 --> 00:04:37,637
Not yet, Your Honor.

44
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,440
Proper use of trade name without...

45
00:04:55,942 --> 00:04:58,041
- Is that you?
- Yeah, that's me.

46
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,542
Miller.

47
00:04:59,542 --> 00:05:01,541
Yes. Hello, Iris.

48
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:04,041
Client of yours?

49
00:05:03,942 --> 00:05:06,842
Funny. Hold on, Iris.
Excuse me, sir?

50
00:05:35,348 --> 00:05:38,347
My sons and I went
to a restaurant the other day.

51
00:05:38,248 --> 00:05:40,048
We ordered coffee.

52
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:41,548
The waiter goes...

53
00:05:41,548 --> 00:05:44,648
"Would you like sugar
or Sweet 'n' Low?"

54
00:05:45,548 --> 00:05:48,648
I said,
"Do I look like I should be on a diet?"

55
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:51,950
Oh, God,
sometimes I just feel so sorry...

56
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,950
- Andy.
- Hi, Doc.

57
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,850
Your blood work came back this morning.

58
00:05:56,751 --> 00:05:58,851
I'm gonna come back in a few minutes
and talk to you about it.

59
00:05:58,952 --> 00:06:01,251
- All right?
- I'll be right here.

60
00:06:01,151 --> 00:06:02,752
Good.

61
00:06:02,752 --> 00:06:04,452
How you doin' today, Jackie?

62
00:06:04,453 --> 00:06:07,052
Hi. How're you feeling?

63
00:06:07,052 --> 00:06:09,052
- Feelin' pretty good.
- Great.

64
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:13,153
Make a fist for me?
Once more.

65
00:06:13,054 --> 00:06:16,653
Gonna have to start lookin' for veins
in your feet, sweetheart.

66
00:06:16,455 --> 00:06:19,453
- Patience, Tyrone.
- Okay.

67
00:06:22,955 --> 00:06:25,155
Once more.

68
00:06:42,358 --> 00:06:45,058
- How are the Magruder accounts?
- We'll close in a couple weeks.

69
00:06:45,058 --> 00:06:46,958
Terrific job on the Kendall situation.

70
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:49,160
- Top-notch, Mr. Beckett.
- Thanks, Kenneth, Robert.

71
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,460
- Hi, Mr. Beckett.
- Hi, Rose.

72
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:55,059
Anthea, just the paralegal
extraordinaire I was hoping to see.

73
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,961
I know what that means.
The answer is no.

74
00:06:56,961 --> 00:06:59,962
- I'm talkin' dinner at Felicia's.
- I've got a class.

75
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:03,161
I've got some pretty compelling briefs
that need proofing.

76
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,961
You can exploit somebody else.

77
00:07:05,563 --> 00:07:08,562
- Since you've asked...
- Your exam.

78
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:10,663
Thank you. Ninety-eight.

79
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:14,663
Ninety-eight? Congratulations.

80
00:07:14,463 --> 00:07:16,863
I have to pick up Amy, but I want
to talk to you about that Hansen thing.

81
00:07:16,763 --> 00:07:20,363
Give me a call. I'll be here. Tell Amy
I loved her painting. It's on my wall.

82
00:07:20,364 --> 00:07:22,865
Hi, Andrew. Conference call's up.
The roll call just started.

83
00:07:22,865 --> 00:07:25,965
Now, this is a settlement agreement.
The red-line copy's on your desk.

84
00:07:25,865 --> 00:07:29,265
- You need me in there?
- No. It's 6:30. Go home.

85
00:07:32,867 --> 00:07:34,867
- Hello?
- Hey, Mom!

86
00:07:34,967 --> 00:07:38,167
Oh, hi, darling.
What a wonderful surprise. How are you?

87
00:07:38,068 --> 00:07:39,768
Good.

88
00:07:39,768 --> 00:07:41,667
Well, what does Dr. Gillman say?

89
00:07:41,768 --> 00:07:45,768
Dr. Gillman says I am fine.
My blood work is excellent.

90
00:07:45,568 --> 00:07:47,668
She says my T-cells are steady.

91
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:50,169
Honey, how 'bout your platelets?
What did she say?

92
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:52,268
Oh, even my platelets look good.

93
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:53,669
Great.

94
00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:55,969
Mom, more importantly,
how are you?

95
00:07:57,171 --> 00:07:58,370
Mom?

96
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,571
I'm fine.

97
00:08:01,571 --> 00:08:03,870
- And Dad?
- Dad is fine.

98
00:08:03,871 --> 00:08:05,373
And what are you doin'?

99
00:08:24,774 --> 00:08:26,275
Okay.

100
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:31,675
"Action for the wrongful interference
with prospective economic relations."

101
00:08:31,576 --> 00:08:32,877
Okay.

102
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,878
Am I interrupting you?

103
00:08:40,878 --> 00:08:43,078
In a word, Bob...

104
00:08:43,078 --> 00:08:45,478
Charles wants to see you upstairs.

105
00:08:46,978 --> 00:08:49,079
I was just about to take a break.

106
00:08:49,778 --> 00:08:52,379
- I'm not underdressed for this?
- No, you're not.

107
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:55,278
Charles, Andy has expressed
a keen interest...

108
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,880
in Highline, Inc. V. Sander Systems.

109
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,680
Isn't that right, Andy?

110
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,080
The fate of the participants
interests me. Yes, sir.

111
00:09:04,881 --> 00:09:06,881
It's an antitrust action.

112
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:11,882
It is, and it isn't, Charles.

113
00:09:11,782 --> 00:09:16,083
Sander Systems copies
Highline's spreadsheet program.

114
00:09:15,883 --> 00:09:18,183
For me...

115
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:22,783
the legal principle involved is
copyright infringement.

116
00:09:24,084 --> 00:09:25,984
Well, tell me this, Andy.

117
00:09:25,984 --> 00:09:30,085
Which side of this conflict would you
wish to see emerge victorious?

118
00:09:29,886 --> 00:09:33,185
And don't allow my close personal
relationship with Bill Wright...

119
00:09:33,185 --> 00:09:36,986
Sander Systems' C.E.O. To influence
your answer in any way.

120
00:09:38,987 --> 00:09:41,487
Well, I'd like to see Highline
win this one.

121
00:09:41,387 --> 00:09:43,388
Oh! Why, Beckett?

122
00:09:45,988 --> 00:09:48,088
If Sanders Systems wins...

123
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:52,488
an energetic,
young company is destroyed.

124
00:09:52,388 --> 00:09:56,889
The laws for antitrust and copyright
were enacted to prevent exactly...

125
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:00,091
the kind of bullshit
that Sander Systems is trying to pull.

126
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,690
- Andy, you know who reps Highline?
- Rodney Bailey.

127
00:10:02,592 --> 00:10:04,091
Oh, I object!

128
00:10:06,191 --> 00:10:10,691
Rodney Bailey, who couldn't find his way
around copyright law with a map.

129
00:10:14,392 --> 00:10:18,994
Well, apparently the fellas
at Highline agree with you, Andy.

130
00:10:18,793 --> 00:10:24,193
Which explains why, as of 9:03
this evening, right after dessert...

131
00:10:24,095 --> 00:10:29,895
Highline is now represented by Wyant,
Wheeler, Hellerman, Tetlow and Brown.

132
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,495
Outstanding.

133
00:10:32,696 --> 00:10:34,595
And more specifically...

134
00:10:34,496 --> 00:10:38,995
Senior Associate Andrew Beckett.

135
00:10:38,897 --> 00:10:41,796
- Bravo!
- Yes!

136
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,499
- Come on!
- Congratulations.

137
00:10:50,398 --> 00:10:54,898
- Thank you, Robert.
- We've got to get on this right away.

138
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:57,000
Statute of limitations, yeah.
I'm right on it.

139
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,500
- Exactly.
- We have ten days to file.

140
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,200
Tokyo on line four, Bob.

141
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,800
Walter, thank you.

142
00:11:05,501 --> 00:11:07,501
- Kenneth, thank you.
- You bet, Andy. Congratulations.

143
00:11:07,602 --> 00:11:10,501
- Thanks. I'm overwhelmed.
- What's that on your forehead, pal?

144
00:11:10,402 --> 00:11:12,301
What? Where?

145
00:11:13,603 --> 00:11:15,302
That... right there on your forehead.

146
00:11:16,203 --> 00:11:18,502
Oh, I got whacked in the head
with a racket ball.

147
00:11:19,803 --> 00:11:21,204
Excuse me.

148
00:11:26,004 --> 00:11:27,504
Charles, I...

149
00:11:28,705 --> 00:11:33,505
I sincerely appreciate
your faith in my abilities.

150
00:11:33,405 --> 00:11:37,906
Faith, Andy, is the belief in something
for which we have no evidence.

151
00:11:37,807 --> 00:11:41,306
It does not apply to this situation.

152
00:11:44,006 --> 00:11:45,607
Well, go home.

153
00:11:45,608 --> 00:11:47,508
Oh, no! Go back to work.

154
00:11:57,909 --> 00:11:59,510
Thank you, Charles.

155
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:01,109
No sweat, buddy.

156
00:12:07,411 --> 00:12:11,311
The committee meeting we're gonna have
next week... a bunch of staff members...

157
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:30,515
Tommy, how are ya?

158
00:13:00,619 --> 00:13:03,219
The Highline complaint is
right there on my desk, Shelby.

159
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,720
It's all set to go,
so make sure Jamey is on top of it.

160
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,020
Sure. You got it.
Anything else?

161
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:13,321
No, that's it. I'm gonna be working
out of the house this afternoon...

162
00:13:13,122 --> 00:13:15,022
so, thanks a lot.

163
00:13:15,022 --> 00:13:17,122
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

164
00:13:17,021 --> 00:13:22,222
Okay. Now, you're gonna want to apply
this foundation as evenly as you can.

165
00:13:23,323 --> 00:13:25,823
'Cause you don't want it to look
like you threw it on with a spoon.

166
00:13:25,823 --> 00:13:28,323
- Yeah.
- So, over here, you try this.

167
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,524
- I got it.
- Right there.

168
00:13:30,524 --> 00:13:34,025
Chandra, you don't think this is
just a little too orange for me?

169
00:13:33,925 --> 00:13:38,824
Well, okay, it's Tahitian Bronze.
That works best on these lesions.

170
00:13:38,726 --> 00:13:42,226
Think of it as the
"I just got back from Aruba" look.

171
00:13:42,126 --> 00:13:44,526
Exactly. I've called in sick
for four days...

172
00:13:44,527 --> 00:13:48,027
and now they're gonna think
I was taking a cruise.

173
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,728
- Fax.
- Oh, thank you, Bruno.

174
00:13:51,528 --> 00:13:53,728
Okay, we can try this light Egypt...

175
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:55,929
What?

176
00:14:00,729 --> 00:14:01,930
Excuse me.

177
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,031
Just like my cousin, Fredo.

178
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,132
Does anybody want a bagel?

179
00:14:34,434 --> 00:14:36,334
You okay, Andy?

180
00:14:39,235 --> 00:14:42,736
I think I need to go
to the hospital.

181
00:14:55,638 --> 00:14:57,038
Watch out!

182
00:15:09,841 --> 00:15:12,541
Hello, hello.
Oh, it's all right.

183
00:15:13,242 --> 00:15:15,242
It's all right.

184
00:15:15,242 --> 00:15:17,241
- I'm gettin' out of here, all right?
- Okay.

185
00:15:17,241 --> 00:15:19,441
I'll talk to you later.
Oh, one more.

186
00:15:19,442 --> 00:15:21,743
Thank you for driving
like a bat out of hell.

187
00:15:21,743 --> 00:15:24,643
- Take it easy, all right?
- Dr. Gillman is out of her office.

188
00:15:24,643 --> 00:15:27,443
I told her to take a day off, and she
took a day off. Can you believe that?

189
00:15:27,444 --> 00:15:29,544
They took blood?
A specimen or something?

190
00:15:29,544 --> 00:15:33,544
Blood, yes. A specimen, I'm empty.
Did you find someone to take your class?

191
00:15:33,444 --> 00:15:35,145
Don't worry about it.
Let me see.

192
00:15:35,045 --> 00:15:38,346
Oh, you got a fever, baby.

193
00:15:39,246 --> 00:15:41,646
Oh, there's my guy.
Excuse me.

194
00:15:41,646 --> 00:15:43,446
Doctor? Hello, hi.

195
00:15:43,447 --> 00:15:44,946
Just one second.

196
00:15:46,147 --> 00:15:49,247
I came that close to not making it
to the bathroom again.

197
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:52,046
- I almost lost it in front of everyone.
- So what?

198
00:15:52,047 --> 00:15:55,448
- It's nothing to be ashamed of.
- I'm not ashamed, it's just...

199
00:15:56,448 --> 00:15:58,749
- What about my blood work?
- We're waiting.

200
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:02,749
Meanwhile, I want to prep you
for a colonoscopy, take a look inside.

201
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,950
- It sounds delightful.
- Wait a minute.

202
00:16:09,951 --> 00:16:11,751
Why do you need to do this?

203
00:16:11,851 --> 00:16:15,051
- Who are you?
- Who are you, Dr...

204
00:16:14,951 --> 00:16:17,051
- This is my partner.
- Yeah?

205
00:16:18,552 --> 00:16:21,053
He keeps the records of all my hospital
visits. It's nothing personal.

206
00:16:21,053 --> 00:16:23,753
Oh, I'm Dr. Klenstein.

207
00:16:23,652 --> 00:16:26,653
Listen, you're right. A colonoscopy
is not a pleasant procedure.

208
00:16:26,554 --> 00:16:30,853
But if the K.S. Is causing the diarrhea,
we've got to know about that right away.

209
00:16:30,654 --> 00:16:33,854
No, but it could be parasites,
an infection. I mean...

210
00:16:33,854 --> 00:16:36,254
Reaction to the A.Z.T.

211
00:16:36,255 --> 00:16:38,555
All these are possibilities,
but we've got to go forward...

212
00:16:38,555 --> 00:16:41,455
Listen to me. He's not going through
some painful procedure...

213
00:16:41,355 --> 00:16:44,055
until we cancel out everything else,
understand?

214
00:16:44,056 --> 00:16:46,357
- I'm trying to help your partner, okay?
- Okay.

215
00:16:46,257 --> 00:16:48,757
- You're not immediate family.
- I'm not?

216
00:16:48,657 --> 00:16:50,857
- I could have you removed from the E.R.
- Really?

217
00:16:50,756 --> 00:16:53,856
Look, he's upset. He's sorry.

218
00:16:53,758 --> 00:16:55,958
No. Don't apologize for me, okay?

219
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:59,058
Okay. He's not sorry.
Let's do this.

220
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,358
Let's find out
what the blood work tells us.

221
00:17:01,359 --> 00:17:05,560
I'll try to give you a specimen.
Some hospital food may help me along.

222
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,659
Then we might hear from Dr. Gillman.
We can start from there, okay?

223
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,661
- Everybody happy? All right?
- Okay.

224
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,961
- I'll see the lab about the blood work.
- Thank you, Doctor.

225
00:17:14,961 --> 00:17:16,461
I'm sorry.

226
00:17:18,963 --> 00:17:21,362
That's the third time
the office has beeped me.

227
00:17:21,263 --> 00:17:23,362
- I better go.
- "Klenstein"?

228
00:17:23,262 --> 00:17:27,761
I gotta go give them a call.
Now, I want you to sit down and relax.

229
00:17:27,563 --> 00:17:29,363
- I am relaxed.
- Oh, good.

230
00:17:29,363 --> 00:17:31,463
Is there a phone around,
somewhere nearby?

231
00:17:31,363 --> 00:17:33,664
- Down the hall.
- Thank you.

232
00:17:33,763 --> 00:17:37,464
If you or someone you know has been
injured through the fault of others...

233
00:17:37,365 --> 00:17:39,565
you may be entitled
to a cash settlement...

234
00:17:39,565 --> 00:17:42,065
or money damages
for your pain and suffering.

235
00:17:42,065 --> 00:17:43,965
- Good Lord.
- I'm attorneyJoseph Miller.

236
00:17:43,966 --> 00:17:45,566
At McCreedy and...

237
00:17:45,466 --> 00:17:46,766
Mr. Beckett's office.

238
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:50,666
Shelby, it's me.
Jamey's been beepin' me.

239
00:17:50,467 --> 00:17:52,066
I'm so glad you called, Andrew.

240
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:56,067
Listen, I just want you to know we have
a minor catastrophe in the making here.

241
00:17:55,968 --> 00:17:59,267
It's about that Highline complaint.
Jamey is going absolutely ballistic.

242
00:17:59,267 --> 00:18:01,868
All right. Calm down.
Put him on.

243
00:18:01,769 --> 00:18:03,769
All right. One second.

244
00:18:03,869 --> 00:18:07,170
Andy, this is a disaster! We can't find
the revisions on the Highline complaint.

245
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:09,570
Wait, wait. Slow down.

246
00:18:09,571 --> 00:18:13,471
I told them you were working at home,
and it would be here this morning.

247
00:18:13,371 --> 00:18:16,571
No. I brought it into the office
last night.

248
00:18:16,371 --> 00:18:20,771
I was there till 3:00 a.m. There should
be a copy with corrections on my desk.

249
00:18:20,572 --> 00:18:24,172
I'm telling you it's not here, Andy.
Shelby can't find it either.

250
00:18:24,172 --> 00:18:27,272
All right.
The hard disk on my computer.

251
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:30,973
Print it up on the double and run it
through word processing yourself.

252
00:18:30,873 --> 00:18:35,173
- Okay. What did you file it under?
- H- L-1.

253
00:18:34,975 --> 00:18:38,675
Jamey, I don't have to tell you we are
up against the statute of limitations...

254
00:18:38,675 --> 00:18:40,675
and it runs out in...

255
00:18:40,575 --> 00:18:43,275
in 75 minutes?

256
00:18:46,775 --> 00:18:49,776
- It's not here, Andy.
- Not there? I'm on my way.

257
00:18:53,577 --> 00:18:56,878
Every problem has a solution.

258
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,479
Aw, it's coming.
Yeah, baby, it's coming!

259
00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:13,781
It's a girl.

260
00:19:13,781 --> 00:19:15,080
Oh, my God.

261
00:19:18,582 --> 00:19:21,982
- Take a picture, Joe.
- I'm trying. I can't get the film in.

262
00:19:21,882 --> 00:19:25,481
Oh, my God.
Baby? Help me, baby.

263
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,483
Aw, look at her.

264
00:19:31,383 --> 00:19:33,983
- That little, sweet little...
- Get a picture before she gets too old.

265
00:19:36,484 --> 00:19:39,784
She's perfect, Lisa.
Long hair.

266
00:19:40,785 --> 00:19:42,885
Go down to Famous Fourth Street Deli,
and get a pound of Nova...

267
00:19:42,886 --> 00:19:45,385
No... Scotch salmon.
She likes that.

268
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:47,986
Yeah. Some onion rolls, bagels...
Here, give me a call.

269
00:19:49,186 --> 00:19:51,886
- Nice champagne.
- You're that TV guy.

270
00:19:51,787 --> 00:19:53,887
I don't care how much it costs.
Get some nice Dom Perignon.

271
00:19:53,887 --> 00:19:55,687
- Thanks.
- How much?

272
00:19:55,687 --> 00:19:58,587
A hundred dollars? Don't get
Dom Perignon. Get a nice Californian.

273
00:19:58,587 --> 00:20:01,588
Dom Perignon's too much. Get it all
over here, because she's starving.

274
00:20:01,488 --> 00:20:04,988
No, Iris, not the baby.
Lisa is starving.

275
00:20:04,888 --> 00:20:08,289
Yeah, Lisa.
Iris, listen.

276
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,590
- Anybody call?
- An Andrew Beckett called.

277
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:13,090
Beckett? Who's Andrew Beckett?

278
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,990
There he is! Joseph!

279
00:20:52,997 --> 00:20:57,996
The entire street is clear, except for
one small area under construction:

280
00:20:57,897 --> 00:21:00,697
This huge hole that is
clearly marked and blocked off.

281
00:21:00,698 --> 00:21:04,398
- Yes.
- You decide to cross at this spot.

282
00:21:04,298 --> 00:21:08,099
You fall into the hole. Now you want
to sue the city for negligence, right?

283
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,399
Yes. Do I have a case?

284
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:14,499
- Yes. Of course you've got a case.
- Great.

285
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:16,500
- Go with my assistant Iris.
- All right.

286
00:21:16,501 --> 00:21:19,600
She'll have you fill out some forms,
tell you about our fee arrangement.

287
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,001
Of course, you know we take no cash
unless we get cash justice for you.

288
00:21:23,001 --> 00:21:25,601
How's your back? You got any
lower back pain, dizziness, nightmares?

289
00:21:25,502 --> 00:21:27,602
Funny you should mention that.
I been having...

290
00:21:27,602 --> 00:21:31,202
Iris will take good care of you.
Iris, you take good care of Mr. Finley.

291
00:21:31,102 --> 00:21:33,702
- I will. Mr. Beckett's here.
- Hey, thanks a lot.

292
00:21:33,703 --> 00:21:36,703
Take care. Mr. Beckett?

293
00:21:39,704 --> 00:21:41,503
Mr. Beckett, come in.

294
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,705
It's good to see you again,
Counselor.

295
00:21:48,705 --> 00:21:52,505
Judge Tate. Kendall Construction.

296
00:21:52,506 --> 00:21:54,906
"Innocuous."

297
00:21:54,906 --> 00:21:56,807
How are you?
What happened to your face?

298
00:21:57,407 --> 00:21:58,907
I have AIDS.

299
00:22:01,407 --> 00:22:03,107
I'm sorry. I, uh...

300
00:22:09,109 --> 00:22:11,110
- Can I sit down?
- Yeah.

301
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,909
Thank you.

302
00:22:21,511 --> 00:22:22,910
Oh, look at this.

303
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,111
You have a new baby.

304
00:22:28,612 --> 00:22:30,612
Yeah.
I got a little baby girl.

305
00:22:34,613 --> 00:22:37,514
"It's a girl."
Congratulations.

306
00:22:39,614 --> 00:22:41,513
Yeah. One week old.

307
00:22:41,514 --> 00:22:43,615
Kids are great.

308
00:22:44,214 --> 00:22:48,014
Yeah. Thank you, Beckett.
I'm real excited about it. Listen, I...

309
00:22:50,415 --> 00:22:52,516
What can I do for you?

310
00:22:52,516 --> 00:22:55,917
I've been fired by Wyant, Wheeler.

311
00:22:57,615 --> 00:23:01,817
I want to bring a wrongful termination
suit against Wheeler and his partners.

312
00:23:01,717 --> 00:23:05,717
You want to sue Wyant, Wheeler,
Hellerman, Tetlow and Brown?

313
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,618
Correct.
I'm seeking representation.

314
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:11,618
Continue.

315
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:16,220
I misplaced an important complaint.
That's their story.

316
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,321
Want to hear mine?

317
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,320
How many lawyers did you go to
before you called me?

318
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,621
Nine.

319
00:23:29,222 --> 00:23:30,721
Continue.

320
00:23:31,521 --> 00:23:35,522
The night before it was due,
I worked on the complaint in my office.

321
00:23:35,324 --> 00:23:37,123
I left a copy of it on my desk.

322
00:23:38,124 --> 00:23:40,824
The next day,
the complaint vanished.

323
00:23:41,724 --> 00:23:43,524
No hard copy.

324
00:23:44,724 --> 00:23:49,524
All traces of it
mysteriously gone from my computer.

325
00:23:50,126 --> 00:23:54,326
Miraculously, a copy of the complaint
was located at the last minute...

326
00:23:54,226 --> 00:23:56,927
and we got it to court on time.

327
00:23:57,426 --> 00:24:01,727
But the next day I was summoned
to a meeting with the managing partners.

328
00:24:01,728 --> 00:24:03,927
They were waiting for me
in the conference room.

329
00:24:03,927 --> 00:24:06,528
Oh, hello, Andy!
Come on in.

330
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:08,528
Would you mind hitting the windows?

331
00:24:10,829 --> 00:24:12,929
Thanks. Come on in.

332
00:24:12,829 --> 00:24:16,829
Kenneth, Robert, Charles,
Walter and Lydia.

333
00:24:16,629 --> 00:24:18,630
Thanks for coming in.

334
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,130
Oh, of course.

335
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:24,530
Andy, before we begin,
I'd just like to say...

336
00:24:24,432 --> 00:24:27,331
that everyone in this room
is your friend.

337
00:24:27,331 --> 00:24:29,232
I know that, Charles.

338
00:24:29,232 --> 00:24:31,932
More than your friend...

339
00:24:31,933 --> 00:24:33,132
family.

340
00:24:34,433 --> 00:24:40,133
Charles, I must apologize again
for the Highline mishap yesterday.

341
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:44,033
That was some scary moment
around here.

342
00:24:44,034 --> 00:24:46,934
Wow. Thank God
the complaint was found...

343
00:24:46,734 --> 00:24:49,035
and no damage was done.

344
00:24:49,036 --> 00:24:52,036
This time.
What about next time?

345
00:24:53,536 --> 00:24:55,536
There won't be a next time.

346
00:24:55,635 --> 00:24:57,136
I guarantee it.

347
00:24:57,036 --> 00:25:01,336
Yeah. It's just that something's
come over you lately, Andy.

348
00:25:01,137 --> 00:25:03,137
I don't know...

349
00:25:03,137 --> 00:25:06,637
some kind of stupor or fogginess.

350
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:09,539
Some people think you have
an attitude problem, Beckett.

351
00:25:11,638 --> 00:25:13,539
Really?

352
00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:14,938
Who thinks that?

353
00:25:14,939 --> 00:25:16,639
I do.

354
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,139
Excuse me.

355
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:25,240
Am I being fired?

356
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:28,541
Let me put it this way, Andy.

357
00:25:28,541 --> 00:25:32,542
Your place in the future
of this firm is no longer secure.

358
00:25:32,543 --> 00:25:35,443
We feel it isn't fair
to keep you here...

359
00:25:35,443 --> 00:25:38,643
when your prospects are limited.

360
00:25:39,343 --> 00:25:43,444
And now,
I don't want to rush you out...

361
00:25:43,344 --> 00:25:44,844
We've got a committee meeting.

362
00:25:44,944 --> 00:25:46,444
Excuse me, Charles...

363
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:50,645
with all due respect,
this is preposterous!

364
00:25:50,545 --> 00:25:52,345
It doesn't make any sense.

365
00:25:52,245 --> 00:25:55,145
Oh, you're right, Beckett.
You don't have an attitude problem.

366
00:25:55,145 --> 00:25:56,446
Take it easy.

367
00:25:56,446 --> 00:25:59,746
If you'd lost confidence in me,
why did you give me the Highline suit?

368
00:25:59,547 --> 00:26:03,747
Andy, you nearly blew the entire case.
That alone is inexcusable.

369
00:26:03,647 --> 00:26:06,646
It would have been
catastrophic for us.

370
00:26:10,949 --> 00:26:13,548
So you were
concealing your illness.

371
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,949
That's correct.

372
00:26:20,349 --> 00:26:22,649
All right. Explain this to me
like I'm a two-year-old, okay?

373
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:26,351
Because there's an element to this thing
that I cannot get through my thick head.

374
00:26:28,651 --> 00:26:30,650
Didn't you have an obligation
to tell your employer...

375
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:33,151
you had this dreaded, deadly,
infectious disease?

376
00:26:34,052 --> 00:26:36,252
That's not the point.

377
00:26:36,352 --> 00:26:39,253
From the day they hired me
to the day I was fired...

378
00:26:39,152 --> 00:26:42,753
I served my clients consistently,
thoroughly, with absolute excellence.

379
00:26:42,754 --> 00:26:45,554
If they hadn't fired me,
that's what I'd be doing today.

380
00:26:45,454 --> 00:26:47,854
And they don't want to fire you
for having AIDS...

381
00:26:47,854 --> 00:26:50,754
so, in spite of your brilliance,
they make you look incompetent.

382
00:26:50,655 --> 00:26:53,155
Thus, the mysterious lost files.
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

383
00:26:53,155 --> 00:26:55,955
Correct. I was sabotaged.

384
00:26:59,756 --> 00:27:01,656
I don't buy it, Counselor.

385
00:27:03,656 --> 00:27:05,856
That's very disappointing.

386
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:07,758
I don't see a case.

387
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:13,159
I have a case.

388
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:16,159
If you don't want it
for personal reasons...

389
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,060
Thank you.
That's correct. I don't.

390
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,160
Well, thank you for your time,
Counselor.

391
00:27:34,462 --> 00:27:37,462
I'm sorry about what happened to you.
It's a bitch, you know?

392
00:27:49,065 --> 00:27:51,065
Have a nice day, Mr. Beckett.

393
00:27:51,065 --> 00:27:53,065
What the hell's the matter
with that guy?

394
00:27:53,065 --> 00:27:55,365
Iris, find out
if Armbruster can see me.

395
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,965
- Joe Miller's office.
- Iris.

396
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,566
- Find out if Armbruster can see me.
- Armbruster? When?

397
00:27:58,566 --> 00:28:00,765
- Sometime this afternoon.
- What's wrong with him?

398
00:28:00,765 --> 00:28:02,267
No. Right away, Iris.

399
00:28:32,172 --> 00:28:33,571
Excuse me.

400
00:28:38,571 --> 00:28:43,172
The HIV virus can only be transmitted
through the exchange ofbodily fluids...

401
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:46,173
namely, blood, semen
and vaginal secretions.

402
00:28:46,173 --> 00:28:48,373
Right. Yeah.

403
00:28:48,374 --> 00:28:52,174
But isn't it true they're finding out
new things about this disease every day?

404
00:28:52,075 --> 00:28:54,475
Now, you tell me today
there's no danger. Go home.

405
00:28:54,475 --> 00:28:56,375
I go home.
I pick up my little baby girl.

406
00:28:56,476 --> 00:28:58,676
Then I find out six months from now
on the news or something:

407
00:28:58,676 --> 00:29:02,076
Whoops! Made a mistake.
Yeah, you can carry it...

408
00:29:01,976 --> 00:29:03,876
on your shirt
or your clothes or...

409
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:08,078
What are you doing?

410
00:29:09,077 --> 00:29:10,477
We're gonna draw blood.

411
00:29:10,577 --> 00:29:12,577
- Why are we gonna do that?
- Joe.

412
00:29:12,577 --> 00:29:14,277
Little Joe.

413
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:17,778
I've known you
since you were a kid.

414
00:29:17,778 --> 00:29:20,779
And I don't care a whit
about your private life.

415
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:26,280
Thanks, Doc. I don't need
an AIDS test, but thanks anyway.

416
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,980
Just send a bill
to my office for me.

417
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,780
Okay?

418
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,881
Thanks for the information.
Really.

419
00:29:38,582 --> 00:29:40,583
You have a problem with gays, Joe.

420
00:29:40,583 --> 00:29:43,083
- Not especially.
- Yes, you do.

421
00:29:42,983 --> 00:29:45,783
- How many gays do you know?
- How many do you know?

422
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:47,582
- Lots.
- Like who?

423
00:29:47,484 --> 00:29:50,684
Karen Berman, my aunt Theresa...

424
00:29:51,284 --> 00:29:53,485
Cousin Tommy
who lives in Rochester...

425
00:29:53,485 --> 00:29:55,484
Eddie Meyers from the office...

426
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:59,185
Stanley, the guy who's putting in
our kitchen cabinets.

427
00:29:59,185 --> 00:30:01,486
Aunt Theresa is gay?

428
00:30:01,386 --> 00:30:04,686
That beautiful, sensuous,
voluptuous woman is a lesbian?

429
00:30:05,687 --> 00:30:07,287
Since when?

430
00:30:07,287 --> 00:30:09,287
Probably since she was born.

431
00:30:09,287 --> 00:30:10,787
Oh, man.

432
00:30:11,586 --> 00:30:13,688
All right. Well, hey,
I admit it, okay?

433
00:30:13,789 --> 00:30:16,589
I'm prejudiced. I don't like
homosexuals. There. You got me.

434
00:30:16,489 --> 00:30:19,788
- All right.
- I mean, the way these guys do that...

435
00:30:19,688 --> 00:30:21,188
thing, don't they get confused?

436
00:30:21,189 --> 00:30:23,390
"Oh, I don't know.
Is that yours? Is that mine?"

437
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:28,790
You know, I don't want to be in bed
with anybody who's stronger than me...

438
00:30:28,689 --> 00:30:30,389
or who has more hair
on their chest.

439
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:34,491
Now, you can call me old-fashioned,
conservative. Just call me a man.

440
00:30:36,191 --> 00:30:39,691
Besides, I think you have to be a man
to understand how...

441
00:30:39,592 --> 00:30:41,992
really disgusting
that whole idea is anyway.

442
00:30:41,992 --> 00:30:43,793
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

443
00:30:43,793 --> 00:30:46,093
Well, well.
Little caveman of the house.

444
00:30:45,993 --> 00:30:48,093
You damn skippy.

445
00:30:48,094 --> 00:30:50,694
Here you go, baby.
Stay away from your aunt Theresa too.

446
00:30:50,694 --> 00:30:53,094
Joe, don't say that to her.

447
00:30:53,094 --> 00:30:55,194
Think about those guys
pumping up together...

448
00:30:55,195 --> 00:30:57,296
trying to be macho and faggot
at the same time.

449
00:30:57,296 --> 00:31:00,195
I mean, I can't stand that shit.

450
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:02,096
Hey, I'm bein' totally honest
with you, okay?

451
00:31:01,996 --> 00:31:05,995
- Oh, yeah. You are.
- All right. I got a question for you.

452
00:31:05,796 --> 00:31:08,397
Would you accept a client...

453
00:31:08,297 --> 00:31:10,697
if you were constantly thinking...

454
00:31:10,697 --> 00:31:12,897
"I don't want this person to touch me.

455
00:31:12,898 --> 00:31:15,498
I don't want him
to even breathe on me"?

456
00:31:16,997 --> 00:31:19,697
- Not if I was you, honey.
- That's what I'm talking about.

457
00:31:19,598 --> 00:31:20,898
What?

458
00:31:21,699 --> 00:31:25,099
Ho, ho, ho!
Merry Christmas!

459
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:28,999
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

460
00:31:30,201 --> 00:31:32,501
- Hey, merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas, sir.

461
00:31:35,401 --> 00:31:37,201
Thank...

462
00:31:37,101 --> 00:31:38,600
Happy new year.

463
00:31:39,902 --> 00:31:42,502
- You're the, uh, the TV guy.
- TV guy.

464
00:32:30,011 --> 00:32:31,310
Sir?

465
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:35,711
This is the supplement.

466
00:32:36,611 --> 00:32:41,411
You're right. There is a section
on HIV-related discrimination.

467
00:32:41,312 --> 00:32:43,312
Thank you.

468
00:32:43,312 --> 00:32:45,612
Thank you very much.

469
00:32:54,615 --> 00:32:57,714
We do have a private research room
available.

470
00:32:57,614 --> 00:32:59,615
I'm fine right here.
Thank you.

471
00:32:59,615 --> 00:33:03,615
Excuse me. Do you know where I can find
the State v. Murdock case?

472
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:05,717
Just a moment.
I'll be right with you.

473
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:07,016
Thanks.

474
00:33:26,219 --> 00:33:28,619
Wouldn't you be more comfortable
in a research room?

475
00:33:42,622 --> 00:33:44,722
No.

476
00:33:44,621 --> 00:33:46,721
Would it make you more comfortable?

477
00:33:55,724 --> 00:33:57,924
Beckett. How you doin'?

478
00:34:02,726 --> 00:34:04,226
Counselor.

479
00:34:16,727 --> 00:34:18,427
Whatever, sir.

480
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:24,629
Excuse me.

481
00:34:35,431 --> 00:34:36,830
Who'd you get?

482
00:34:37,832 --> 00:34:39,031
What?

483
00:34:39,031 --> 00:34:41,331
Did you find a lawyer?

484
00:34:42,531 --> 00:34:43,932
I'm a lawyer.

485
00:34:45,932 --> 00:34:47,932
Hey, how's your baby?

486
00:34:47,833 --> 00:34:50,533
Oh, yeah. She's, uh...

487
00:34:50,533 --> 00:34:52,432
She's wonderful, great.

488
00:34:52,432 --> 00:34:54,234
What's her name?

489
00:34:54,334 --> 00:34:56,334
Larice.

490
00:34:56,334 --> 00:34:58,734
That's a beautiful name.

491
00:34:59,234 --> 00:35:01,835
Named her after my sister.

492
00:35:38,741 --> 00:35:40,041
Look, I'm, uh...

493
00:35:45,742 --> 00:35:47,643
How'd they find out
you have the AIDS?

494
00:35:47,643 --> 00:35:51,143
One of the partners noticed
a lesion on my forehead.

495
00:35:56,844 --> 00:36:00,344
But how do you go from, uh...

496
00:36:00,244 --> 00:36:04,944
How do you go from a lawyer spotting
a lesion, which could be anything...

497
00:36:04,846 --> 00:36:08,545
to the partners deducing
that you have AIDS...

498
00:36:08,446 --> 00:36:11,745
and terminating you
on the basis of that conclusion?

499
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:15,947
That's a good point.

500
00:36:24,848 --> 00:36:28,348
The partner who spotted the lesion,
Walter Kenton...

501
00:36:28,249 --> 00:36:32,149
worked for Walsh,
Ulmer and Brahm in D.C.

502
00:36:32,049 --> 00:36:34,750
A paralegal there,
Melissa Benedict...

503
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:38,350
showed lesions on and off
for the better part of two, three years.

504
00:36:38,251 --> 00:36:42,151
She says it was common knowledge around
the office they were caused by AIDS.

505
00:36:42,151 --> 00:36:43,651
But they didn't fire her.

506
00:36:43,651 --> 00:36:47,051
No. They did not fire her.

507
00:36:46,952 --> 00:36:48,152
I see.

508
00:36:48,252 --> 00:36:50,352
So you got a relevant precedent?

509
00:36:51,453 --> 00:36:53,453
The Arline decision.

510
00:36:53,454 --> 00:36:55,854
- Arline?
- Supreme Court.

511
00:37:13,156 --> 00:37:15,156
"The Federal Vocational
Rehabilitation Act...

512
00:37:15,156 --> 00:37:17,956
of 1973 prohibits
discrimination...

513
00:37:17,956 --> 00:37:21,357
against otherwise
qualified handicapped persons...

514
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:25,457
who are able to perform the duties
required by their employment.

515
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:27,558
Although the ruling did not
address the specific issue...

516
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:29,659
of HIV and AIDS discrimination..."

517
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:33,659
"Subsequent decisions have held
that AIDS is protected as a handicap...

518
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:38,060
under law, not only because of
the physical limitations it imposes...

519
00:37:38,061 --> 00:37:40,361
but because the prejudice
surrounding AIDS...

520
00:37:40,361 --> 00:37:43,661
exacts a social death which precedes...

521
00:37:46,961 --> 00:37:50,462
which precedes
the actual physical one."

522
00:37:59,163 --> 00:38:01,463
"This is the essence
of discrimination:

523
00:38:02,564 --> 00:38:07,265
Forming opinions about others
not based on their individual merits...

524
00:38:07,165 --> 00:38:11,364
but rather their membership in a group
with assumed characteristics."

525
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:40,771
- Charles Wheeler.
- Julius Erving!

526
00:38:40,671 --> 00:38:43,270
- By golly, I'm glad to see you!
- Ken Starr.

527
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:46,371
- Ken, how are ya?
- How are ya?

528
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,671
Come over here.

529
00:38:52,673 --> 00:38:54,674
Charles Wheeler, how you doin'?

530
00:38:54,674 --> 00:38:56,073
- How are you?
- Very good.

531
00:38:56,073 --> 00:38:58,873
- Welcome...
- Summons for you.

532
00:38:58,873 --> 00:39:00,274
Take a look at it.
Have a good day.

533
00:39:00,174 --> 00:39:03,273
Hey, Dr.J. How are you?
You're the best.

534
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:05,775
If you ever need a lawyer for anything,
you give me a call.

535
00:39:05,775 --> 00:39:08,275
If you slip and fall, you know,
accidents, anything, let me know.

536
00:39:08,275 --> 00:39:10,675
See you in court.

537
00:39:10,676 --> 00:39:12,676
- The TV guy.
- Yeah, the TV guy.

538
00:39:18,377 --> 00:39:20,277
Say, Chuck, what's up?

539
00:39:20,177 --> 00:39:24,877
Now, regarding Andy, I want to know
everything regarding his personal life.

540
00:39:24,777 --> 00:39:26,978
Does he frequent those pathetic bars
on Chestnut Street?

541
00:39:26,979 --> 00:39:28,378
- Right.
- Oh, Jesus.

542
00:39:28,378 --> 00:39:31,278
What other homosexual facilities
does he go to?

543
00:39:31,178 --> 00:39:32,779
- Absolutely.
- Charles.

544
00:39:32,879 --> 00:39:36,678
What deviant groups or organizations
does he secretly belong to?

545
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,380
- First thing in the morning.
- Wait a minute!

546
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,680
- Look...
- What is it?

547
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,280
Let's make a fair settlement offer
and put this tragic business behind us.

548
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,180
Bob...

549
00:39:45,181 --> 00:39:48,782
Andy brought AIDS into our offices...

550
00:39:48,681 --> 00:39:50,882
into our men's room.

551
00:39:50,882 --> 00:39:55,081
He brought AIDS
to our annual goddamn family picnic.

552
00:39:54,982 --> 00:39:56,883
We ought to be suing him, Bob.

553
00:39:56,883 --> 00:39:59,382
Where is your compassion,
gentlemen?

554
00:39:59,382 --> 00:40:03,082
Bob, we gave him Highline.
Did Andrew Beckett say...

555
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:07,084
"I might not be able to serve
our client to the best of my ability"?

556
00:40:06,984 --> 00:40:08,485
He said nothing.

557
00:40:08,385 --> 00:40:11,884
And now, disregarding the trust
and affection I conferred upon him...

558
00:40:11,785 --> 00:40:16,186
Andrew Beckett proposes
to haul me into court...

559
00:40:16,086 --> 00:40:20,486
to sling accusations at me,
to call me a bigot...

560
00:40:20,286 --> 00:40:25,487
in full view of the entire
Philadelphia judicial establishment.

561
00:40:25,386 --> 00:40:27,188
My God!

562
00:40:28,888 --> 00:40:30,289
Excuse me.

563
00:40:32,488 --> 00:40:36,088
Beckett doesn't want to go to court.
He wants a quick, tasty settlement.

564
00:40:35,989 --> 00:40:38,689
A jury might decide
that he has a case.

565
00:40:38,589 --> 00:40:40,990
Wait a minute.

566
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:44,690
He was fired for incompetence,
not because he has AIDS.

567
00:40:45,591 --> 00:40:47,690
You didn't know he was sick,
did you, Bob?

568
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:50,191
Holy shit.
Did you, Bob?

569
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:56,293
No. No, not really.

570
00:41:06,594 --> 00:41:08,295
Okay, everybody.

571
00:41:08,394 --> 00:41:11,593
Everybody, this is the house
that I grew up in...

572
00:41:12,795 --> 00:41:16,196
right here in the hometown
of Lower Merion, Pennsylvania.

573
00:41:15,995 --> 00:41:20,195
Wait, here's proof.

574
00:41:20,196 --> 00:41:25,296
There. My handprints
from when I was a cute little boy.

575
00:41:25,097 --> 00:41:30,097
Today is the 40th wedding anniversary
of my mom and dad, the Becketts.

576
00:41:29,998 --> 00:41:31,498
Isn't that somethin'?

577
00:41:31,498 --> 00:41:35,298
Pretty tough life around this poverty
so many years, huh?

578
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:38,599
Well, those can be some pretty mean
streets. Don't let appearances fool you.

579
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:41,099
Here's the front door.
Now, I once slammed...

580
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:43,700
this finger in the front door
and I broke it.

581
00:41:46,701 --> 00:41:49,500
There's my sisterJill,
everybody.

582
00:41:49,402 --> 00:41:52,801
- Say hello, Alexis.
- Mommy's pregnant again!

583
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:55,101
What? Are you really?

584
00:41:57,003 --> 00:41:59,303
- Hi, Meghan.
- It's Uncle Andy!

585
00:41:59,303 --> 00:42:03,202
- Where's Dad?
- He's trying to fix the snowblower.

586
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:06,203
It snows once in seven years,
Dad buys a new snowblower.

587
00:42:06,203 --> 00:42:08,304
Oh, me. How are you?

588
00:42:08,304 --> 00:42:10,704
Oh, Mom, today's a good day.

589
00:42:10,705 --> 00:42:13,405
Meghan, keep that up.
You're doin' a great job.

590
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:15,805
I gotta say hello
to the Bronte sisters.

591
00:42:18,907 --> 00:42:21,907
How are you?
Good to see you.

592
00:42:21,907 --> 00:42:24,107
Hi, Lee. How are you?

593
00:42:27,108 --> 00:42:29,007
Put me down!

594
00:42:29,908 --> 00:42:32,208
If you let me love you

595
00:42:32,208 --> 00:42:35,508
It's for sure I'm gonna love you

596
00:42:37,209 --> 00:42:40,810
All the way

597
00:42:40,709 --> 00:42:43,210
All

598
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:46,411
Bud and Sarah

599
00:42:46,411 --> 00:42:48,311
All the way

600
00:42:51,612 --> 00:42:55,711
There will be things said at the trial
that are hard for you to hear...

601
00:42:55,612 --> 00:42:57,811
about me and my personal life.

602
00:42:57,811 --> 00:43:00,712
And there's gonna be publicity. I want
to make sure it's okay with everybody.

603
00:43:01,813 --> 00:43:03,913
Andy, you want me to take her?

604
00:43:03,813 --> 00:43:07,514
No. She's fine.

605
00:43:07,514 --> 00:43:09,413
I think it's great
that you're asking, Andy...

606
00:43:09,414 --> 00:43:13,315
but this is really your call.

607
00:43:13,214 --> 00:43:15,115
All right.
Thank you, brother.

608
00:43:17,816 --> 00:43:20,916
Hey, you're my kid brother.

609
00:43:20,816 --> 00:43:22,415
That's all that matters.
Okay?

610
00:43:23,816 --> 00:43:26,616
To be honest,
I'm worried about Mommy and Daddy.

611
00:43:28,617 --> 00:43:30,218
They've been through
so much already.

612
00:43:30,218 --> 00:43:34,618
And it's possible there are going to be
some very tough times ahead.

613
00:43:37,019 --> 00:43:41,119
Andy, the way that you've handled
this whole thing...

614
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:46,119
you and Miguel...
with so much courage...

615
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,720
I don't believe there's anything...

616
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:50,420
that anyone could say
that would...

617
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:55,520
make us feel anything
but incredibly proud of you.

618
00:43:57,222 --> 00:44:01,022
Well, I didn't raise my kids
to sit in the back of the bus.

619
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:05,323
You get in there
and you fight for your rights, okay?

620
00:44:07,424 --> 00:44:10,023
Gee, I love you guys.

621
00:44:35,028 --> 00:44:37,428
Ladies and gentlemen of thejury...

622
00:44:39,329 --> 00:44:42,829
forget everything you've seen
on television and in the movies.

623
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:45,729
There's not gonna be
any last-minute surprise witnesses.

624
00:44:45,729 --> 00:44:48,530
Nobody's gonna break down on the stand
with a tearful confession.

625
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:52,130
You're gonna be presented with
a simple fact:

626
00:44:53,731 --> 00:44:56,231
Andrew Beckett was fired.

627
00:44:56,131 --> 00:44:58,631
You'll hear two explanations
for why he was fired:

628
00:44:58,631 --> 00:45:01,331
Ours and theirs.

629
00:45:01,332 --> 00:45:05,932
It is up to you to sift
through layer upon layer of truth...

630
00:45:05,733 --> 00:45:09,633
until you determine for yourselves
which version sounds the most true.

631
00:45:09,634 --> 00:45:11,934
There are certain points
that I must prove to you.

632
00:45:11,934 --> 00:45:15,034
Point number one:
Andrew Beckett was...

633
00:45:16,336 --> 00:45:18,435
is... a brilliant lawyer...

634
00:45:18,336 --> 00:45:20,335
a great lawyer.

635
00:45:20,335 --> 00:45:24,035
Point number two: Andrew Beckett,
afflicted with a debilitating disease...

636
00:45:23,936 --> 00:45:27,136
made the understandable,
the personal...

637
00:45:27,736 --> 00:45:31,537
the legal choice to keep
the fact of his illness to himself.

638
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:35,837
Point number three:
His employers discovered his illness.

639
00:45:35,638 --> 00:45:38,339
And, ladies and gentlemen,
the illness I'm referring to is AIDS.

640
00:45:38,339 --> 00:45:42,038
Point number four: They panicked.

641
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:49,539
And in their panic, they did what most
of us would like to do with AIDS...

642
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,140
which is just get it
and everybody who has it...

643
00:45:52,141 --> 00:45:55,341
as far away from the rest of us
as possible.

644
00:45:57,841 --> 00:46:01,541
Now, the behavior of Andrew Beckett's
employers may seem reasonable to you.

645
00:46:01,442 --> 00:46:03,043
It does to me.

646
00:46:03,141 --> 00:46:06,342
After all, AIDS is a deadly,
incurable disease.

647
00:46:06,242 --> 00:46:10,543
But no matter how you come to judge
Charles Wheeler and his partners...

648
00:46:10,444 --> 00:46:14,743
in ethical, moral and human terms,
the fact of the matter is...

649
00:46:14,644 --> 00:46:18,844
when they fired Andrew Beckett
because he had AIDS...

650
00:46:18,645 --> 00:46:21,445
they broke the law.

651
00:46:26,646 --> 00:46:28,046
Fact:

652
00:46:31,546 --> 00:46:35,047
Andrew Beckett's performance
on the job...

653
00:46:34,848 --> 00:46:38,747
varied from competent, good...

654
00:46:38,647 --> 00:46:41,847
to oftentimes mediocre...

655
00:46:41,749 --> 00:46:45,849
to sometimes flagrantly incompetent.

656
00:46:47,249 --> 00:46:48,649
Fact:

657
00:46:49,749 --> 00:46:53,849
He claims he's the victim
of lies and deceit.

658
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:56,751
Fact:

659
00:46:56,851 --> 00:46:59,651
It was Andrew Beckett who lied...

660
00:46:59,552 --> 00:47:04,252
going to great lengths to conceal
his disease from his employers.

661
00:47:04,252 --> 00:47:05,553
Fact:

662
00:47:06,452 --> 00:47:11,253
He was successful
in his duplicity.

663
00:47:11,953 --> 00:47:15,353
The partners at Wyant, Wheeler
did not know...

664
00:47:15,353 --> 00:47:19,354
that Andrew Beckett had AIDS
when they fired him.

665
00:47:22,155 --> 00:47:23,655
Fact:

666
00:47:25,355 --> 00:47:27,157
Andrew Beckett is dying.

667
00:47:33,357 --> 00:47:34,857
Fact:

668
00:47:36,358 --> 00:47:39,357
Andrew Beckett is angry...

669
00:47:40,758 --> 00:47:45,558
because his lifestyle,
his reckless behavior...

670
00:47:46,759 --> 00:47:48,859
has cut short his life.

671
00:47:48,859 --> 00:47:52,759
And in his anger, his rage...

672
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,661
he is lashing out.

673
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:58,060
And he wants someone to pay.

674
00:48:02,062 --> 00:48:04,761
Thank you.

675
00:48:18,965 --> 00:48:23,465
Andrew Beckett represented your company
in a lawsuit in 1990. Is that correct?

676
00:48:23,265 --> 00:48:25,164
That's correct.

677
00:48:25,066 --> 00:48:27,467
Were you pleased
with his work?

678
00:48:27,467 --> 00:48:30,765
We were satisfied
with the outcome of the litigation.

679
00:48:33,367 --> 00:48:34,767
Satisfied.

680
00:48:37,567 --> 00:48:42,968
Mr. Laird, when I approached you
about being a witness in this trial...

681
00:48:42,768 --> 00:48:46,069
you gave sworn testimony
in a deposition, is that correct?

682
00:48:46,069 --> 00:48:48,369
That's correct.

683
00:48:48,369 --> 00:48:53,569
In that deposition, you said that
you were impressed and delighted...

684
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:55,870
with the quality
of Andrew Beckett's work.

685
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:57,670
Do you recall saying that?

686
00:49:04,271 --> 00:49:07,572
In all honesty,
I was delighted...

687
00:49:07,473 --> 00:49:10,172
with certain aspects
of Andy's efforts.

688
00:49:10,873 --> 00:49:14,272
But in general,
I found the work to be...

689
00:49:14,272 --> 00:49:17,173
merely satisfactory.

690
00:49:23,174 --> 00:49:25,174
Do you agree...

691
00:49:27,376 --> 00:49:29,876
that a bologna sandwich
is a satisfactory meal?

692
00:49:29,876 --> 00:49:34,276
Whereas caviar
and champagne...

693
00:49:34,077 --> 00:49:38,278
roast duck and baked Alaska...

694
00:49:38,278 --> 00:49:40,678
that might be considered
a delightful meal?

695
00:49:40,578 --> 00:49:44,778
We object. These gastronomical comments
are irrelevant, Your Honor.

696
00:49:45,378 --> 00:49:47,278
They are not irrelevant.

697
00:49:47,178 --> 00:49:52,478
Your Honor, five months ago this witness
characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar.

698
00:49:52,279 --> 00:49:54,180
Now he's a bologna sandwich.

699
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:56,480
I think the jury
is entitled to know...

700
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:00,879
what powerful force
has caused him to change his mind.

701
00:50:02,282 --> 00:50:04,581
He hasn't changed his mind.

702
00:50:04,481 --> 00:50:06,681
He's amplified his answer.

703
00:50:06,682 --> 00:50:08,682
Objection sustained.

704
00:50:13,783 --> 00:50:15,283
All right.

705
00:50:18,484 --> 00:50:23,184
Mr. Laird, explain this to me
like I'm a four-year-old, okay?

706
00:50:23,085 --> 00:50:27,185
Did Andrew Beckett
win your lawsuit for you?

707
00:50:27,885 --> 00:50:29,486
Yes, we won.

708
00:50:29,486 --> 00:50:33,786
Oh, congratulations!
That must've been a very...

709
00:50:33,686 --> 00:50:37,186
satisfactory experience.

710
00:50:37,087 --> 00:50:40,587
"AIDS Cures Homosexuality"
Homophobia's got to go. Hey, hey!

711
00:51:03,791 --> 00:51:06,691
- Ready, Mr. Beckett?
- Get ready. Here they come.

712
00:51:06,592 --> 00:51:08,691
No rights for sodomites!

713
00:51:12,292 --> 00:51:14,592
Adam and Eve!
Not Adam and Steve!

714
00:51:14,593 --> 00:51:16,793
Thou shalt not lie
with mankind.

715
00:51:16,893 --> 00:51:19,993
Do you see this
as a gay rights issue?

716
00:51:19,893 --> 00:51:24,094
I am not political.
I just want what is fair, what is right.

717
00:51:23,995 --> 00:51:26,195
But you are gay, aren't you?

718
00:51:26,195 --> 00:51:30,096
I don't see how that's
any of your business. But, yes, I am.

719
00:51:31,896 --> 00:51:33,296
Totally irrelevant.

720
00:51:33,296 --> 00:51:36,396
Do you think that homosexuals
deserve special treatment?

721
00:51:36,396 --> 00:51:39,096
- Hell, no!
- We're in Philadelphia...

722
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:42,797
the City of Brotherly Love,
birthplace of freedom...

723
00:51:42,698 --> 00:51:46,198
where the Founding Fathers authored
the Declaration of Independence.

724
00:51:46,198 --> 00:51:48,598
I don't recall that
glorious document saying...

725
00:51:48,499 --> 00:51:51,299
anything about all straight men
are created equal.

726
00:51:51,299 --> 00:51:53,799
I believe it says
all men are created equal.

727
00:51:53,799 --> 00:51:56,099
Gimme a goddamn break.

728
00:51:56,099 --> 00:51:58,800
As far as someone being fired
from a law firm or a business...

729
00:51:58,801 --> 00:52:01,000
if we found that their action
was discriminatory...

730
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,400
they'd do no business with the city.

731
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:06,100
- Thank you, Mayor.
- Yo!

732
00:52:06,002 --> 00:52:10,902
You're not getting a little light
in the sneakers, are you, pal?

733
00:52:20,503 --> 00:52:24,504
Yeah, I am, Filko.
I'm changing.

734
00:52:24,505 --> 00:52:26,705
I'm on the prowl.

735
00:52:26,705 --> 00:52:29,405
And I'm looking for a hunk,
not just any hunk.

736
00:52:29,405 --> 00:52:31,204
I mean a man,
a real man like you.

737
00:52:33,305 --> 00:52:37,006
You can tell everybody. You know
what we do. You wanna play sailor?

738
00:52:36,906 --> 00:52:40,207
- Remember? You're the first mate?
- That's not funny!

739
00:52:40,107 --> 00:52:43,207
Let me tell you something.
These people make me sick.

740
00:52:43,207 --> 00:52:45,908
But a law's been broken.

741
00:52:45,808 --> 00:52:47,408
You remember the law?

742
00:52:53,108 --> 00:52:55,508
At least we agree
on one thing, Joe.

743
00:52:55,409 --> 00:52:57,509
What's that, Charlie?

744
00:52:58,510 --> 00:53:00,810
Tutti-fruttis make me sick too.

745
00:53:07,211 --> 00:53:11,611
Ms. Benedict, is it true you worked
for Walsh, Ulmer and Brahm...

746
00:53:11,511 --> 00:53:14,411
at the same time as Walter Kenton?

747
00:53:14,412 --> 00:53:15,613
That's correct.

748
00:53:15,713 --> 00:53:18,613
At that time,
did Walter Kenton know...

749
00:53:18,513 --> 00:53:21,513
the K.S. Lesions on your face
and arms were caused by AIDS?

750
00:53:21,513 --> 00:53:24,814
Definitely.
I told all the partners.

751
00:53:24,715 --> 00:53:27,714
How did Walter Kenton treat you
after you told him you had AIDS?

752
00:53:28,915 --> 00:53:33,814
Every time he'd come in contact with me,
he'd get this look on his face.

753
00:53:33,616 --> 00:53:36,116
I refer to it
as the "Oh, God" expression.

754
00:53:36,016 --> 00:53:39,415
As in, "Oh, God,
here comes that woman with AIDS."

755
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:43,618
Thank you, Ms. Benedict.
No more questions, Your Honor.

756
00:53:43,618 --> 00:53:47,517
Ms. Benedict,
how did you contract the AIDS virus?

757
00:53:47,318 --> 00:53:51,518
Through a transfusion. I lost a lot of
blood giving birth to my second child.

758
00:53:51,419 --> 00:53:54,619
So, in your case
there was no behavior on your part...

759
00:53:54,619 --> 00:53:57,219
which caused you to be
infected with the virus.

760
00:53:57,220 --> 00:54:00,519
It was something you were unable
to avoid. Isn't that correct?

761
00:54:02,721 --> 00:54:03,920
I guess.

762
00:54:09,521 --> 00:54:10,822
Thank you.

763
00:54:10,822 --> 00:54:13,022
But I don't
consider myself...

764
00:54:13,023 --> 00:54:15,823
any different from anyone else
with this disease.

765
00:54:15,823 --> 00:54:21,123
I'm not guilty. I'm not innocent.
I'm just trying to survive.

766
00:54:20,923 --> 00:54:22,423
Thank you, Ms. Benedict.

767
00:54:23,024 --> 00:54:25,424
No further questions
at this time, Your Honor.

768
00:54:27,324 --> 00:54:29,424
You may step down, Mrs. Benedict.

769
00:54:31,826 --> 00:54:34,425
Beyond noticing
the marks on his face...

770
00:54:34,425 --> 00:54:37,826
were there other things
about his appearance, Miss Burton...

771
00:54:37,826 --> 00:54:41,926
that made you suspect
that Andrew had AIDS?

772
00:54:41,827 --> 00:54:45,227
He was getting thinner,
and he seemed very tired sometimes.

773
00:54:45,127 --> 00:54:49,028
But he was working so hard.
Still, I felt something was wrong.

774
00:54:49,029 --> 00:54:53,929
And I can't believe they're pretending
that they didn't notice anything.

775
00:54:53,728 --> 00:54:55,829
Objection.

776
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:58,029
Just answer the question, please.

777
00:54:58,029 --> 00:55:01,229
Have you ever felt discriminated against
at Wyant, Wheeler?

778
00:55:04,431 --> 00:55:05,631
Well, yes.

779
00:55:05,731 --> 00:55:07,731
- In what way?
- Well...

780
00:55:07,731 --> 00:55:10,632
Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia...

781
00:55:10,632 --> 00:55:13,931
said that Mr. Wheeler
had a problem with my earrings.

782
00:55:13,833 --> 00:55:17,632
- Really?
- Apparently Mr. Wheeler felt...

783
00:55:17,632 --> 00:55:20,732
that they were too...
"ethnic" is the word she used.

784
00:55:20,633 --> 00:55:23,333
She told me he said
he would like it...

785
00:55:23,334 --> 00:55:25,834
if I wore something
a little less garish...

786
00:55:25,834 --> 00:55:30,034
a little smaller and more American.

787
00:55:30,835 --> 00:55:32,035
What'd you say?

788
00:55:32,035 --> 00:55:35,035
I said, "My earrings are American.

789
00:55:35,035 --> 00:55:37,835
They're African-American."

790
00:55:40,636 --> 00:55:42,837
Let's have order, please.

791
00:55:42,737 --> 00:55:44,537
Thank you. No more questions.

792
00:55:44,537 --> 00:55:46,437
Ms. Burton...

793
00:55:46,437 --> 00:55:50,037
weren't you recently promoted?

794
00:55:51,138 --> 00:55:53,138
Yes. I'm in charge
of the paralegal department.

795
00:55:56,239 --> 00:56:00,340
Congratulations on your unfettered
ascendancy at Wyant, Wheeler.

796
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,439
I don't know if I'd go so far
as to call it unfettered.

797
00:56:03,439 --> 00:56:06,939
I don't understand.
How do you explain...

798
00:56:06,841 --> 00:56:10,641
the promotion of an obviously...

799
00:56:10,641 --> 00:56:13,141
intelligent, articulate...

800
00:56:13,142 --> 00:56:17,442
qualified
African-American woman...

801
00:56:17,342 --> 00:56:19,443
in a firm which practices
discrimination...

802
00:56:19,443 --> 00:56:24,543
as wantonly and consistently
as you and Mr. Beckett claim?

803
00:56:26,143 --> 00:56:29,144
- I can't explain it.
- Could it be...

804
00:56:29,144 --> 00:56:31,744
that these...

805
00:56:31,745 --> 00:56:34,444
instances of discrimination...

806
00:56:34,444 --> 00:56:36,844
are in fact misunderstandings...

807
00:56:36,745 --> 00:56:40,045
that have been blown
completely out of proportion?

808
00:56:42,646 --> 00:56:46,846
I think counsel tends to
oversimplify the issue somewhat.

809
00:56:46,748 --> 00:56:49,448
Thank you, Miss Burton,
I'll...

810
00:56:49,448 --> 00:56:52,148
take that note
under consideration.

811
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:13,592
- How's the trial going?
- Excuse me?

812
00:57:13,593 --> 00:57:16,192
It's a great case. I saw you on
television. I'm a law student at Penn.

813
00:57:16,192 --> 00:57:18,393
- How you doing?
- All right. How are you?

814
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:20,192
- Saw me on TV?
- Yeah.

815
00:57:20,092 --> 00:57:22,094
It's a good school, Penn.
What year are you in?

816
00:57:22,095 --> 00:57:26,194
Second. Listen,
I just want to tell you...

817
00:57:26,194 --> 00:57:28,995
this case,
it's tremendously important.

818
00:57:28,895 --> 00:57:31,896
I wanted to let you know
I think you're doing a fantastic job.

819
00:57:31,797 --> 00:57:35,996
- Hey.
- Thank you. All right.

820
00:57:35,897 --> 00:57:37,798
When you graduate,
you give me a call.

821
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:41,100
Okay. All right.
Thank you very much.

822
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,999
- Listen, Joe?
- Yeah?

823
00:57:43,999 --> 00:57:47,501
Would you like to have a drink? I just
finished a game and could use a beer.

824
00:57:47,301 --> 00:57:49,801
Ah, no, I can't.
My wife is...

825
00:57:51,902 --> 00:57:54,003
I don't pick up people
in drugstores every day.

826
00:58:03,806 --> 00:58:06,207
- You think I'm gay?
- Aren't you?

827
00:58:07,007 --> 00:58:09,707
What's the matter?
I look gay to you?

828
00:58:09,707 --> 00:58:11,108
Do I look gay to you?

829
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:16,511
- Relax.
- I ought to kick your faggoty ass.

830
00:58:16,411 --> 00:58:18,111
Take it as a compliment.
Geez!

831
00:58:22,012 --> 00:58:27,213
That is exactly the kind of bullshit
that makes people hate your...

832
00:58:27,012 --> 00:58:28,913
faggoty ass.

833
00:58:28,914 --> 00:58:31,014
You want to try
and kick my ass, Joe?

834
00:58:30,914 --> 00:58:33,915
- Asshole.
- No, you're the asshole, buddy!

835
00:58:42,317 --> 00:58:43,819
Please continue, Ms. O'Hara.

836
00:58:43,819 --> 00:58:48,318
We were going crazy looking
for this complaint.

837
00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:50,119
I felt like I was
in the twilight zone.

838
00:58:50,219 --> 00:58:53,821
Mr. Beckett was screaming
at everybody and he just...

839
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,821
He looked so freaky.

840
00:58:55,721 --> 00:58:58,821
Mr. Kenton kept saying,
"You lost the Highline complaint?"

841
00:58:58,821 --> 00:59:02,423
And he called Mr. Wheeler,
and all of a sudden...

842
00:59:02,322 --> 00:59:05,722
Jamey comes in with the complaint
in his hand.

843
00:59:05,723 --> 00:59:10,825
- He says, "It was in central files."
- Central files?

844
00:59:10,725 --> 00:59:16,326
Central files is a place where paperwork
is sent when cases are closed.

845
00:59:16,228 --> 00:59:18,229
Jamey ran it over
to the court just in time...

846
00:59:18,229 --> 00:59:23,527
and everybody just stood
there completely wasted.

847
00:59:24,130 --> 00:59:25,529
And Mr...

848
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:29,130
And Mr. Beckett
just kept saying...

849
00:59:29,231 --> 00:59:33,732
"I'm sorry. Sorry.
I don't understand this."

850
00:59:33,831 --> 00:59:36,631
Thank you, Ms. O'Hara.

851
00:59:36,833 --> 00:59:38,833
No further questions
at this time, Your Honor.

852
00:59:38,935 --> 00:59:41,634
All right. Mr. Miller.

853
00:59:48,237 --> 00:59:50,036
- May I?
- Certainly.

854
00:59:59,641 --> 01:00:01,040
Thank you.

855
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:04,840
- You okay?
- Yes.

856
01:00:04,742 --> 01:00:06,941
- You want a glass of water?
- No.

857
01:00:11,244 --> 01:00:12,644
Was Andy a good boss?

858
01:00:12,644 --> 01:00:14,943
Yes.

859
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:18,245
He was very sweet.

860
01:00:20,346 --> 01:00:24,346
How would you characterize
his work as an attorney?

861
01:00:25,647 --> 01:00:28,146
How would I know?
I just worked for him.

862
01:00:31,547 --> 01:00:34,749
Excuse me, Your Honor,
but is this for the record?

863
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:38,650
Mr. Miller, perhaps you should
return to counsel's table.

864
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:40,051
Yes, sir.

865
01:00:51,255 --> 01:00:54,156
- Miss O'Hara?
- Yes?

866
01:00:53,957 --> 01:00:55,555
Were you aware...

867
01:00:55,657 --> 01:00:59,557
at any time of any problems
that the senior partners had...

868
01:00:59,457 --> 01:01:03,457
with the quality of Andrew's work
prior to this missing file episode?

869
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,860
No, I wasn't.

870
01:01:06,758 --> 01:01:10,460
Thank you.
No more questions, Your Honor.

871
01:01:15,361 --> 01:01:19,762
Is Andrew Becket the kind of lawyer
who misplaces crucial documents?

872
01:01:19,663 --> 01:01:23,363
Not to my knowledge. No.

873
01:01:23,363 --> 01:01:28,064
If you wanted to make a lawyer look
incompetent, would this be a good way?

874
01:01:27,966 --> 01:01:31,665
Hiding an important document
maybe for a few hours...

875
01:01:31,566 --> 01:01:35,667
and then making it look like
the responsible lawyer misplaced it?

876
01:01:35,568 --> 01:01:39,168
Why would Mr. Wheeler and the others
behave so outrageously?

877
01:01:39,169 --> 01:01:41,069
Because they found out
Andy was sick?

878
01:01:40,969 --> 01:01:43,569
- He's not answering the question.
- Perhaps.

879
01:01:43,569 --> 01:01:48,470
We've had lawyers with heart attacks,
ulcers, prostate cancer, leukemia!

880
01:01:48,273 --> 01:01:49,971
No one sandbagged them.

881
01:01:49,971 --> 01:01:54,973
Did you have something to do with this
file being lost accidentally on purpose?

882
01:01:54,875 --> 01:01:56,474
- Objection.
- I'll rephrase.

883
01:01:56,575 --> 01:01:59,975
Did you have anything
to do with this file being misplaced?

884
01:01:59,875 --> 01:02:01,574
Absolutely not.

885
01:02:01,574 --> 01:02:03,275
Are you a homosexual?

886
01:02:03,276 --> 01:02:08,077
- What?
- Answer the question! Are you a homo?

887
01:02:07,877 --> 01:02:09,377
A faggot? A punk?

888
01:02:09,277 --> 01:02:11,977
A queen, pillow biter, fairy?

889
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:15,979
Bootie snatcher, rump roaster?
Are you gay?

890
01:02:15,879 --> 01:02:18,080
- Objection!
- Order!

891
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:21,681
Where did this come from? Suddenly
counsel's attacking his own witness?

892
01:02:21,582 --> 01:02:27,283
Mr. Collins' sexual orientation
has nothing to do with this case.

893
01:02:27,082 --> 01:02:29,283
Please have a seat, Miss Conine.

894
01:02:33,585 --> 01:02:35,984
Would you approach the bench,
Mr. Miller?

895
01:02:47,489 --> 01:02:50,089
Could you kindly
share with me...

896
01:02:50,089 --> 01:02:52,389
exactly what's going on
inside your head...

897
01:02:52,289 --> 01:02:55,990
because at this moment,
I don't have a clue.

898
01:02:59,592 --> 01:03:00,993
Your Honor...

899
01:03:03,192 --> 01:03:05,992
everybody in this courtroom...

900
01:03:05,893 --> 01:03:09,795
is thinking about sexual orientation,
sexual preference...

901
01:03:09,695 --> 01:03:12,394
whatever you want to call it.

902
01:03:12,395 --> 01:03:16,697
Who does what to whom
and how they do it.

903
01:03:16,598 --> 01:03:19,797
They're looking at Andrew Beckett.
They're thinking about it.

904
01:03:19,798 --> 01:03:23,699
They're looking at Mr. Wheeler,
Miss Conine, even you, Your Honor.

905
01:03:23,598 --> 01:03:26,900
They're wondering about it.

906
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:30,201
Trust me, I know they're looking at me
and thinking about it.

907
01:03:30,102 --> 01:03:35,002
So let's get it out in the open.
Let's get it out of the closet.

908
01:03:34,803 --> 01:03:38,303
Because this case is not
just about AIDS, is it?

909
01:03:38,304 --> 01:03:41,104
So let's talk about what
this case is really all about:

910
01:03:41,104 --> 01:03:43,504
The general public's hatred,
our loathing...

911
01:03:43,504 --> 01:03:48,206
our fear of homosexuals...

912
01:03:48,107 --> 01:03:50,906
and how that climate
of hatred and fear...

913
01:03:50,807 --> 01:03:55,007
translated into the firing
of this particular homosexual...

914
01:03:54,908 --> 01:03:57,709
my client, Andrew Beckett.

915
01:03:59,910 --> 01:04:01,910
Please have a seat, Mr. Miller.

916
01:04:07,311 --> 01:04:09,211
Very good.

917
01:04:09,312 --> 01:04:11,611
In this courtroom, Mr. Miller,
justice is blind...

918
01:04:11,612 --> 01:04:16,515
to matters of race, creed, color...

919
01:04:16,415 --> 01:04:19,215
religion and sexual orientation.

920
01:04:19,016 --> 01:04:21,616
With all due respect,
Your Honor...

921
01:04:24,116 --> 01:04:27,317
we don't live in this courtroom,
though, do we?

922
01:04:27,318 --> 01:04:30,319
No, we don't.

923
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:32,018
However, as regards to this witness...

924
01:04:32,018 --> 01:04:35,119
I'm going to sustain
the defense's objection.

925
01:04:37,022 --> 01:04:41,520
How many weeks would you be out to sea
without stopping at port?

926
01:04:41,421 --> 01:04:45,822
Oh, anywhere from two weeks
to several months.

927
01:04:45,724 --> 01:04:47,724
Any women on board?

928
01:04:47,624 --> 01:04:50,324
Not when I was in the navy.

929
01:04:52,625 --> 01:04:56,127
So, during these long voyages...

930
01:04:56,127 --> 01:05:00,127
months at a time out to sea,
no women in sight...

931
01:04:59,927 --> 01:05:04,327
hundreds of hardworking, robust
young men in the prime of their lives...

932
01:05:04,228 --> 01:05:07,829
at the peak of their natural appetites
and desires...

933
01:05:07,829 --> 01:05:11,830
their God-given hormonal instincts,
anything going on?

934
01:05:12,731 --> 01:05:14,431
Going on? Like what?

935
01:05:14,431 --> 01:05:18,533
Like two sailors down below
making flippy-flop.

936
01:05:18,434 --> 01:05:22,035
- Objection.
- Mr. Miller.

937
01:05:21,935 --> 01:05:23,934
We had one guy like that.

938
01:05:23,934 --> 01:05:26,334
You haven't ruled on my objection,
Your Honor.

939
01:05:26,234 --> 01:05:28,134
Go on, Mr. Miller.

940
01:05:28,035 --> 01:05:31,836
You had one guy like that.
You mean a homosexual?

941
01:05:31,735 --> 01:05:36,036
He strutted around quarters naked
trying to get everybody to notice him.

942
01:05:36,037 --> 01:05:38,139
Made everyone sick.

943
01:05:38,139 --> 01:05:40,138
He was destroying our morale.

944
01:05:40,039 --> 01:05:43,739
So we let him know this kind
of behavior was not acceptable.

945
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:46,041
How'd you do that?
Wrote him a letter?

946
01:05:46,041 --> 01:05:49,041
We stuck his head in a latrine
after ten of us had used it.

947
01:05:49,041 --> 01:05:52,942
- You taught him a lesson, didn't you?
- Yes, we did.

948
01:05:52,843 --> 01:05:55,143
- Like firing Andrew taught him a lesson.
- Objection.

949
01:05:55,143 --> 01:05:59,344
I withdraw. You were aware
when you worked with Melissa Benedict...

950
01:05:59,344 --> 01:06:00,844
that she had AIDS, correct?

951
01:06:00,845 --> 01:06:02,947
- She didn't try to conceal it.
- So you are aware...

952
01:06:02,947 --> 01:06:06,646
of the difference between
a bruise and a lesion. Correct?

953
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:09,948
Beckett told me he had been hit
by a racket ball, and I believed him.

954
01:06:09,949 --> 01:06:14,447
Did you avoid contact with Ms. Benedict
after you found out she had AIDS?

955
01:06:14,348 --> 01:06:19,450
She says and I quote, that you were
repulsed by her. Is that correct?

956
01:06:20,251 --> 01:06:22,351
I felt,
and I still feel nothing...

957
01:06:22,351 --> 01:06:26,452
but the deepest sympathy and compassion
for people like Melissa...

958
01:06:26,353 --> 01:06:30,355
who contracted this terrible disease
through no fault of their own.

959
01:06:44,158 --> 01:06:45,558
Don't move now.

960
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,458
Okay.

961
01:07:06,062 --> 01:07:09,264
Boy. It's not going through.

962
01:07:11,565 --> 01:07:13,767
We may have to flush it out again.

963
01:07:19,967 --> 01:07:22,070
The vein's closed.

964
01:07:22,969 --> 01:07:25,969
We've got to call Barbara.

965
01:07:25,771 --> 01:07:29,470
- Nurse Ratchett.
- Wait a minute.

966
01:07:29,470 --> 01:07:31,372
Yeah. Tell her to come over.

967
01:07:36,872 --> 01:07:40,673
Look, I've... There's so much stuff
that I need to get done.

968
01:07:42,674 --> 01:07:46,475
Can we... Can we just skip
the treatment for tonight?

969
01:07:46,476 --> 01:07:50,575
No. We are not
skipping this treatment.

970
01:07:50,476 --> 01:07:54,878
It's my arm, and it's my treatment,
and I say skip it.

971
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:02,580
Well...

972
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:06,981
You know something?

973
01:08:08,182 --> 01:08:10,382
That stuff is saving your life.

974
01:08:10,383 --> 01:08:11,983
What's the matter with you tonight?

975
01:08:12,883 --> 01:08:14,284
Close the law book.

976
01:08:14,383 --> 01:08:16,384
Will you just...

977
01:08:26,989 --> 01:08:29,088
The least you can do...

978
01:08:28,988 --> 01:08:31,687
is look at me...

979
01:08:31,588 --> 01:08:33,889
and give me a little
of your time, man.

980
01:08:33,890 --> 01:08:35,591
Got it?

981
01:08:36,690 --> 01:08:39,791
You are worried...

982
01:08:39,791 --> 01:08:43,492
we don't have very much time left,
now, aren't you?

983
01:08:44,993 --> 01:08:47,193
No. No.

984
01:09:01,599 --> 01:09:04,598
I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

985
01:09:04,499 --> 01:09:08,200
I'm going to start planning
my memorial service.

986
01:09:08,201 --> 01:09:11,000
I'm going to start preparing
for the inevitable.

987
01:09:16,602 --> 01:09:18,902
Maybe you should
think about it.

988
01:09:37,207 --> 01:09:38,708
No.

989
01:09:50,511 --> 01:09:52,113
I've got a better idea.

990
01:10:06,516 --> 01:10:09,617
- Hi, Andrew. Hi, Miguel.
- Hey, hey!

991
01:10:09,417 --> 01:10:12,417
- Oh, Joe Miller, Counselor.
- My wife, Lisa.

992
01:10:12,417 --> 01:10:15,518
- Are you Lisa? Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

993
01:10:15,518 --> 01:10:19,018
- You look wonderful!
- Maria, Lisa.

994
01:10:18,921 --> 01:10:22,720
- Miguel's sister, Maria.
- How are you, Maria?

995
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:25,321
- Do you care for something to drink?
- I'll take care ofJoe.

996
01:10:27,623 --> 01:10:30,923
You're looking, uh, alive tonight!

997
01:10:30,724 --> 01:10:33,723
I had a blood transfusion,
and I feel great.

998
01:10:33,724 --> 01:10:38,426
So, you like it?
I'm a lawsuit.

999
01:10:38,226 --> 01:10:40,227
You get it?
I'm a lawsuit.

1000
01:10:40,126 --> 01:10:43,127
- It's not bad.
- Lawsuit.

1001
01:10:43,128 --> 01:10:45,127
- What are you drinking?
- Wine is good.

1002
01:10:45,127 --> 01:10:47,028
Can I have some
of the red, please?

1003
01:10:49,627 --> 01:10:53,428
We've got to get to this Q and A
sometime tonight, you know?

1004
01:10:53,329 --> 01:10:55,330
Sure. Just one problem.

1005
01:10:55,330 --> 01:10:58,030
- I'm at a party right now.
- Fine. Whatever.

1006
01:10:58,030 --> 01:11:00,632
- We'll get to it, just later.
- Thank you.

1007
01:11:00,633 --> 01:11:03,432
Hi, Joe Miller.

1008
01:11:03,332 --> 01:11:05,734
- Do I know you?
- Mona Lisa.

1009
01:11:05,634 --> 01:11:09,933
Ah. Uh, lawsuit.

1010
01:11:09,835 --> 01:11:11,336
Nice. Have fun.

1011
01:11:21,238 --> 01:11:23,238
Mr. Sandman

1012
01:11:23,238 --> 01:11:25,338
Bring me a dream

1013
01:11:25,339 --> 01:11:29,141
Make him the cutest boy
that I've ever seen

1014
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:32,841
Give him two lips
like roses in clover

1015
01:11:32,841 --> 01:11:36,241
Then tell me that
my lonesome nights are over

1016
01:11:36,143 --> 01:11:38,043
Mr. Sandman

1017
01:11:38,043 --> 01:11:40,144
I'm so alone

1018
01:11:40,243 --> 01:11:42,944
Don't have a boyfriend
to call my own

1019
01:11:42,846 --> 01:11:47,045
Oh, won't you please turn on
your magic beam

1020
01:11:46,944 --> 01:11:50,846
Mr. Sandman, bring us a dream

1021
01:11:50,747 --> 01:11:54,347
It is hard to imagine

1022
01:11:54,247 --> 01:11:59,149
Oh, that nothing at all

1023
01:11:59,050 --> 01:12:01,850
Could be so exciting

1024
01:12:06,550 --> 01:12:08,451
And so much fun

1025
01:12:09,553 --> 01:12:12,152
Oh, heaven

1026
01:12:14,852 --> 01:12:17,254
Is a place

1027
01:12:20,155 --> 01:12:25,055
Where nothing
Oh, nothing

1028
01:12:24,957 --> 01:12:29,958
Can go wrong

1029
01:12:50,465 --> 01:12:52,364
Thank you.

1030
01:12:57,467 --> 01:12:59,766
- Thank you.
- Sure.

1031
01:13:01,367 --> 01:13:04,168
Congratulations, Counselor.

1032
01:13:04,168 --> 01:13:05,569
Congratulations?

1033
01:13:05,569 --> 01:13:10,269
You've survived what I assume to be
your first gay party intact.

1034
01:13:15,572 --> 01:13:16,972
Let me tell you something.

1035
01:13:16,972 --> 01:13:20,071
When you're brought up the way
most people are in this country...

1036
01:13:20,071 --> 01:13:23,373
there's not a whole lot of discussion
about homosexuality...

1037
01:13:23,273 --> 01:13:27,174
or what do you call it,
alternate lifestyles.

1038
01:13:27,175 --> 01:13:30,276
As a kid you're taught
that queers are funny, queers are weird.

1039
01:13:30,075 --> 01:13:33,775
Queers dress up like their mother,
that they're afraid to fight...

1040
01:13:33,776 --> 01:13:36,178
that they're a danger
to little kids.

1041
01:13:36,178 --> 01:13:38,877
That all they want to do
is get into your pants.

1042
01:13:41,979 --> 01:13:46,080
That pretty much sums up the general
thinking, if you want to know the truth.

1043
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:49,980
- Thank you for sharing that with me.
- You're very welcome.

1044
01:13:49,981 --> 01:13:53,183
Let's go over this testimony.
We've got a big day on Monday.

1045
01:13:55,882 --> 01:13:58,682
Okay. First I'll ask you...

1046
01:13:58,683 --> 01:14:00,884
"Can you describe
the circumstances in which...

1047
01:14:00,884 --> 01:14:03,985
you joined the firm Wyant, Wheeler,
Hellerman, Tetlow and Brown?"

1048
01:14:03,985 --> 01:14:05,386
Miller?

1049
01:14:07,587 --> 01:14:10,388
Do you ever pray?

1050
01:14:11,987 --> 01:14:15,588
Andrew, that is not
the answer to the question.

1051
01:14:15,489 --> 01:14:17,190
But, yes, I pray.

1052
01:14:18,090 --> 01:14:21,691
- What do you pray for?
- What do you mean?

1053
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:24,691
I pray that... I don't know!

1054
01:14:24,692 --> 01:14:29,693
I pray my baby is healthy.
I pray my wife made it through delivery.

1055
01:14:29,593 --> 01:14:31,493
I pray the Phillies
win the pennant.

1056
01:14:33,394 --> 01:14:35,694
Now, can we go through
these questions?

1057
01:14:35,694 --> 01:14:38,695
Number one: "Can you describe
the circumstances in which...

1058
01:14:38,695 --> 01:14:42,495
you joined the firm Wyant, Wheeler,
Hellerman, Tetlow and Brown?"

1059
01:14:42,397 --> 01:14:43,998
Can you do that for me?

1060
01:14:44,098 --> 01:14:47,898
There's a possibility I won't be around
to see the end of this trial.

1061
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,999
Yes, I've considered that.

1062
01:14:50,899 --> 01:14:56,399
I've made some provisions
in my will for some charities.

1063
01:14:57,402 --> 01:15:00,001
Miguel will need a lawyer.
I know it's not your area.

1064
01:15:00,702 --> 01:15:02,602
I know a good probate lawyer.

1065
01:15:02,602 --> 01:15:05,904
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Now...

1066
01:15:05,804 --> 01:15:09,203
"Can you describe
the circumstances in which...

1067
01:15:09,105 --> 01:15:12,505
you joined the firm Wyant, Wheeler,
Hellerman, Tetlow and Brown?"

1068
01:15:18,307 --> 01:15:21,008
Do you mind this music?
Do you like opera?

1069
01:15:24,809 --> 01:15:28,810
I am not that familiar
with opera, Andrew.

1070
01:15:31,210 --> 01:15:34,210
Oh, this is my favorite aria.

1071
01:15:34,812 --> 01:15:36,912
It's Maria Callas.

1072
01:15:38,712 --> 01:15:40,712
It's Andrea Chenier.

1073
01:15:43,015 --> 01:15:45,515
Umberto Giordano.

1074
01:15:48,316 --> 01:15:50,215
This is Madeleine.

1075
01:15:52,317 --> 01:15:55,117
She's saying how...

1076
01:15:55,117 --> 01:16:00,020
during the French Revolution
the mob set fire to her house.

1077
01:16:02,319 --> 01:16:05,621
And her mother died,
saving her.

1078
01:16:05,622 --> 01:16:07,721
She says, "Look!

1079
01:16:07,721 --> 01:16:11,322
The place that cradled me
is burning.

1080
01:16:15,323 --> 01:16:17,224
I am alone."

1081
01:16:24,727 --> 01:16:28,426
Do you hear the heartache
in her voice?

1082
01:16:29,126 --> 01:16:30,527
Can you feel it?

1083
01:16:38,131 --> 01:16:43,032
Now, in come the strings,
and it changes everything.

1084
01:16:42,831 --> 01:16:45,732
It's like the music...
it fills with a hope.

1085
01:16:49,933 --> 01:16:51,935
And that'll change again.
Listen.

1086
01:16:56,035 --> 01:16:57,537
Listen.

1087
01:17:01,137 --> 01:17:04,537
"I bring sorrow
to those who love me."

1088
01:17:04,537 --> 01:17:07,638
Oh, that single cello!

1089
01:17:16,541 --> 01:17:20,843
"It was during this sorrow
that love came to me.

1090
01:17:28,244 --> 01:17:31,045
A voice filled with harmony.

1091
01:17:33,946 --> 01:17:36,248
It said, "Live still.

1092
01:17:39,749 --> 01:17:41,648
I am life.

1093
01:17:44,449 --> 01:17:46,950
Heaven is in your eyes.

1094
01:18:28,462 --> 01:18:33,362
It's everything around you.
It's the blood and the mud.

1095
01:18:33,164 --> 01:18:35,165
I am divine!

1096
01:18:36,764 --> 01:18:38,765
I am oblivion.

1097
01:18:41,566 --> 01:18:43,467
I am the god...

1098
01:18:46,768 --> 01:18:49,766
that comes down from the heavens
to the earth...

1099
01:18:49,767 --> 01:18:53,370
and makes of the earth a heaven.

1100
01:19:04,773 --> 01:19:07,374
I am love.

1101
01:19:09,075 --> 01:19:10,974
I am love."

1102
01:19:29,781 --> 01:19:31,981
Geez, I better get out of here.

1103
01:19:34,181 --> 01:19:37,682
Lisa's...
I told her that, you know...

1104
01:19:40,485 --> 01:19:43,285
I'll look over the Q and A.

1105
01:19:43,285 --> 01:19:45,284
No, you're ready.

1106
01:20:21,396 --> 01:20:22,796
Jesus.

1107
01:20:48,804 --> 01:20:50,303
God.

1108
01:21:28,314 --> 01:21:29,715
Yes, baby.

1109
01:21:32,616 --> 01:21:35,216
Oh, I love you, little Larice.

1110
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:14,445
Place your left hand on the Bible.
Raise your right hand.

1111
01:23:14,446 --> 01:23:17,747
Do you swear to tell the whole truth and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?

1112
01:23:17,747 --> 01:23:19,647
- I do.
- Please be seated.

1113
01:23:24,448 --> 01:23:29,149
Andrew, can you describe
the circumstances in which...

1114
01:23:29,050 --> 01:23:33,450
you joined the firm Wyant, Wheeler,
Hellerman, Tetlow and Brown?

1115
01:23:34,650 --> 01:23:39,152
Wyant, Wheeler
aggressively recruited me.

1116
01:23:39,153 --> 01:23:42,553
They were the most
prestigious firm in Philadelphia...

1117
01:23:42,453 --> 01:23:44,354
full of opportunity.

1118
01:23:44,354 --> 01:23:47,054
And I was impressed
with the partners.

1119
01:23:47,055 --> 01:23:50,556
- Including Charles Wheeler?
- Particularly Charles.

1120
01:23:50,556 --> 01:23:52,555
What impressed you about him?

1121
01:23:52,656 --> 01:23:56,657
He was the kind of lawyer
I thought I wanted to be.

1122
01:23:56,558 --> 01:23:58,557
What kind of lawyer is that?

1123
01:23:58,458 --> 01:24:01,859
Possessed of an encyclopedic
knowledge of the law...

1124
01:24:01,759 --> 01:24:05,560
a razor-sharp litigator,
genuine leader.

1125
01:24:05,461 --> 01:24:09,461
Gifted at bringing out
the very best in others...

1126
01:24:09,361 --> 01:24:13,463
and an awesome ability
to illuminate...

1127
01:24:13,364 --> 01:24:18,564
the most complex of legal concepts
to a colleague, a courtroom...

1128
01:24:18,464 --> 01:24:21,365
to the man in the street.

1129
01:24:21,266 --> 01:24:26,065
The kind of person who can play
three sets of tennis...

1130
01:24:25,965 --> 01:24:27,867
but doesn't sweat.

1131
01:24:27,967 --> 01:24:31,968
Underneath an elegant surface...

1132
01:24:31,869 --> 01:24:34,169
he has an adventurous spirit.

1133
01:24:36,368 --> 01:24:39,269
In the years
you worked at Wyant, Wheeler...

1134
01:24:39,270 --> 01:24:41,870
did you ever tell Charles Wheeler
you were gay?

1135
01:24:41,870 --> 01:24:43,772
No, I didn't.

1136
01:24:43,772 --> 01:24:45,571
Why not?

1137
01:24:45,472 --> 01:24:47,773
You don't bring your personal life
into a law firm.

1138
01:24:47,774 --> 01:24:50,473
You're not supposed to have
a personal life, really.

1139
01:24:50,473 --> 01:24:55,474
Anyway, I did plan
to tell Charles eventually.

1140
01:24:55,375 --> 01:24:57,677
But then something happened...

1141
01:24:57,677 --> 01:24:59,376
at the racket club...

1142
01:24:59,276 --> 01:25:02,176
about three years ago.

1143
01:25:03,078 --> 01:25:05,579
Somebody started telling
some jokes.

1144
01:25:09,879 --> 01:25:14,178
What do you call a woman who has
P.M.S. and E.S.P. at the same time?

1145
01:25:14,081 --> 01:25:16,782
I don't know!
What do you call her?

1146
01:25:16,782 --> 01:25:19,282
A bitch who knows everything.

1147
01:25:19,282 --> 01:25:22,283
Sounds like someone I know.

1148
01:25:22,184 --> 01:25:25,683
Hey, Walter, how does a faggot
fake an orgasm?

1149
01:25:25,683 --> 01:25:28,084
He throws a quart of hot yogurt
on your back!

1150
01:25:31,886 --> 01:25:33,187
That reminds me...

1151
01:25:33,285 --> 01:25:34,686
How'd that make you feel?

1152
01:25:34,586 --> 01:25:35,888
Relieved...

1153
01:25:37,187 --> 01:25:39,888
that I never told him
I was gay.

1154
01:25:41,188 --> 01:25:43,289
Just very relieved.

1155
01:25:44,488 --> 01:25:46,290
All right.

1156
01:25:46,291 --> 01:25:48,490
Are you a good lawyer, Andrew?

1157
01:25:48,490 --> 01:25:50,791
I'm an excellent lawyer.

1158
01:25:50,691 --> 01:25:53,392
What makes you
an excellent lawyer?

1159
01:25:53,392 --> 01:25:55,091
I love the law.

1160
01:25:55,092 --> 01:25:57,494
I know the law.

1161
01:25:57,494 --> 01:25:59,493
I excel at practicing.

1162
01:25:59,493 --> 01:26:02,094
What do you love
about the law, Andrew?

1163
01:26:02,895 --> 01:26:05,896
I... Many things.

1164
01:26:07,797 --> 01:26:09,596
What I love the most?

1165
01:26:09,596 --> 01:26:11,796
Yes.

1166
01:26:13,097 --> 01:26:14,799
Is that
every now and again...

1167
01:26:14,799 --> 01:26:17,999
not often, but occasionally...

1168
01:26:18,899 --> 01:26:21,600
you get to be a part of...

1169
01:26:21,501 --> 01:26:25,301
justice being done.

1170
01:26:27,502 --> 01:26:28,902
That really is...

1171
01:26:29,002 --> 01:26:32,004
quite a thrill
when that happens.

1172
01:26:37,705 --> 01:26:39,605
Thank you, Andrew.

1173
01:26:43,506 --> 01:26:45,608
You said earlier...

1174
01:26:45,509 --> 01:26:51,309
you aspire to be the kind of person
who had an adventurous spirit, correct?

1175
01:26:51,108 --> 01:26:52,908
Something like that.

1176
01:26:53,009 --> 01:26:55,109
Do you take risks?

1177
01:26:55,110 --> 01:26:58,610
In my work, yes.
Calculated risks.

1178
01:26:58,511 --> 01:27:00,211
You have to.

1179
01:27:04,512 --> 01:27:07,914
Did your doctor ever tell you
to reduce stress?

1180
01:27:07,813 --> 01:27:11,015
That long hours
and stressful working conditions...

1181
01:27:11,016 --> 01:27:13,115
might damage the immune system...

1182
01:27:13,115 --> 01:27:16,617
and speed up your illness?

1183
01:27:16,416 --> 01:27:21,115
My doctor mentioned the impact AIDS...
Excuse me.

1184
01:27:22,418 --> 01:27:27,219
My doctor mentioned the impact
stress could have on the immune system.

1185
01:27:27,019 --> 01:27:31,519
Have you ever been
to the Stallion Showcase Cinema...

1186
01:27:31,419 --> 01:27:33,321
on 21st Street?

1187
01:27:44,323 --> 01:27:46,224
I've been to...

1188
01:27:47,625 --> 01:27:49,026
that...

1189
01:27:50,525 --> 01:27:52,227
I've been to that theater...

1190
01:27:53,528 --> 01:27:56,327
three times in my life.

1191
01:27:56,227 --> 01:27:58,428
What kind of movies
do they show there?

1192
01:27:58,428 --> 01:28:00,829
Gay movies.

1193
01:28:00,728 --> 01:28:03,129
Gay pornographic movies?

1194
01:28:03,130 --> 01:28:05,030
Yes.

1195
01:28:05,631 --> 01:28:07,230
Objection, Your Honor.

1196
01:28:08,231 --> 01:28:12,430
Your Honor, this line of questioning
is vital to the issue of credibility.

1197
01:28:13,733 --> 01:28:19,434
Let's see where this is going.
Continue, Counselor.

1198
01:28:19,235 --> 01:28:24,036
Do men have sex with each other
in that theater?

1199
01:28:23,936 --> 01:28:26,736
Some men.

1200
01:28:26,637 --> 01:28:29,836
Have you ever had sex with anyone
in that theater?

1201
01:28:30,538 --> 01:28:31,739
I'm Robert.

1202
01:28:31,739 --> 01:28:33,838
Andy.

1203
01:28:33,838 --> 01:28:35,739
Yes.

1204
01:28:35,740 --> 01:28:37,640
Once.

1205
01:28:37,740 --> 01:28:43,241
When? Approximately what year
did that event take place?

1206
01:28:45,042 --> 01:28:49,344
I guess it was 1984.

1207
01:28:49,144 --> 01:28:52,044
'84, '85.

1208
01:28:52,044 --> 01:28:55,344
Were you aware in 1984, '85...

1209
01:28:55,245 --> 01:28:58,547
that there was a fatal disease
out there called AIDS...

1210
01:28:58,446 --> 01:29:02,447
and that you could contract it
through sexual activity?

1211
01:29:03,647 --> 01:29:06,449
I'd heard of some...
I'd heard of a thing.

1212
01:29:09,749 --> 01:29:12,850
The gay plague, the gay cancer.

1213
01:29:12,851 --> 01:29:16,852
We didn't know
how you could get it...

1214
01:29:16,751 --> 01:29:18,551
or that it killed you.

1215
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:23,154
Do you need a break, Mr. Beckett?

1216
01:29:25,954 --> 01:29:29,053
No. I could use some water, though.

1217
01:29:29,054 --> 01:29:32,455
John, would you
bring Mr. Beckett some water?

1218
01:29:36,257 --> 01:29:38,957
While you were employed at Wyant,
Wheeler you did everything you could...

1219
01:29:38,857 --> 01:29:43,959
to make sure no one knew
that you were an active homosexual.

1220
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:45,059
Correct?

1221
01:29:45,159 --> 01:29:47,260
No.

1222
01:29:47,260 --> 01:29:49,761
That's not correct.
I never lied about it.

1223
01:29:57,363 --> 01:29:59,163
As a homosexual...

1224
01:29:59,163 --> 01:30:04,464
one is often forced to conceal
one's sexuality.

1225
01:30:04,365 --> 01:30:06,566
Isn't that right?

1226
01:30:07,465 --> 01:30:08,865
In some circumstances, yes.

1227
01:30:09,065 --> 01:30:12,566
Isn't it true you've spent your life
pretending to be something you're not...

1228
01:30:12,467 --> 01:30:17,368
so much so that the art
of concealment and dishonesty...

1229
01:30:17,268 --> 01:30:20,268
- has become second nature...
- Your Honor, I object!

1230
01:30:20,269 --> 01:30:21,770
I'll withdraw it,
Your Honor.

1231
01:30:22,969 --> 01:30:26,370
Mr. Beckett, were you living with...

1232
01:30:26,170 --> 01:30:28,271
Miguel Alvarez...

1233
01:30:28,272 --> 01:30:32,173
in 1984 or '85
when you had your...

1234
01:30:33,573 --> 01:30:37,874
anonymous sexual encounter
in the porn theater?

1235
01:30:38,975 --> 01:30:41,176
Yes.

1236
01:30:42,075 --> 01:30:45,677
So you could have infected him,
isn't that right?

1237
01:30:45,678 --> 01:30:48,478
Miguel has not been infected.

1238
01:30:48,378 --> 01:30:50,178
You didn't answer my question.

1239
01:30:50,178 --> 01:30:54,380
You could have infected Mr. Alvarez
at that time. Is that correct?

1240
01:30:58,481 --> 01:31:00,281
Yes.

1241
01:31:00,380 --> 01:31:02,882
You've testified that
the lesions on your face...

1242
01:31:02,783 --> 01:31:06,284
were visible to the people
that you worked with, correct?

1243
01:31:07,382 --> 01:31:08,783
That's right.

1244
01:31:08,684 --> 01:31:13,184
And you contend that when the partners
were made aware of the lesions...

1245
01:31:13,086 --> 01:31:17,185
that they leapt to the conclusion
that you had AIDS and fired you.

1246
01:31:17,085 --> 01:31:18,286
Is that correct?

1247
01:31:20,686 --> 01:31:22,687
As painful as it is...

1248
01:31:24,588 --> 01:31:27,589
to accuse my former colleagues...

1249
01:31:27,590 --> 01:31:31,290
of such reprehensible behavior...

1250
01:31:31,190 --> 01:31:34,891
it is the only conclusion
I could come to.

1251
01:31:34,892 --> 01:31:38,892
Do you have any lesions
on your face at this time?

1252
01:31:40,593 --> 01:31:43,294
One here...

1253
01:31:43,295 --> 01:31:45,295
right by my ear.

1254
01:31:48,095 --> 01:31:50,195
Your Honor,
may I approach the witness?

1255
01:31:50,195 --> 01:31:51,696
Yes, you may.

1256
01:32:03,499 --> 01:32:05,800
Remembering that
you're under oath...

1257
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:08,101
answering truthfully...

1258
01:32:08,101 --> 01:32:12,100
can you see the lesions
on your face in this mirror...

1259
01:32:12,002 --> 01:32:13,602
from three feet away?

1260
01:32:13,602 --> 01:32:15,504
Answering truthfully.

1261
01:32:24,506 --> 01:32:27,006
Well, l...
At the time I was fired...

1262
01:32:26,807 --> 01:32:30,208
I had four lesions,
and they were much bigger.

1263
01:32:30,208 --> 01:32:32,509
Could you answer
the question, please?

1264
01:32:36,909 --> 01:32:40,410
Well, no.
No, I can't really see it.

1265
01:32:44,212 --> 01:32:46,112
No more questions, Your Honor.

1266
01:32:48,213 --> 01:32:51,413
This would be a good time
to break for today.

1267
01:32:51,414 --> 01:32:54,915
- We can reconvene in the morning.
- I hate this case.

1268
01:32:54,814 --> 01:32:58,315
Your Honor, may I have
five minutes in redirect?

1269
01:32:59,215 --> 01:33:03,017
Mr. Beckett, can you go on
for five minutes?

1270
01:33:02,919 --> 01:33:04,316
- Three minutes.
- Yes.

1271
01:33:05,719 --> 01:33:07,617
May I borrow your mirror, please?

1272
01:33:14,821 --> 01:33:19,021
Do you have any lesions on any part
of your body at this time...

1273
01:33:18,921 --> 01:33:21,923
that resemble the lesions
you had on your face...

1274
01:33:22,023 --> 01:33:23,924
at the time that you were fired?

1275
01:33:23,924 --> 01:33:28,123
Yes. On my torso.

1276
01:33:28,024 --> 01:33:30,824
Your torso.
If it please the court...

1277
01:33:30,725 --> 01:33:33,624
I would like to ask Andrew
to remove his shirt...

1278
01:33:33,525 --> 01:33:37,726
so that everyone could get an accurate
idea of what we're talking about.

1279
01:33:37,527 --> 01:33:38,527
Objection.

1280
01:33:38,527 --> 01:33:42,126
Your Honor, it would
unfairly influence the jury.

1281
01:33:42,026 --> 01:33:46,428
Your Honor, if Andrew was forced to use
a wheelchair due to his illness...

1282
01:33:46,330 --> 01:33:48,830
would the defense ask him
to park it outside...

1283
01:33:48,830 --> 01:33:50,830
because it would
unfairly influence the jury?

1284
01:33:50,931 --> 01:33:55,032
We're talking about AIDS, about lesions.
Let's see what we're talking about.

1285
01:33:54,932 --> 01:33:57,633
I'll allow it.

1286
01:33:57,633 --> 01:34:00,732
Mr. Beckett, would you please
remove your shirt?

1287
01:34:11,438 --> 01:34:14,939
My God, what a nightmare!

1288
01:34:14,737 --> 01:34:16,738
He asked for it.

1289
01:34:59,351 --> 01:35:03,253
Can you see the lesions
on your chest in this mirror?

1290
01:35:03,253 --> 01:35:04,652
Yes.

1291
01:35:06,553 --> 01:35:07,951
Thank you.

1292
01:35:17,456 --> 01:35:20,957
Do you swear to tell the whole truth,
so help you God?

1293
01:35:20,957 --> 01:35:22,357
I do.

1294
01:35:22,357 --> 01:35:24,258
Please be seated.

1295
01:35:32,962 --> 01:35:37,462
Mr. Wheeler, were you aware
that Andrew Beckett...

1296
01:35:37,363 --> 01:35:42,162
was suffering from AIDS at the time
of his departure from Wyant, Wheeler?

1297
01:35:41,962 --> 01:35:45,464
- No.
- For absolute clarity...

1298
01:35:45,364 --> 01:35:48,564
did you fire Andrew Beckett...

1299
01:35:48,564 --> 01:35:50,765
because he had AIDS?

1300
01:35:50,766 --> 01:35:55,866
No, I did not fire Andrew Beckett
because he had AIDS.

1301
01:35:55,666 --> 01:36:00,768
Mr. Wheeler, can you explain,
in a way that leaves no doubt...

1302
01:36:00,669 --> 01:36:02,169
why you promoted...

1303
01:36:02,169 --> 01:36:04,770
Andrew Beckett through your firm?

1304
01:36:04,770 --> 01:36:08,970
And then, most importantly...

1305
01:36:08,870 --> 01:36:12,272
why you eventually
asked him to leave?

1306
01:36:14,472 --> 01:36:17,773
If you're the owner
of a major league ball club...

1307
01:36:17,774 --> 01:36:20,873
you recruit the hot rookie.

1308
01:36:20,674 --> 01:36:26,575
And Andy was tremendously promising
as a young attorney.

1309
01:36:26,476 --> 01:36:30,477
Fresh out of Penn.
Crackerjack.

1310
01:36:30,376 --> 01:36:32,579
That's why we went after him.
That's why we hired him.

1311
01:36:32,579 --> 01:36:37,178
And that's why we stuck with him
year after year.

1312
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:40,480
Why did you give him...

1313
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:43,180
opportunity after opportunity?

1314
01:36:43,181 --> 01:36:46,682
Well, when you groom someone...

1315
01:36:46,582 --> 01:36:50,681
the way we groomed Andy,
nurturing him...

1316
01:36:50,682 --> 01:36:55,584
lavishing all kinds of
special treatment on him...

1317
01:36:55,384 --> 01:36:57,685
you make quite an investment.

1318
01:36:57,685 --> 01:37:02,186
We were waiting for the promise
to kick in and deliver.

1319
01:37:01,986 --> 01:37:04,987
But ultimately
we could no longer...

1320
01:37:04,887 --> 01:37:09,989
ignore the gap between
the reality and the promise.

1321
01:37:16,292 --> 01:37:18,190
Thank you, Mr. Wheeler.

1322
01:37:20,891 --> 01:37:23,092
No more questions
at this time, Your Honor.

1323
01:37:23,092 --> 01:37:25,092
Mr. Miller?

1324
01:37:27,095 --> 01:37:27,994
Objection!

1325
01:37:27,994 --> 01:37:31,095
- Your Honor, objection.
- All right, Mr. Miller.

1326
01:37:30,994 --> 01:37:35,495
- That'll be sufficient.
- Mr. Wheeler, you are magnificent.

1327
01:37:35,396 --> 01:37:37,897
You are my hero.

1328
01:37:37,797 --> 01:37:41,697
Andrew is right.
You are the greatest.

1329
01:37:41,698 --> 01:37:43,099
Are you gay?

1330
01:37:44,499 --> 01:37:46,900
Objection.

1331
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:49,999
How dare you!

1332
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,001
Witness will kindly answer.

1333
01:37:55,801 --> 01:37:59,202
No, I am not a homosexual.

1334
01:37:59,103 --> 01:38:01,504
Isn't it true that
when you realized...

1335
01:38:01,504 --> 01:38:04,805
Andrew Beckett... your golden boy,
your future senior partner...

1336
01:38:04,805 --> 01:38:06,805
was gay and had AIDS...

1337
01:38:06,705 --> 01:38:11,006
it drove a stake of fear
right through your heterosexual heart?

1338
01:38:10,908 --> 01:38:12,406
Remembering...

1339
01:38:12,406 --> 01:38:16,207
all the hugs and handshakes,
the intimate moments in the sauna...

1340
01:38:16,109 --> 01:38:19,310
the friendly pats on the backside
that you and Andrew exchanged...

1341
01:38:19,210 --> 01:38:20,510
like guys exchange.

1342
01:38:20,410 --> 01:38:25,110
It made you say, "My God!

1343
01:38:25,011 --> 01:38:26,711
What does this say about me?"

1344
01:38:26,711 --> 01:38:28,712
Objection, Your Honor.

1345
01:38:31,312 --> 01:38:34,212
The witness will please
respond to the question.

1346
01:38:36,015 --> 01:38:38,614
You may tap dance around me
all you wish...

1347
01:38:38,514 --> 01:38:42,214
with your innuendoes
and locker room fantasies.

1348
01:38:42,215 --> 01:38:45,717
But the truth still remains
that your client...

1349
01:38:45,617 --> 01:38:47,917
worked when he wanted to work...

1350
01:38:47,817 --> 01:38:52,417
telling us what he thought we needed
to know about who he really was.

1351
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:54,820
Andy insisted on bending the rules...

1352
01:38:54,820 --> 01:38:59,619
and his work suffered tremendously
in the long run as a result of that.

1353
01:38:59,521 --> 01:39:03,922
Explain this like I'm a six-year-old,
'cause I just don't get it.

1354
01:39:03,721 --> 01:39:07,922
Who makes these rules that
you're talking about? You?

1355
01:39:07,923 --> 01:39:13,124
Read your Bible, Mr. Miller,
Old and New Testament.

1356
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:15,325
Pretty valuable rules in there.

1357
01:39:15,326 --> 01:39:17,326
Excuse me.

1358
01:39:20,427 --> 01:39:22,627
Excuse... I can't...

1359
01:39:26,929 --> 01:39:28,628
Excuse me!

1360
01:39:28,529 --> 01:39:30,629
Christ's sakes, somebody get a doctor!

1361
01:39:32,331 --> 01:39:35,531
What is it?
Turn over now.

1362
01:39:35,531 --> 01:39:38,731
- Call an ambulance, please?
- Right away.

1363
01:39:38,731 --> 01:39:41,932
An ambulance, please!
Let him breathe.

1364
01:39:41,833 --> 01:39:44,634
Please make room for him.

1365
01:39:47,634 --> 01:39:49,834
It's not working.

1366
01:39:49,835 --> 01:39:51,536
- Please, sir!
- It's not working!

1367
01:39:51,436 --> 01:39:54,137
- They know how to save him.
- It is making him worse!

1368
01:39:57,238 --> 01:40:01,238
Did you notice any changes
whatsoever in Andrew's appearance...

1369
01:40:01,038 --> 01:40:04,439
over the course of the year
leading up to his termination?

1370
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:08,139
Yes. I did.

1371
01:40:08,140 --> 01:40:11,143
Were these changes for the better
or for the worse?

1372
01:40:11,143 --> 01:40:15,443
Sometimes for the better,
but generally they were for the worse.

1373
01:40:15,344 --> 01:40:19,743
Mr. Seidman, what did you think caused
these changes in Andy's appearance?

1374
01:40:21,444 --> 01:40:23,945
I was afraid.

1375
01:40:25,445 --> 01:40:27,646
I suspected Andy had AIDS.

1376
01:40:28,846 --> 01:40:32,047
- Order.
- Thank you. Your witness.

1377
01:40:31,948 --> 01:40:34,748
- Miss Conine?
- Mr. Seidman...

1378
01:40:34,648 --> 01:40:37,948
did you share your suspicions
with Mr. Wheeler...

1379
01:40:37,850 --> 01:40:41,850
or any of the other managing partners
at any time...

1380
01:40:41,750 --> 01:40:45,050
before the decision
to fire Andrew Beckett was made?

1381
01:40:45,050 --> 01:40:47,351
No. I didn't.

1382
01:40:47,351 --> 01:40:49,654
I didn't mention it to anyone...

1383
01:40:49,655 --> 01:40:51,553
not even Andy.

1384
01:40:51,553 --> 01:40:53,954
I didn't even give him a chance
to talk about it.

1385
01:40:56,654 --> 01:40:59,454
And I think
I'm going to regret that...

1386
01:40:59,357 --> 01:41:01,656
for as long as I live.

1387
01:41:01,656 --> 01:41:04,856
- Any more questions, Miss Conine?
- That's all, Your Honor.

1388
01:41:04,856 --> 01:41:09,658
They are sayin'he wasn't
a good lawyer. He was mediocre.

1389
01:41:09,559 --> 01:41:14,559
And the fact that they gave him the most
important lawsuit they ever had...

1390
01:41:14,460 --> 01:41:16,560
for one of their most
important clients...

1391
01:41:16,462 --> 01:41:21,162
They say that doesn't prove anything
because that was just a test.

1392
01:41:21,061 --> 01:41:24,163
- What'd they call it? A carrot?
- Yeah. "What's up, Doc?"

1393
01:41:24,064 --> 01:41:28,264
To see if he'd rise to the occasion.
Okay.

1394
01:41:28,163 --> 01:41:31,165
Say I gotta send a pilot
into enemy territory...

1395
01:41:31,064 --> 01:41:34,265
and he's gonna be flyin' a plane
that costs $350 million.

1396
01:41:35,665 --> 01:41:38,267
Who am I gonna put in that plane?

1397
01:41:38,267 --> 01:41:43,367
Some rookie who can't cut it so
I can see if he is up to the challenge?

1398
01:41:43,168 --> 01:41:47,369
Or am I gonna give that assignment
to my best pilot...

1399
01:41:47,168 --> 01:41:50,369
my sharpest, my most experienced,
my top gun...

1400
01:41:50,370 --> 01:41:52,870
the very best I got?

1401
01:41:52,770 --> 01:41:55,271
I just don't get that.

1402
01:41:55,871 --> 01:41:58,473
Would somebody please
explain it to me...

1403
01:41:59,973 --> 01:42:01,974
like I'm a six-year-old?

1404
01:42:03,574 --> 01:42:06,374
- Juror number six?
- I agree.

1405
01:42:06,375 --> 01:42:09,376
- Juror number seven?
- I agree.

1406
01:42:11,576 --> 01:42:13,977
- Juror number nine?
- I agree.

1407
01:42:13,978 --> 01:42:16,179
Juror number ten?

1408
01:42:16,179 --> 01:42:19,079
- I disagree.
- Juror number 11?

1409
01:42:19,079 --> 01:42:21,679
- I agree.
- Juror number 12?

1410
01:42:21,679 --> 01:42:23,879
Agree.

1411
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:25,780
Have you awarded any damages?

1412
01:42:26,781 --> 01:42:29,183
Yes, Your Honor, we have.

1413
01:42:29,183 --> 01:42:34,682
For back pay and loss of benefits
we award $143,000.

1414
01:42:34,383 --> 01:42:39,184
For mental anguish and humiliation
we award $100,000.

1415
01:42:38,983 --> 01:42:43,185
And for punitive damages
we award $4,782,000.

1416
01:42:48,288 --> 01:42:50,488
You may record the verdict.

1417
01:42:51,287 --> 01:42:54,489
Everyone remain seated
until the jury is removed.

1418
01:42:54,489 --> 01:42:56,590
How could they do that?

1419
01:43:00,091 --> 01:43:02,491
This trial is now concluded.

1420
01:43:06,593 --> 01:43:08,193
Congratulations!

1421
01:43:09,192 --> 01:43:11,894
We'll strain ourselves
getting a reversal on this one.

1422
01:43:11,894 --> 01:43:14,294
- We'll get started in the morning.
- Well, that's that.

1423
01:43:14,295 --> 01:43:18,295
Congratulations, Mr. Miller.
I'll see you at the appeal.

1424
01:43:18,196 --> 01:43:20,197
Congratulations.
Well done.

1425
01:43:22,797 --> 01:43:26,198
Oh, man.
Thanks a lot.

1426
01:43:26,098 --> 01:43:28,398
- I'll see ya at the hospital.
- Okay.

1427
01:43:36,101 --> 01:43:38,003
Oh, Mr. Miller.
Hi. How you doin'?

1428
01:43:38,003 --> 01:43:39,901
- You know where the room is?
- Down the hall.

1429
01:43:39,902 --> 01:43:42,602
- Right there.
- The one off...

1430
01:43:42,602 --> 01:43:43,904
Thanks.

1431
01:43:45,304 --> 01:43:48,005
If he leaves the hospital,
which is unlikely...

1432
01:43:47,904 --> 01:43:52,406
don't expect him to be
remotely like he was before this crisis.

1433
01:43:53,105 --> 01:43:55,805
He's lost the vision
in his right eye...

1434
01:43:55,705 --> 01:43:59,607
and because of the C.M.V.
He will not regain his vision.

1435
01:44:00,308 --> 01:44:05,309
- Next door, to the right.
- The C.M.V. Has ravaged his body.

1436
01:44:12,212 --> 01:44:13,912
Hi. Congratulations.

1437
01:44:14,012 --> 01:44:15,613
Hey. Way to go.

1438
01:44:15,613 --> 01:44:17,513
Man of the hour.

1439
01:44:24,815 --> 01:44:26,516
Hey, Joe.

1440
01:44:27,517 --> 01:44:30,616
We are so grateful to you.
You were wonderful. Thank you so much.

1441
01:44:30,517 --> 01:44:32,518
- Can I take that for you?
- Yeah. I brought some...

1442
01:44:32,619 --> 01:44:37,019
- Oh, wonderful.
- Cheese and stuff.

1443
01:44:59,925 --> 01:45:01,525
How ya doin'?

1444
01:45:12,028 --> 01:45:15,129
What do you call
a thousand lawyers...

1445
01:45:14,929 --> 01:45:17,730
chained together
at the bottom of the ocean?

1446
01:45:18,630 --> 01:45:20,631
I don't know.

1447
01:45:20,631 --> 01:45:22,831
A good start.

1448
01:45:32,335 --> 01:45:34,435
Excellent work, Counselor.

1449
01:45:37,137 --> 01:45:39,035
I thank you.

1450
01:45:39,938 --> 01:45:42,338
It was great working with you...

1451
01:45:42,338 --> 01:45:44,338
Counselor.

1452
01:46:15,447 --> 01:46:17,247
I'd better go.

1453
01:46:20,248 --> 01:46:22,449
Yeah. Sure thing.

1454
01:46:23,850 --> 01:46:25,350
I'll see you later?

1455
01:46:29,452 --> 01:46:31,751
Thanks for stopping by.

1456
01:46:34,853 --> 01:46:36,454
I'll see you again.

1457
01:46:45,957 --> 01:46:47,855
I'll keep it on ice for you.

1458
01:46:51,158 --> 01:46:52,658
See you.

1459
01:46:52,758 --> 01:46:54,659
I just want to say thank you.

1460
01:46:59,361 --> 01:47:02,161
We really appreciate it.
We'll see you again?

1461
01:47:10,664 --> 01:47:12,963
He's a fighter.

1462
01:47:12,964 --> 01:47:15,065
We just want to get him home.

1463
01:47:17,366 --> 01:47:18,765
Thank you, Joe.

1464
01:47:45,773 --> 01:47:50,374
What do you call a thousand lawyers
chained at the bottom of the ocean?

1465
01:47:50,275 --> 01:47:53,476
- A good start?
- Very amusing.

1466
01:47:55,478 --> 01:47:57,978
I'll see you tomorrow, buddy.
Okay?

1467
01:48:09,780 --> 01:48:11,681
God bless you, Andy.

1468
01:48:16,184 --> 01:48:18,182
Good night, son.

1469
01:48:18,182 --> 01:48:19,684
Try to get some rest, okay?

1470
01:48:20,784 --> 01:48:22,585
I love you, Andy.

1471
01:48:22,585 --> 01:48:24,486
I love you too, Dad.

1472
01:48:27,985 --> 01:48:29,986
See you first thing tomorrow.

1473
01:48:50,393 --> 01:48:52,393
Hey. It's okay.

1474
01:48:52,393 --> 01:48:54,894
- Don't worry.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

1475
01:48:57,195 --> 01:48:58,594
Come on, sweetheart.

1476
01:49:00,095 --> 01:49:04,796
It's all right.
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

1477
01:49:09,698 --> 01:49:11,798
Good night, my angel.

1478
01:49:13,399 --> 01:49:15,299
My sweet boy.

1479
01:50:12,117 --> 01:50:14,716
No, let me help you.

1480
01:50:23,120 --> 01:50:24,720
Miguel...

1481
01:50:29,022 --> 01:50:30,322
I'm ready.

1482
01:50:48,427 --> 01:50:49,728
Hello?

1483
01:50:51,128 --> 01:50:52,728
Joe, it's Miguel.

1484
01:50:54,730 --> 01:50:56,330
Hello?

1485
01:51:07,033 --> 01:51:09,032

I know I'll be all right

01:51:43,041 --> 01:51:47,542
I've got my friends in the world

1491
01:51:47,443 --> 01:51:50,544
I had my friends

1492
01:51:50,445 --> 01:51:54,646
When we were boys and girls

1493
01:51:54,547 --> 01:51:59,248
And the secrets came unfurled

1494
01:52:00,048 --> 01:52:01,648
Look at my boy.

1495
01:52:32,858 --> 01:52:34,958
Oh, hi.
Yes, I know.

01:52:56,664 --> 01:53:01,565
I don't wanna be alone

Love lasts forever

1501
01:53:05,867 --> 01:53:10,468
Someone is talkin'to me

1502
01:53:10,369 --> 01:53:13,368
Calling my name

1503
01:53:13,368 --> 01:53:17,469
Tell me I'm not to blame

1504
01:53:17,369 --> 01:53:22,371
I won't be ashamed of love
