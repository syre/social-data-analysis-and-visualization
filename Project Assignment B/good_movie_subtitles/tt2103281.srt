1
00:01:00,603 --> 00:01:04,315
<i>If you have a fever and cough
or sore throat...</i>

2
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:05,942
<i>stay home.</i>

3
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:09,154
<i>I'd say 95% chance this is manufactured.
Came out of a laboratory.</i>

4
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,030
<i>The source of the virus was traced back...</i>

5
00:01:11,197 --> 00:01:14,492
<i>to drug testing done at
Gen-Sys Laboratories in San Francisco.</i>

6
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:16,870
<i>The lab technician now known
as Patient Zero...</i>

7
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:20,790
<i>was accidentally exposed to
retrovirus ALZ-113...</i>

8
00:01:20,957 --> 00:01:23,668
<i>an Alzheimer's trial drug
that was being tested on chimpanzees.</i>

9
00:01:23,835 --> 00:01:27,005
<i>The infected chimps showed signs
of erratic and aggressive behavior...</i>

10
00:01:27,172 --> 00:01:28,965
<i>that led to their escape from the facility.</i>

11
00:01:29,132 --> 00:01:31,342
<i>The now-famous incident
on the Golden Gate Bridge...</i>

12
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:33,386
<i>a six-hour standoff with police...</i>

13
00:01:33,553 --> 00:01:36,055
<i>ended with the apes disappearing
into Muir woods.</i>

14
00:01:36,222 --> 00:01:39,809
<i>Emergency rooms are being overwhelmed
with patients showing signs...</i>

15
00:01:39,976 --> 00:01:41,728
<i>of what's being dubbed
"The Simian Flu."</i>

16
00:01:41,895 --> 00:01:44,063
<i>The CDC is projecting a fatality toll...</i>

17
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,567
<i>ranging from 5 million
to as many as 150 million...</i>

18
00:01:47,734 --> 00:01:48,985
<i>in the next 6 to 8 months.</i>

19
00:01:49,152 --> 00:01:53,531
<i>Anyone showing signs of a contagious illness
will receive special treatment here...</i>

20
00:01:53,698 --> 00:01:56,159
<i>the airport's purpose-built
quarantine center.</i>

21
00:01:56,326 --> 00:02:00,246
<i>Many of the new arrivals are children
who have lost contact with their parents.</i>

22
00:02:00,413 --> 00:02:02,874
<i>The mandatory quarantines
have sparked civil unrest.</i>

23
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:04,918
<i>Families are being ripped apart.</i>

24
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:06,586
<i>Containment is not very likely.</i>

25
00:02:06,753 --> 00:02:09,380
<i>Prepare your families.
Know your evacuation route.</i>

26
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:12,926
<i>The survival rate is now
approximately 1 in 500.</i>

27
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:15,178
<i>Violence erupted in the
city center tonight.</i>

28
00:02:15,345 --> 00:02:16,745
<i>The third incident in as many days.</i>

29
00:02:16,846 --> 00:02:19,224
<i>Martial law has been
declared in 28 nations...</i>

30
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,100
<i>including the U.S. and Canada.</i>

31
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:23,770
<i>The reactor is overheating.
We can't stop a meltdown.</i>

32
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:28,775
<i>Just a total collapse of anything
resembling civilian order.</i>

33
00:02:28,942 --> 00:02:31,402
<i>Due to the extremity of the
Simian Flu crisis...</i>

34
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:35,281
<i>all regular government functions
have been suspended indefinitely.</i>

35
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:40,453
<i>Those who aren't killed by the virus...</i>

36
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,455
<i>will probably die in the fighting.</i>

37
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:46,709
<i>So, maybe this is it.</i>

38
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:48,920
<i>This is how it ends.</i>

39
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:50,588
<i>Pretty soon...</i>

40
00:02:51,798 --> 00:02:53,758
<i>there won't be anyone left.</i>

41
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:00,533
Caesar...

42
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:02,201
They are close.

43
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:06,748
Koba!

44
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:28,853
Now, father?

45
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,919
Son, stay...

46
00:06:51,746 --> 00:06:53,998
Thank you, Koba.

47
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:18,689
Think before you act, son.

48
00:08:23,254 --> 00:08:25,298
Don't feel bad, Blue Eyes...

49
00:08:28,718 --> 00:08:31,762
Scars make you strong.

50
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:51,861
Come meet your new brother.

51
00:11:07,877 --> 00:11:09,253
Another son.

52
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:17,928
Makes me think how far we've come,
Maurice.

53
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:24,935
Seems long ago.

54
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:31,150
Still think about them?

55
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:33,611
Humans?

56
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,032
Sometimes.

57
00:11:41,077 --> 00:11:43,788
Didn't know them like you did.

58
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:48,376
Only saw their bad side.

59
00:11:49,085 --> 00:11:53,130
Good, bad... doesn't matter now.

60
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:56,967
Humans destroyed each other.

61
00:11:57,885 --> 00:11:59,845
Apes fight too.

62
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:02,807
But we are family.

63
00:12:09,105 --> 00:12:12,900
Wonder if they're really all gone.

64
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:15,361
Ten winters now...

65
00:12:15,486 --> 00:12:19,156
Last two... no sign of them.

66
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:22,159
They must be gone.

67
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:56,902
That bear wouldn't get me Blue Eyes.
I'm quick!

68
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:59,113
Shut up, Ash!

69
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:11,584
Oh, God.

70
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:13,461
It's okay.

71
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:27,183
It's okay. It's okay.

72
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:28,392
Freeze!

73
00:13:43,741 --> 00:13:44,742
Stay!

74
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:46,160
Help!

75
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,329
Help!

76
00:13:48,496 --> 00:13:49,497
No!

77
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:51,832
Hey!

78
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:54,418
Over here!

79
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,256
I shot him! I shot him.

80
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:33,958
They shot Ash! Shot my son!

81
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:37,127
Rocket, wait...

82
00:14:43,092 --> 00:14:45,094
We don't mean any harm!

83
00:14:45,261 --> 00:14:49,139
They're apes, man. You think
they understand what you're saying?

84
00:14:50,391 --> 00:14:52,142
Do they look like just apes to you?

85
00:15:05,823 --> 00:15:06,657
Dad.

86
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:07,658
Malcolm, what are you doing?

87
00:15:07,825 --> 00:15:09,076
- Dad?
- Malcolm.

88
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:10,327
It's okay.

89
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,334
Put your guns down.

90
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:19,336
- You can't be serious.
- Do it.

91
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,180
Go!

92
00:15:32,141 --> 00:15:33,100
Holy shit.

93
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:34,268
Holy shit.

94
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:39,356
Okay. Okay, we're going.

95
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:40,858
Go!

96
00:15:41,025 --> 00:15:42,651
Slowly.
Go, go, go!

97
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:48,115
My bag!

98
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:49,283
Go!

99
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,138
Koba!

100
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:14,308
Follow!

101
00:17:00,104 --> 00:17:01,313
Did you find it?

102
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:03,774
We need to talk.

103
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:06,819
What? What's wrong?

104
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:10,114
The dam is pretty much intact.

105
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,199
It could probably start generating
power for us within a week.

106
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,785
But there is a problem. Get in.

107
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,548
I shot him.

108
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:29,693
I was scared.
I didn't know what to do.

109
00:17:29,717 --> 00:17:32,720
Jesus Christ.
How many were there?

110
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:33,971
A lot. Like, 80.

111
00:17:34,138 --> 00:17:35,305
- At least.
- Okay...

112
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:39,226
you're not hearing what he's saying.
They spoke!

113
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:40,811
That is not possible.

114
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:42,855
I'm telling you, Dreyfus,
they did and it was incredible.

115
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:45,733
Incredible? They're talking apes!

116
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:47,901
- With big-ass spears!
- Please!

117
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:51,864
I don't know exactly what you think
you saw or heard...

118
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:54,533
but you have to calm down, okay?

119
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:57,828
What about the virus, Ellie?
Any chance of contagion?

120
00:17:57,995 --> 00:18:01,165
We're all genetically immune
or we would've been dead a long time ago.

121
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:02,541
You don't know that for sure.

122
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,069
She worked with the CDC.
She knows.

123
00:18:04,168 --> 00:18:05,008
What are we gonna do?

124
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:06,837
I don't know.

125
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:08,881
We need that power.

126
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:11,008
He could've killed us, but he didn't.

127
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:13,719
Maybe he kept us alive,
so they could follow us.

128
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:16,847
They find out where we are,
and they kill us all!

129
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:18,307
What do you mean, "he"?

130
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,017
That's what we're trying to tell you.

131
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:23,020
It was unlike anything you've
ever seen before, and the leader...

132
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,647
He was remarkable.

133
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:26,899
Really?

134
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:29,157
- Is that what you thought?
- It's what we saw.

135
00:18:29,193 --> 00:18:30,360
Yeah, it's what we all saw.

136
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,821
Not a word of this back at the colony,
you understand me?

137
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:34,789
Not a word
until we can figure out what to do.

138
00:18:34,907 --> 00:18:37,409
- You gotta be kidding.
- No, I'm not kidding.

139
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:40,913
I don't want to create a panic.

140
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:01,391
How are you doing, pal?
Are you okay?

141
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:03,560
- I dropped my bag.
- I know.

142
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:05,729
- Was your sketchbook in there?
- It's gone.

143
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:09,107
Carver just told me we're not gonna tell
anybody what happened up there.

144
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:10,943
Not yet. No.

145
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:39,930
Must attack them now!

146
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:42,140
Before they attack us!

147
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:44,852
We don't know how many there are.

148
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:47,354
How many guns they have?

149
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:51,441
Or why they came up here?

150
00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:01,368
They shot your son, Rocket!

151
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,328
Don't you want to fight?

152
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:07,332
I follow Caesar.

153
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:10,878
Koba's right!

154
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:14,840
They almost killed you, Ash!

155
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:21,263
No!

156
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:28,812
If we go to war...

157
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:32,649
We could lose all we've built...

158
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:36,403
Home.

159
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:40,991
Family.

160
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:50,626
Future.

161
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:00,218
I will decide by morning.

162
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:12,814
Caesar.

163
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:22,282
For years I was a prisoner in their lab...

164
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:24,284
They cut me...

165
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:25,702
Tortured me.

166
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:29,706
You freed me.

167
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:34,044
I would do anything you ask.

168
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:38,882
But we must show strength!

169
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:43,887
We will, Koba.

170
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,890
Coming through. Coming through.

171
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:52,289
That's a hell of a lot more than eighty!

172
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:22,152
Malcolm!

173
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,726
Apes...

174
00:23:56,561 --> 00:24:00,690
do not want war...

175
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:04,694
but Will fight...

176
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:08,824
if we must.

177
00:24:40,564 --> 00:24:43,608
Ape home.

178
00:24:45,068 --> 00:24:49,406
Human home.

179
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:57,205
Do not come back.

180
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:38,455
Everyone!

181
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:43,126
Everyone, you have to calm down!

182
00:25:49,841 --> 00:25:51,801
Everybody.

183
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:54,471
Everybody!

184
00:25:54,638 --> 00:25:58,308
Please! We're all immune!

185
00:25:58,475 --> 00:26:02,854
We're all immune,
or we wouldn't still be here!

186
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:04,481
How did they find us?

187
00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:06,942
We found them.

188
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:09,486
- You knew they were out there!
- What if they come back?

189
00:26:09,653 --> 00:26:11,446
Yeah!

190
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:14,282
If they come back...
If they come back...

191
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:17,494
they'll be sorry they ever did!

192
00:26:18,161 --> 00:26:20,622
Now, this city may not have the
manpower it once did...

193
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:23,667
but it has the firepower.

194
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:26,294
Those stockpiles left behind...

195
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:31,049
by FEMA, the National Guard,
we have it all.

196
00:26:31,216 --> 00:26:33,009
Look...

197
00:26:34,636 --> 00:26:37,013
I know why you're scared.

198
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:41,518
I'm scared, too, believe me.

199
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:45,397
But I recognize the trust
you've all placed in me.

200
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:48,858
We've been through hell together.

201
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:54,364
But you all know
what we're up against.

202
00:26:57,284 --> 00:27:00,120
We're almost out of fuel.

203
00:27:00,912 --> 00:27:03,373
Which means no more power...

204
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:07,043
which means we could slip back
to the way things were.

205
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:11,214
That dam up there was the answer.

206
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:15,302
We just had no idea
they were up there, too.

207
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:16,469
So, what do we do now?

208
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:18,722
Yeah!

209
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:21,725
We find another way...

210
00:27:23,268 --> 00:27:25,562
because that power...

211
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:27,397
is not just about keeping the lights on.

212
00:27:27,731 --> 00:27:30,108
It's about giving us the tools...

213
00:27:30,275 --> 00:27:32,610
to reconnect to the rest of the world.

214
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:35,655
To find out who else is out there...

215
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:40,076
so that we can start to rebuild...

216
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:43,830
and reclaim...

217
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:49,502
the world we lost.

218
00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:55,800
That was a great speech.

219
00:27:57,927 --> 00:28:00,847
There is no alternative power source.

220
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:04,976
That dam is the only option.

221
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:12,359
Well, then, we fight them.

222
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:18,323
We're two weeks away
from running out of fuel.

223
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:19,532
Maybe three, tops.

224
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:20,784
I know.

225
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,119
And once that happens...

226
00:28:23,286 --> 00:28:25,872
I won't be able to go out
there with a bullhorn...

227
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:28,333
and calm everybody down.

228
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:32,796
We need that power
to get the radio transmitter working.

229
00:28:32,962 --> 00:28:36,383
It's our only chance
of reaching the outside world.

230
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:38,510
We have to find other survivors.

231
00:28:38,676 --> 00:28:41,679
Yeah. There's not that many of us left.

232
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:44,474
We can't afford any more casualties.

233
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:47,310
We founded this place...

234
00:28:47,811 --> 00:28:49,813
- you and I...
- I know.

235
00:28:50,188 --> 00:28:53,983
On the idea that power would lead us back
to the life we once had.

236
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:56,736
If we can't stick together,
maybe we can't survive.

237
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,322
I lost everything.

238
00:29:00,865 --> 00:29:04,828
The idea of losing what little I have is...

239
00:29:07,664 --> 00:29:08,998
I want to go back up there.

240
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:13,878
Listen to me. Give me three days.

241
00:29:14,045 --> 00:29:16,047
Let me talk to him.
If it doesn't work, then we do it your way.

242
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:18,508
And what if it backfires?
What if he gets violent?

243
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:22,387
I mean, how do you know
that he'll even understand you?

244
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:28,435
He's more than just an ape.

245
00:29:30,353 --> 00:29:32,856
I'm gonna take some men
up to Fort Point.

246
00:29:33,022 --> 00:29:34,899
I'm gonna go through the armory.

247
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:37,735
I'm gonna see what's still working.

248
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:40,280
Three days.

249
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:41,727
You're not back in three days...

250
00:29:41,865 --> 00:29:45,368
we're going up there, and we're
gonna kill every last one of them.

251
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:04,012
Carver is getting the trucks ready.

252
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:06,890
He'll be here with Foster and Kemp
any minute.

253
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,518
You're really taking Carver?
I mean, he shot one of them.

254
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:11,936
I don't really have any choice.

255
00:30:12,103 --> 00:30:16,941
He used to work at the water department. He's
the only one who knows how the dam works.

256
00:30:18,568 --> 00:30:19,903
Malcolm...

257
00:30:20,069 --> 00:30:23,656
what are you gonna do up there?
What are you gonna say?

258
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:27,827
I'll tell him the truth.

259
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:30,830
Hope I catch him in a good mood.

260
00:30:36,002 --> 00:30:38,046
You think I'm crazy.

261
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:40,882
I'm worried.

262
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:43,801
Yeah, so am I.

263
00:30:44,802 --> 00:30:47,263
I've gone over it in my head...

264
00:30:48,515 --> 00:30:51,601
and I think if I don't at least try this...

265
00:30:52,894 --> 00:30:54,979
there's gonna be a war.

266
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:18,336
Take me with you.

267
00:31:18,503 --> 00:31:20,797
What if someone gets hurt?
You'll need me there.

268
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:26,302
I love you.

269
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,597
But I need you to stay here.

270
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,934
I don't want Alexander to be alone.

271
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:35,353
I'm coming, too.

272
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:40,316
Son, it's not safe.

273
00:31:41,693 --> 00:31:43,695
But I'm safer with you
than I am down here.

274
00:31:44,612 --> 00:31:46,364
I'm coming.

275
00:31:46,531 --> 00:31:47,824
Please.

276
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:18,479
No one gets out of the trucks.

277
00:32:18,813 --> 00:32:20,398
No one.

278
00:32:20,857 --> 00:32:24,360
If I'm not back in two hours,
you get everyone back to the city.

279
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:27,113
It's gonna be okay.

280
00:35:29,295 --> 00:35:32,298
Please. Please. Please.

281
00:35:35,593 --> 00:35:37,220
Please don't kill me.

282
00:35:37,804 --> 00:35:40,723
Just hear what I have to say.

283
00:35:41,682 --> 00:35:43,100
I know.

284
00:35:44,936 --> 00:35:48,105
"Don't come back." I know.

285
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:50,316
I wouldn't be here unless it were...

286
00:35:50,483 --> 00:35:52,276
Okay! Okay! Okay!

287
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:59,116
Okay, okay, okay.

288
00:36:00,618 --> 00:36:03,412
I need to show you something.

289
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:04,664
It's not far.

290
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:06,249
Human lies!

291
00:36:06,499 --> 00:36:08,751
No! No!

292
00:36:10,962 --> 00:36:13,047
No, no, no. I swear.

293
00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:18,928
If I could just show you,
then you'll understand.

294
00:36:19,095 --> 00:36:20,638
Please.

295
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,578
Show me.

296
00:37:06,684 --> 00:37:10,396
This is what we used to call
a "small hydro."

297
00:37:10,563 --> 00:37:13,316
it was built to service
areas to the north of here...

298
00:37:13,482 --> 00:37:16,652
but we've been working to
reroute the power lines to the city...

299
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:19,405
because the city used to run off nuclear
power, but that ran out years ago.

300
00:37:19,572 --> 00:37:21,991
So, we've been using
diesel generators and gasifiers.

301
00:37:22,158 --> 00:37:24,911
But if we can just
get this dam working...

302
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:29,373
then we have a shot
at restoring limited power.

303
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:39,425
Is any of this making any sense to you?

304
00:37:40,551 --> 00:37:43,429
The... lights.

305
00:37:43,596 --> 00:37:45,348
Yes.

306
00:37:46,432 --> 00:37:47,516
The lights.

307
00:37:48,851 --> 00:37:50,394
This is your home...

308
00:37:50,561 --> 00:37:53,230
and I don't want to take it away from you,
I promise.

309
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:57,985
But if you can let us do our work here...

310
00:37:58,152 --> 00:38:00,029
You brought others?

311
00:38:04,367 --> 00:38:05,743
Just a few.

312
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:08,537
I'm not a threat.

313
00:38:08,704 --> 00:38:10,164
If I am...

314
00:38:10,873 --> 00:38:13,584
then I guess you can kill me.

315
00:38:38,401 --> 00:38:40,903
Come on!

316
00:38:41,946 --> 00:38:45,074
- Wait, wait, wait!
- Stop, stop.

317
00:38:57,169 --> 00:38:58,754
We need to give them our guns.

318
00:39:00,756 --> 00:39:02,925
That's the one condition.

319
00:39:03,509 --> 00:39:04,593
What does that mean?

320
00:39:05,511 --> 00:39:07,388
We can stay.

321
00:39:22,236 --> 00:39:25,322
If they get power, they'll
be more dangerous!

322
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,324
Why help them?!

323
00:39:27,575 --> 00:39:29,660
They seem desperate...

324
00:39:30,453 --> 00:39:33,122
If we make them go, they'll attack.

325
00:39:33,456 --> 00:39:35,416
Let them.

326
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:39,003
We'll destroy them while they're weak.

327
00:39:40,046 --> 00:39:43,049
And how many apes will die?

328
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:48,637
We have one chance for peace...

329
00:39:49,221 --> 00:39:52,183
Let them do their human work.
Then they'll go.

330
00:39:54,435 --> 00:39:56,312
Human work?

331
00:39:59,398 --> 00:40:01,901
Human work.

332
00:40:04,111 --> 00:40:06,989
Human work.

333
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,283
Human work!

334
00:40:47,613 --> 00:40:49,031
Koba say...

335
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:51,367
Apes should hate humans...

336
00:40:51,534 --> 00:40:52,368
Enough!

337
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:55,037
From humans Koba learned hate...

338
00:40:55,371 --> 00:40:56,997
But nothing else.

339
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:12,513
Hey.

340
00:41:12,847 --> 00:41:14,014
You need to eat.

341
00:41:14,849 --> 00:41:16,725
Okay.

342
00:41:16,976 --> 00:41:19,061
That was brave, what you did today.

343
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:28,946
Malcolm.

344
00:41:29,238 --> 00:41:30,781
I know everyone's depending on you...

345
00:41:30,948 --> 00:41:34,618
I don't care about that.
I don't care about any of that.

346
00:41:35,536 --> 00:41:36,787
I care about him.

347
00:41:38,789 --> 00:41:42,960
He saw things that no kid should see,
and I'm not letting us go back to that.

348
00:41:47,715 --> 00:41:49,592
I know.

349
00:41:59,435 --> 00:42:01,979
I have been trying
to get closer to him.

350
00:42:02,605 --> 00:42:04,064
But...

351
00:42:04,815 --> 00:42:06,150
You Will.

352
00:42:10,863 --> 00:42:13,908
You know the scary thing about them?

353
00:42:14,074 --> 00:42:17,328
They don't need power, lights.

354
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:21,040
Heat. Nothing.

355
00:42:21,207 --> 00:42:21,916
Hey, pal.

356
00:42:22,082 --> 00:42:23,626
That's their advantage.

357
00:42:24,585 --> 00:42:27,087
That's what makes them stronger.

358
00:42:27,254 --> 00:42:29,924
Malcolm, I'm thinking one of us
should stand guard tonight.

359
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:32,176
With what? They took our guns.

360
00:42:32,343 --> 00:42:33,719
If they wanted us dead,
we would be dead already.

361
00:42:33,886 --> 00:42:36,180
Maybe they're just taking their time.

362
00:42:36,347 --> 00:42:37,948
They killed off half the planet already.

363
00:42:38,349 --> 00:42:39,183
Come on.

364
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:40,309
What?

365
00:42:40,476 --> 00:42:42,144
You can't honestly blame the apes.

366
00:42:42,311 --> 00:42:45,940
Who the hell else am I going to blame?
It was the Simian Flu.

367
00:42:46,106 --> 00:42:47,907
It was a virus created
by scientists in a lab.

368
00:42:48,025 --> 00:42:50,653
The chimps they were testing on
didn't have a say in the matter.

369
00:42:50,819 --> 00:42:52,529
Spare me the hippie-dippie bullshit.

370
00:42:52,696 --> 00:42:55,866
You're telling me you don't get
sick to your stomach at the sight of them?

371
00:43:00,037 --> 00:43:01,330
Didn't you have a little girl?

372
00:43:01,497 --> 00:43:02,377
Carver, that's enough.

373
00:43:02,539 --> 00:43:04,208
- How did she die?
- That's enough!

374
00:43:04,375 --> 00:43:05,251
Or your wife, for that matter.

375
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:06,577
Carver, you better shut up...

376
00:43:06,669 --> 00:43:08,587
before I kick your ass.

377
00:43:12,049 --> 00:43:13,175
Okay.

378
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:18,597
I'm the asshole.

379
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:25,396
Are you okay?

380
00:43:43,998 --> 00:43:48,127
You sound sick... You ok?

381
00:43:50,546 --> 00:43:52,214
Just need rest.

382
00:43:59,346 --> 00:44:02,891
You worry about the humans...

383
00:45:03,118 --> 00:45:04,870
Where's Koba?

384
00:45:05,245 --> 00:45:08,791
Still angry.

385
00:45:10,209 --> 00:45:13,462
Said he was going hunting...

386
00:45:21,053 --> 00:45:23,138
Look, humans below!

387
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:37,986
Why are we here?

388
00:45:38,529 --> 00:45:41,198
Caesar trusts humans...

389
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,826
Koba does not.

390
00:45:45,369 --> 00:45:47,204
Most of the arsenal seems functional.

391
00:45:47,371 --> 00:45:48,163
Good.

392
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:49,998
We're testing them out back.

393
00:46:37,254 --> 00:46:38,881
Hey!

394
00:46:39,923 --> 00:46:41,133
Don't you move!

395
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:44,303
Don't move, do you understand me?

396
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:46,555
Terry!

397
00:46:46,972 --> 00:46:49,391
Terry, get in here, quick!

398
00:46:56,023 --> 00:46:58,150
Holy shit.

399
00:47:00,777 --> 00:47:03,697
What do we do?
What do we do?

400
00:47:03,864 --> 00:47:05,282
Where did he come from?

401
00:47:06,033 --> 00:47:08,577
- Should we shoot him?
- Maybe. I don't know.

402
00:47:12,456 --> 00:47:15,083
You are one ugly son of a bitch,
aren't you?

403
00:47:33,936 --> 00:47:36,063
Whoa, man.

404
00:47:40,609 --> 00:47:42,110
Dude, I think he's hungry.

405
00:47:42,277 --> 00:47:44,613
He must have gotten separated
from the others.

406
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:45,864
You lost?

407
00:47:46,615 --> 00:47:48,951
Trying to get home?

408
00:47:49,785 --> 00:47:52,454
Go on! Get out of here, stupid monkey!

409
00:47:52,621 --> 00:47:55,374
Go on. You heard him. Go!

410
00:48:03,298 --> 00:48:05,717
Enough guns here to kill every ape...

411
00:48:06,635 --> 00:48:08,219
Must warn Caesar.

412
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,514
Who knows what humans are
really doing up there?

413
00:48:30,158 --> 00:48:32,786
We gotta clear this blockage.

414
00:48:38,041 --> 00:48:39,668
I didn't know you had a daughter.

415
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,341
Yeah.

416
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,140
What was her name?

417
00:48:58,186 --> 00:49:00,188
Sarah.

418
00:49:04,693 --> 00:49:06,528
I'm really sorry.

419
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:17,497
Well, now I have you and your dad, so...

420
00:49:24,254 --> 00:49:26,298
Yeah.

421
00:49:26,465 --> 00:49:28,383
All right, you got that straight?

422
00:49:38,393 --> 00:49:40,062
Whoa.

423
00:49:40,228 --> 00:49:42,189
That's all the wire we got.

424
00:49:42,814 --> 00:49:45,025
Brace yourselves.

425
00:49:46,151 --> 00:49:50,322
Three, two, one.

426
00:49:55,994 --> 00:49:58,330
- Dad!
- Malcolm!

427
00:50:03,043 --> 00:50:05,671
Malcolm! Malcolm!

428
00:50:05,837 --> 00:50:06,672
Dad?

429
00:50:07,422 --> 00:50:08,674
I can't see Carver.

430
00:50:32,572 --> 00:50:33,740
Don't!

431
00:50:33,907 --> 00:50:35,909
- Leave it there.
- I got it.

432
00:50:38,328 --> 00:50:40,414
It's not broken.

433
00:50:41,498 --> 00:50:44,334
Let go. Good.

434
00:50:56,263 --> 00:50:57,806
Thank you.

435
00:50:59,307 --> 00:51:00,809
You saved our lives.

436
00:51:01,435 --> 00:51:02,769
We've got a lot of debris to clear now.

437
00:51:02,936 --> 00:51:04,136
We might need a bit more time.

438
00:51:04,146 --> 00:51:05,981
How long?

439
00:51:44,269 --> 00:51:45,437
Hey, buddy.

440
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,862
Hey... hey...

441
00:51:54,362 --> 00:51:56,615
What are you doing? Are you finished?

442
00:51:59,451 --> 00:52:00,577
What are you looking at?

443
00:52:09,377 --> 00:52:10,754
Hey! Hey!

444
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:13,590
Hey, get out of there!

445
00:52:18,887 --> 00:52:21,181
- Hey! I'll kill you!
- Carver, what're you doing?

446
00:52:25,894 --> 00:52:27,145
Don't! Don't!

447
00:52:27,312 --> 00:52:29,022
Caesar, no!

448
00:52:29,189 --> 00:52:30,398
No.

449
00:52:44,913 --> 00:52:49,459
Said no guns!

450
00:52:53,088 --> 00:52:54,631
- No, don't.
- Please.

451
00:53:26,454 --> 00:53:28,331
I didn't know.

452
00:53:35,338 --> 00:53:38,800
Human leave now!

453
00:54:23,595 --> 00:54:25,263
Man, we screwed now.

454
00:54:28,892 --> 00:54:30,268
Malcolm?

455
00:54:31,019 --> 00:54:33,021
Malcolm, where are you going?

456
00:54:33,188 --> 00:54:34,022
Malcolm.

457
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:43,073
Please, please,
I just need to speak to him.

458
00:54:46,076 --> 00:54:49,371
I'm sorry. That was all my fault.
But I will make him leave.

459
00:54:49,788 --> 00:54:52,624
This my home.

460
00:54:54,292 --> 00:54:56,044
You should not be here.

461
00:54:56,419 --> 00:54:57,754
I understand.

462
00:54:57,921 --> 00:54:59,923
Malcolm.

463
00:55:04,636 --> 00:55:06,054
She's sick.

464
00:55:08,223 --> 00:55:10,308
How long has she been this way?

465
00:55:17,983 --> 00:55:20,068
I have medicine.

466
00:55:21,069 --> 00:55:22,988
Antibiotics.

467
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,408
Maybe she can help.

468
00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:32,664
Do not trust you.

469
00:55:34,916 --> 00:55:37,002
I don't blame you.

470
00:55:37,502 --> 00:55:39,754
But believe me...

471
00:55:39,921 --> 00:55:41,589
we are not all like him.

472
00:55:41,756 --> 00:55:43,258
Please.

473
00:55:44,759 --> 00:55:46,928
Let us help you.

474
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:17,292
One day.

475
00:56:19,502 --> 00:56:22,672
You stay one day.

476
00:56:23,506 --> 00:56:24,966
Father, no...!

477
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:27,677
- We might need more time.
- One day!

478
00:56:32,098 --> 00:56:34,142
Ape will help.

479
00:56:37,854 --> 00:56:40,732
I will not help!

480
00:56:44,194 --> 00:56:46,035
- This is bullshit, man!
- Get him out of here.

481
00:56:46,154 --> 00:56:48,823
Move! That's enough.
Come on, get out of here.

482
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:50,742
Come on, man.

483
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,999
Okay?

484
00:56:59,584 --> 00:57:01,878
Move, come on!

485
00:57:06,508 --> 00:57:08,051
Get in!

486
00:57:23,024 --> 00:57:25,151
See you tomorrow, asshole.

487
00:57:30,198 --> 00:57:33,118
Just came from the city.
Humans very dangerous!

488
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:35,537
Where is Caesar?

489
00:57:39,374 --> 00:57:42,210
With the humans...

490
00:57:47,507 --> 00:57:48,883
Yo, Alex.

491
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:52,137
This relay's busted.
See if there's another one.

492
00:57:52,303 --> 00:57:53,263
Yeah.

493
00:58:14,784 --> 00:58:16,661
Caesar.

494
00:58:22,375 --> 00:58:23,293
Hey!

495
00:58:26,212 --> 00:58:27,714
No! No, no, no, don't!

496
00:58:27,881 --> 00:58:29,382
No! No! No!

497
00:58:36,514 --> 00:58:40,018
Where Caesar? Want Caesar.

498
00:58:40,351 --> 00:58:42,145
Caesar!

499
00:58:58,328 --> 00:59:02,498
Humans attack your sons.

500
00:59:02,665 --> 00:59:06,586
You let them stay!

501
00:59:08,504 --> 00:59:11,716
Put apes in danger!

502
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:17,805
Caesar love humans more...

503
00:59:17,972 --> 00:59:19,349
than apes!

504
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:24,020
More than your...

505
00:59:24,187 --> 00:59:26,147
SONS.

506
01:00:13,194 --> 01:00:14,654
Ape...

507
01:00:15,655 --> 01:00:17,323
not...

508
01:00:17,490 --> 01:00:19,200
kill...

509
01:00:19,367 --> 01:00:21,035
ape.

510
01:00:49,355 --> 01:00:51,399
Forgive me.

511
01:01:25,475 --> 01:01:27,769
You are my son...

512
01:01:29,228 --> 01:01:31,689
I need you to listen...

513
01:01:43,618 --> 01:01:47,455
You didn't tell Caesar
about the guns we found?

514
01:01:50,249 --> 01:01:52,794
Neither will you.

515
01:02:04,555 --> 01:02:08,601
Your father doesn't trust me now.

516
01:02:09,727 --> 01:02:12,563
You need to protect him.

517
01:02:12,939 --> 01:02:15,650
His love for humans...

518
01:02:16,234 --> 01:02:18,069
Makes him blind.

519
01:02:18,194 --> 01:02:19,987
I know...

520
01:02:20,863 --> 01:02:24,867
As long as they are here...

521
01:02:26,828 --> 01:02:30,748
I fear for Caesar's life.

522
01:03:21,132 --> 01:03:22,216
For yesterday.

523
01:03:46,741 --> 01:03:48,993
Look. Look.

524
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,161
Watch.

525
01:03:50,578 --> 01:03:52,330
Watch.

526
01:03:52,538 --> 01:03:54,248
"It was Friday.

527
01:03:55,166 --> 01:03:57,376
"A real nice afternoon.

528
01:03:58,002 --> 01:03:59,587
"Warm.

529
01:04:02,924 --> 01:04:05,051
"We were hanging...

530
01:04:05,885 --> 01:04:08,179
"We were hanging out...

531
01:04:08,346 --> 01:04:11,098
"at this kegger down
at the swimming hole."

532
01:04:13,267 --> 01:04:15,019
Hanging out.

533
01:04:17,522 --> 01:04:19,440
Hanging-

534
01:04:21,067 --> 01:04:23,903
Here. You can read?

535
01:04:34,121 --> 01:04:36,123
Now, this is the good stuff.

536
01:04:38,709 --> 01:04:40,753
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

537
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:51,264
What the hell is wrong with you?
I thought we told you to go home!

538
01:04:51,764 --> 01:04:53,182
No!

539
01:04:53,349 --> 01:04:55,893
No! Go!

540
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:00,791
- He understood that, didn't he?
- Yeah.

541
01:05:02,066 --> 01:05:03,818
Hey, hey, hey!

542
01:05:03,985 --> 01:05:05,486
Hey, hey.

543
01:05:10,074 --> 01:05:10,741
Hey.

544
01:05:10,908 --> 01:05:13,911
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey, hey, hey.

545
01:05:16,622 --> 01:05:17,999
I think he likes you.

546
01:05:18,165 --> 01:05:19,584
Shut up.

547
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:21,502
All right, all right.

548
01:05:22,503 --> 01:05:25,381
You want a drink, fugly?

549
01:05:25,548 --> 01:05:27,633
Go on, give him some.

550
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:30,219
Give him some, man.
See what happens.

551
01:05:33,222 --> 01:05:33,973
There you go.

552
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:35,891
Whoa, hey!

553
01:05:38,269 --> 01:05:39,812
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

554
01:05:41,147 --> 01:05:42,148
Shit!

555
01:05:47,111 --> 01:05:48,195
That's good, huh?

556
01:05:50,406 --> 01:05:51,866
Hey, hey, hey!

557
01:05:52,074 --> 01:05:53,743
Okay. All right.

558
01:05:55,161 --> 01:05:55,828
Easy.

559
01:05:55,995 --> 01:05:56,704
Yeah.

560
01:05:56,871 --> 01:05:57,997
- Easy.
- Easy.

561
01:05:58,164 --> 01:05:59,165
All right...

562
01:06:47,963 --> 01:06:49,632
Malcolm!

563
01:06:49,799 --> 01:06:50,966
Malcolm!

564
01:06:51,133 --> 01:06:53,678
What is it? What happened?

565
01:08:31,108 --> 01:08:32,735
It worked.

566
01:08:33,861 --> 01:08:35,696
At least here it did.

567
01:08:35,905 --> 01:08:38,699
We'll know when
we get back to the city.

568
01:08:45,498 --> 01:08:46,707
Trust.

569
01:09:12,191 --> 01:09:14,401
Son of a bitch.

570
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:17,655
You son of a bitch!

571
01:10:03,325 --> 01:10:06,161
The... lights.

572
01:10:35,691 --> 01:10:37,818
Feeling better?

573
01:11:14,647 --> 01:11:17,733
Mother...?

574
01:12:28,637 --> 01:12:30,597
Human gun!

575
01:12:33,892 --> 01:12:35,269
Run.

576
01:12:49,616 --> 01:12:53,245
Humans kill Caesar!

577
01:12:57,958 --> 01:12:59,918
Burn ape home!

578
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:13,807
Go! Get them!

579
01:13:14,266 --> 01:13:17,936
Apes must attack human city!

580
01:13:18,645 --> 01:13:20,773
Fight back!

581
01:13:21,190 --> 01:13:24,943
Come, fight for Caesar!

582
01:13:28,781 --> 01:13:30,907
Females and young stay in woods...

583
01:13:30,908 --> 01:13:32,493
We go to the city!

584
01:13:41,293 --> 01:13:44,338
We will avenge your father's death!

585
01:13:58,310 --> 01:14:00,354
Ellie! Ellie.

586
01:15:49,504 --> 01:15:51,965
This is San Francisco
attempting contact.

587
01:15:52,132 --> 01:15:53,342
If anyone is receiving this message...

588
01:15:53,508 --> 01:15:57,638
we ask that you identify yourself
and your location. Over.

589
01:16:10,025 --> 01:16:11,652
Move, move!

590
01:16:25,874 --> 01:16:29,836
If you are receiving this signal,
please state your location. Over.

591
01:16:30,003 --> 01:16:33,882
Repeat. This is San Francisco
attempting to establish contact.

592
01:16:34,049 --> 01:16:35,175
If you are receiving this signal...

593
01:16:35,342 --> 01:16:38,053
please state your identity
and your location. Over.

594
01:16:39,638 --> 01:16:40,472
What is it?

595
01:16:40,639 --> 01:16:42,000
The apes attacked the armory, sir.

596
01:16:45,185 --> 01:16:48,730
Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm!

597
01:17:21,888 --> 01:17:26,768
Keep them off the walls!
Keep them off the walls!

598
01:17:30,439 --> 01:17:32,607
Let's go! Get into position.

599
01:17:36,903 --> 01:17:38,196
- You ready?
- Yes, sir.

600
01:17:38,363 --> 01:17:39,698
Good.

601
01:17:40,782 --> 01:17:42,034
Listen to me.

602
01:17:42,743 --> 01:17:45,787
We are survivors!

603
01:17:45,954 --> 01:17:48,248
Now, they may have got their hands
on some of our guns...

604
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:50,709
but that does not make them men.

605
01:17:51,460 --> 01:17:53,211
<i>They are animals!</i>

606
01:17:53,378 --> 01:17:54,463
<i>We will push them back!</i>

607
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:57,132
<i>Drive them down!</i>

608
01:17:57,299 --> 01:18:01,219
And they will not
get through these doors!

609
01:18:39,132 --> 01:18:40,801
There! California Street!

610
01:20:28,783 --> 01:20:30,410
Bring me the rocket launcher!

611
01:22:43,877 --> 01:22:44,878
We have a beacon marking our location.

612
01:22:45,045 --> 01:22:47,130
Please, we need help.
We are under attack.

613
01:22:47,297 --> 01:22:48,882
<i>San Francisco. Repeat.</i>

614
01:22:49,049 --> 01:22:49,716
Hello?

615
01:22:49,883 --> 01:22:51,217
<i>Do you COPY?</i>

616
01:23:17,577 --> 01:23:20,455
Humans escaping! Capture them!

617
01:23:42,686 --> 01:23:44,979
We must be getting close.

618
01:23:51,111 --> 01:23:53,363
I think I see it. It's down here!

619
01:23:57,325 --> 01:23:58,618
Dad!

620
01:24:15,301 --> 01:24:17,220
Oh, my God. Malcolm!

621
01:24:17,387 --> 01:24:18,805
Ellie, help me.

622
01:24:31,985 --> 01:24:33,319
My...

623
01:24:34,195 --> 01:24:35,321
SOD...

624
01:24:38,116 --> 01:24:39,743
My...

625
01:24:40,410 --> 01:24:42,120
family...

626
01:24:46,583 --> 01:24:47,959
Where?

627
01:24:52,589 --> 01:24:54,591
I don't know.

628
01:25:03,266 --> 01:25:06,936
Try not to speak. You need to rest.

629
01:25:16,112 --> 01:25:17,739
Hold.

630
01:25:28,583 --> 01:25:29,667
He's lost a lot of blood.

631
01:25:29,834 --> 01:25:31,461
Is he going to make it?

632
01:25:32,045 --> 01:25:33,546
I don't understand.

633
01:25:35,089 --> 01:25:36,800
Where did Carver get the gun?

634
01:25:37,634 --> 01:25:39,093
Why would he do this?

635
01:25:39,260 --> 01:25:40,428
Ape...

636
01:25:42,972 --> 01:25:44,182
What?

637
01:25:47,227 --> 01:25:48,686
Ape...

638
01:25:49,229 --> 01:25:50,772
did...

639
01:25:52,482 --> 01:25:54,150
this.

640
01:26:01,449 --> 01:26:03,368
Get in the truck.

641
01:26:23,721 --> 01:26:26,474
Followed the humans here.
Hiding everywhere!

642
01:26:27,058 --> 01:26:29,602
We must catch them all!

643
01:26:48,079 --> 01:26:49,497
Kill him.

644
01:26:49,664 --> 01:26:50,665
No, no, no.

645
01:26:56,254 --> 01:26:58,464
Go ahead Ash...

646
01:26:58,882 --> 01:27:01,676
...make humans pay.

647
01:27:05,179 --> 01:27:08,474
Caesar wouldn't want this.

648
01:27:46,846 --> 01:27:49,974
Caesar gone...

649
01:27:55,188 --> 01:27:57,690
Apes follow...

650
01:27:58,441 --> 01:28:00,860
Koba now.

651
01:28:22,090 --> 01:28:24,300
Oh, my God.
Look, the colony's on fire.

652
01:28:24,467 --> 01:28:26,386
Where are we going to go?

653
01:28:26,552 --> 01:28:28,429
Caesar, what?

654
01:28:36,938 --> 01:28:38,940
Is this it?
Are we close?

655
01:28:39,232 --> 01:28:40,566
Where is he taking us?

656
01:28:43,569 --> 01:28:44,445
Malcolm, stop!

657
01:28:52,912 --> 01:28:56,165
I don't understand.
What are we doing here?

658
01:28:56,332 --> 01:28:57,250
It doesn't matter.

659
01:28:57,417 --> 01:29:00,377
We just need a place to hide him
until we find out what's going on at home.

660
01:29:04,924 --> 01:29:06,509
Go move the table.

661
01:29:10,263 --> 01:29:12,640
Okay. Right here.

662
01:29:13,766 --> 01:29:14,767
Okay.

663
01:29:19,605 --> 01:29:20,440
Dad, look.

664
01:29:22,483 --> 01:29:23,651
Look.

665
01:29:29,365 --> 01:29:31,701
We need to operate.
I don't have anything.

666
01:29:32,827 --> 01:29:34,454
There's a surgical kit
back at the place, but that's...

667
01:29:34,620 --> 01:29:35,663
<i>I'll go.</i>

668
01:29:37,999 --> 01:29:38,916
It's not safe.

669
01:29:39,083 --> 01:29:42,003
He's the only one that can stop this.

670
01:29:44,464 --> 01:29:46,174
Humans!

671
01:29:46,507 --> 01:29:50,094
You ape prisoner now!

672
01:29:50,261 --> 01:29:54,098
You will know life in cage.

673
01:29:55,308 --> 01:29:57,810
More humans out there.

674
01:29:58,519 --> 01:30:01,105
Go! Find them!

675
01:30:20,458 --> 01:30:22,418
Maurice...?

676
01:30:23,169 --> 01:30:25,088
Koba said...

677
01:30:25,797 --> 01:30:28,674
...we're too loyal to your father.

678
01:30:31,219 --> 01:30:34,847
Protect yourself.

679
01:31:54,594 --> 01:31:55,678
Shit!

680
01:33:05,873 --> 01:33:07,416
Hey, wait.

681
01:33:08,834 --> 01:33:10,294
Your father.

682
01:33:13,089 --> 01:33:15,091
He's alive.

683
01:33:27,395 --> 01:33:28,354
I got it.

684
01:33:28,854 --> 01:33:30,064
How is he?

685
01:33:54,964 --> 01:33:57,758
Your... mother.

686
01:34:00,261 --> 01:34:01,637
Brother.

687
01:34:02,805 --> 01:34:04,140
Safe?

688
01:34:05,474 --> 01:34:07,560
For now.

689
01:34:16,110 --> 01:34:17,153
No.

690
01:34:17,570 --> 01:34:18,696
No.

691
01:34:21,907 --> 01:34:24,368
Not human.

692
01:34:28,622 --> 01:34:30,207
Koba.

693
01:34:34,086 --> 01:34:35,046
Malcolm.

694
01:34:35,796 --> 01:34:37,256
Yeah.

695
01:34:38,924 --> 01:34:40,259
Caesar.

696
01:34:41,927 --> 01:34:44,055
We need to do this now.

697
01:34:48,059 --> 01:34:49,560
Son.

698
01:35:24,345 --> 01:35:26,013
How is he?

699
01:35:28,307 --> 01:35:29,850
We'll see.

700
01:35:31,352 --> 01:35:33,354
He's very strong.

701
01:35:42,780 --> 01:35:44,782
It's gonna be okay.

702
01:36:18,023 --> 01:36:20,067
I'm so sorry...

703
01:36:20,985 --> 01:36:22,570
For everything.

704
01:36:24,155 --> 01:36:25,656
No.

705
01:36:29,452 --> 01:36:31,162
L.-

706
01:36:31,495 --> 01:36:32,872
am to blame.

707
01:36:35,332 --> 01:36:37,543
But Koba betrayed you.

708
01:36:37,877 --> 01:36:39,170
L.-

709
01:36:39,336 --> 01:36:42,965
chose to trust him...

710
01:36:43,632 --> 01:36:47,720
because he is ape.

711
01:36:48,888 --> 01:36:51,223
I always think...

712
01:36:51,807 --> 01:36:55,686
ape better than human.

713
01:36:57,980 --> 01:37:00,065
I see now...

714
01:37:01,859 --> 01:37:06,238
how much like them we are.

715
01:37:10,743 --> 01:37:13,078
Where Koba now?

716
01:37:14,997 --> 01:37:17,291
On the human tower...

717
01:37:18,459 --> 01:37:20,586
Loyal apes around him.

718
01:37:20,753 --> 01:37:24,215
And those who not follow?

719
01:37:24,757 --> 01:37:26,634
Prisoners.

720
01:37:27,968 --> 01:37:29,345
Maurice.

721
01:37:30,012 --> 01:37:31,430
Rocket.

722
01:37:35,684 --> 01:37:37,978
Koba killed Ash.

723
01:37:44,443 --> 01:37:46,487
Fear makes others follow.

724
01:37:49,031 --> 01:37:50,783
But when they see you alive...

725
01:37:52,368 --> 01:37:55,329
They will turn from Koba.

726
01:37:55,454 --> 01:37:57,248
Not if I am weak.

727
01:38:00,125 --> 01:38:04,421
Ape always seek strongest branch.

728
01:38:07,550 --> 01:38:11,470
I must do something to stop him.

729
01:38:21,605 --> 01:38:23,315
Father.

730
01:38:25,985 --> 01:38:29,947
Let me help you.

731
01:39:21,165 --> 01:39:23,208
Please, let us out of here!

732
01:41:42,890 --> 01:41:43,891
<i>Okay-</i>

733
01:41:44,057 --> 01:41:45,934
<i>Caesar, look.</i>

734
01:41:46,852 --> 01:41:48,061
<i>Apple.</i>

735
01:41:48,729 --> 01:41:49,855
<i>Apple.</i>

736
01:41:50,272 --> 01:41:52,191
<i>Good.</i>

737
01:41:53,025 --> 01:41:54,193
<i>Home.</i>

738
01:41:54,902 --> 01:41:56,278
<i>Home.</i>

739
01:41:58,405 --> 01:41:59,782
<i>Home.</i>

740
01:42:01,533 --> 01:42:02,618
<i>Yes.</i>

741
01:42:04,536 --> 01:42:06,413
<i>This is your home.</i>

742
01:42:06,914 --> 01:42:08,373
<i>Your home.</i>

743
01:42:10,793 --> 01:42:12,628
<i>Good. Good.</i>

744
01:42:13,629 --> 01:42:15,214
<i>That's good.</i>

745
01:42:38,278 --> 01:42:39,780
Sorry.

746
01:42:39,947 --> 01:42:42,074
I didn't mean to intrude.

747
01:42:46,078 --> 01:42:48,455
It's been two days.

748
01:42:54,545 --> 01:42:56,713
Your son is not back yet?

749
01:43:01,718 --> 01:43:03,679
Who was that?

750
01:43:05,097 --> 01:43:06,723
On the video.

751
01:43:09,476 --> 01:43:12,813
A good man.

752
01:43:15,691 --> 01:43:18,026
Like you.

753
01:43:48,849 --> 01:43:50,769
They need to get to the tower
without being seen.

754
01:43:50,851 --> 01:43:52,811
I'm gonna take him through the subway.

755
01:43:53,604 --> 01:43:54,730
I love you.

756
01:43:55,314 --> 01:43:58,525
Koba sent for the females and young.

757
01:43:58,734 --> 01:44:01,278
They're on their way.

758
01:44:01,612 --> 01:44:03,030
Mother too.

759
01:44:04,448 --> 01:44:06,700
Must go. Now!

760
01:44:18,003 --> 01:44:19,171
Are you okay?

761
01:44:29,973 --> 01:44:31,308
Who's there?

762
01:44:31,975 --> 01:44:34,227
If you're human, you better say so!

763
01:44:34,394 --> 01:44:36,229
It's me! It's Malcolm!

764
01:44:36,396 --> 01:44:37,689
Don't shoot!

765
01:44:39,775 --> 01:44:41,026
Take the stairs.

766
01:44:41,193 --> 01:44:43,354
They'll bring you around and
up under the street, okay?

767
01:44:43,487 --> 01:44:44,529
Go.

768
01:44:48,617 --> 01:44:49,576
Thank you.

769
01:44:50,369 --> 01:44:52,204
Trust.

770
01:44:59,252 --> 01:45:01,171
All right, I'm coming out!

771
01:45:01,338 --> 01:45:03,048
Don't shoot!

772
01:45:20,857 --> 01:45:22,109
Hey!

773
01:45:22,275 --> 01:45:23,694
Look who I found.

774
01:45:23,860 --> 01:45:25,946
I didn't know if you'd made it out.

775
01:45:26,113 --> 01:45:27,155
Good to see you.

776
01:45:27,322 --> 01:45:28,740
Don't worry.

777
01:45:28,907 --> 01:45:30,450
We're gonna turn all this around.

778
01:45:30,617 --> 01:45:32,411
What do you mean? What's going on?

779
01:45:32,577 --> 01:45:34,287
The apes. They're all over the tower.

780
01:45:34,454 --> 01:45:36,206
I lost the signal. It dropped out.

781
01:45:36,373 --> 01:45:37,332
Keep trying-

782
01:45:37,499 --> 01:45:39,001
Malcolm, look at this.

783
01:45:40,377 --> 01:45:43,630
C-4. Five-pound blocks.

784
01:45:44,256 --> 01:45:46,383
We just started setting them.

785
01:45:46,550 --> 01:45:49,011
They're gonna take down the whole tower.

786
01:45:51,221 --> 01:45:53,557
Blast them all at once.

787
01:45:54,141 --> 01:45:56,059
We could use your help.

788
01:46:34,598 --> 01:46:37,851
This is San Francisco attempting contact.
If anyone is receiving this...

789
01:46:38,018 --> 01:46:41,104
we ask that you identify yourself and
your location. Over.

790
01:46:45,192 --> 01:46:46,985
Here.
Come on.

791
01:46:47,152 --> 01:46:49,712
If anyone is receiving this,
we ask that you identify yourself...

792
01:46:49,863 --> 01:46:51,615
and your location. Over.

793
01:47:00,040 --> 01:47:01,208
This is San Francisco...

794
01:47:01,374 --> 01:47:03,627
attempting contact.
If anyone is receiving this...

795
01:47:03,794 --> 01:47:06,671
we ask that you identify yourself
and your location.

796
01:47:09,216 --> 01:47:11,176
- Hey.
- Hey.

797
01:47:18,517 --> 01:47:21,311
If anyone is receiving this,
we ask that you identify yourself...

798
01:47:21,478 --> 01:47:22,771
and your location. Over.

799
01:47:27,484 --> 01:47:28,568
Dreyfus.

800
01:47:32,781 --> 01:47:34,241
- Can anybody hear me?
- Werner.

801
01:47:37,619 --> 01:47:40,539
I'm sorry, but I can't let you do this.

802
01:47:41,832 --> 01:47:43,667
We need to give him a chance.

803
01:47:44,668 --> 01:47:46,586
We need to give him some time.

804
01:47:47,295 --> 01:47:49,005
He's up there right now.

805
01:47:51,591 --> 01:47:53,426
Who's up there?

806
01:48:30,005 --> 01:48:35,802
Caesar has no place here.

807
01:48:37,762 --> 01:48:39,806
Apes follow...

808
01:48:40,932 --> 01:48:42,601
Koba now.

809
01:48:46,188 --> 01:48:48,648
Follow Koba...

810
01:48:49,608 --> 01:48:50,650
to war.

811
01:48:50,942 --> 01:48:53,528
Apes win war!

812
01:48:55,155 --> 01:48:58,450
Apes together strong!

813
01:49:03,622 --> 01:49:05,040
Caesar...

814
01:49:06,499 --> 01:49:07,834
weak.

815
01:49:11,630 --> 01:49:14,716
Koba weaker.

816
01:50:04,015 --> 01:50:06,601
Are you out of your fucking mind?

817
01:50:07,352 --> 01:50:10,355
No, I've seen things.
I've seen the way they are.

818
01:50:11,189 --> 01:50:13,066
They want what we want, to survive.

819
01:50:13,233 --> 01:50:14,359
They don't want a war.

820
01:50:14,526 --> 01:50:16,027
They're animals!

821
01:50:16,194 --> 01:50:17,445
They attacked us!

822
01:50:17,612 --> 01:50:20,282
Because they thought we attacked them.
They think that he's dead, but he's not...

823
01:50:20,448 --> 01:50:22,033
Sit down, Finney!

824
01:50:22,784 --> 01:50:24,202
Sit down!

825
01:50:47,559 --> 01:50:49,644
Trusted Koba like brother.

826
01:50:49,978 --> 01:50:53,273
Caesar brother to human!

827
01:50:55,734 --> 01:50:58,403
Koba fight for ape!

828
01:50:58,737 --> 01:51:00,488
Free ape!

829
01:51:03,074 --> 01:51:04,326
Kill ape.

830
01:51:04,492 --> 01:51:06,077
Koba fight for Koba.

831
01:51:14,919 --> 01:51:16,254
Koba...

832
01:51:16,796 --> 01:51:20,508
belong in cage.

833
01:52:08,640 --> 01:52:10,642
I know how this must sound.

834
01:52:10,809 --> 01:52:11,969
I don't think you have any...

835
01:52:17,524 --> 01:52:19,567
Do you think stopping me will matter?

836
01:52:20,151 --> 01:52:21,820
They're coming.

837
01:52:22,987 --> 01:52:25,407
Now, we made contact with a
military base up north.

838
01:52:26,366 --> 01:52:28,910
They're already on their way!

839
01:52:29,702 --> 01:52:30,829
It's true.

840
01:52:35,750 --> 01:52:36,501
Dreyfus!

841
01:52:36,668 --> 01:52:38,169
What are you doing, man?

842
01:52:48,346 --> 01:52:50,181
I'm saving the human race.

843
01:52:50,348 --> 01:52:51,182
No!

844
01:55:12,657 --> 01:55:13,866
Ape...

845
01:55:14,701 --> 01:55:16,661
not kill...

846
01:55:17,537 --> 01:55:18,830
ape.

847
01:55:44,355 --> 01:55:46,566
You are...

848
01:55:48,359 --> 01:55:50,194
<i>not ape.</i>

849
01:55:54,032 --> 01:55:55,617
No!

850
01:57:09,941 --> 01:57:11,442
Leave him!

851
01:57:29,293 --> 01:57:31,003
You're not safe here.

852
01:57:31,629 --> 01:57:34,340
They made contact.
Other people are coming. Soldiers.

853
01:57:34,924 --> 01:57:36,968
You have to leave now. Everyone.

854
01:57:37,969 --> 01:57:41,514
If you don't go,
it'll be all-out war.

855
01:57:41,681 --> 01:57:43,307
War...

856
01:57:43,474 --> 01:57:45,601
has already...

857
01:57:46,686 --> 01:57:47,812
begun.

858
01:57:49,814 --> 01:57:52,567
Ape started war.

859
01:57:55,695 --> 01:57:57,405
And human...

860
01:57:59,824 --> 01:58:02,869
Human will not forgive.

861
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:09,834
You must go...

862
01:58:10,168 --> 01:58:13,880
before fighting begins.

863
01:58:15,715 --> 01:58:17,508
I am sorry...

864
01:58:20,011 --> 01:58:22,930
my friend.

865
01:58:27,685 --> 01:58:30,563
I thought we had a chance.

866
01:58:33,941 --> 01:58:36,569
I did, too.
