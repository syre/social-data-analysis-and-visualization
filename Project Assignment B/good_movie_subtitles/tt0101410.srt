1
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:46,606
I'm kissing it all goodbye.
These four stinking walls, six flights up.

2
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:51,068
The L that roars by at 3:00 a.m.
Like a cast-iron wind.

3
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:53,946
Kiss them goodbye for me, Maury, I'll miss them.

4
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,199
- Like hell I will.
- Dreaming again.

5
00:01:56,283 --> 00:02:01,245
Not anymore, Lil. I'm awake now,
awake for the first time in years.

6
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,539
Uncle Dave said it.

7
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:07,293
"Daylight is a dream if you've lived
with your eyes closed."

8
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,837
Well, my eyes are open now.

9
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:13,174
I see the choir
and I know they're dressed in rags

10
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,593
but we're part of that choir, yeah, both of us.

11
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:19,472
- And you, Maury, and Uncle Dave, too.
- The sun's coming up, kid.

12
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,558
They'll be hawking the fish
down on Fulton Street.

13
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:26,270
Let 'em hawk.
Let 'em sing their hearts out.

14
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:30,483
That's it, kid.
Take that ruined choir. Make it sing.

15
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:33,236
- So long, Maury.
- So long.

16
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:40,159
We'll hear from that kid.
And I don't mean a postcard.

17
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,580
Fish! Fresh fish!

18
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:51,587
Let's spit on our hands and get to work.
It's late, Maury.

19
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,882
Not anymore, Lil. It's early.

20
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,103
Bravo!

21
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,940
Bravo!

22
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,821
Bravo!

23
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:25,663
Author! Author!

24
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:31,002
Author! Author!

25
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,855
Your table is ready, Monsieur Fink.

26
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:54,817
In fact, several members of your party
have already arrived.

27
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:56,777
Is Garland Stanford here?

28
00:03:56,862 --> 00:04:00,823
He called to say he'll be a few minutes late.
Ahh, here we are.

29
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:04,410
Barton, Barton, so glad you could make it.

30
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,330
You know Richard St. Claire
and Poppy Carnahan.

31
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:08,998
Charmed, charmed, charmed.

32
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,876
We're drinking champagne,
dear boy, in honor of the occasion.

33
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:15,630
- Have you seen The Herald?
- Not yet.

34
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:19,008
Well, I don't want to embarrass you
but Caven could hardly contain himself.

35
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,345
But, more important,
Richard and Poppy here loved the play.

36
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:27,183
Weeping. Copious tears.
What did The Herald say?

37
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,352
- I happen to have it with me.
- Please, Derek.

38
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:33,439
"Bare Ruined Choirs,
Triumph Of The Common Man.

39
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:34,857
"The star of Bare Ruined Choirs

40
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:37,610
"was nowhere to be seen
on the stage of the Belasco last night,

41
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:41,113
"though the thespians all acquitted
themselves admirably.

42
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:45,451
"The find of the evening was the author
of this drama about simple folk,

43
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,911
"fishmongers, in fact,

44
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,788
"whose brute struggle for existence

45
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:51,624
"cannot quite quell their longing
for something higher.

46
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,167
"The playwright finds nobility

47
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,754
"in the most squalid corners
and poetry in the most callous speech.

48
00:04:56,838 --> 00:05:00,007
"A tough new voice
in the American theater has arrived

49
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:04,428
"and the owner of that voice
is named Barton Fink."

50
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,056
Well, they'll be wrapping
fish in it in the morning,

51
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,808
so I guess it's not a total waste.

52
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:12,103
- Cynic.
- I can't start listening to the critics

53
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,981
and I can't kid myself about my own work.

54
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,900
A writer writes from his gut.

55
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:22,738
His gut tells him what's good
and what's merely adequate.

56
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,702
I don't pretend to be a critic

57
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:30,246
but Lord knows I have a gut

58
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:35,209
and my gut tells me it's simply marvelous.

59
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:38,295
And a charming gut it is.

60
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,006
Oh, you dog.

61
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,551
Oh, stop.

62
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,019
I thought you were going to join us.

63
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,896
Jesus, Garland.
You left me alone with those people?

64
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:59,025
Don't panic. I'll join you in a minute.

65
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,318
We have to talk a little business.

66
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:03,946
I've just been on the phone to Los Angeles.

67
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:07,658
Barton, Capitol Pictures
wants to put you under contract.

68
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:12,747
They've offered you $1,000 a week.
I think I can get them up to as high as $2,000.

69
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:16,584
- To do what?
- What do you do for a living?

70
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:21,630
I'm not sure any more.
I guess I try to make a difference.

71
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,842
Look, Barton. There's no pressure here
because I respect you.

72
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:26,719
But a brief tenure in Hollywood

73
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:30,556
could support you
through the writing of any number of plays.

74
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,893
I don't know, Garland.
My place is here right now.

75
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:37,813
I feel I'm on the brink of success.

76
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:41,067
- I'd say you're already enjoying some.
- No, don't you see, Garland?

77
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,570
Not the kind of success
where the critics fawn over you

78
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,490
or the producers like Derek make a lot of money.

79
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,617
No, a real success.

80
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,911
The success we've been dreaming about.

81
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,872
The creation of a new, living theater,

82
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,666
of and about and for the common man.

83
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,086
If I ran off to Hollywood now,

84
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:04,006
I'd be making money,
going to parties, meeting the big shots, sure.

85
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:07,635
But I'd be cutting myself off
from the wellspring of that success,

86
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,345
from the common man.

87
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:15,601
I guess I'm spouting off again.

88
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,186
Did you see Caven's review in The Herald?

89
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:20,189
- No, what did it say?
- Here, take my copy.

90
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,358
You're the toast of Broadway

91
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,319
and you have an opportunity
to redeem that for a little cash.

92
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,738
Strike that, a lot of cash.

93
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:34,620
The common man'll still be here
when you get back.

94
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:40,042
Who knows? They may even have
one or two of them out in Hollywood.

95
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,878
That's a rationalization, Garland.

96
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:46,882
Barton, it was a joke.

97
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:15,304
Welcome to the Hotel Earle.
May I help you, sir?

98
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,098
I'm checking in, Barton Fink.

99
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,810
All righty.

100
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,897
Okay.

101
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,191
That's F-I-N-K?

102
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:33,989
- Fink, Barton. That must be you, huh?
- Must be.

103
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:37,660
Okay, then, everything seems to be in order.

104
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:41,747
Everything seems to be in order. Just...

105
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,836
- Are you a trans or a res?
- Excuse me?

106
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,339
Transient or resident?

107
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:54,802
I don't know. I mean, I'll be here indefinitely.

108
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:57,846
Res. That'll be $25.50 a week,
payable in advance.

109
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,348
Checkout time is 12:00 sharp only,

110
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,350
you can forget about that
on account of you're a res.

111
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,851
If you need anything, anything at all,

112
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,937
just pick up your personal in-room telephone
and talk to me.

113
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,272
My name is Chet.

114
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,607
Although we do provide privacy
for the residential guests,

115
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:11,735
we are also a full-service hotel,
including complimentary shoeshine.

116
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,779
My name is Chet.

117
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:17,366
Okay.

118
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:23,831
Those your only bags?

119
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,750
The others are being sent.

120
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,962
Welcome to Los Angeles, Mr. Fink.

121
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,268
Six, please.

122
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,898
Next stop, six.

123
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,367
This stop, six.

124
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:07,346
Is that him? Is that Barton Fink?

125
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:12,142
Let me at him.
Let me put my arms around this guy.

126
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:15,646
Let me hug this guy. How the hell are you?

127
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,607
Good trip? My name is Jack Lipnick.

128
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,859
I run this dump. You know that.
You read the papers.

129
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,070
Lou treating you all right?
Get you everything you need?

130
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:26,615
What the hell's the matter with your face?
What the hell's the matter with his face, Lou.

131
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:30,327
It's not as bad as it looks.
Just a mosquito in my room.

132
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,413
- Place okay? Where'd we put him?
- I'm at the Earle.

133
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,415
Never heard of it.
Let's move him to The Grand or The Wilshire.

134
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,708
Hell, he can stay at my place!

135
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,544
Thanks, but I wanted a place
that was a little less...

136
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,087
Less Hollywood.

137
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,256
Sure. Say it. It's not a dirty word.

138
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,801
Say whatever the hell you want.
The writer is king here at Capitol Pictures.

139
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,595
You don't believe me? Take a look
at your paycheck at the end of every week.

140
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,180
That's what we think of the writer.

141
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:51,890
So, what kind of pictures does he like?

142
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:55,060
Mr. Fink hasn't given
a preference, Mr. Lipnick.

143
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,187
So how about it, Bart?

144
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:02,317
Well, to be honest,
I don't go to the pictures much, Mr. Lipnick.

145
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,611
That's okay. That's just fine.

146
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:07,281
You probably walked in here thinking
that was going to be a handicap.

147
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:09,908
Thinking that we wanted people
who knew something about the medium,

148
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:13,829
maybe even thinking there was all kinds
of technical mumbo-jumbo to learn.

149
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,873
You were dead wrong.
We're only interested in one thing.

150
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,168
Can you tell a story, Bart? Can you
make us laugh, can you make us cry?

151
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:23,088
Can you make us wanna break out in joyous song?

152
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,590
Is that more than one thing? Okay.

153
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:27,759
The point is, I run this dump and
I don't know the technical mumbo-jumbo.

154
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:31,763
Why do I run it? 'Cause I got horse sense,
goddamn it. Showmanship!

155
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,473
And also, I hope Lou told you this.

156
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,475
I am bigger, meaner and louder

157
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,686
than any other kike in this town.
Did you tell him that, Lou?

158
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,938
I don't mean my dick is bigger than yours,
it's not a sexual thing.

159
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:42,190
Although, you are a writer,
you know more about that. Coffee?

160
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,195
- Yes, thank you.
- Lou!

161
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,664
Used to have shares in the company.

162
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:59,916
Ownership interest.
Got bought out in the '20s.

163
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:02,711
Muscled out, according to some.
According to me.

164
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,379
We keep him around. He's got a family.

165
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,298
Poor schmuck. He's sensitive.
Don't mention the old days.

166
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:09,092
Hell, say whatever you want. Look, Bart.

167
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:13,138
Barring a preference, we're gonna put you to
work on a wrestling picture. Wallace Beery.

168
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,390
I say this because they tell me
you know the poetry of the streets

169
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:19,311
so that would rule out westerns, pirates,
screwball, Bible, Roman...

170
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,814
Look. I'm not one of those guys
that thinks poetic has gotta be fruity.

171
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:25,859
We're together on that, aren't we?
I mean, I'm from New York myself.

172
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,403
Minsk, if you wanna go all the way back.

173
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,281
Which we won't, if you don't mind,
and I ain't asking.

174
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:35,118
Now, people are gonna say to you,
"Wallace Beery, wrestling, it's a B-picture."

175
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:37,204
You tell them, "Bullshit!"

176
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:40,499
We do not make B-pictures here at Capitol.

177
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:44,002
Let's put a stop to that rumor...
right now.

178
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,717
Thanks, Lou. Join us.

179
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:54,805
- We're talking about the Wally Beery picture.
- Excellent picture.

180
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,182
- We got a treatment on it yet?
- No, not yet, Jack.

181
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,725
We just bought the story.

182
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:01,144
- Saturday Evening Post.
- To hell with the story.

183
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,021
Wally Beery is a wrestler.

184
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:04,523
I wanna know his hopes, his dreams.

185
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,733
Naturally, you have to get him
mixed up with a bad element.

186
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:08,985
And a romantic interest, you know the drill.

187
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,655
Romantic interest,
or else a young kid, an orphan.

188
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:15,492
What do you think, Lou?
Wally a little too old for a romantic interest?

189
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,871
Look at me.

190
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:24,668
A writer in the room and I'm asking Lou
what the goddamn story should be.

191
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,754
Which is it, Bart? Orphan? Dame?

192
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:32,968
Both, maybe?

193
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,975
Maybe we should do a treatment.

194
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,978
Hell. Let Bart take a crack at it.

195
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:46,231
He'll get into the swing of things
or I don't know writers.

196
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,567
Let's make it a dame, Bart. Keep it simple.

197
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,277
We don't gotta tackle the world
the first time out.

198
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:53,989
The important thing is we all want it
to have that Barton Fink feeling.

199
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,324
I guess, we all have that Barton Fink feeling

200
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:59,077
but since you're Barton Fink,
I'm assuming you have it in spades.

201
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:02,664
Seriously, Bart, I like you.
We're off to a good start.

202
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:05,876
If all my writers were like you,
I wouldn't have to get so goddamn involved.

203
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,170
I'd like to see something
by the end of the week.

204
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,676
Oh, I heard about your show, by the way.

205
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:18,263
My man in New York saw it. Tells me it's
pretty damn powerful, pretty damn moving.

206
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:21,600
A little fruity, he said,
but I guess you know what you're doing.

207
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:25,479
Thanks for your heart, Bart.
We need more heart in motion pictures.

208
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:28,190
We're all expecting great things.

209
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,626
- Front desk.
- Hello, Chet?

210
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:56,087
- Speaking.
- This is Barton Fink in room 621.

211
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,673
- Mmm-hmm?
- Yes, there's...

212
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:02,719
There's someone in the room
next door to mine, 623,

213
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,013
and he's...

214
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:06,348
He's...

215
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:11,978
Making a lot of noise.

216
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:15,190
- I'll take care of it right away, sir.
- Thank you.

217
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,578
Hello.

218
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,872
What?

219
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:32,374
Huh?

220
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,835
Who?

221
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:09,911
Did you...

222
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,126
- Somebody just complained.
- No, I didn't.

223
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:19,087
I mean, I did call down.
Not to complain exactly.

224
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,340
I was just concerned that you might...

225
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,509
Not that it's my business,

226
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,762
but that you might be in some kind of distress.

227
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,973
See, I was trying to work and it's...

228
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,267
Well, it was difficult.

229
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,399
Yeah...

230
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:44,404
I'm damn sorry if I bothered you.
The damn walls. I just apologize like hell.

231
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,615
My name's Charlie Meadows.
I guess we're neighbors.

232
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:49,826
Barton Fink.

233
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:53,163
Neighbor, I'd feel better
about the damned inconvenience

234
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:55,248
if you let me buy you a drink.

235
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,836
- That's all right, really. Thank you.
- "All right," hell.

236
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,298
You trying to work, me carrying on in there.

237
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:06,134
Look, the liquor's good. What do you say?

238
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:09,304
You got a glass? It's the least I can do.

239
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:14,851
Okay. A quick one. Sure.

240
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,853
Yeah, just a nip.

241
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:20,648
I sure do forget myself sometimes.

242
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,070
I feel like a heel,
all the carryings-on next door.

243
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,572
That's okay, I assure you.

244
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,657
It's just I was trying to work.

245
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:33,828
What kind of work do you do, Barton,
if you don't mind my asking?

246
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:36,581
Well, I'm a writer, actually.

247
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,500
You don't say. That's a tough racket.

248
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,919
My hat's off to anyone that can make a go of it.

249
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:44,672
- Damned interesting work, I'd imagine.
- Can be. It's not easy but...

250
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:46,299
Damned difficult, I'd imagine.

251
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:50,303
- And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?
- Hell, no, call me Charlie.

252
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,599
Well, Barton, you might say
I sell peace of mind.

253
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:56,559
Insurance is my game.

254
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:59,813
Door to door. Human contact.
Still the only way to move the merchandise.

255
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:03,024
In spite of what you might think from tonight,
I'm pretty good at it.

256
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,860
- It doesn't surprise me at all.
- Hell, yes! Because I believe in it.

257
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,029
Fire, theft and casualty are not things

258
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:10,740
that only happen to other people,
that's what I tell them.

259
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:13,243
Writing doesn't work out,
you may wanna look into it.

260
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:16,454
Providing for a basic human need.
A fella could do worse.

261
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:19,124
- Thanks. I'll keep that in mind.
- Mmm.

262
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:22,710
What kind of scribbler are you?
Newspaperman, did you say?

263
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:26,131
No. Actually, I'm writing for the pictures now.

264
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,716
Pictures? Jesus!

265
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,055
Oh, I'm sorry, brother.

266
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:36,015
I was just sitting here thinking

267
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,561
I was talking to some ambitious youngster
eager to make good.

268
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:40,812
Hell, you've got it made.

269
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:43,815
Writing for the pictures!
Beating out that competition.

270
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,025
And me being patronizing?

271
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,904
Is the egg showing or what?

272
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:52,740
That's okay,
I am just starting out in the movies,

273
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:55,827
though I was pretty well established
in New York.

274
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:59,497
- Some renown there.
- It's an exciting time, then.

275
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:02,167
I'm not the best-read mug on the planet

276
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:05,253
so I guess it's not surprising
I didn't recognize your name.

277
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:08,339
Jesus, I feel like a heel.

278
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:11,092
That's okay, Charlie.

279
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:14,429
I'm a playwright.
My shows have only played New York.

280
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,347
The last one got a hell of a write-up
in The Herald.

281
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:18,266
I guess that's why they wanted me here.

282
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,643
Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality.

283
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:23,104
What kind of venue...

284
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:25,940
That is to say, thematically...

285
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:27,609
Umm...

286
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:30,111
What do I write about?

287
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:35,116
Caught me trying to be fancy.
Yeah, that's it, Bart.

288
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,994
Well, that's a good question.

289
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:42,498
Strange as it may seem, Charlie,
I guess I write about people like you.

290
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:45,251
The average working stiff, the common man.

291
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:48,213
- Well, ain't that a kick in the head.
- Yeah, I guess it is.

292
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:51,424
But in a way, that's exactly the point.

293
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:55,303
There's a few people in New York...
Hopefully, our numbers are growing...

294
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:58,181
Who feel we have an opportunity now

295
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:01,559
to forge something real
out of everyday experience.

296
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:06,064
Create a theater for the masses
based on a few simple truths,

297
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:07,899
not on some shopworn abstractions

298
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:11,611
about drama that don't hold true today,
if they ever did.

299
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:16,574
- I don't guess this means much to you.
- Hell yeah. I could tell you some stories.

300
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:20,495
And that's the point.
That we all have stories.

301
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:24,999
The hopes and dreams of the common man
are as noble as those of any king.

302
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,919
It's the stuff of life,
why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?

303
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:32,465
Goddamn it, why should that be
such a hard pill to swallow?

304
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:36,094
Don't call it new theater, Charlie,
call it real theater.

305
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,596
Call it our theater.

306
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:42,225
I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.

307
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:45,395
Well, I don't mean to get up on my high horse.

308
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:48,356
But why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there?

309
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:53,319
Who cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop
and Lady Higginbottom

310
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:56,614
and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?

311
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:59,826
- I can feel my butt getting sore already.
- Exactly, Charlie.

312
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:03,705
You understand what I'm saying
a lot more than these literary types

313
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:07,375
- because you're a real man.
- I could tell you some stories...

314
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:11,045
Sure you could, and yet, many writers
do everything in their power

315
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,423
to insulate themselves from the common man,

316
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:15,717
from where they live, from where they trade,

317
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:19,220
from where they fight
and love and converse and...

318
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:26,311
So naturally, their work suffers
and regresses into empty formalism.

319
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:29,480
I'm spouting off again,
but to put it in your language,

320
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:32,400
the theater becomes
as phony as a three-dollar bill.

321
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:34,569
Well, I guess that's a tragedy right there.

322
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:38,114
You're all right, Charlie.

323
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:43,119
I'm glad you stopped by. I'm sorry if...
I know sometimes I run on.

324
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:47,457
Well, Christ. If there's any way
I can contribute or help or whatever...

325
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,709
Sure, Charlie, you can help
by just being yourself.

326
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,211
Well, I can tell you some stories.

327
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:57,342
And look, I'm sorry as hell
about the interruption.

328
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,597
Too much revelry late at night,
you forget there's other people in the world.

329
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:45,366
I'll be eating on the lot today.

330
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:47,618
- Who's this?
- Barton Fink, Mr. Geisler.

331
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:48,661
More, please.

332
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:52,039
I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum
said I should drop by this morning...

333
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:54,459
- Ever act?
- Huh? No, I'm a...

334
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:57,420
- Need Indians for a Norman Steele western.
- I'm a writer. Ted Okum...

335
00:29:57,504 --> 00:30:00,381
Think about it, Fink, writers come and go.
We always need Indians.

336
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,133
I'm a writer.

337
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,969
Ted Okum said you're producing
this Wallace Beery picture I'm working on.

338
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,054
Ted Okum doesn't know shit.

339
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,265
They've assigned me enough pictures
for a goddamn year.

340
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,766
Listen, what Ted Okum doesn't know

341
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:12,894
you could almost squeeze
into the Hollywood Bowl.

342
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,437
Then who should I talk to?

343
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:18,983
Get me Lou Breeze.

344
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:24,238
- Is he in for Mr. Geesler?
- Geisler.

345
00:30:25,908 --> 00:30:28,701
Lou, how's Lipnick's ass smell this morning?

346
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,745
Yeah? Yeah?

347
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:34,081
All right, listen. The reason I'm calling,
I got a writer here. Fink. All screwy.

348
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:36,000
Says I'm producing that Wallace Beery
wrestling picture.

349
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,419
What am I, the goddamn janitor around here?

350
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:40,671
Yeah? Who'd you get that from?

351
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:43,090
Tell Lipnick he can kiss my dimpled ass.

352
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:46,302
No, all right! Shit. All right. No, all right.

353
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,516
Okay, Fink, let's chow.

354
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:01,108
Don't worry about it. It's just a B-picture.

355
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:05,071
I bring it in on budget, they book it without
screening it. Life is too short.

356
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:08,950
Lipnick said he wanted to look at the script,
see something by the end of the week.

357
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:12,995
Sure he did. He forgot about it
before your ass left his sofa.

358
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:15,164
Okay.

359
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:20,962
I'm just having trouble getting started.

360
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:23,005
It's funny, I'm blocked up.

361
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:27,134
I just feel like I need some kind of
indication of what's expected.

362
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:32,431
Wallace Beery, wrestling picture.
What do you need, a road map?

363
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:36,269
Look, you're confused. You need guidance?

364
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:41,232
- Talk to another writer.
- Who?

365
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:45,278
Oh, Jesus.
You throw a rock in here, you'll hit one.

366
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:48,030
Do me a favor, Fink?

367
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:50,157
Throw it hard.

368
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:10,905
Bill Mayhew. Sorry about the odor.

369
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:13,032
Barton Fink.

370
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:19,747
Jesus, W. P?

371
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:24,001
- I beg your pardon?
- W.P. Mayhew, the writer?

372
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:26,045
Just Bill, please.

373
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:27,922
Bill,

374
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:30,800
you're the finest novelist of our time.

375
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:32,885
Why, thank you, son. How kind.

376
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:37,640
My God, I had no idea you were in Hollywood.

377
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,017
All of us undomesticated writers

378
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:43,896
eventually make our way out here
to the Great Salt Lick.

379
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:47,817
That's probably why
I always have such a powerful thirst.

380
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,569
A little social lubricant, Mr. Fink?

381
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:52,947
No, it's a little early for me.

382
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:03,582
Bill, if I'm imposing, you should say so.

383
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,584
I know you're very busy.

384
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,796
I just wanted to ask you a favor.

385
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,800
Have you ever written a wrestling picture?

386
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:18,264
You are drippin', sir.

387
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:22,351
Mr. Fink, they have not invented
a genre of picture

388
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:25,604
that Bill Mayhew has not at one time
or other been invited to essay.

389
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:27,231
Well, what...

390
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,650
Yes, I have taken my stab at the wrestling form,

391
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,152
as I have stabbed at so many others

392
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,404
- and with as little success.
- How do...

393
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:37,324
I gather that you are a freshman here,
eager for an upperclassman's counsel.

394
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:40,286
However, just at the moment,
I have drinking to do.

395
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:44,373
Why don't you stop by my bungalow,
number 15, later on this afternoon

396
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:48,335
and we will discuss wrestling scenarios
and other things literary.

397
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:52,882
Sons of bitches!

398
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:03,517
Honey? Where's my honey?

399
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:07,521
The water's lapping up on me, honey!

400
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:15,529
I can't... I'm trying to help you.

401
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,325
Can I help you?

402
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:21,368
- I'm sorry, I...
- Why, damn it?

403
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,788
- My name is Fink.
- Where's my honey?

404
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:28,876
Bill asked me to drop by this afternoon.
Is he in?

405
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:34,924
- Mr. Mayhew is indisposed at the moment.
- Where's my honey?

406
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,385
Is he okay?

407
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:41,138
He'll be fine.

408
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:46,644
Mr. Fink, I'm Audrey Taylor,
Mr. Mayhew's personal secretary.

409
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:50,231
- Where's my honey?
- I know this all must sound horrid.

410
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:54,693
- I really do apologize.
- Where are you, damn it?

411
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:58,531
When he can't write, he drinks.

412
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:00,699
It's so embarrassing.

413
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:04,078
How about you? Will you be all right?

414
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:07,456
I'll be fine.

415
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:11,877
- Are you a writer, Mr. Fink?
- Yes. I'm working on a wrestling...

416
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:13,671
Please, call me Barton.

417
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:16,590
I'll tell Bill you dropped by.

418
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:19,093
I'm sure he'll wanna reschedule
your appointment.

419
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:22,346
Perhaps you and I can get together
at some point, also.

420
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:26,267
I'm sorry if that sounds abrupt, I just...

421
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,186
I don't know anyone here in town.

422
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:36,318
- Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.
- Please, Barton.

423
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,070
Barton.

424
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:40,447
You see, Barton,

425
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,742
I'm not just Bill's secretary.

426
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,703
Bill and I are

427
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:49,164
in love.

428
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,626
Where's my honey?

429
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:55,921
I know this must look

430
00:36:57,299 --> 00:36:58,632
funny.

431
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,386
- Bastard-ass sons of bitches!
- I'm sorry.

432
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:05,139
Please, don't judge us, Mr. Fink.

433
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:10,811
Bastard-ass sons of bitches,
the water's lapping up!

434
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:12,813
Honey!

435
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,948
- Howdy, neighbor.
- Charlie, how are you?

436
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:49,702
Ah, Jesus, I hope
I'm not interrupting you again.

437
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:53,247
Heard you walking around in here,
figured I'd drop by.

438
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,833
Yeah, come on in. Have a seat.

439
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:57,960
I hadn't really gotten started yet.

440
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:02,756
- What happened to your ear?
- Yeah, an ear infection.

441
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:06,760
Chronic thing.
It goes away for a while, then it comes back.

442
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:09,263
I gotta put cotton in it
to stanch the flow of pus.

443
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:12,558
- Don't worry. It's not contagious.
- Have you seen a doctor?

444
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:16,353
Doctors. What's he gonna tell me?
Can't trade my head in for a new one.

445
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:19,189
Yeah, I guess you're stuck with the one you got.

446
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:23,277
I'd invite you over to my place
but it's a goddamn mess.

447
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:26,905
- You married, Bart?
- No.

448
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:29,825
I myself have yet to be lassoed.

449
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,660
Hey, Bart.

450
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:34,288
Ouch!

451
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:43,130
- Got a sweetheart?
- No.

452
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:48,260
I guess it's something about my work.
I get so worked up over it.

453
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:51,930
I don't really have a lot of attention left over,

454
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:54,641
so it would be a little unfair.

455
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:57,478
Yeah, ladies do ask for attention.

456
00:39:57,896 --> 00:39:59,855
In my experience, they pretend to give it

457
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:03,233
but it's generally a smoke screen
for demanding it back with interest.

458
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:05,819
How about family, Bart?
How're you fixed in that department?

459
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:10,157
- My folks live in Brooklyn with my uncle.
- Mine have passed on.

460
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:14,328
It's just the three of us now.
What's that expression?

461
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,289
- Me, myself and I.
- Sure.

462
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,333
That's tough.

463
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:24,046
But in a sense, we're all alone
in the world, aren't we, Charlie?

464
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:28,509
I'm often surrounded
by family and friends but...

465
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:34,306
You're no stranger to loneliness, then.

466
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:38,519
I guess I got no beef,
especially where the dames are concerned.

467
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:41,396
In my line of work, I get opportunities galore,

468
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:43,065
always on the wing, you know what I'm saying.

469
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:48,195
I could tell you stories to curl your hair
but it looks like you've already heard them.

470
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:52,950
That's me in Kansas City, plying my trade.
That was taken by one of my policy holders.

471
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:56,954
They're more than just customers to me,
they appreciate what I have to offer them.

472
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:01,625
You see, her hubby was out of town at
the time, and they were carrying fire and life.

473
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,836
The third quarter payment was way past due...

474
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,754
You know, in a way, I envy you, Charlie.

475
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:08,715
Your daily routine, you know what's expected.

476
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,467
You know the drill.

477
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:16,807
My job is to plumb the depths, so to speak,

478
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,976
dredge up something from inside.

479
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,686
Something honest.

480
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:24,356
I gotta tell you, the life of the mind,

481
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,984
there's no road map for that territory.

482
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,112
Exploring it can be painful.

483
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:35,242
A kind of pain most people
don't know anything about.

484
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,998
- This must be boring you.
- No, it's damned interesting.

485
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:42,666
Yeah.

486
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:47,296
Probably sounds a little grand from someone
writing a wrestling picture for Wallace Beery.

487
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,716
Beery? You got no beef there.
He's good! A hell of an actor.

488
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,969
Though for my money, you can't beat Jack Oakie.

489
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:57,639
A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, funny stuff.

490
00:41:57,724 --> 00:42:02,019
But don't get me wrong.
Beery, wrestling picture, could be a pip.

491
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:06,064
I wrestled myself some, back in school.
I guess you know the basic moves?

492
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:10,152
No, I never even watched any.
I'm not that interested in the act itself.

493
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,863
Okay. But hell,
you should know what it's about.

494
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:16,283
I can show you the wrestling basics
in about 30 seconds.

495
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:20,537
You're a little out of your weight class
but just for the purposes of demonstration.

496
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:21,830
That's all right, really.

497
00:42:21,915 --> 00:42:24,333
Not a bit of it, compadre.
Easiest thing in the world.

498
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,336
You just get down on your knees to my left here,

499
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,422
slap your right hand here, your left hand here.

500
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:33,050
Come on, champ, you can do it. Come on.

501
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:35,260
Come on. Come on.

502
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:37,804
Come on.

503
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,727
Okay, right there.

504
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:47,356
All right.

505
00:42:47,941 --> 00:42:51,902
When I say, "Ready, wrestle,"
you try and pin me and I try and pin you.

506
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,613
- And that's the whole game, got it?
- Yeah, okay.

507
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,657
Ready, wrestle!

508
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:58,742
Hup, two, three.

509
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:02,579
Damn, there I go again,
gonna wake up the downstairs neighbors.

510
00:43:02,664 --> 00:43:04,831
- I didn't hurt you, did I?
- It's okay.

511
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:07,000
That's all wrestling is,

512
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:09,753
except usually there's more
grunting and squirming before the pin.

513
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:12,172
It's your first time
and you're out of your weight class.

514
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:14,466
Jesus, I did hurt you.

515
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:18,178
I sure do apologize.
I'm just a big, clumsy lug.

516
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:21,974
I sure do apologize. You sure you're okay?

517
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:24,351
I'm fine, really.

518
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,853
Actually, it's been helpful.

519
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:32,693
But I guess I should get to work.

520
00:43:33,695 --> 00:43:35,487
Well, it wasn't fair of me to do that.

521
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:38,240
I'm pretty well-endowed physically.

522
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:40,117
Don't feel bad, though.

523
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:43,370
I wouldn't be much of a match for you
at mental gymnastics.

524
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:46,540
Give me a holler, if you need anything.

525
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:25,537
If I close my eyes,
I can almost smell the live oak.

526
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:27,998
That's chicken fat, Bill.

527
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:34,296
My olfactory's turning womanish on me,
lying and deceitful.

528
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:37,883
Still, I must say,
I haven't felt a peace like this

529
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:40,010
since the grand productive days.

530
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:42,929
Don't you find it so, Barton?

531
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:45,974
Ain't writing peace?

532
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:49,227
Well...

533
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:54,066
Actually no, Bill.

534
00:44:57,737 --> 00:45:02,282
No, I've always found that writing comes
from a great inner pain.

535
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:06,119
Maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization

536
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:09,081
that one must do something for one's fellow man

537
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:12,459
to help somehow ease the suffering.

538
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,379
Maybe it's personal pain.

539
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:20,092
At any rate, I don't believe
good work is possible without it.

540
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:25,514
Well, me, I just enjoy making things up.

541
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:29,059
Yes, sir, escape.

542
00:45:30,478 --> 00:45:33,397
It's when I can't write, can't escape myself,

543
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:36,817
that I wanna rip my head off
and run screaming through the street

544
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:39,152
with my balls in a fruit-picker's pail.

545
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:45,033
- This'll sometimes help.
- That doesn't help anything, Bill.

546
00:45:45,118 --> 00:45:47,369
That's true.
I've never found that to help my writing.

547
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:49,663
Your writin'?

548
00:45:50,123 --> 00:45:52,749
Son, have you ever heard the story
of Solomon's mammy?

549
00:45:53,543 --> 00:45:58,171
Barton, you should read this, I think it's
Bill's finest or among his finest, anyway.

550
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:02,426
So, now I'm supposed to roll over like
a bitch dog getting my belly scratched?

551
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:05,303
Look, maybe it's none of my business

552
00:46:05,388 --> 00:46:08,849
but don't you think a man with your talent,

553
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:11,268
that your first obligation is to your gift?

554
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:14,688
Shouldn't you be doing
whatever you have to do to work again?

555
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:17,190
- And what would that be, son?
- I don't know exactly,

556
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:19,234
but I do know what you're doing with that drink,

557
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:21,736
you're cutting yourself off from your gift
and from Audrey,

558
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:24,614
and from your fellow man
and from everything your art is about.

559
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:27,451
No, son. I'm building a levee.

560
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:30,162
Gulp by gulp, brick by brick.

561
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:35,459
Puttin' up a levee to keep that ragin' river
of manure from lappin' at my door.

562
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:37,002
Maybe you'd better too, Barton,

563
00:46:37,086 --> 00:46:39,337
before you get buried under his manure.

564
00:46:39,422 --> 00:46:42,799
My honey pretends to be impatient with me,
Barton, but she'll put up with anything.

565
00:46:42,884 --> 00:46:45,969
Not anything, Bill. Don't test me.

566
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:48,638
You're lucky she puts up with you as much
as she does.

567
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:51,308
Am I? Maybe to a schoolboy's eye.

568
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:54,644
People who know about the human heart,
maybe they'd say,

569
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:59,399
"Bill over here, he gives his honey love
and she pays him back with pity."

570
00:46:59,484 --> 00:47:02,402
- The basest coin there is.
- Stop it, Bill.

571
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:08,533
Gone are the days
when my heart was young and gay

572
00:47:09,619 --> 00:47:11,912
Gone are my friends

573
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:16,124
From the cotton fields away

574
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:19,085
Gone from the earth

575
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:22,797
To a better land I know

576
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:26,343
I hear their gentle voices callin'

577
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:30,263
Old Black Joe

578
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,935
I'm comin', I'm comin'

579
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:39,397
Though my head is bending low

580
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:42,651
I hear their gentle...

581
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:49,282
The truth, my honey,
is a tart that does not bear scrutiny.

582
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,826
Breach my levee at your peril.

583
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:55,580
Gone are my friends...

584
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:59,793
Son of a bitch. That son of a bitch!

585
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:02,295
Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer.

586
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:05,882
From the earth to a better land...

587
00:48:05,967 --> 00:48:07,217
Are you all right?

588
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:09,803
Audrey...

589
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:11,096
I hear their angel voices...

590
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,722
- You can't...
- Go, Barton.

591
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:14,724
You can't put up with this.

592
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:17,727
Old Black Joe

593
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:19,604
I feel so sorry for him.

594
00:48:19,689 --> 00:48:22,482
What? He's a son of a bitch.

595
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,818
No, no...

596
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,528
I'm coming...

597
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:30,740
He, sometimes just...

598
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,785
I hear their angel voices...

599
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:35,996
Well, he thinks about Estelle.

600
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:38,957
His wife still lives in Fayetteville.

601
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,166
Old Black Joe...

602
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:41,710
She's

603
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,339
disturbed.

604
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:47,465
Really?

605
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:55,348
I'll just walk on down to the Pacific
and from there I'll improvise.

606
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:59,936
He'll wander back when he's sober
and apologize. He always does.

607
00:49:00,021 --> 00:49:04,482
- Okay, but that doesn't excuse his behavior.
- Silence upon a hill in Darien.

608
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:07,861
Empathy requires understanding.

609
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,279
I'm comin'...

610
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,698
What? What don't I understand?

611
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:17,245
Though my head is hangin' low

612
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:22,042
I hear their gentle voices calling

613
00:49:22,835 --> 00:49:26,379
Old Black Joe

614
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:54,759
- I hope these are your shoes.
- Charlie?

615
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:58,430
Because that would mean they gave you mine.

616
00:50:58,931 --> 00:51:01,558
Yeah. As a matter of fact, they did.

617
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:06,604
- Come on in.
- Jesus, what a day I had.

618
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,442
You ever had one of those days?

619
00:51:10,526 --> 00:51:13,987
- Seems like nothing but, lately.
- Jesus, what a day.

620
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:17,157
Felt like I couldn't
have sold ice water in the Sahara.

621
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:21,202
Jesus. Okay, so you don't want insurance.
Okay, so that's your loss.

622
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:23,788
But, God, people can be rude.

623
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:27,000
Feel like I have to talk to
a normal person like you

624
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:29,377
just to restore a little of my...

625
00:51:29,462 --> 00:51:33,965
It's my pleasure.
I could use a little lift myself.

626
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:36,176
Little lift, yeah.

627
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,511
Good thing they bottle it, pal?

628
00:51:39,764 --> 00:51:43,391
Did I say rude?
People can be goddamn cruel.

629
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:46,186
Especially some of these housewives.

630
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:49,063
Okay, so I have a weight problem.

631
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:51,816
That's my cross to bear. I don't know.

632
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:55,945
- It's a defense mechanism.
- Defense against what, insurance?

633
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:59,407
Something they need? Something they
should be grateful to me for offering?

634
00:51:59,492 --> 00:52:01,493
A little peace of mind.

635
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:06,998
Finally decided to knock off early.

636
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:09,876
Take your advice.
Went to see a doctor about this.

637
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:12,837
He told me I had an ear infection, $10, please.

638
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:18,384
I says, "Hell, I told you my ear was infected.
Why don't you give me $10?"

639
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:21,888
Well, that led to an argument.

640
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:27,185
Listen to me bellyaching.

641
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:30,730
As if my problems amounted to a hill of beans.

642
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:33,441
How goes the life of the mind?

643
00:52:33,526 --> 00:52:35,485
Well, it's been better.

644
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:38,404
I just can't seem to get going on this thing.

645
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:42,367
The one idea, the one that lets you get started,

646
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:44,077
I still haven't gotten it.

647
00:52:44,245 --> 00:52:47,497
Maybe I only had one idea in me. My play.

648
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:50,583
Maybe once that was done,
I was done being a writer.

649
00:52:51,252 --> 00:52:53,253
Christ. I feel like a fraud.

650
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:55,755
Sitting here, staring at this paper.

651
00:52:56,841 --> 00:53:00,051
Those two lovebirds next door driving you nuts?

652
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:04,681
How do you know about that?

653
00:53:04,765 --> 00:53:07,642
Know about it?
I can practically see how they're doin' it.

654
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:10,103
Brother, I wish I had a piece of that.

655
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:14,566
Seems like I hear
everything that goes on in this dump.

656
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:17,193
- Pipes or somethin'.
- Yeah, but...

657
00:53:17,278 --> 00:53:20,405
You'll lick this picture business, believe me.
You got a head on your shoulders.

658
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:23,700
And what is it they say?
Where there's a head, there's hope.

659
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:27,787
- Where there's life, there's hope.
- See, that proves you really are a writer.

660
00:53:28,664 --> 00:53:30,373
There's hope for you, too, Charlie.

661
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:33,543
Tomorrow, I bet you sell
a half-dozen policies.

662
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:37,005
Thanks, brother, but the fact is
I gotta pull up stakes for a while.

663
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:44,762
- You're leaving?
- In a few days.

664
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:47,640
Out to your stomping ground,
as a matter of fact, New York City.

665
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:50,184
Things have gotten all balled up
at the head office.

666
00:53:52,438 --> 00:53:54,522
I'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie.
I'll miss you.

667
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:57,150
Well, hell, buddy, don't pull a long face.

668
00:53:57,776 --> 00:54:01,446
This is home to me. I keep a room here
and I'll be back, sooner or later.

669
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:03,239
And mark my words,

670
00:54:03,324 --> 00:54:06,534
by the time I get back,
your picture'll be finished, I know it.

671
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:09,412
New York can be pretty cruel to strangers,
Charlie.

672
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:13,833
If you need a home-cooked meal,
you just look up Sam and Lillian Fink.

673
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:18,504
They live on Fulton Street with my Uncle Maury.

674
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:31,267
Christ.

675
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:34,354
Your room does that, too.

676
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:38,399
I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.

677
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:40,860
What a dump.

678
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:45,365
I guess this must seem pretty pathetic
to a guy like you.

679
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:47,158
Well...

680
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:50,036
But it's pathetic, isn't it?

681
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:53,373
I mean, to a guy from New York?

682
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,541
What do you mean?

683
00:54:56,085 --> 00:54:58,503
This kind of heat. Pathetic.

684
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:01,422
I guess you pick your poison.

685
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:02,966
So they say.

686
00:55:04,593 --> 00:55:06,678
Don't pick up and leave
without saying good-bye.

687
00:55:06,762 --> 00:55:08,596
Course not, compadre.

688
00:55:08,681 --> 00:55:10,014
You'll see me again.

689
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:33,222
- Bango, you're dead, you're a corpse.
- You got me.

690
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:35,600
Okay. Go, go. You son of a gun.

691
00:56:35,684 --> 00:56:37,685
Yeah. Fink.

692
00:56:41,482 --> 00:56:43,900
Come in, come on.

693
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,904
What do you got for me?
What the hell happened to your face?

694
00:56:48,072 --> 00:56:50,239
Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.

695
00:56:50,324 --> 00:56:52,575
Like hell it is.
There are no mosquitoes in Los Angeles.

696
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:55,703
Mosquitoes breed in swamps.
This is a desert. What do you got for me?

697
00:56:55,788 --> 00:56:56,829
Well, I...

698
00:56:56,914 --> 00:56:59,082
On the Beery picture.
Where are we? What do you got?

699
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:01,959
Well, I'm having a little trouble
getting started.

700
00:57:02,044 --> 00:57:05,755
Getting... Christ Jesus, started?
You don't have anything yet?

701
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:08,841
- Well, not much.
- What the hell do you think this is? Hamlet?

702
00:57:08,926 --> 00:57:10,968
Gone With The Wind? Ruggles Of Red...

703
00:57:11,053 --> 00:57:14,722
It's a goddamn B-picture. Big men in tights.
You know the drill.

704
00:57:14,807 --> 00:57:16,516
I'm afraid I don't really understand that genre.

705
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:17,850
Maybe that's the problem.

706
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:21,813
Understand shit. I thought you were gonna
consult another writer on this.

707
00:57:21,897 --> 00:57:23,481
- Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew.
- Bill Mayhew?

708
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:26,067
Mayhew? Some help! The guy's a souse.

709
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:27,610
- He's a great writer.
- A great souse!

710
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:28,903
- You don't understand.
- Souse!

711
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,696
- He's in pain because he can't write.
- Souse!

712
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:32,365
Souse! He can't write.

713
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:35,159
He manages to write his name
on the back of his paycheck every week.

714
00:57:35,244 --> 00:57:36,911
But I thought no one cared about this picture.

715
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:39,372
You thought? Where the hell
did you get that from? You thought.

716
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:41,958
Listen, I don't know what the hell
you said to Lipnick,

717
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:43,793
but the son of a bitch likes you.

718
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:48,131
You understand that, Fink?
He likes you. He's taken an interest.

719
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:51,259
Never make Lipnick like you. Never!

720
00:57:51,343 --> 00:57:53,302
I don't understand.

721
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,972
Are you deaf? He likes you!
He's taken an interest.

722
00:57:56,056 --> 00:57:57,682
What the hell did you say to him?

723
00:57:58,016 --> 00:58:00,393
- I didn't say anything.
- Well, he's taken an interest.

724
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:03,146
That means he'll make your life hell,
which I could care less about.

725
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:05,606
But since I drew the short straw
to supervise this turkey,

726
00:58:05,691 --> 00:58:07,316
he's gonna be all over me, too.

727
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:10,236
Fat-assed son of a bitch called me yesterday
to ask me how it's going.

728
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:12,363
Don't worry, I covered for you.

729
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:15,616
I told him you were making progress,
we were all very excited.

730
00:58:15,951 --> 00:58:18,619
I told him it was great.

731
00:58:19,163 --> 00:58:21,706
Understand that?
So now my ass is on the line.

732
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:25,042
He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.

733
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:27,086
I can't write anything by tomorrow.

734
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:29,547
Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't read.

735
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:33,759
You gotta tell it to him.
Tell him something, for Christ's sake.

736
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:37,180
What do I tell him?

737
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,062
- Yes, Mr. Geisler.
- Projection.

738
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:47,523
- Jerry.
- Jerry! Ben Geisler here.

739
00:58:47,608 --> 00:58:48,608
- Hi, Ben.
- Yeah.

740
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:49,942
Any of the screening rooms free this afternoon?

741
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:51,444
- Yeah, I think...
- Good! Book it for me.

742
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:52,820
I got a writer here, Fink.

743
00:58:52,905 --> 00:58:55,156
He's coming in.
You're gonna show him wrestling pictures.

744
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,991
- Which ones?
- I don't give a shit which ones.

745
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:58,034
Wrestling pictures!

746
00:58:58,118 --> 00:59:00,536
Wait a minute.
Isn't Victor Sjoderberg shooting one now?

747
00:59:00,621 --> 00:59:02,538
- Yeah, he's...
- Well, show him some of the dailies on that.

748
00:59:02,623 --> 00:59:03,956
Okay, Ben, I'll show him...

749
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:06,918
All right. This'll give you some ideas.

750
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:10,922
8: 15 tomorrow morning at Lipnick's house.

751
00:59:14,218 --> 00:59:15,468
Ideas.

752
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:17,595
Broad strokes.

753
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:21,599
Don't cross me, Fink.

754
00:59:23,936 --> 00:59:25,269
Devil On The...

755
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:27,730
Devil On The Canvas. 12-apple, take one.

756
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:29,774
Action!

757
00:59:29,858 --> 00:59:31,400
I will destroy him!

758
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:33,236
Cut, cut, cut, cut!

759
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,905
Devil On The Canvas, 12-apple, take two.

760
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:37,365
Action!

761
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:39,575
I will destroy him.

762
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:40,868
Cut, cut!

763
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:45,039
- Rolling!
- Devil On The Canvas, 12-apple, take four.

764
00:59:45,624 --> 00:59:46,832
Action!

765
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:48,709
I will destroy him!

766
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:50,544
Cut! Cut! Cut!

767
00:59:50,629 --> 00:59:52,672
Devil On The Canvas,
12-apple, take five.

768
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:55,049
I will destroy him!

769
00:59:55,384 --> 00:59:58,719
- 12-apple, take six.
- I will destroy him!

770
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:00,471
12-apple, take seven.

771
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,431
I will destroy him!

772
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:04,016
12-baker, take one.

773
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:06,519
I will destroy him.

774
01:00:17,072 --> 01:00:19,282
12-Charlie, take one.

775
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:23,327
Take two.

776
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:26,872
One, two...

777
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:29,875
Take seven.

778
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:08,706
Orphan? Dame?

779
01:01:12,753 --> 01:01:14,211
- Front desk.
- Hello, Chet?

780
01:01:14,296 --> 01:01:16,005
This is Barton Fink, in room 621.

781
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:17,673
Could you try a number for me in Hollywood?

782
01:01:17,758 --> 01:01:21,177
- Sure.
- Slauson, 64304.

783
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:22,345
Right away, sir.

784
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:26,974
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up.

785
01:01:27,059 --> 01:01:29,393
- Hello?
- Audrey, I need help. I know it's late.

786
01:01:29,478 --> 01:01:30,811
And I shouldn't be calling you like this.

787
01:01:30,896 --> 01:01:33,522
Believe me,
I wouldn't have if I had any other alternative.

788
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:37,818
But I'm sorry... Listen, how are you?
I'm sorry. You doing okay?

789
01:01:38,445 --> 01:01:39,570
Who is this?

790
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:42,573
Barton! I'm sorry. It's Barton Fink.

791
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:44,742
Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good time.

792
01:01:45,369 --> 01:01:48,204
I'm sorry, I just feel like I need...

793
01:01:48,372 --> 01:01:52,124
I know I shouldn't ask.
I just need some kind of help, I just...

794
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:54,794
I have a deadline tomorrow.

795
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:58,798
All right, Barton. I'll see if I can slip away.

796
01:01:58,882 --> 01:02:01,467
- If you could, I'd be...
- lf I can.

797
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:04,136
He gets jealous.

798
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:06,972
I need help, Audrey.

799
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:11,268
I'll try to slip out if he quiets down,
passes out.

800
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:14,146
I'm afraid he thinks...

801
01:02:15,399 --> 01:02:17,525
Well, he said you were a buffoon, Barton.

802
01:02:17,651 --> 01:02:18,651
Uh-huh.

803
01:02:18,819 --> 01:02:20,152
He becomes irrational.

804
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:22,822
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

805
01:02:22,906 --> 01:02:24,657
I'll see if I can slip away.

806
01:02:24,866 --> 01:02:26,033
Who is that!

807
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:45,302
Audrey, thank you for coming.

808
01:02:46,054 --> 01:02:47,346
Thank you.

809
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:52,017
- Hello, Barton.
- I'm sorry to be such a... Such a...

810
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:56,897
- Thank you.
- That's all right, Barton.

811
01:02:58,108 --> 01:03:00,192
Everything's gonna be all right.

812
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:01,735
Yes. Thank you.

813
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:05,739
Thank you. Yes. Thank you.

814
01:03:08,285 --> 01:03:09,535
How's Bill?

815
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,121
He's...

816
01:03:12,956 --> 01:03:16,292
He drifted off. He'll sleep for a while now.

817
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:20,963
What is it you have to do, exactly?

818
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:22,047
Well...

819
01:03:22,716 --> 01:03:26,427
I have to come up with an outline,
I guess you'd call it.

820
01:03:26,887 --> 01:03:29,221
The story. The whole goddamn story.

821
01:03:29,306 --> 01:03:32,016
Soup to nuts. Three acts.
The whole goddamn...

822
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:35,311
That's all right, Barton.
You don't have to write actual scenes.

823
01:03:35,395 --> 01:03:38,564
No, but the whole goddamn...

824
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:42,610
Audrey,

825
01:03:43,737 --> 01:03:46,447
have you ever read
any of Bill's wrestling scenarios?

826
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:49,241
Yes, I'm afraid I have.

827
01:03:49,743 --> 01:03:51,368
What are they like? What are they about?

828
01:03:52,913 --> 01:03:58,334
Well, usually they're simple morality tales.

829
01:03:59,169 --> 01:04:03,464
There's a good wrestler and a bad wrestler
whom he confronts at the end.

830
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:06,592
In between the good wrestler has a love interest

831
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,886
or a small child he has to protect.

832
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:13,807
Bill would usually make the good wrestler
a backwoods type or a convict.

833
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:17,228
And sometimes, instead of a waif,

834
01:04:17,604 --> 01:04:21,190
he'd have the wrestler
protecting an idiot man-child.

835
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:22,983
The studio always hated that.

836
01:04:24,528 --> 01:04:28,614
Some of the scripts were so spirited.

837
01:04:32,619 --> 01:04:33,661
Barton...

838
01:04:35,455 --> 01:04:38,916
Look, it's really just a formula.
You don't have to type your soul into it.

839
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,462
We'll invent some names, a new setting.
I'll help you. Won't take any time at all.

840
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:45,589
I did it for Bill so many times.

841
01:04:46,174 --> 01:04:47,550
You did what for Bill?

842
01:04:49,094 --> 01:04:51,011
Well, this.

843
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:54,306
You wrote his scripts for him?

844
01:04:57,602 --> 01:05:01,313
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his.

845
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:04,191
You wrote Bill's scripts?

846
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:06,610
Jesus, you wrote his...

847
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:08,988
What about before that?

848
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:11,574
- Before what?
- Before Bill came to Hollywood.

849
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:15,744
Bill was always the author, so to speak.

850
01:05:15,996 --> 01:05:18,289
What do you mean "so to speak"?

851
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:24,003
Audrey, how long have you been his secretary?

852
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:26,880
Barton, I think we should
concentrate on our little project.

853
01:05:27,132 --> 01:05:29,592
I wanna know how many of Bill's books you wrote.

854
01:05:29,676 --> 01:05:30,759
- Barton...
- I wanna know!

855
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:32,595
Barton, honestly.

856
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:38,142
Only the last couple.

857
01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:42,521
And my input was mostly editorial, really.

858
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:44,815
After he'd been drinking.

859
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:45,899
I'll bet.

860
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:49,862
Jesus, the grand productive days.

861
01:05:50,155 --> 01:05:52,239
What a goddamn phony.

862
01:05:52,532 --> 01:05:56,952
W.P. Mayhew.
William goddamn Phony Mayhew.

863
01:05:57,037 --> 01:06:00,998
All his guff about escape.
I'll say he escaped!

864
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:05,628
Well, we don't have much time.

865
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:11,717
It'll be fine.

866
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:15,054
Don't judge him, Barton.

867
01:06:17,015 --> 01:06:18,724
Don't condescend to him.

868
01:06:20,769 --> 01:06:23,687
I help Bill most by understanding him,

869
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:26,815
by appreciating him.

870
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:31,278
We all need understanding, Barton.

871
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:34,490
Even you, tonight.

872
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:37,576
It's all you really need.

873
01:10:01,072 --> 01:10:02,155
Barton?

874
01:10:15,503 --> 01:10:16,712
Barton, are you all right?

875
01:10:16,796 --> 01:10:17,921
No, I'm fine, thank you.

876
01:10:18,006 --> 01:10:19,756
- Are you sure?
- No, no.

877
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:35,600
Barton, are you all right?

878
01:12:36,144 --> 01:12:38,395
No. Can I come in?

879
01:12:38,521 --> 01:12:39,938
Let's go to your room.

880
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:42,941
Charlie, I'm in trouble. You gotta help me.

881
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:45,694
Get a grip on yourself, brother.

882
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:47,571
Whatever the problem is, we can sort it out.

883
01:12:47,655 --> 01:12:50,532
Charlie, I'm in trouble.
Something horrible's happened.

884
01:12:50,742 --> 01:12:54,369
I gotta call the police.
Will you stay with me till they get here?

885
01:12:55,455 --> 01:12:58,248
Don't worry about it, Barton.
We can work it out.

886
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:00,959
Before you go in, I didn't do this.

887
01:13:01,044 --> 01:13:04,880
I don't know how it happened, but I didn't...

888
01:13:05,089 --> 01:13:07,174
I want you to know that.

889
01:13:14,307 --> 01:13:15,390
Okay.

890
01:13:42,919 --> 01:13:46,171
Jesus, Barton, what the hell is this?
What are we gonna do?

891
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:48,340
- I gotta call the police.
- Hold on. Hold on.

892
01:13:48,633 --> 01:13:50,759
- I didn't do this, I did not do this.
- Hold on.

893
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:53,220
Hold on. Hold on! Stop.

894
01:13:53,596 --> 01:13:55,180
Take a deep breath now.

895
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:57,933
- Tell me what happened.
- I passed out. I don't know.

896
01:13:58,351 --> 01:13:59,976
- Won't the police be able to...
- Stop with the police!

897
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:03,563
Wake up, friend! This does not look good!
They hang people for this.

898
01:14:03,648 --> 01:14:06,566
But I didn't do it. Don't you believe me?

899
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:09,736
I believe you, I know you.
Why should the police?

900
01:14:12,073 --> 01:14:13,365
Did you...

901
01:14:14,075 --> 01:14:17,869
Barton, between you and me,
did you have sexual intercourse?

902
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:22,958
Jesus, they can tell that.

903
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:25,418
They gotta believe me.

904
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:27,879
They gotta have mercy.

905
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:30,715
You're in pictures, Barton.

906
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:34,136
Even if they cleared you,
eventually, this would ruin you.

907
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:38,974
Come on, wait in the bathroom.

908
01:15:02,123 --> 01:15:06,001
Oh, Lord. Oh, Lordy. Oh, my Lord.

909
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:25,437
You passed out.

910
01:15:27,815 --> 01:15:28,982
Where's Audrey?

911
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:30,942
She's dead, Barton.

912
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,028
She's dead, if that was her name.

913
01:15:33,112 --> 01:15:36,323
Barton, listen to me.
You gotta act as if nothing has happened.

914
01:15:36,407 --> 01:15:37,949
Put this totally out of your head.

915
01:15:38,034 --> 01:15:40,160
I know that's hard,
but your play from here on out

916
01:15:40,244 --> 01:15:42,787
is just to go on about your business as usual.

917
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:44,164
Give us some time to sort this out.

918
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:57,177
Bart! So happy to see you.

919
01:15:58,763 --> 01:16:01,514
Sit, talk. Relax for a minute, then talk.

920
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:03,516
Drink?

921
01:16:04,018 --> 01:16:05,018
Ah...

922
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:06,645
Yeah.

923
01:16:07,647 --> 01:16:08,688
Rye whiskey?

924
01:16:08,773 --> 01:16:11,483
Boy, you writers work hard, play hard.

925
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:13,109
That's what I hear, anyway. Lou!

926
01:16:14,153 --> 01:16:17,072
Anyway. Ben Geisler tells me
things are going along great.

927
01:16:17,156 --> 01:16:19,574
Says we got a real winner in this one.

928
01:16:19,659 --> 01:16:21,826
Let me tell you something, I'm counting on it.

929
01:16:21,953 --> 01:16:24,162
I've taken an interest.
Nothing to fear, mind you.

930
01:16:24,247 --> 01:16:29,626
Hardly seems necessary in your case.
A writer, a storyteller of your stature.

931
01:16:29,877 --> 01:16:32,087
Give it to me in bold strokes, Bart.

932
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:34,005
Give me the broad outlines.

933
01:16:34,173 --> 01:16:36,508
I'm sitting in the audience, the lights go down.

934
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:38,260
Capitol logo comes up.

935
01:16:38,803 --> 01:16:39,844
You're on.

936
01:16:43,683 --> 01:16:46,518
Yeah. Okay.

937
01:16:49,647 --> 01:16:50,689
Well...

938
01:16:52,483 --> 01:16:53,692
We fade in.

939
01:16:57,697 --> 01:17:00,282
It's a tenement building on the Lower East Side.

940
01:17:00,366 --> 01:17:03,702
Great. He's poor, this wrestler.
He's had to struggle.

941
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,122
And then...

942
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,041
Well...

943
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:14,796
Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnick?

944
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:15,964
Can you?

945
01:17:17,008 --> 01:17:18,675
Jesus, you damn well better be.

946
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:21,177
If I wasn't honest in my business dealing...

947
01:17:21,262 --> 01:17:22,762
Well, of course you can't always be honest,

948
01:17:22,847 --> 01:17:24,306
not with the sharks swimming around this town.

949
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:25,974
But you're a writer,
you don't think about those things.

950
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:27,100
If I had been totally honest,

951
01:17:27,184 --> 01:17:29,561
I wouldn't be within a mile of this pool
unless I was cleaning it.

952
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:32,063
But that's no reason for you not to be.

953
01:17:33,232 --> 01:17:34,816
Honest, I mean. Not cleaning the pool.

954
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:50,248
To be honest, uh,

955
01:17:51,542 --> 01:17:54,210
I'm never really comfortable
discussing work in progress.

956
01:17:55,254 --> 01:17:58,256
I got it all worked out in my head,
but sometimes,

957
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:02,594
if you force it into words prematurely,

958
01:18:03,304 --> 01:18:04,596
the wrong words,

959
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:06,806
well, your meaning changes in...

960
01:18:07,433 --> 01:18:10,685
Changes in your own mind
and you never get it back.

961
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:13,897
So I'd just as soon as not talk about it.

962
01:18:19,445 --> 01:18:23,448
Mr. Fink, never mind me,
never mind how long I've been in pictures.

963
01:18:23,783 --> 01:18:26,785
Mr. Lipnick has been in pictures
just about since they was invented.

964
01:18:26,869 --> 01:18:28,453
He practically invented them.

965
01:18:29,288 --> 01:18:33,541
I think if he's interested in what
one of his contract employees is doing,

966
01:18:33,626 --> 01:18:35,960
that employee should be able to tell him,

967
01:18:36,212 --> 01:18:38,588
if he wants to stay an employee.

968
01:18:39,882 --> 01:18:45,470
Right now, the contents of your head
are the property of Capitol Pictures.

969
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:48,640
If I was you,

970
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:51,726
I would speak up and pretty goddamn fast.

971
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:58,483
You lousy kike

972
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:01,236
son of a bitch.

973
01:19:01,821 --> 01:19:05,657
You're telling this man,
this artist, what to do?

974
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:08,618
- Mr. Lipnick, I...
- This man creates for a living.

975
01:19:08,786 --> 01:19:11,830
Thank him for it, you son of a bitch,
or you're fired.

976
01:19:11,956 --> 01:19:15,291
- Mr. Lipnick, that's really not necessary.
- Get down on your knees, you son of a bitch.

977
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:18,461
Get down on your knees and kiss this man's feet.

978
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:20,255
Mr. Lipnick, please.

979
01:19:20,339 --> 01:19:22,006
Kiss this man's feet!

980
01:19:27,638 --> 01:19:29,597
Get out of here! You understand me?

981
01:19:30,182 --> 01:19:32,809
You're out of here. You're fired.
Get out of my sight.

982
01:19:42,069 --> 01:19:43,945
- I...
- I apologize, Barton.

983
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:46,698
No, no.
Mr. Breeze actually has been a great help.

984
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:48,408
You don't have to cover for him.
It's very noble of you.

985
01:19:48,492 --> 01:19:49,701
These things happen in business.

986
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:52,287
I really would feel much better
if you'd just reconsider.

987
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:54,289
Forget it, kid.
I want you to put it out of your head.

988
01:19:54,373 --> 01:19:57,167
If that son of a bitch wouldn't
apologize to you, then goddamn it, I will.

989
01:19:57,251 --> 01:20:00,044
I respect your artistry and your methods.

990
01:20:00,129 --> 01:20:01,796
And if you can't fill us in yet, well, hell,

991
01:20:01,881 --> 01:20:04,466
we should be kissing your feet
for your fine efforts.

992
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:08,553
You know...

993
01:20:12,558 --> 01:20:15,143
In the old country we were taught
as very young children

994
01:20:15,227 --> 01:20:18,771
that there's no shame in supplicating
yourself when you respect someone.

995
01:20:20,483 --> 01:20:23,776
On behalf of Capitol Pictures,
the administration,

996
01:20:23,861 --> 01:20:25,737
and all of the stockholders,

997
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:30,241
please accept this as a symbol
of our apology and respect.

998
01:20:58,604 --> 01:21:00,605
Barton, can I come in?

999
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:16,371
Jesus, you're leaving?

1000
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:19,040
I have to, old-timer, just for a little while.

1001
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:22,293
Jesus. Charlie, I...

1002
01:21:22,378 --> 01:21:24,587
Everything's okay, believe me.

1003
01:21:24,838 --> 01:21:28,466
I know it's rough, mentally,
but everything's been taken care of.

1004
01:21:29,468 --> 01:21:31,553
Charlie, I got no one else here.

1005
01:21:32,846 --> 01:21:35,515
You're the only person I know in Los Angeles

1006
01:21:36,684 --> 01:21:38,685
that I can talk to.

1007
01:21:47,570 --> 01:21:52,490
I feel like I'm losing my mind,
like I'm going crazy.

1008
01:21:52,616 --> 01:21:54,200
I don't know what to do.

1009
01:21:55,828 --> 01:22:00,707
I didn't do it, believe me,
I'm sure of that, Charlie, I...

1010
01:22:00,791 --> 01:22:02,500
You gotta get a grip on, brother.

1011
01:22:03,002 --> 01:22:06,087
You just gotta carry on,
just for a few days till I get back.

1012
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:09,007
Try and stay here, keep your door locked,
don't talk to anyone.

1013
01:22:09,592 --> 01:22:12,594
We gotta keep our heads and we'll figure it out.

1014
01:22:13,345 --> 01:22:15,221
- Okay, but what if...
- Don't argue with me.

1015
01:22:15,306 --> 01:22:18,391
You asked me to believe you and I do.
Now don't argue with me.

1016
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:23,813
Look, pal, can you do something for me?

1017
01:22:25,733 --> 01:22:27,567
Keep that for me till I get back.

1018
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:31,195
It's just a lot of personal stuff,
but I don't want to drag it with me.

1019
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:33,990
And I'd like to think it's in good hands.
Funny, huh.

1020
01:22:35,075 --> 01:22:37,493
When everything that's important to a guy,

1021
01:22:37,995 --> 01:22:40,663
everything he wants to keep from a lifetime,

1022
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:43,958
and he can fit it all into a little box like that.

1023
01:22:45,544 --> 01:22:46,628
I guess...

1024
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:50,048
I guess it's pretty pathetic.

1025
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:52,008
It's more than I've got.

1026
01:22:54,053 --> 01:22:56,512
Well, keep it for me,
maybe it'll bring you good luck.

1027
01:22:56,597 --> 01:22:59,599
Yeah, it'll help you finish your script.
You'll think about me.

1028
01:22:59,683 --> 01:23:02,518
Make me your wrestler,
then you'll lick that story of yours.

1029
01:23:02,603 --> 01:23:04,103
Thanks, Charlie.

1030
01:23:04,188 --> 01:23:05,772
Yeah, yeah, sure.

1031
01:23:06,231 --> 01:23:08,232
I'll see you soon, friend. You'll be fine.

1032
01:23:08,651 --> 01:23:09,651
And you'll be back?

1033
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:13,655
Don't worry about that, compadre.
I'll be back.

1034
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:13,501
Have you read the Bible, Pete?

1035
01:26:15,921 --> 01:26:17,630
The Holy Bible?

1036
01:26:19,633 --> 01:26:20,675
Yeah.

1037
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:24,428
Yeah, I think so.

1038
01:26:25,556 --> 01:26:27,557
Anyway, I've heard about it.

1039
01:26:41,864 --> 01:26:43,948
- Fink?
- Yeah.

1040
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:47,201
- Detective Mastrionotti.
- Detective Deutsch.

1041
01:26:47,327 --> 01:26:48,619
LAPD.

1042
01:26:49,496 --> 01:26:50,538
Uh-huh.

1043
01:26:50,622 --> 01:26:52,373
Got some questions we want to ask you.

1044
01:26:52,499 --> 01:26:54,417
Just routine. Sit down.

1045
01:26:55,919 --> 01:26:57,461
What do you do, Fink?

1046
01:27:00,465 --> 01:27:01,465
I write.

1047
01:27:02,342 --> 01:27:03,551
Yeah? What kind of writing?

1048
01:27:03,635 --> 01:27:06,220
Well, as a matter of fact,
I write for the pictures.

1049
01:27:06,305 --> 01:27:08,222
- Big fucking deal.
- Want my partner to kiss your ass?

1050
01:27:08,307 --> 01:27:09,807
Would that be good enough for you?

1051
01:27:09,892 --> 01:27:12,143
- No, I didn't mean to sound...
- What did you mean?

1052
01:27:13,395 --> 01:27:15,521
I got respect for working guys like you.

1053
01:27:15,606 --> 01:27:17,690
Jesus, ain't that a load off?

1054
01:27:17,774 --> 01:27:20,109
- You live in 621?
- Yeah.

1055
01:27:20,193 --> 01:27:21,485
How long you been up there, Fink?

1056
01:27:22,195 --> 01:27:23,404
A week. Eight, nine days.

1057
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:26,073
- Is this multiple choice?
- You know this slob?

1058
01:27:37,044 --> 01:27:39,086
Yeah, he lives next door to me.

1059
01:27:39,171 --> 01:27:40,588
That's right, Fink.

1060
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:44,508
- He lives next door to you.
- You ever talk to him?

1061
01:27:46,011 --> 01:27:47,136
Once or twice.

1062
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:49,430
His name is Charlie Meadows.

1063
01:27:49,514 --> 01:27:51,974
Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.

1064
01:27:52,059 --> 01:27:54,143
His name's Mundt. Karl Mundt.

1065
01:27:54,227 --> 01:27:56,312
Also known as Madman Mundt.

1066
01:27:56,396 --> 01:27:58,272
A little funny in the head.

1067
01:27:59,191 --> 01:28:00,608
- What did he...
- Funny,

1068
01:28:00,776 --> 01:28:04,654
as in he likes to ventilate people
with a shotgun and then cut their heads off.

1069
01:28:04,738 --> 01:28:05,821
Yeah, he's funny that way.

1070
01:28:05,906 --> 01:28:08,741
He started in Kansas City.
A couple housewives.

1071
01:28:08,867 --> 01:28:10,952
A couple of days ago we got
the same MO out at Los Feliz.

1072
01:28:11,036 --> 01:28:14,288
- Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man.
- All of which is now missing.

1073
01:28:14,373 --> 01:28:17,124
- Well, some of his throat was there.
- Physician, heal thyself.

1074
01:28:17,209 --> 01:28:19,460
- Good luck with fucking no head.
- Anyway.

1075
01:28:19,544 --> 01:28:22,588
Hollywood Precinct
finds another stiff yesterday.

1076
01:28:22,673 --> 01:28:26,509
Not too far from here.
This one's better looking than the doc.

1077
01:28:26,718 --> 01:28:30,137
Female Caucasian, about 30 years old.
Nice tits, no head.

1078
01:28:31,056 --> 01:28:33,099
Ever see Mundt with anyone
fits that description?

1079
01:28:33,183 --> 01:28:35,601
But, you know, with the head still on.

1080
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:40,314
No. I never saw him with anyone else.

1081
01:28:40,399 --> 01:28:42,900
So you did talk to Mundt. What about?

1082
01:28:44,403 --> 01:28:48,114
Nothing really.
He said he was in the insurance business.

1083
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:49,782
Yeah, and he's Buck Rogers.

1084
01:28:49,866 --> 01:28:53,077
No reputable company would hire a guy like that.

1085
01:28:53,161 --> 01:28:54,370
Well, that's what he said.

1086
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:55,705
What else?

1087
01:28:58,417 --> 01:28:59,583
I'm trying to think.

1088
01:29:00,585 --> 01:29:02,086
Nothing, really. He...

1089
01:29:04,339 --> 01:29:06,632
He said he liked Jack Oakie pictures.

1090
01:29:09,428 --> 01:29:15,141
You know, ordinarily we say anything
you might remember could be helpful.

1091
01:29:16,268 --> 01:29:19,854
But I'll be frank with you, Fink,
that is not helpful.

1092
01:29:19,938 --> 01:29:21,605
Notice how he's not writing it down?

1093
01:29:23,692 --> 01:29:24,817
Fink?

1094
01:29:25,819 --> 01:29:27,361
That's a...

1095
01:29:28,196 --> 01:29:29,864
A Jewish name, isn't it?

1096
01:29:29,948 --> 01:29:32,158
Yeah.

1097
01:29:33,285 --> 01:29:35,578
I didn't think this dump was restricted.

1098
01:29:36,830 --> 01:29:41,000
Mundt has disappeared,
I don't think he'll be back.

1099
01:29:42,294 --> 01:29:44,086
But give me a call if you see him.

1100
01:29:46,506 --> 01:29:50,301
Or if you remember something
that isn't totally idiotic.

1101
01:31:35,824 --> 01:31:37,783
"Fade in.

1102
01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:42,663
"A young hussy opens the door

1103

01:31:52,507 --> 01:31:56,594

1107
01:32:02,475 --> 01:32:06,312
"Yours... Indelibly...

"I don't care.
It's lonely after all these years..."

1119
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:48,145
Hold the line, sir,
I have your call.

1120
01:32:48,230 --> 01:32:50,564
Hello, operator? I can't...

1121
01:32:51,441 --> 01:32:52,942
Oh, God.

1122
01:32:57,113 --> 01:32:58,530
- Hello?
- Garland, it's me.

1123
01:32:58,615 --> 01:33:03,494
Barton? What time is it? Are you all right?

1124
01:33:03,745 --> 01:33:07,164
Yeah, I'm fine. I have to talk to you, Garland.

1125
01:33:07,332 --> 01:33:09,541
I'm calling long distance.

1126
01:33:09,668 --> 01:33:11,752
What is it, Barton? Are you okay?

1127
01:33:11,836 --> 01:33:14,338
Yeah, I'm fine, Garland,
but I have to talk to you.

1128
01:33:14,422 --> 01:33:16,298
It's about what I'm writing.

1129
01:33:16,675 --> 01:33:17,841
I think

1130
01:33:18,551 --> 01:33:19,885
it's really...

1131
01:33:21,471 --> 01:33:23,180
I think it's really big.

1132
01:33:24,182 --> 01:33:27,810
- What do you mean?
- Not big in the sense of large,

1133
01:33:27,894 --> 01:33:31,272
although it's that, too. I mean important.

1134
01:33:32,983 --> 01:33:35,526
This may be the most important work
I've ever done.

1135
01:33:36,069 --> 01:33:37,778
Barton, is everything okay?

1136
01:33:38,697 --> 01:33:40,155
You sound a little...

1137
01:33:40,407 --> 01:33:42,241
Sound a little what?

1138
01:33:42,909 --> 01:33:44,535
You sound a little...

1139
01:33:45,245 --> 01:33:48,914
Thanks, Garland.
Thanks for all the encouragement.

1140
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:53,127
Nitwit.

1141
01:35:27,931 --> 01:35:29,681
Excuse me, buddy. Mind if I cut in?

1142
01:35:31,101 --> 01:35:32,684
This is my dance, sailor.

1143
01:35:32,977 --> 01:35:35,312
Hey, come on, buddy, I'm shipping out tomorrow.

1144
01:35:37,315 --> 01:35:41,652
I'm a writer, celebrating
the completion of something good.

1145
01:35:42,153 --> 01:35:45,239
- Do you understand that, sailor?
- Beat it, creep.

1146
01:35:45,323 --> 01:35:47,950
Come on, buddy, give the navy a dance.

1147
01:35:48,034 --> 01:35:50,077
Let somebody else spin the dame.

1148
01:35:50,161 --> 01:35:51,912
Step aside, four eyes.

1149
01:35:51,996 --> 01:35:53,539
Hey, 4F, take a hike.

1150
01:35:53,623 --> 01:35:55,499
- Suck an egg.
- Go sit on a tomato.

1151
01:35:56,459 --> 01:35:59,503
I'm a writer, you monsters. I create.

1152
01:35:59,838 --> 01:36:01,505
I create for a living!

1153
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:04,967
I'm a creator! I am a creator!

1154
01:36:05,051 --> 01:36:08,303
- He's screwy.
- This is my uniform.

1155
01:36:09,097 --> 01:36:12,433
This is how I serve the common man.
This is where I...

1156
01:36:15,687 --> 01:36:16,854
Get 'em, boys.

1157
01:36:52,682 --> 01:36:55,476
"Where is my little boy?

1158
01:36:56,478 --> 01:36:57,853
"He left this morning.

1159
01:36:58,980 --> 01:37:00,606
"Said he had a job to do.

1160
01:37:01,191 --> 01:37:05,068
"There was something in his eyes.
Something new.

1161
01:37:05,987 --> 01:37:09,072
"Mother: What's to become of him?

1162
01:37:10,825 --> 01:37:15,787
"Father: We'll be hearing
from that crazy wrestler,

1163
01:37:16,581 --> 01:37:18,540
"and I don't mean a postcard.

1164
01:37:19,375 --> 01:37:21,627
"Fade out. The end."

1165
01:37:26,007 --> 01:37:27,841
I thought you said you were a writer.

1166
01:37:27,926 --> 01:37:29,801
Now I don't know, Duke.
I kind of liked it.

1167
01:37:29,886 --> 01:37:31,678
Keep your filthy eyes off of that.

1168
01:37:33,473 --> 01:37:35,182
You made the morning papers, Fink.

1169
01:37:35,475 --> 01:37:38,352
Second one of your friends to wind up dead.

1170
01:37:38,436 --> 01:37:40,521
You do get around, don't you, Fink?

1171
01:37:40,605 --> 01:37:44,358
- You didn't tell us you knew the dame.
- Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?

1172
01:37:44,442 --> 01:37:45,943
Give you nosebleeds?

1173
01:37:48,780 --> 01:37:52,533
Just tell me one thing, Fink.
Where'd you put the heads?

1174
01:37:53,409 --> 01:37:56,453
Charlie. Charlie's back.

1175
01:37:56,996 --> 01:38:00,415
No kidding, bright boy.
We smelled Mundt all over this.

1176
01:38:01,125 --> 01:38:02,167
Was he the idea man?

1177
01:38:02,252 --> 01:38:05,003
Tell us where the heads are.
Maybe they'll go easy on you.

1178
01:38:05,088 --> 01:38:06,547
Only fry you once.

1179
01:38:06,631 --> 01:38:07,881
Could you two come back later?

1180
01:38:07,966 --> 01:38:10,592
It's just too hot, my head is killing me.

1181
01:38:10,677 --> 01:38:13,637
All right, forget the heads.
Where's Mundt, Fink?

1182
01:38:14,138 --> 01:38:17,391
- He teach you how to do it?
- You two have some sick sex thing?

1183
01:38:17,475 --> 01:38:19,017
Sex?

1184
01:38:19,561 --> 01:38:21,853
He's a man. We wrestled.

1185
01:38:25,358 --> 01:38:26,650
You're a sick fuck, Fink.

1186
01:38:27,819 --> 01:38:28,986
Charlie's back.

1187
01:38:29,988 --> 01:38:31,572
It's hot, he's back.

1188
01:38:57,682 --> 01:38:58,724
Fred.

1189
01:39:04,272 --> 01:39:06,273
Sit tight, Fink.

1190
01:39:11,779 --> 01:39:14,031
Why is it so goddamn hot out here?

1191
01:39:16,492 --> 01:39:17,492
Duke.

1192
01:39:46,397 --> 01:39:47,606
Mundt!

1193
01:39:52,695 --> 01:39:55,030
Mundt! Show yourself.

1194
01:40:17,595 --> 01:40:18,929
There's a boy, Mundt.

1195
01:40:21,307 --> 01:40:24,518
Put the policy case down
and your mitts in the air.

1196
01:40:35,113 --> 01:40:36,196
He's complying.

1197
01:40:41,077 --> 01:40:43,120
Look upon me!

1198
01:40:43,496 --> 01:40:46,456
I'll show you the life of the mind!

1199
01:40:51,921 --> 01:40:52,921
Look upon me!

1200
01:40:53,798 --> 01:40:59,136
I'll show you the life of the mind!
I'll show you the life of the mind!

1201
01:40:59,887 --> 01:41:02,180
I'll show you the life of the mind!

1202
01:41:02,390 --> 01:41:05,183
I will show you the life of the mind!

1203
01:41:34,714 --> 01:41:35,922
Heil Hitler.

1204
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:50,687
Barton.

1205
01:41:54,567 --> 01:41:56,067
Brother, is it hot.

1206
01:41:58,029 --> 01:41:59,196
How you been, buddy?

1207
01:42:02,033 --> 01:42:04,201
Don't look at me like that.

1208
01:42:04,494 --> 01:42:06,203
It's just me, Charlie.

1209
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:10,207
I hear it's Mundt. Madman Mundt.

1210
01:42:11,542 --> 01:42:14,044
Jesus, people can be cruel.

1211
01:42:15,254 --> 01:42:17,923
If it's not my build, it's my personality.

1212
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:28,350
They say I'm a madman, Bart,
but I'm not mad at anyone.

1213
01:42:28,726 --> 01:42:30,143
Honest, I'm not.

1214
01:42:31,604 --> 01:42:33,980
Most guys I just feel sorry for.

1215
01:42:35,441 --> 01:42:38,985
It tears me up inside to think about
what they're going through,

1216
01:42:39,070 --> 01:42:40,862
how trapped they are.

1217
01:42:43,366 --> 01:42:45,367
I understand it.

1218
01:42:46,285 --> 01:42:47,869
I feel for them.

1219
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:52,833
So I try and help them out.

1220
01:42:53,543 --> 01:42:54,668
Jesus.

1221
01:42:57,129 --> 01:42:59,464
Yeah. Yeah.

1222
01:43:01,926 --> 01:43:05,720
I know what it feels like when
things get all balled up at the head office.

1223
01:43:06,556 --> 01:43:08,557
It puts you through hell, Barton.

1224
01:43:10,768 --> 01:43:12,769
So I help people out.

1225
01:43:15,565 --> 01:43:18,316
I just wish someone would do as much for me.

1226
01:43:21,195 --> 01:43:23,655
Jesus, it's hot.

1227
01:43:29,036 --> 01:43:33,039
Sometimes it gets so hot
I want to crawl right out of my skin.

1228
01:43:34,250 --> 01:43:36,084
But, Charlie, why me?

1229
01:43:37,044 --> 01:43:39,963
- Why...
- Because you don't listen!

1230
01:43:49,557 --> 01:43:52,309
Jesus, I'm dripping again.

1231
01:43:55,813 --> 01:43:57,647
Come on, Barton.

1232
01:43:59,066 --> 01:44:00,734
You think you know pain?

1233
01:44:02,862 --> 01:44:05,322
You think I made your life hell?

1234
01:44:07,617 --> 01:44:09,576
Take a look around this dump.

1235
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:12,495
You're just a tourist with a typewriter,
Barton, I live here.

1236
01:44:12,580 --> 01:44:14,164
Don't you understand that?

1237
01:44:21,839 --> 01:44:23,882
And you come into my home,

1238
01:44:26,677 --> 01:44:28,553
and you complain

1239
01:44:28,638 --> 01:44:31,932
that I'm making too much noise.

1240
01:44:44,111 --> 01:44:45,445
I'm sorry.

1241
01:44:53,412 --> 01:44:54,579
Don't be.

1242
01:45:43,170 --> 01:45:45,171
I'll be next door if you need me.

1243
01:45:50,011 --> 01:45:51,011
Oh,

1244
01:45:51,637 --> 01:45:54,973
I dropped in on your folks
in New York and Uncle Maury.

1245
01:45:57,101 --> 01:45:58,226
Good people.

1246
01:46:05,026 --> 01:46:07,610
By the way, that package I gave you,

1247
01:46:08,070 --> 01:46:10,780
I lied. It isn't mine.

1248
01:47:15,471 --> 01:47:20,141
Fink. Samuel or Lillian Fink.
85 Fulton Street.

1249
01:47:20,226 --> 01:47:21,434
- I under...
- Or Uncle Maury.

1250
01:47:21,519 --> 01:47:23,686
I understand that, sir,
but there's still no answer.

1251
01:47:23,771 --> 01:47:24,938
Mr. Fink!

1252
01:47:25,314 --> 01:47:27,190
Shall I check for trouble on the line?

1253
01:47:34,949 --> 01:47:36,199
Fink.

1254
01:47:36,283 --> 01:47:37,367
Mr. Lipnick?

1255
01:47:38,702 --> 01:47:41,204
Colonel Lipnick, if you don't mind. Sit down.

1256
01:47:41,497 --> 01:47:43,081
I was commissioned yesterday
in the Army Reserve.

1257
01:47:43,165 --> 01:47:44,874
Henry Morgenthau arranged it. Dear friend.

1258
01:47:46,877 --> 01:47:47,877
Congratulations.

1259
01:47:47,962 --> 01:47:49,712
Well, actually it hasn't officially
gone through yet.

1260
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:51,297
I had wardrobe whip this up.

1261
01:47:51,590 --> 01:47:53,424
You gotta pull teeth
to get anything done in this town.

1262
01:47:53,509 --> 01:47:55,135
I can understand a little red tape in peacetime,

1263
01:47:55,219 --> 01:47:57,137
but now it's all-out warfare against the Japs.

1264
01:47:57,221 --> 01:48:00,473
Little yellow bastards.
They'd love to see me sit this one out.

1265
01:48:00,558 --> 01:48:01,808
Yes, sir. They...

1266
01:48:01,892 --> 01:48:04,894
Anyway. I had Lou read your script for me.

1267
01:48:06,814 --> 01:48:08,439
I gotta tell you, Fink.

1268
01:48:09,567 --> 01:48:10,859
It won't wash.

1269
01:48:11,110 --> 01:48:14,028
With all due respect, sir,
I think it's the best work I've done.

1270
01:48:14,113 --> 01:48:15,655
Don't gas me, Fink.

1271
01:48:15,823 --> 01:48:18,658
If your opinion mattered,
I guess I'd resign or let you run the studio.

1272
01:48:18,742 --> 01:48:20,160
Well, it doesn't and you won't.

1273
01:48:20,286 --> 01:48:22,328
Now, the lunatics are not
gonna run this particular asylum,

1274
01:48:22,413 --> 01:48:25,081
so let's put a stop to that rumor right now.

1275
01:48:26,333 --> 01:48:27,333
Yes, sir.

1276
01:48:27,793 --> 01:48:30,003
I had to call Beery this morning,

1277
01:48:30,087 --> 01:48:31,254
tell him we're pushing the picture back,

1278
01:48:31,338 --> 01:48:34,883
after all I'd told him about quality,
about that Barton Fink feeling.

1279
01:48:35,259 --> 01:48:36,467
How disappointed we were.

1280
01:48:36,552 --> 01:48:39,470
Wally was heartbroken, the man was devastated.

1281
01:48:40,014 --> 01:48:41,097
He was...

1282
01:48:41,974 --> 01:48:43,516
Well, I didn't actually call him, Lou did.

1283
01:48:43,601 --> 01:48:44,767
But that's a fair description, isn't it, Lou?

1284
01:48:44,935 --> 01:48:46,019
Yes, Colonel.

1285
01:48:46,103 --> 01:48:51,065
Hell, I could take you through it step by step
explaining why your story stinks.

1286
01:48:51,150 --> 01:48:53,860
But I won't insult your intelligence.
Well, all right.

1287
01:48:53,944 --> 01:48:57,488
First of all, this is a wrestling picture.

1288
01:48:57,948 --> 01:49:01,618
The audience wants to see action, adventure,
wrestling and plenty of it.

1289
01:49:01,702 --> 01:49:03,953
They don't want to see
a guy wrestling with his soul.

1290
01:49:04,038 --> 01:49:05,663
Well, all right, a little bit for the critics.

1291
01:49:05,748 --> 01:49:07,999
But you make it the carrot that wags the dog.

1292
01:49:08,083 --> 01:49:10,126
Too much of it, they head for the exits.
I don't blame them.

1293
01:49:10,211 --> 01:49:13,755
There's plenty of poetry
right inside that ring, Fink.

1294
01:49:13,839 --> 01:49:15,381
Look at Hell, Ten Feet Square.

1295
01:49:15,466 --> 01:49:17,967
- Blood, Sweat and Canvas.
- Blood, Sweat and Canvas.

1296
01:49:18,052 --> 01:49:21,721
These are big movies, Fink,
about big men, in tights!

1297
01:49:21,847 --> 01:49:23,806
Both physically and mentally.

1298
01:49:24,475 --> 01:49:26,184
Especially physically.

1299
01:49:26,268 --> 01:49:29,896
We don't put Wally Beery
in a fruity movie about suffering.

1300
01:49:30,314 --> 01:49:31,814
I thought we were together on that.

1301
01:49:34,193 --> 01:49:35,360
Sorry if I let you down.

1302
01:49:35,444 --> 01:49:37,445
You didn't let me down, Fink, or even Lou.

1303
01:49:37,529 --> 01:49:41,908
We don't live or die by what you scribble.
You let Ben Geisler down.

1304
01:49:41,992 --> 01:49:45,745
He liked you, trusted you.
And that's why he's gone, he's fired.

1305
01:49:45,829 --> 01:49:48,998
That man had a heart as big as
the all outdoors and you fucked him.

1306
01:49:49,083 --> 01:49:52,210
He tried to convince me
to fire you, too, but no, that'd be too easy.

1307
01:49:52,294 --> 01:49:54,462
Now, you're under contract.
You're gonna stay that way.

1308
01:49:54,546 --> 01:49:57,215
Anything you write is gonna be the property
of Capitol Pictures

1309
01:49:57,299 --> 01:50:00,426
and Capitol Pictures
is not gonna produce anything you write.

1310
01:50:00,511 --> 01:50:02,011
Not until you grow up a little.

1311
01:50:02,846 --> 01:50:07,558
You ain't no writer, Fink,
you're a goddamn write-off.

1312
01:50:11,313 --> 01:50:14,190
I tried to show you something beautiful.

1313
01:50:16,860 --> 01:50:18,569
Something about all of us.

1314
01:50:20,072 --> 01:50:23,491
You arrogant son of a bitch.

1315
01:50:24,118 --> 01:50:28,371
You think you're the only writer
that can give me that Barton Fink feeling?

1316
01:50:28,497 --> 01:50:33,376
I got 20 writers under contract
I can ask for a Fink-type thing from!

1317
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:36,087
You swell-headed hypocrite,
you just don't get it, do you?

1318
01:50:36,255 --> 01:50:38,506
You think the whole world revolves around

1319
01:50:38,590 --> 01:50:42,302
whatever rattles inside
that little kike head of yours.

1320
01:50:43,053 --> 01:50:44,387
Get him out of my sight, Lou.

1321
01:50:45,055 --> 01:50:48,182
I want him in town, though.
He's still under contract.

1322
01:50:48,642 --> 01:50:51,728
I want you in town, Fink, and out of my sight.

1323
01:50:53,063 --> 01:50:54,147
Now get lost.

1324
01:50:55,399 --> 01:50:56,941
There's a war on.

1325
01:51:55,417 --> 01:51:56,959
It's a beautiful day.

1326
01:51:57,711 --> 01:51:58,711
Huh?

1327
01:52:05,636 --> 01:52:07,470
I said it's a beautiful day.

1328
01:52:08,013 --> 01:52:10,681
Yes. It is.

1329
01:52:14,103 --> 01:52:15,436
What's in the box?

1330
01:52:17,815 --> 01:52:18,981
I don't know.

1331
01:52:20,984 --> 01:52:22,151
Isn't it yours?

1332
01:52:27,866 --> 01:52:29,492
I don't know.

1333
01:52:36,667 --> 01:52:38,000
You're very beautiful.

1334
01:52:43,006 --> 01:52:44,298
Are you in pictures?

1335
01:52:46,385 --> 01:52:47,510
Don't be silly.
