1
00:05:27,688 --> 00:05:30,498
Nice fat deposit.
You're sure in the right business, Sally.

2
00:05:30,568 --> 00:05:31,729
Thank you.

3
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,176
Good morning.

4
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:36,535
Deposit.

5
00:05:45,688 --> 00:05:46,735
Another nice deposit.

6
00:05:46,808 --> 00:05:48,810
You and Sally are sure
in the right business.

7
00:05:48,888 --> 00:05:50,413
I'm in a hurry, please.

8
00:06:38,048 --> 00:06:39,209
Hi, Kate.

9
00:07:16,648 --> 00:07:18,696
Have you cleaned up the house
across the way?

10
00:07:18,768 --> 00:07:20,133
I haven't had time yet.

11
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,290
You should always do that one first.

12
00:07:29,888 --> 00:07:31,014
Anne!

13
00:07:37,048 --> 00:07:38,209
Come here.

14
00:07:42,368 --> 00:07:44,814
Did you ever see that kid out there before?

15
00:07:45,168 --> 00:07:47,296
I think maybe he was in the bar last night.

16
00:07:47,368 --> 00:07:48,529
Send Joe in.

17
00:07:49,648 --> 00:07:50,615
Joe.

18
00:07:56,168 --> 00:07:57,738
Hello, Pretty Boy.

19
00:08:02,768 --> 00:08:05,931
- Call me, Kate?
- Yeah. Take a look out the window.

20
00:08:06,008 --> 00:08:09,694
There's a kid who's been following me
all the way to the bank and back.

21
00:08:34,048 --> 00:08:36,449
Come here, you young squirt, come here.

22
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:41,769
- You want me?
- What's the idea of throwing that stone?

23
00:08:42,928 --> 00:08:44,896
Any law against throwing stones?

24
00:08:45,528 --> 00:08:47,576
You're tough? Come here!

25
00:08:51,128 --> 00:08:53,734
What are you hanging around here for,
anyway?

26
00:08:55,728 --> 00:08:57,457
- Would she talk to me?
- Kate?

27
00:08:58,168 --> 00:09:00,739
What for? What do you want?

28
00:09:03,488 --> 00:09:05,536
Just wanna talk to her.

29
00:09:05,968 --> 00:09:08,812
- What do you want, you?
- Nothing.

30
00:09:10,648 --> 00:09:12,173
You live around here?

31
00:09:13,328 --> 00:09:16,013
- In Monterey?
- Salinas.

32
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:17,374
What's your name?

33
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:21,098
You're not talking? Now, look...

34
00:09:21,168 --> 00:09:23,216
why are you following Kate around?

35
00:09:23,768 --> 00:09:25,008
What's the idea, squirt?

36
00:09:25,088 --> 00:09:27,932
Any law against following
around the town...

37
00:09:29,248 --> 00:09:30,818
madam, whatever you call her?

38
00:09:30,888 --> 00:09:34,017
I don't know if there's any law against it,
but she don't like it.

39
00:09:34,088 --> 00:09:36,216
She owns that house over there, too,
don't she?

40
00:09:36,288 --> 00:09:39,531
But don't you go hanging
around there, squirt. You're too young.

41
00:09:39,608 --> 00:09:41,849
Now come on. Now beat it.

42
00:09:41,928 --> 00:09:43,612
Is that her real name?

43
00:09:45,088 --> 00:09:49,332
- Kate. Is that her real name?
- Sure, as far as I know. Why?

44
00:09:50,648 --> 00:09:52,298
What's her last name?

45
00:09:52,408 --> 00:09:55,059
Nobody's got any last name
around here, kid. Why?

46
00:09:59,128 --> 00:10:02,052
You tell her I hate her.

47
00:10:24,968 --> 00:10:27,494
I should have gone right on in there.

48
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:30,729
Should have gone right on in there
and talked to her.

49
00:10:52,968 --> 00:10:55,812
Cal wasn't home all night.
Boy, is he gonna catch it from Dad.

50
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:58,414
- You know what the girls in class call him?
- No, what?

51
00:10:58,488 --> 00:11:00,058
The Prowler.

52
00:11:00,128 --> 00:11:02,051
- I'll tell him that.
- You better not, Aron.

53
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:03,459
- Promise me you won't.
- Why not?

54
00:11:03,528 --> 00:11:05,735
Please don't. I don't want you...

55
00:11:07,088 --> 00:11:08,658
- Hi, Cal.
- Hi.

56
00:11:08,728 --> 00:11:10,218
Hello, Cal.

57
00:11:10,808 --> 00:11:12,298
Excuse me for talking.

58
00:11:12,368 --> 00:11:15,053
We're going down to see the icehouse
that Dad's gonna buy.

59
00:11:15,128 --> 00:11:16,698
- Do you want to come?
- What icehouse?

60
00:11:16,768 --> 00:11:18,975
The one he's buying
to freeze the vegetables with.

61
00:11:19,048 --> 00:11:21,699
He's been talking about it every night
for the last week.

62
00:11:21,768 --> 00:11:22,974
Is Dad gonna be there?

63
00:11:23,048 --> 00:11:25,016
Why sure, he's gonna buy it.

64
00:11:26,888 --> 00:11:28,333
I'll skip it.

65
00:11:29,048 --> 00:11:31,210
You're gonna have
to see him sometime, Cal.

66
00:11:31,288 --> 00:11:34,019
- Come on.
- Hey, Aron.

67
00:11:34,088 --> 00:11:35,010
Yeah?

68
00:11:35,648 --> 00:11:38,970
- Why don't you ask me where I've been?
- Would you tell me?

69
00:11:39,848 --> 00:11:42,294
- No.
- Then what's the use of my asking?

70
00:11:45,048 --> 00:11:47,289
- Is Dad mad at me?
- Well, you were out all night.

71
00:11:47,368 --> 00:11:49,450
He was worried.

72
00:11:50,408 --> 00:11:51,614
Yeah, I bet.

73
00:11:53,688 --> 00:11:55,292
You gonna come or not?

74
00:11:57,768 --> 00:12:00,214
Okay. I'll see you at supper.

75
00:12:00,528 --> 00:12:01,654
He's coming.

76
00:12:02,968 --> 00:12:04,333
He's coming.

77
00:12:11,048 --> 00:12:13,494
You see, Will, I got the idea
from an article I read.

78
00:12:13,568 --> 00:12:16,139
They dug up a mastodon
somewhere in Siberia.

79
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:19,576
Been in the ice for thousands of years
and the meat was still good.

80
00:12:19,648 --> 00:12:20,570
Mastodon?

81
00:12:25,488 --> 00:12:27,809
What have you got to say for yourself?

82
00:12:31,248 --> 00:12:32,852
This is my son, Cal.

83
00:12:33,848 --> 00:12:36,738
When you were his age,
I imagine you thought it only right...

84
00:12:36,808 --> 00:12:39,334
to let your father know
before you stayed out all night.

85
00:12:39,408 --> 00:12:42,935
Or at least to offer some kind
of apology when you did come home.

86
00:12:43,168 --> 00:12:44,818
Well, times change.

87
00:12:45,968 --> 00:12:49,256
As I was saying,
a mastodon is a kind of elephant.

88
00:12:49,328 --> 00:12:51,410
Hasn't lived on the Earth for a long while.

89
00:12:51,488 --> 00:12:54,537
- And the meat was still fresh?
- Sweet as a pork chop.

90
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:57,896
You're more excited about this
than you've been for a long time.

91
00:12:57,968 --> 00:12:59,652
Now, I seem to be, don't I?

92
00:12:59,728 --> 00:13:02,698
See, Will, I've been sort of
in a rut out there in the ranch.

93
00:13:02,768 --> 00:13:06,375
- Sixteen, 17 years, I've kept out of things.
- I know.

94
00:13:06,448 --> 00:13:09,691
But now I feel that
if I could only do something...

95
00:13:09,768 --> 00:13:14,376
some little thing for, before I die,
some little thing for progress...

96
00:13:14,808 --> 00:13:17,095
for people, maybe.
Call it anything you want.

97
00:13:17,168 --> 00:13:20,331
I might make up for all the years
I've been lying fallow.

98
00:13:20,408 --> 00:13:24,208
So, lately I've been reading up all I can
about refrigeration.

99
00:13:24,288 --> 00:13:27,735
And I can't get it out of my head
that you can keep anything good...

100
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:31,335
as long as you can get it cold enough.
Like that mastodon there.

101
00:13:31,408 --> 00:13:33,649
- Good afternoon, Abra.
- Good afternoon, Mr. Trask.

102
00:13:33,728 --> 00:13:34,968
- Hello, Mr. Hamilton.
- Hello.

103
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:36,174
- Hello, Son.
- Hi, Dad.

104
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:40,253
Now my son, Aron, that is,
thinks I may have a good idea here.

105
00:13:40,328 --> 00:13:42,330
Dad wrapped a head of lettuce
in wax paper...

106
00:13:42,408 --> 00:13:44,570
and kept it in our icebox
for over three weeks...

107
00:13:44,648 --> 00:13:46,571
and it still came out fresh and good.
Right?

108
00:13:46,648 --> 00:13:47,695
Quite right, Son.

109
00:13:47,768 --> 00:13:51,853
- Dad, is it all right if we look around?
-'Course, Aron. Belongs to us now.

110
00:13:53,408 --> 00:13:56,651
Do you know where the biggest market
for vegetables is in the winter?

111
00:13:56,728 --> 00:13:58,412
- Where?
- New York City.

112
00:13:58,488 --> 00:14:00,297
And they can't raise them there.

113
00:14:00,368 --> 00:14:03,053
But the rail road had promised me
those fruit cars.

114
00:14:04,568 --> 00:14:07,174
Don't you have anything to say to me, Cal?

115
00:14:07,248 --> 00:14:09,376
- Yeah.
- It's about time. Well?

116
00:14:10,688 --> 00:14:13,897
I read in the Monterey newspaper...

117
00:14:13,968 --> 00:14:16,812
that if we get into this war...

118
00:14:16,888 --> 00:14:19,494
there are gonna be some fortunes made.

119
00:14:19,728 --> 00:14:24,017
But you're gonna make them
in beans and corn, and stuff like that.

120
00:14:25,248 --> 00:14:27,819
- You don't need all this ice.
- You're perfectly right.

121
00:14:27,888 --> 00:14:29,413
Beans are up to 3 cents.

122
00:14:29,488 --> 00:14:31,377
You wanna make a profit, you plant beans.

123
00:14:31,448 --> 00:14:33,371
And they keep, too, don't they?

124
00:14:33,448 --> 00:14:36,611
But I'm not particularly interested
in making a profit, Cal.

125
00:14:42,328 --> 00:14:43,818
Look here, Will.

126
00:14:43,888 --> 00:14:46,732
I'm not an inventor nor a scientist...

127
00:14:46,808 --> 00:14:48,890
but I know I have an idea here.

128
00:14:48,968 --> 00:14:52,495
I come from a whole family of inventors.
People full of ideas like this one.

129
00:14:52,568 --> 00:14:54,570
I'm the only one that didn't have an idea...

130
00:14:54,648 --> 00:14:56,332
and the only one that ever made a dime.

131
00:14:56,408 --> 00:14:58,490
You wanna make a profit, you plant beans.

132
00:14:58,568 --> 00:15:01,458
Put out that cigarette!
That place is full of sawdust!

133
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:09,011
- Come on, Adam, he's just thoughtless.
- Thoughtless? He's inconsiderate.

134
00:15:09,088 --> 00:15:11,568
I don't know.
I'm at my rope's end with that boy.

135
00:15:11,648 --> 00:15:13,457
I don't understand him. I never have.

136
00:15:13,528 --> 00:15:16,179
Aron I've understood since he was a child.

137
00:15:20,168 --> 00:15:21,249
Help me up.

138
00:15:25,048 --> 00:15:27,449
- He doesn't like anybody, does he?
- Who, Dad?

139
00:15:27,528 --> 00:15:29,098
No, Cal.

140
00:15:30,088 --> 00:15:31,738
It's dark in here and spooky.

141
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,532
Why is he so alone all the time?

142
00:15:34,608 --> 00:15:37,657
- He wants to be.
- Nobody wants to be alone all the time.

143
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:40,698
Dad's made a wonderful buy, hasn't he?
We'll freeze vegetables.

144
00:15:40,768 --> 00:15:42,930
It'll really give him something
to live for now.

145
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:45,898
What's the matter, Abra,
don't you like Cal?

146
00:15:45,968 --> 00:15:48,289
- I guess I don't know him very well.
- I love him.

147
00:15:48,368 --> 00:15:51,690
Well, naturally, he's your brother.
He's scary.

148
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,336
- Scary?
- When he looks at you.

149
00:15:54,808 --> 00:15:56,697
Sort of like an animal.

150
00:15:56,768 --> 00:15:58,497
I don't know, he scares me.

151
00:15:59,128 --> 00:16:01,779
Aron, when are we gonna get married?

152
00:16:02,648 --> 00:16:05,572
Just as soon as I get through
with that darned school.

153
00:16:06,368 --> 00:16:08,018
I wish it was right now.

154
00:16:10,008 --> 00:16:11,612
- So do I.
- Do you?

155
00:16:19,888 --> 00:16:21,970
Abra.

156
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:23,459
- When we get--
- I love you, Aron.

157
00:16:23,528 --> 00:16:26,008
When we get married,
it's going to be perfect.

158
00:16:26,368 --> 00:16:28,814
Everything about it is going to be perfect.

159
00:16:53,368 --> 00:16:55,894
You're gonna make
a wonderful mother, Abra.

160
00:16:56,968 --> 00:16:58,697
- I hope so.
- You are.

161
00:16:59,568 --> 00:17:01,058
A perfect one.

162
00:17:02,648 --> 00:17:05,413
You don't remember your mother at all,
do you, Aron?

163
00:17:05,928 --> 00:17:08,408
No, she died
right after Cal and I were born.

164
00:17:09,088 --> 00:17:11,739
Must be hard never to have had a mother.

165
00:17:13,768 --> 00:17:16,294
- What's that?
- Look, what's he doing up there?

166
00:17:17,248 --> 00:17:19,012
- Crazy guy.
- He's watching us.

167
00:17:19,088 --> 00:17:21,090
- No, he isn't.
- Yes, he is, too.

168
00:17:21,168 --> 00:17:23,853
Let's move over here. Aron.

169
00:17:34,848 --> 00:17:38,170
- He's not watching us.
- I feel as if he can still see us.

170
00:17:43,888 --> 00:17:46,209
I love you, Aron.

171
00:17:46,288 --> 00:17:47,972
Really, I do. Really.

172
00:17:49,288 --> 00:17:51,416
Sure. I love you, too.

173
00:18:09,768 --> 00:18:12,294
Cal, stop! Stop that, Cal!

174
00:18:12,368 --> 00:18:14,177
What are you doing? Stop it!

175
00:18:16,568 --> 00:18:19,811
"Blessed is he
whose transgression is forgiven...

176
00:18:19,888 --> 00:18:21,413
"whose sin is covered.

177
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:26,054
"Blessed is the man unto whom
the Lord imputeth not iniquity...

178
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,935
"and in whose spirit there is no guile."

179
00:18:31,688 --> 00:18:33,736
And you are forgiven, Cal.

180
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:38,495
I think there is no iniquity
in your actions...

181
00:18:38,608 --> 00:18:40,770
only something I do not know.

182
00:18:42,608 --> 00:18:45,179
Why did you push that ice down?

183
00:18:48,808 --> 00:18:50,014
I don't know.

184
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,289
Was it...

185
00:18:53,128 --> 00:18:56,132
Was it vengeance? Anger?

186
00:18:56,928 --> 00:19:00,489
Fear that I would punish you
for not coming home last night?

187
00:19:01,168 --> 00:19:02,294
What was it?

188
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,814
I wanted to see it slide down the chute.

189
00:19:08,368 --> 00:19:11,577
- Perhaps you had better read from here on.
- I'll read it, Dad.

190
00:19:11,728 --> 00:19:13,890
No, it's for Cal to read.

191
00:19:13,968 --> 00:19:16,050
Start at the fifth verse.

192
00:19:17,408 --> 00:19:18,694
Verse 5.

193
00:19:35,848 --> 00:19:38,977
"I acknowledge my sin unto thee,
and mine iniquity have I not hid.

194
00:19:39,048 --> 00:19:41,699
"I said, I will confess my transgressions
unto the Lord...

195
00:19:41,768 --> 00:19:44,214
"and thou forgavest
the iniquity of my sin. Selah."

196
00:19:44,288 --> 00:19:45,255
Go on.

197
00:19:50,568 --> 00:19:51,694
Six.

198
00:19:51,768 --> 00:19:53,896
And I suggest a little slower, Cal.

199
00:19:53,968 --> 00:19:56,414
And you don't have to read
the verse numbers.

200
00:19:56,768 --> 00:20:00,614
"For this shall every one that is godly
pray unto thee.

201
00:20:00,688 --> 00:20:02,690
"And surely in the floods of great waters...

202
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:05,897
"they shall not come nigh unto him.
Selah."

203
00:20:05,968 --> 00:20:06,935
Seven.

204
00:20:07,008 --> 00:20:08,453
Not the numbers, Cal.

205
00:20:08,648 --> 00:20:12,414
"Thou art my hiding place,
thou shalt preserve me from trouble...

206
00:20:12,488 --> 00:20:16,209
"thou shalt compass me about
with songs of deliverance. Selah."

207
00:20:17,768 --> 00:20:20,772
- Eight.
- You have no repentance! You're bad!

208
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,339
Through and through, bad.

209
00:20:22,408 --> 00:20:25,139
Excuse me. I'll go out and wait for Abra.

210
00:20:33,888 --> 00:20:37,131
You're right. I am bad.
I knew that for a long time.

211
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:40,052
I didn't mean that, Cal. I spoke in anger.

212
00:20:40,128 --> 00:20:42,210
Well, it's true.

213
00:20:43,288 --> 00:20:44,972
Aron's the good one.

214
00:20:45,248 --> 00:20:47,057
I guess there's just a certain amount...

215
00:20:47,128 --> 00:20:49,051
of good and bad you get
from your parents...

216
00:20:49,128 --> 00:20:51,449
-and I just got the bad.
- That's not true.

217
00:20:51,528 --> 00:20:52,939
Cal, listen to me.

218
00:20:53,448 --> 00:20:55,530
You can make of yourself
anything you want.

219
00:20:55,608 --> 00:20:57,849
It's up to you. A man has a choice.

220
00:20:57,928 --> 00:21:00,408
That's where he's different from an animal.

221
00:21:02,968 --> 00:21:05,255
You don't listen. You'll never remember.

222
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:12,934
My mother...

223
00:21:17,248 --> 00:21:19,330
she's not dead and gone to heaven...

224
00:21:20,368 --> 00:21:21,335
is she?

225
00:21:23,288 --> 00:21:24,733
Why do you ask that?

226
00:21:25,248 --> 00:21:27,012
She's not dead at all.

227
00:21:27,968 --> 00:21:30,812
She's not buried in the East
like you said, either.

228
00:21:31,288 --> 00:21:32,574
She's alive.

229
00:21:32,648 --> 00:21:34,889
- What makes you think so?
- I heard from a guy.

230
00:21:34,968 --> 00:21:36,458
- Who?
- I don't know his name.

231
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,656
He was just passing through.

232
00:21:39,808 --> 00:21:42,539
How come you told Aron and me she died?

233
00:21:42,608 --> 00:21:45,088
- I thought it would save you pain.
- Pain?

234
00:21:51,688 --> 00:21:54,214
If she was still alive,
where do you think she'd be?

235
00:21:54,288 --> 00:21:57,212
I have no idea. She went East.

236
00:21:57,408 --> 00:21:58,739
How do you know?

237
00:21:59,248 --> 00:22:03,333
When she left the ranch we lived on
when you and Aron were born...

238
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:05,733
I heard she went East.

239
00:22:06,808 --> 00:22:08,731
What was she like? Was she bad?

240
00:22:09,488 --> 00:22:11,536
I guess she...

241
00:22:12,408 --> 00:22:15,855
I never really knew what she was like.
She wasn't like other people.

242
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:18,209
There was something she seemed to lack.

243
00:22:19,688 --> 00:22:21,929
Kindness, maybe. Conscience.

244
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:25,970
I never knew what she was after.

245
00:22:26,488 --> 00:22:29,094
- How come she left you?
- I never knew that, either.

246
00:22:29,168 --> 00:22:32,854
She was so full of hate.

247
00:22:32,928 --> 00:22:35,499
- Hate for you?
- For everything.

248
00:22:39,448 --> 00:22:42,054
You won't tell Aron that she didn't die?

249
00:22:42,768 --> 00:22:43,735
No.

250
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:46,769
Must not do anything to hurt Aron.

251
00:22:50,968 --> 00:22:53,653
Where'd you get that scar
you got on your shoulder, Father?

252
00:22:53,728 --> 00:22:55,412
I've told you, Cal.

253
00:22:55,848 --> 00:22:59,295
It's an old wound I got
in the Indian campaigns.

254
00:22:59,608 --> 00:23:03,294
- Why do you ask that now?
- What'd she look like? Was she pretty?

255
00:23:04,648 --> 00:23:07,811
She had the most lovely hands.

256
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:09,253
Like ivory.

257
00:23:10,368 --> 00:23:12,416
She took such good care of them.

258
00:23:13,648 --> 00:23:15,059
Her mother had arthritis.

259
00:23:15,128 --> 00:23:18,257
She was always afraid
it would come to her in her hands.

260
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:25,892
Talk to me, Father.

261
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:33,252
I got to know who I am.
I got to know who I'm like.

262
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:34,614
I got to know...

263
00:23:36,128 --> 00:23:37,334
Where is she?

264
00:23:38,248 --> 00:23:40,615
I'm telling you, truthfully, Cal...

265
00:23:41,408 --> 00:23:43,615
after she left, I never heard from her.

266
00:23:46,528 --> 00:23:48,451
Cal, wait. I want to talk more with you.

267
00:23:48,528 --> 00:23:51,737
If you leave this room now
we may never be able to talk again.

268
00:23:52,488 --> 00:23:53,899
You coming home tonight, Cal?

269
00:23:53,968 --> 00:23:56,972
What's the difference?
You're home. You're the one he wants.

270
00:23:57,048 --> 00:23:59,528
Good evening, Cal.

271
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,896
High strung. Very high strung.

272
00:24:03,248 --> 00:24:06,058
Good evening, Abra.
Where is my chess victim?

273
00:24:06,248 --> 00:24:08,330
- He's waiting for you, Mr. AIbrecht.
- Good.

274
00:24:08,408 --> 00:24:10,615
What do you suppose he meant by that?

275
00:24:24,048 --> 00:24:25,937
Go on, beat it!

276
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:29,811
Your wife has called up three times.

277
00:24:29,888 --> 00:24:33,688
- My wife's a--
- I know she is. Now beat it.

278
00:24:42,928 --> 00:24:44,532
Joe!

279
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:51,773
All right, fella, you've run out of money.

280
00:24:51,848 --> 00:24:53,657
Mr. Hawks.

281
00:24:57,728 --> 00:24:59,856
- What do you want?
- I want--

282
00:24:59,928 --> 00:25:03,330
- What do you want to drink?
- Beer.

283
00:25:14,408 --> 00:25:15,739
Hey!

284
00:25:16,608 --> 00:25:19,054
- Where's my drink?
- All right.

285
00:25:19,728 --> 00:25:21,537
That's not very neat, is...

286
00:25:22,328 --> 00:25:23,375
It's okay.

287
00:25:25,888 --> 00:25:27,697
- You'd better get out of here.
- How come?

288
00:25:27,768 --> 00:25:29,896
You're the one who followed Kate
this morning.

289
00:25:29,968 --> 00:25:32,369
- It's a free country, isn't it?
- It's a free country.

290
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:35,338
Only, Joe said if I saw you again,
I was supposed to tell him.

291
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:37,376
You can tell him if you want to.

292
00:25:38,408 --> 00:25:40,934
You're just a kid, ain't you?

293
00:25:42,048 --> 00:25:44,528
- I'm older than you are.
- Yeah, sure, but that isn't--

294
00:25:44,608 --> 00:25:46,133
- Hey!
- All right.

295
00:25:47,728 --> 00:25:48,775
Kid, please...

296
00:25:48,848 --> 00:25:51,294
you oughtn't to go around
throwing stones and things.

297
00:25:51,368 --> 00:25:53,848
That isn't nice. And drinking beer.

298
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,094
There's Joe.

299
00:25:58,128 --> 00:26:01,257
Look, kid, please go.
You don't want to get yourself hurt.

300
00:26:02,048 --> 00:26:05,211
You could tell him now, if you want to.
There's your chance.

301
00:26:06,488 --> 00:26:09,014
You sure have got a nerve, haven't you?

302
00:26:16,128 --> 00:26:19,132
- Do you know Kate?
- This is Kate's place.

303
00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:22,212
- She's treating you okay?
- Sure.

304
00:26:22,288 --> 00:26:23,972
I gotta go now, kid.

305
00:26:24,048 --> 00:26:25,379
Is she nice?

306
00:26:25,848 --> 00:26:27,179
Don't let Joe see you, please.

307
00:26:27,248 --> 00:26:29,489
She doesn't treat you rough
or anything, does she?

308
00:26:29,568 --> 00:26:32,378
Please, kid, I gotta go now.
It was nice meeting you.

309
00:26:32,448 --> 00:26:34,974
Isn't there anything nice about her at all?

310
00:26:36,008 --> 00:26:37,578
What's the matter, kid?

311
00:26:38,488 --> 00:26:40,934
- She had pretty hands. Did you see them?
- Hands?

312
00:26:41,008 --> 00:26:42,089
Did you look at them?

313
00:26:42,168 --> 00:26:45,297
No, I don't think I ever saw them.
She always wears gloves.

314
00:26:49,648 --> 00:26:50,729
Where is she?

315
00:26:50,808 --> 00:26:52,617
- You mean now?
- Yeah.

316
00:26:52,688 --> 00:26:55,532
- Back in her office, probably.
- Where's that?

317
00:26:55,608 --> 00:26:57,258
Back that way.

318
00:26:57,328 --> 00:26:58,614
Will you show me?

319
00:27:02,128 --> 00:27:04,813
Look, kid, please don't start any trouble.

320
00:27:04,888 --> 00:27:07,414
I'm not gonna start any trouble. Come on.

321
00:27:07,488 --> 00:27:10,298
We... You can just point the door to me,
and I'll go there.

322
00:27:10,368 --> 00:27:11,494
No, honest.

323
00:27:11,568 --> 00:27:14,412
This is a tough place. I can't lose this job.

324
00:27:14,488 --> 00:27:16,855
- I'm not very good at it, anyway.
- You won't lose it.

325
00:27:16,928 --> 00:27:20,057
If I step out of line
Kate will throw me out on my ear.

326
00:27:20,928 --> 00:27:23,249
Come on, will you?

327
00:27:23,328 --> 00:27:25,569
You can just show me where the door is.

328
00:27:26,008 --> 00:27:27,169
Come on.

329
00:27:28,808 --> 00:27:30,378
Be a sport.

330
00:27:33,488 --> 00:27:34,819
Come on.

331
00:27:48,648 --> 00:27:50,252
There's the door.

332
00:27:50,648 --> 00:27:52,571
Thank you. You can go back now.

333
00:27:53,408 --> 00:27:55,058
What are you gonna do?

334
00:27:55,608 --> 00:27:58,054
Please, kid, don't make any trouble.

335
00:27:59,528 --> 00:28:03,977
I'm not gonna make any trouble.
I'm gonna wait till you're gone. Okay?

336
00:28:54,768 --> 00:28:57,772
Will you let me talk to you? Please.

337
00:28:59,528 --> 00:29:01,769
I gotta talk to you.

338
00:29:06,288 --> 00:29:08,575
Joe!

339
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:12,775
Get out of here! Joe! Tex!

340
00:29:15,288 --> 00:29:17,894
Call the sheriff! Get him out!

341
00:29:18,528 --> 00:29:21,896
Call the sheriff! Get him out of here!

342
00:29:24,368 --> 00:29:26,575
I want to talk to her!

343
00:29:35,088 --> 00:29:37,329
I want to talk to you!

344
00:29:38,928 --> 00:29:41,249
Please, talk to me!

345
00:29:41,328 --> 00:29:44,775
Talk to me, please! Mother!

346
00:29:46,408 --> 00:29:49,571
Is there any law against a guy
trying to see his own mother?

347
00:29:49,648 --> 00:29:51,810
No, I guess there isn't.

348
00:29:52,648 --> 00:29:53,729
Here.

349
00:29:53,808 --> 00:29:56,778
Put this on your cheek. Here.

350
00:30:02,168 --> 00:30:03,533
Drink some coffee.

351
00:30:05,088 --> 00:30:07,090
How did you find out about Kate, anyway?

352
00:30:07,168 --> 00:30:09,978
That guy I saw you talking to
in the bar the other night?

353
00:30:10,048 --> 00:30:12,574
The one they call "Rabbit."

354
00:30:13,088 --> 00:30:16,251
I thought so. He never was any good.

355
00:30:16,328 --> 00:30:19,252
I remember when he used
to work on your father's ranch.

356
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:24,133
Well, he won't be around anymore, Cal.
He's left town for good.

357
00:30:26,928 --> 00:30:29,818
- What do you hang around bars for?
- Any law against hanging--

358
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:32,129
Yes, there is! I'm the law.

359
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:34,177
Get that through your head.

360
00:30:35,528 --> 00:30:36,973
Shut up!

361
00:30:42,888 --> 00:30:46,017
Does Adam know that you...

362
00:30:46,088 --> 00:30:48,090
roam around over here at night?

363
00:30:52,168 --> 00:30:55,217
Adam's an old friend of mine,
you know, Cal, from...

364
00:30:55,288 --> 00:30:57,529
way back in his ranch days.

365
00:30:58,328 --> 00:31:01,650
I was afraid when you moved here
last year...

366
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:05,098
that you might find out something
about Kate.

367
00:31:06,128 --> 00:31:08,859
But then she was over here on the Bay...

368
00:31:08,928 --> 00:31:12,137
and you were way over on the other side
of the mountains in Salinas.

369
00:31:12,208 --> 00:31:16,054
- So I figured it'd be all right.
- You think he'll ever find out about her?

370
00:31:16,448 --> 00:31:18,655
He'd never come over here.

371
00:31:23,568 --> 00:31:25,457
Here. You might as well look at this now.

372
00:31:25,528 --> 00:31:29,214
It's a picture of your father
and your mother on their wedding day.

373
00:31:29,968 --> 00:31:32,574
You're the first person
I've ever showed it to.

374
00:31:37,568 --> 00:31:39,093
I knew it.

375
00:31:41,048 --> 00:31:42,857
I knew it was true.

376
00:31:45,048 --> 00:31:47,654
When that old guy told me in the bar,
I knew it.

377
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:52,530
How did you know it was true?

378
00:31:52,608 --> 00:31:55,737
'Cause she ain't no good
and I ain't no good.

379
00:31:55,808 --> 00:31:58,379
I knew there was a reason why I wasn't.

380
00:32:06,048 --> 00:32:07,174
I hate her.

381
00:32:07,528 --> 00:32:09,656
And I hate him, too.

382
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:12,936
Come on, I'll take you home.

383
00:32:14,168 --> 00:32:17,934
- You don't have to drive me home!
- I know I don't have to take you home!

384
00:32:19,128 --> 00:32:20,209
Here.

385
00:32:21,008 --> 00:32:23,659
A little bit of the hair
of the dog that bit you.

386
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:25,334
Come on now.

387
00:32:38,368 --> 00:32:40,132
How did Dad meet her?

388
00:32:41,408 --> 00:32:43,058
Where did she come from?

389
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:46,374
Nobody ever knew
where she come from, really.

390
00:32:47,328 --> 00:32:50,377
There were a lot of drifters in those days.

391
00:32:50,448 --> 00:32:52,894
Of all the people.

392
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:58,212
How come he married her?

393
00:32:58,688 --> 00:33:01,294
You have no idea how pretty she was, Cal.

394
00:33:01,368 --> 00:33:03,575
Young and full of spirit.

395
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:06,254
And your father hadn't been
off the ranch much, you know.

396
00:33:06,328 --> 00:33:08,251
He's not a worldly man.

397
00:33:17,448 --> 00:33:21,134
- Did she shoot him?
- Yes, she did.

398
00:33:22,768 --> 00:33:24,179
How come?

399
00:33:25,608 --> 00:33:26,894
I don't know.

400
00:33:29,368 --> 00:33:31,336
Did he do something to her?

401
00:33:32,128 --> 00:33:33,812
- Did he hurt her?
- No.

402
00:33:34,088 --> 00:33:35,977
It wasn't in him to hurt her.

403
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:40,612
After she left him, he died.
He walked around, but he died.

404
00:33:43,968 --> 00:33:46,494
He must have done something to hurt her.

405
00:33:46,888 --> 00:33:48,856
No. No, sir.

406
00:33:48,928 --> 00:33:52,137
He gave her everything
that any woman could ask for.

407
00:33:55,248 --> 00:33:57,615
You see, your father has more kindness...

408
00:33:58,208 --> 00:34:02,179
and more conscience
than any man that I've ever known.

409
00:34:12,368 --> 00:34:16,089
He's a good man, Cal.
Don't sell him short, boy.

410
00:34:41,128 --> 00:34:43,017
It's going to work.

411
00:34:43,088 --> 00:34:46,058
If only I can keep them
cold enough long enough.

412
00:34:56,168 --> 00:34:57,613
It's going to work.

413
00:35:13,248 --> 00:35:16,377
All right, there she is. Let's try it.
Step back, girls.

414
00:35:24,168 --> 00:35:26,455
All right, bring her on. Come on.

415
00:35:29,848 --> 00:35:31,612
Now do you think it'll work?

416
00:35:51,808 --> 00:35:54,334
- Good morning, Mr. Trask.
- Good morning.

417
00:35:57,008 --> 00:35:59,329
Somebody swiped our coal chute
right off the wagon.

418
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:01,809
Dear, dear.
Times are getting pretty lawless.

419
00:36:01,888 --> 00:36:02,935
It's this war in Europe.

420
00:36:03,008 --> 00:36:06,455
There's a wave of lawlessness
spreading through the country.

421
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,371
Anyway, somebody swiped our chute.

422
00:36:08,448 --> 00:36:09,973
- Is that where you're loading?
- Yes.

423
00:36:10,048 --> 00:36:11,891
We'll move on, then. Good day, Mr. Trask.

424
00:36:11,968 --> 00:36:13,572
It's this war in Europe.

425
00:36:27,168 --> 00:36:28,897
Do you know where Aron is?

426
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:32,136
He's out in the fields. He's checking.

427
00:36:32,208 --> 00:36:33,289
Can I do something for you?

428
00:36:33,368 --> 00:36:36,451
No. There were just some matters
I want to talk over with him.

429
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,178
What have you got there?

430
00:36:38,968 --> 00:36:42,415
I figured it would save some time. So I...

431
00:36:42,488 --> 00:36:46,049
It's very ingenious, Cal. Very ingenious.
Did you think of it?

432
00:36:46,128 --> 00:36:47,698
Yep.

433
00:36:47,768 --> 00:36:50,135
I'm very pleased
with the way you're taking hold...

434
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,812
and are working so well, Cal.

435
00:36:51,888 --> 00:36:53,572
Thanks. Thanks, Dad.

436
00:36:58,688 --> 00:37:01,692
Think you better have your lunch now.
It's time.

437
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,095
Hi, Cal.

438
00:37:07,248 --> 00:37:09,854
- Aron's out in the field.
- I brought his lunch.

439
00:37:11,208 --> 00:37:13,654
- Okay, I'll take it to him.
- Cal.

440
00:37:25,248 --> 00:37:27,250
Lydia, vamoose.

441
00:37:40,688 --> 00:37:41,928
He'll be here in a minute.

442
00:37:42,008 --> 00:37:45,569
I've been fixing Aron's lunch.
I'll fix yours, too, if you like, after this.

443
00:37:45,648 --> 00:37:47,173
No, thanks.

444
00:37:49,168 --> 00:37:51,296
Would you be eating with her
if I weren't here?

445
00:37:51,368 --> 00:37:52,369
Who?

446
00:37:55,968 --> 00:37:58,175
No, I didn't ask her to come up here.

447
00:38:02,048 --> 00:38:04,016
Girls follow you around, don't they?

448
00:38:04,088 --> 00:38:06,978
- Does she bother you?
- She doesn't bother me.

449
00:38:07,768 --> 00:38:08,929
Who is she?

450
00:38:11,488 --> 00:38:13,570
I never saw her before in my life.

451
00:38:15,128 --> 00:38:16,368
I'll bet.

452
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:22,171
You're really working
at this lettuce business, aren't you, Cal?

453
00:38:22,648 --> 00:38:24,377
Do you think it'll turn out all right?

454
00:38:24,448 --> 00:38:27,099
Your father will lose quite a lot of money
if it doesn't.

455
00:38:27,168 --> 00:38:28,772
Just about all he's got.

456
00:38:29,408 --> 00:38:31,376
I like your father.

457
00:38:32,568 --> 00:38:33,535
Do you?

458
00:38:38,088 --> 00:38:40,694
I threw away about $3,000 once.

459
00:38:41,288 --> 00:38:42,255
Yeah?

460
00:38:43,768 --> 00:38:45,770
- When I was 13.
- You threw it away?

461
00:38:45,848 --> 00:38:47,577
It was a diamond ring worth about that.

462
00:38:47,648 --> 00:38:50,128
At least, my father told me
that's what he paid for it.

463
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:53,496
I threw it in the river.
Made Dad terribly angry.

464
00:38:55,648 --> 00:38:57,412
I reckon it would.

465
00:38:57,488 --> 00:39:00,094
But I forgave him.
And it's been all right ever since.

466
00:39:00,168 --> 00:39:01,658
- You forgave him?
- Yes.

467
00:39:04,328 --> 00:39:07,889
You forgave him 'cause you threw
a ring of his worth $3,000 into the river?

468
00:39:07,968 --> 00:39:09,538
- That's right.
- And you forgave him?

469
00:39:09,608 --> 00:39:11,178
That's right.

470
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:13,296
Is there an egg in this basket?

471
00:39:14,848 --> 00:39:18,330
You see, I thought he didn't love me.
That made me feel awful.

472
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:22,015
Girls love their fathers terribly.

473
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:23,808
Do they?

474
00:39:24,968 --> 00:39:26,697
My mother died when I was 13...

475
00:39:26,768 --> 00:39:29,851
and Dad got married again soon after that.
Did you know that?

476
00:39:29,928 --> 00:39:31,817
No, I didn't know that.

477
00:39:32,968 --> 00:39:35,016
Are you interested in hearing about me?

478
00:39:35,088 --> 00:39:36,135
Yeah.

479
00:39:39,768 --> 00:39:43,090
When Dad got married again,
it made me sick.

480
00:39:44,088 --> 00:39:45,738
I just hated everybody.

481
00:39:46,448 --> 00:39:48,530
I used to sit and just glare at people...

482
00:39:48,608 --> 00:39:51,293
or I wouldn't even answer
when they spoke to me.

483
00:39:53,328 --> 00:39:56,252
- Why you telling me all this?
- I want to.

484
00:39:56,848 --> 00:40:00,170
I was that way for months.
I just hated everybody.

485
00:40:00,248 --> 00:40:02,489
I thought nobody in the world loved me.

486
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:06,530
And it was awful.

487
00:40:08,608 --> 00:40:11,498
Then I found this ring
that Dad gave my new mother...

488
00:40:12,848 --> 00:40:15,499
-so I took it and threw it in the river.
- Good.

489
00:40:16,928 --> 00:40:18,657
I thought you'd like that.

490
00:40:20,048 --> 00:40:21,812
- Did he ever find it?
- Never.

491
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:25,333
They tried.

492
00:40:26,488 --> 00:40:27,853
What'd they do to you?

493
00:40:27,928 --> 00:40:30,659
Dad punished me. Not badly, I guess.

494
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:33,254
But I felt
he shouldn't have punished me at all.

495
00:40:33,328 --> 00:40:36,696
I felt he should have loved me more
because I did it.

496
00:40:37,088 --> 00:40:38,294
But he didn't.

497
00:40:39,088 --> 00:40:41,136
Isn't it funny?

498
00:40:42,008 --> 00:40:43,897
I'm grown up now...

499
00:40:43,968 --> 00:40:46,448
but I still understand kids better
than I do grownups.

500
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:47,654
You're not so grown-up.

501
00:40:47,728 --> 00:40:49,890
- I'm very grown-up.
- That's a matter of opinion.

502
00:40:49,968 --> 00:40:51,413
I'm very grown-up.

503
00:40:51,488 --> 00:40:54,856
More so than Dad, because I forgave him
for not understanding.

504
00:40:57,448 --> 00:40:59,849
And the minute I forgave him in my mind...

505
00:41:00,528 --> 00:41:02,053
I felt better.

506
00:41:09,248 --> 00:41:10,932
Now we get along fine.

507
00:41:12,048 --> 00:41:15,814
We love each other.
Not like we did when I was 13...

508
00:41:15,888 --> 00:41:18,778
but enough so we can live together
till I get married.

509
00:41:22,368 --> 00:41:25,736
He's just my father now.
Nothing to rave about.

510
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:29,577
I still don't like her much,
but then, she's a woman.

511
00:41:41,768 --> 00:41:44,897
My, that girl just hates me, doesn't she?

512
00:41:45,808 --> 00:41:48,049
You better tell her I'm your brother's girl.

513
00:41:48,128 --> 00:41:50,734
I don't have to explain anything
to anybody.

514
00:41:53,568 --> 00:41:55,855
I'll go now and leave the field to her.

515
00:41:59,728 --> 00:42:01,776
My, your hair's in a mess.

516
00:42:05,248 --> 00:42:07,091
Dad, what's that?

517
00:42:07,168 --> 00:42:10,377
That's something Cal rigged up.
It's a good idea.

518
00:42:10,448 --> 00:42:12,530
Aron! I brought your lunch.

519
00:42:13,128 --> 00:42:15,495
Looks like a coal chute.

520
00:42:15,808 --> 00:42:17,537
Coal chute?

521
00:42:20,848 --> 00:42:22,452
Okay, woman, where's the beans?

522
00:42:22,528 --> 00:42:23,495
Cal!

523
00:42:26,088 --> 00:42:29,729
What makes you think you have the right
to come and take something like this?

524
00:42:29,808 --> 00:42:33,017
You probably lost those men their jobs.
Now, you take it back.

525
00:42:40,248 --> 00:42:43,457
He's praising Cal and Cal is lapping it up.

526
00:42:43,528 --> 00:42:46,054
Aron! Look, have one of those
made of wood.

527
00:42:46,128 --> 00:42:48,335
- It'll save a lot of time.
- Yes, sir!

528
00:42:51,568 --> 00:42:53,730
- Good waste of time and money.
- And lettuce.

529
00:42:53,808 --> 00:42:56,857
- What'd you say?
- I said, it's a good idea if it works.

530
00:42:56,928 --> 00:42:59,295
It's gonna work, 'cause it's gotta work.

531
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:01,416
It's gotta work, 'cause I said so.

532
00:43:03,328 --> 00:43:05,330
If it don't work, it ain't that kid's fault.

533
00:43:05,408 --> 00:43:07,649
I never saw anybody work
so hard in my life.

534
00:43:10,968 --> 00:43:13,414
Let's go, Pete. Now, Leonard!

535
00:43:16,328 --> 00:43:18,569
Good luck, Adam.

536
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:53,618
Do you know the principle
of the internal combustion engine?

537
00:43:53,688 --> 00:43:56,134
No, I'm afraid not.
Will, I'll never be able to--

538
00:43:56,208 --> 00:43:58,210
Sure you will. You just listen to Roy.

539
00:43:58,288 --> 00:44:00,450
He's been to the automobile school
in Chicago.

540
00:44:00,528 --> 00:44:03,338
Mr. Trask has just revolutionized
the entire vegetable market.

541
00:44:03,408 --> 00:44:06,014
- Wait till those cars get to New York.
- Don't you worry.

542
00:44:06,088 --> 00:44:08,090
It's about time he owned
his own automobile...

543
00:44:08,168 --> 00:44:09,852
and about time he learned to drive it.

544
00:44:09,928 --> 00:44:12,374
- Now don't you think so, Roy?
- I'll do my best.

545
00:44:12,448 --> 00:44:14,371
Now pay strict attention, boys.

546
00:44:15,288 --> 00:44:16,414
Don't touch that!

547
00:44:16,488 --> 00:44:18,058
Wait till it's explained to you.

548
00:44:18,128 --> 00:44:21,052
No, now for heaven's sake,
don't touch anything, anybody.

549
00:44:21,848 --> 00:44:24,738
The power of the explosion
is exerted on a piston...

550
00:44:24,808 --> 00:44:28,290
and through connecting rod
and crankshaft...

551
00:44:28,368 --> 00:44:32,054
through transmission,
thence to rear wheels.

552
00:44:32,128 --> 00:44:34,734
- Got that so far?
- Sure, he's got that.

553
00:44:34,808 --> 00:44:37,732
Now, we go on
to the operation of the automobile.

554
00:44:38,808 --> 00:44:40,651
This here's the ignition key.

555
00:44:41,528 --> 00:44:44,259
Would you mind putting out
that cigarette, please.

556
00:44:44,328 --> 00:44:47,377
Turn this doohickey here to the left.
That puts her on battery.

557
00:44:47,448 --> 00:44:49,416
- See where it says "bat"?
- Yes.

558
00:44:49,488 --> 00:44:52,810
- Bat, short for battery.
- That's right. Good boy.

559
00:44:53,248 --> 00:44:54,693
Thank you. Thank you very much.

560
00:44:54,768 --> 00:44:56,258
First you gotta retard the spark.

561
00:44:56,328 --> 00:44:59,889
If you don't retard the spark,
she'll probably kick your blasted arm off.

562
00:44:59,968 --> 00:45:01,493
Now remember that.

563
00:45:01,608 --> 00:45:03,133
This here is the spark.

564
00:45:03,208 --> 00:45:06,337
You push her way up. Listen.

565
00:45:07,728 --> 00:45:10,652
- This here's the gas. You push her--
- Down.

566
00:45:11,368 --> 00:45:14,577
- You had lessons before.
- No, I just saw you do it.

567
00:45:15,408 --> 00:45:18,139
- You're a pretty smart old buzzard.
- Thank you very much.

568
00:45:18,208 --> 00:45:20,609
- Keep your eyes open, don't you?
- Try to.

569
00:45:21,208 --> 00:45:22,937
Now, this here is the crank.

570
00:45:23,008 --> 00:45:26,091
See this wire sticking out of the radiator?
That's the choke.

571
00:45:26,168 --> 00:45:28,899
Now watch careful.
Grab hold of the crank like this.

572
00:45:28,968 --> 00:45:30,379
Push in till she catches.

573
00:45:30,448 --> 00:45:31,893
See how my thumb is turned down?

574
00:45:31,968 --> 00:45:33,458
I noticed that. Why do you do that?

575
00:45:33,528 --> 00:45:36,259
If you put her around this way
with my thumb around her...

576
00:45:36,328 --> 00:45:38,251
she'd probably knock
my blasted thumb off.

577
00:45:38,328 --> 00:45:42,174
Dear, dear. First you lose your blasted arm
and then you lose your blasted thumb.

578
00:45:42,248 --> 00:45:44,250
- That's kind of wrong way around.
- How's that?

579
00:45:44,328 --> 00:45:47,457
He made a joke.
I never did see him so happy.

580
00:45:47,928 --> 00:45:50,898
You pull out this choke
turn her around to suck gas in.

581
00:45:51,488 --> 00:45:53,456
Then you give her a hard spin.

582
00:45:53,808 --> 00:45:56,937
- She caught, first time!
- Caught on what?

583
00:45:57,728 --> 00:45:59,492
Advance the spark and retard the gas.

584
00:45:59,568 --> 00:46:02,139
Reach over real quick and switch
to mag. That's magneto.

585
00:46:02,208 --> 00:46:04,017
So, there you are.

586
00:46:04,088 --> 00:46:06,534
Isn't that wonderful?

587
00:46:06,608 --> 00:46:09,054
Of course, it isn't exactly
going anywhere, is it?

588
00:46:09,128 --> 00:46:10,129
That's the easy part.

589
00:46:10,208 --> 00:46:12,017
- Adam.
- I want you all to repeat after me.

590
00:46:12,088 --> 00:46:14,568
Spark up, gas down.

591
00:46:14,648 --> 00:46:15,979
Switch to bat.

592
00:46:16,048 --> 00:46:18,699
Crank to compression, thumb down.

593
00:46:18,768 --> 00:46:20,657
You get that? Let's have it again.

594
00:46:20,728 --> 00:46:22,730
Spark up, gas down.

595
00:46:22,808 --> 00:46:24,936
- What's the matter?
- Big snow slide.

596
00:46:25,008 --> 00:46:27,852
Closed the pass and stopped the cars
about 100 miles out.

597
00:46:27,928 --> 00:46:30,534
Can see water running out of the cars.

598
00:46:42,928 --> 00:46:45,852
It's still a good idea.
Cold can preserve things.

599
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,771
Someday, somebody'II prove it.

600
00:46:49,528 --> 00:46:51,815
- It was your idea.
- No!

601
00:46:51,888 --> 00:46:54,619
It was presumptuous of me
to think it would be I.

602
00:46:56,608 --> 00:46:59,339
Guess we bit off more lettuce
than we could chew.

603
00:47:01,008 --> 00:47:04,376
What do you know about that?
I thought he'd really be hurt.

604
00:47:05,728 --> 00:47:07,935
You don't understand him.

605
00:47:09,008 --> 00:47:11,170
- You can't go in there.
- I gotta see Will Hamilton.

606
00:47:11,248 --> 00:47:13,569
He won't be through for an hour.
They just started.

607
00:47:13,648 --> 00:47:15,650
- Let me see him.
- There's a war in Europe.

608
00:47:15,728 --> 00:47:18,618
These boys are trying
to get themselves in shape. So beat it.

609
00:47:18,688 --> 00:47:20,178
Right, left.

610
00:47:33,888 --> 00:47:35,652
Now, deep knee bends, follow me.

611
00:47:47,968 --> 00:47:49,697
- What's that?
- That's the fire bell.

612
00:47:49,768 --> 00:47:51,372
We better have a look.

613
00:47:53,448 --> 00:47:56,816
- It may be the Germans.
- Fire, Germans, who cares? I surrender.

614
00:47:58,568 --> 00:48:00,093
- Howdy, Mr. AIbrecht.
- Hello, Cal.

615
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:01,977
- Mr. Hamilton.
- There's a fire somewhere.

616
00:48:02,048 --> 00:48:03,493
- No. I rang the bell.
- You rang it?

617
00:48:03,568 --> 00:48:04,569
Yeah. I had to see you.

618
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:06,537
You know, you're crazy.
You're really crazy.

619
00:48:06,608 --> 00:48:08,849
I knew it when you pushed that ice
down the chute.

620
00:48:08,968 --> 00:48:11,733
Let's get out of here
before they start up that piano again.

621
00:48:11,808 --> 00:48:14,971
There must be some easier way
to stop the Germans than this, anyway.

622
00:48:15,048 --> 00:48:18,450
- You see, I gotta make some money.
- Sure, everybody's got to.

623
00:48:19,808 --> 00:48:22,891
Remember, you said that
if you wanna make money...

624
00:48:22,968 --> 00:48:24,208
you ought to raise beans?

625
00:48:24,288 --> 00:48:26,450
Yeah, beans are up 3.5 cents now.

626
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:28,690
Now, the way I figure it, it's like you said.

627
00:48:28,768 --> 00:48:30,850
The country's gonna get into war, isn't it?

628
00:48:30,928 --> 00:48:32,737
I don't see any way out.

629
00:48:32,808 --> 00:48:36,176
- War's good for business.
- The best there is.

630
00:48:36,248 --> 00:48:39,616
See, that's why I wanna go into beans.

631
00:48:40,048 --> 00:48:43,495
See, I gotta get enough money
to give my father back what he lost.

632
00:48:45,248 --> 00:48:46,613
I see.

633
00:48:47,648 --> 00:48:49,810
You think you can make
all that money back?

634
00:48:49,888 --> 00:48:51,219
I gotta.

635
00:48:51,288 --> 00:48:53,131
You know, you're crazy.

636
00:48:53,608 --> 00:48:55,815
Look, Cal, don't you know...

637
00:48:55,888 --> 00:48:58,573
that you gotta have money
in order to make money?

638
00:48:58,968 --> 00:49:00,891
- I'll get some money.
- How?

639
00:49:01,648 --> 00:49:02,774
I'll get it.

640
00:49:03,328 --> 00:49:06,696
Look, don't get so near to me.
I don't wanna get all hot again.

641
00:49:06,768 --> 00:49:09,533
- How much money could you get?
- What do you think I need?

642
00:49:09,608 --> 00:49:11,690
If you had $5,000...

643
00:49:15,848 --> 00:49:17,134
$5,000?

644
00:49:17,848 --> 00:49:21,739
It's a little different when you start
putting it into figures, isn't it?

645
00:49:24,288 --> 00:49:26,017
I know you wanna help your father...

646
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:29,092
but a kid your age can't be expected
to put his hands on $5,000.

647
00:49:29,168 --> 00:49:32,650
Maybe if you could raise $100 or so,
we could let you have a little share.

648
00:49:32,728 --> 00:49:35,095
I don't want a little share,
I want the whole thing.

649
00:49:35,168 --> 00:49:37,853
- I'll get $5,000.
- Maybe if you and Aron went in together--

650
00:49:37,928 --> 00:49:40,499
Aron ain't got nothing to do with this.
This is my deal.

651
00:49:40,568 --> 00:49:41,569
I'll get the $5,000.

652
00:49:41,648 --> 00:49:43,571
What're you gonna do, borrow it?

653
00:49:45,808 --> 00:49:46,775
Yeah.

654
00:49:47,888 --> 00:49:50,095
All right. If you can borrow $5,000...

655
00:49:50,168 --> 00:49:52,819
I know a farmer who's got over 800 acres.

656
00:49:52,888 --> 00:49:55,698
- It's under cultivation.
- All right. What do we do?

657
00:49:56,248 --> 00:49:58,979
If we can guarantee him 5 cents a pound...

658
00:49:59,048 --> 00:50:01,415
and make him a seed loan,
he'll plant beans.

659
00:50:01,488 --> 00:50:02,899
So will a lot of other farmers.

660
00:50:02,968 --> 00:50:05,733
Why, we can contract
all the bean acreage you want.

661
00:50:07,608 --> 00:50:10,976
That's it. That's great. When do we start?

662
00:50:11,888 --> 00:50:14,255
How do you know the price
will go above 5, though?

663
00:50:14,368 --> 00:50:16,177
Did you read the newspapers
this morning?

664
00:50:16,248 --> 00:50:18,410
We're apt to be in war any minute.

665
00:50:18,488 --> 00:50:22,049
You know I got a contract
with the British Purchasing Agency...

666
00:50:22,128 --> 00:50:24,369
and I got a friend in
the Quartermaster Corps.

667
00:50:24,448 --> 00:50:26,769
Do you know
that we could sell all the dry beans...

668
00:50:26,848 --> 00:50:28,930
that we can find
at 10 cents a pound or more?

669
00:50:29,008 --> 00:50:31,693
That's what I want. That's it. See?

670
00:50:32,488 --> 00:50:34,855
- How much will I make?
- Enough for what you want.

671
00:51:21,408 --> 00:51:24,014
- What does Cal stand for?
- Caleb.

672
00:51:24,888 --> 00:51:26,492
It's in the Bible.

673
00:51:29,088 --> 00:51:31,568
- What's your brother's name?
- Aron.

674
00:51:32,648 --> 00:51:34,332
That's in the Bible, too.

675
00:51:38,408 --> 00:51:39,694
What's he like?

676
00:51:41,768 --> 00:51:43,611
He looks like you.

677
00:51:45,728 --> 00:51:47,298
Is he like me?

678
00:51:47,368 --> 00:51:49,370
No. He's good.

679
00:51:53,328 --> 00:51:54,693
I'm more like you.

680
00:51:58,368 --> 00:51:59,699
How's Adam?

681
00:52:00,448 --> 00:52:01,893
How's your father?

682
00:52:03,448 --> 00:52:05,257
I don't wanna talk about him.

683
00:52:13,448 --> 00:52:15,849
- You don't?
- No.

684
00:52:23,608 --> 00:52:26,452
I didn't know who you were
when you were here before.

685
00:52:27,008 --> 00:52:28,772
I knew you didn't.

686
00:52:32,408 --> 00:52:34,536
Aren't you afraid
to come around here again?

687
00:52:34,608 --> 00:52:37,054
Yeah, I am. No. Well, kind of.

688
00:52:41,808 --> 00:52:43,173
What do you want?

689
00:52:45,408 --> 00:52:47,297
Just to look at me?

690
00:52:52,608 --> 00:52:54,451
I want $5,000.

691
00:53:07,288 --> 00:53:09,814
All right, come on in. Sit down.

692
00:53:10,488 --> 00:53:11,614
Come in.

693
00:53:13,208 --> 00:53:14,494
Try that chair.

694
00:53:17,448 --> 00:53:19,018
You got your father's eyes.

695
00:53:20,168 --> 00:53:22,216
That's all I can see of him.

696
00:53:23,488 --> 00:53:26,378
- You're a nice looking boy.
- Yes, ma'am.

697
00:53:30,328 --> 00:53:32,934
- I was very beautiful once.
- Yes, ma'am.

698
00:53:37,208 --> 00:53:38,812
Caleb and Aron.

699
00:53:39,208 --> 00:53:41,893
Your father still thinks
he's living in the Bible, huh?

700
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:43,299
Them's just names.

701
00:53:43,808 --> 00:53:46,334
Joe says that you go to school in Salinas.

702
00:53:46,408 --> 00:53:48,251
Are you good in your studies?

703
00:53:50,008 --> 00:53:51,897
I get by with them.

704
00:53:51,968 --> 00:53:53,891
Does Aron get by with them?

705
00:53:53,968 --> 00:53:55,094
He's bright.

706
00:53:56,328 --> 00:53:59,696
What are you gonna do when you finish?
You're going to college?

707
00:54:00,568 --> 00:54:01,535
Maybe.

708
00:54:01,968 --> 00:54:04,812
Or back to some ranch?

709
00:54:04,888 --> 00:54:07,619
No, I don't like the ranch.

710
00:54:08,528 --> 00:54:10,178
You take after me.

711
00:54:10,848 --> 00:54:14,216
Makes me mad just to think about a ranch.

712
00:54:15,848 --> 00:54:17,088
Sit down.

713
00:54:21,768 --> 00:54:22,735
Thanks.

714
00:54:29,848 --> 00:54:32,055
What do you want with $5,000?

715
00:54:32,768 --> 00:54:34,452
I want to go into business.

716
00:54:34,528 --> 00:54:37,737
- You're a little young for that, aren't you?
- I'm old enough.

717
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:40,654
Yeah, I guess you're right. I guess you are.

718
00:54:41,368 --> 00:54:43,814
- What business do you wanna go into?
- Beans.

719
00:54:46,808 --> 00:54:49,459
Beans are up to 3.5 cents now.

720
00:54:49,528 --> 00:54:52,054
And if we get into war,
they're gonna go up to 10, 12.

721
00:54:52,128 --> 00:54:54,813
- If we get into the war.
- That's a gamble you have to take.

722
00:54:54,888 --> 00:54:56,936
- Will Hamilton says that--
- Will?

723
00:54:57,008 --> 00:54:59,249
You going into business
with Will Hamilton?

724
00:54:59,328 --> 00:55:00,659
You see...

725
00:55:02,528 --> 00:55:05,896
my father, he lost about all he had in--

726
00:55:05,968 --> 00:55:08,858
Yeah, I know. I heard about that.

727
00:55:10,448 --> 00:55:13,418
I wanna make enough to pay him back.

728
00:55:14,208 --> 00:55:17,371
What's the matter with him?
Can't he make any money?

729
00:55:17,448 --> 00:55:18,370
Yeah.

730
00:55:21,048 --> 00:55:22,015
Only...

731
00:55:23,328 --> 00:55:26,696
Only he's too good to bother with money.

732
00:55:29,888 --> 00:55:30,855
Okay.

733
00:55:35,328 --> 00:55:38,218
What makes you think I'd give you $5,000?

734
00:55:42,768 --> 00:55:44,770
I don't know who else to ask.

735
00:55:47,048 --> 00:55:48,857
You got a lot of nerve coming to me.

736
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:51,693
Why? I didn't do anything to you.

737
00:55:57,208 --> 00:55:59,415
It's a good business venture.

738
00:56:02,328 --> 00:56:04,979
I'll pay you back. I'll give you interest.

739
00:56:05,048 --> 00:56:07,619
You're a business woman, ain't you?

740
00:56:07,688 --> 00:56:09,133
One of the best, Son.

741
00:56:10,368 --> 00:56:15,010
You know, Sam told me that you think
I ought to be run out of town.

742
00:56:18,168 --> 00:56:22,093
You're afraid that your father and Aron
might find out about me, is that it?

743
00:56:25,928 --> 00:56:28,056
This $5,000, now.

744
00:56:28,128 --> 00:56:30,859
That wouldn't be
any kind of blackmail, would it?

745
00:56:30,928 --> 00:56:32,612
I never thought about that.

746
00:56:33,408 --> 00:56:35,809
But now that you do, it's a good idea, huh?

747
00:56:37,168 --> 00:56:39,136
- I guess, maybe.
- It's not.

748
00:56:43,248 --> 00:56:46,616
Anyway, I'm not gonna hurt
your precious father or your brother.

749
00:56:47,288 --> 00:56:49,495
- Do they know anything about me?
- No.

750
00:56:49,808 --> 00:56:51,890
Father thinks you're in the East...

751
00:56:53,168 --> 00:56:54,977
and Aron thinks you're dead.

752
00:56:56,008 --> 00:56:59,808
Then, there's no reason to think
that they ever will find out about me.

753
00:56:59,888 --> 00:57:02,937
We don't exactly move in the same circles.

754
00:57:09,088 --> 00:57:10,738
What are you staring at?

755
00:57:12,608 --> 00:57:14,053
How come you did it?

756
00:57:15,008 --> 00:57:15,975
Did what?

757
00:57:17,648 --> 00:57:18,854
Shot my father?

758
00:57:19,688 --> 00:57:22,055
Did he tell you that?

759
00:57:24,768 --> 00:57:27,578
How come you ran away from all of us?
How come you shot him?

760
00:57:27,648 --> 00:57:30,857
- Ran away and did all that kind of stuff?
- None of your business.

761
00:57:32,168 --> 00:57:34,455
I shot him because he tried to stop me.

762
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:37,894
I could have killed him if I'd wanted to,
but I didn't.

763
00:57:37,968 --> 00:57:40,130
I just wanted him to let me go.

764
00:57:40,768 --> 00:57:44,136
- Why?
- Because he tried to hold me.

765
00:57:45,808 --> 00:57:47,014
He wanted to tie me down.

766
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:49,614
He wanted to keep me
on a stinking little ranch...

767
00:57:49,688 --> 00:57:51,850
away from everybody.
Keep me all to himself.

768
00:57:51,928 --> 00:57:54,056
Nobody holds me.

769
00:57:54,608 --> 00:57:56,497
- But he loved you.
- Love.

770
00:57:58,128 --> 00:58:00,017
He wanted to own me.

771
00:58:00,608 --> 00:58:03,134
He wanted to bring me up
like a snot-nosed kid...

772
00:58:03,208 --> 00:58:06,769
and tell me what to do.
Nobody tells me what to do.

773
00:58:08,208 --> 00:58:11,417
Always so right himself.
Knowing everything.

774
00:58:12,168 --> 00:58:14,216
Reading the Bible at me.

775
00:58:15,008 --> 00:58:17,249
- What are you grinning at?
- Nothing.

776
00:58:18,568 --> 00:58:20,775
Maybe you know what I'm talking about?

777
00:58:21,968 --> 00:58:23,652
Always so right himself?

778
00:58:24,248 --> 00:58:25,454
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

779
00:58:26,928 --> 00:58:30,057
Maybe like you said out there,
maybe you are more like me.

780
00:58:33,408 --> 00:58:35,092
Yeah, you got sense.

781
00:58:35,608 --> 00:58:38,737
Maybe you don't fall for that slop
any more than I do.

782
00:58:38,808 --> 00:58:42,415
Maybe you know what people
are really like. What they want.

783
00:58:42,488 --> 00:58:45,458
I got the toughest house on the coast...

784
00:58:45,528 --> 00:58:47,769
and the finest clientele.

785
00:58:49,848 --> 00:58:52,294
Half the stinking city hall go there.

786
00:58:53,808 --> 00:58:55,412
They sneak in at night...

787
00:58:55,488 --> 00:58:58,298
and I walk in this front door
in the daytime, see.

788
00:58:59,128 --> 00:59:01,017
And I built it up from nothing.

789
00:59:02,208 --> 00:59:04,336
Now you want $5,000 of my money...

790
00:59:04,408 --> 00:59:07,139
to go into business
to pay your father back what he lost.

791
00:59:07,328 --> 00:59:08,773
You know, that's funny.

792
00:59:09,728 --> 00:59:12,379
I don't think he'll know where I got it.

793
00:59:12,448 --> 00:59:14,735
No, but it's funny just the same.

794
00:59:15,568 --> 00:59:16,933
Your father.

795
00:59:17,648 --> 00:59:19,935
He's the purest man there is, isn't he?

796
00:59:21,048 --> 00:59:24,291
He thought he had me all tied up
with his purity.

797
00:59:24,928 --> 00:59:28,091
And now I give you $5,000
of the money that I made...

798
00:59:28,168 --> 00:59:30,330
to save him his purity.

799
00:59:31,128 --> 00:59:34,450
If you don't think that's funny,
you'd better not go to college.

800
00:59:43,848 --> 00:59:44,815
Okay.

801
00:59:48,768 --> 00:59:50,975
Tell Will Hamilton to come and see me.

802
00:59:53,488 --> 00:59:55,172
He's a good businessman.

803
00:59:58,408 --> 01:00:01,935
How'd he ever happen to let you go
into this bean business, anyway?

804
01:00:02,408 --> 01:00:03,614
I don't know.

805
01:00:05,088 --> 01:00:07,136
I do. Maybe he likes you.

806
01:00:08,288 --> 01:00:09,255
Maybe.

807
01:00:12,048 --> 01:00:14,016
You're a likeable kid.

808
01:00:23,048 --> 01:00:24,777
You give this to him.

809
01:00:26,128 --> 01:00:29,018
If he wants to gamble
that we get into the war...

810
01:00:29,088 --> 01:00:30,419
it's okay with me.

811
01:00:49,208 --> 01:00:50,733
You're a likeable kid.

812
01:00:58,168 --> 01:01:00,011
Go on, get out of here.

813
01:01:02,728 --> 01:01:05,208
Go on, get out. I'm running a business.

814
01:01:46,128 --> 01:01:48,017
- Them Germans can't fight.
- No.

815
01:02:14,528 --> 01:02:15,529
Hi, partner.

816
01:02:16,048 --> 01:02:19,018
Every day in every way,
we're getting richer and richer.

817
01:02:23,768 --> 01:02:24,894
Kaiser.

818
01:02:24,968 --> 01:02:28,131
All we have to do is call his bluff.
He'll come to heel like a dog.

819
01:02:34,128 --> 01:02:37,928
We'll be there to clean up this mess
for those foreigners in a couple of weeks.

820
01:02:52,768 --> 01:02:54,338
Cal, stop it.

821
01:02:56,368 --> 01:02:57,494
There's Cal.

822
01:03:03,088 --> 01:03:05,819
- Hi, boy. Hey, want some?
- Hello, Cal.

823
01:03:06,328 --> 01:03:07,295
Thanks.

824
01:03:15,648 --> 01:03:19,539
Your own Woodrow Wilson said you gotta
make the country safe for democracy.

825
01:03:19,928 --> 01:03:22,056
- Didn't he say that?
- Yes, he said that.

826
01:03:22,128 --> 01:03:23,209
Will you go?

827
01:03:23,288 --> 01:03:25,290
I think the war will be over. I don't think--

828
01:03:25,368 --> 01:03:28,850
If you believe in all this, why don't you?
If you really think it's right.

829
01:03:28,928 --> 01:03:30,498
I didn't say it was right, Aron.

830
01:03:30,568 --> 01:03:32,491
No, I guess you didn't.

831
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:37,095
Why don't you go back
and join the parade?

832
01:03:43,128 --> 01:03:46,575
Nothing'II ever make me go. Nothing.

833
01:03:48,088 --> 01:03:50,170
I just don't believe it's right.

834
01:04:06,328 --> 01:04:08,490
- Did you water them good?
- Sure, lots of water.

835
01:04:08,568 --> 01:04:10,696
- Not too much, though.
- No, just right.

836
01:04:28,248 --> 01:04:31,058
Marty Hopps got a telegram today.
His boy was killed.

837
01:04:31,128 --> 01:04:33,130
I remember the day we sent him off.

838
01:04:35,568 --> 01:04:38,219
A lot of troop ships have sunk
they don't tell us about.

839
01:04:38,288 --> 01:04:40,734
- It's gonna be a long war.
- Those Germans got an army.

840
01:04:40,808 --> 01:04:42,458
They're a military nation.

841
01:04:42,808 --> 01:04:44,810
Go back where you came from, German!

842
01:04:44,888 --> 01:04:46,458
Go on home, German!

843
01:04:53,648 --> 01:04:54,934
This is just the start.

844
01:04:55,008 --> 01:04:57,329
That rock through the window
is just the beginning.

845
01:04:57,408 --> 01:04:59,092
The German people don't want this war.

846
01:04:59,168 --> 01:05:01,819
And the stories they tell
of what the Germans are doing...

847
01:05:01,888 --> 01:05:03,890
it simply is not true. Not the good ones.

848
01:05:03,968 --> 01:05:07,177
I've been wondering lately
if we shouldn't all go back to the ranch.

849
01:05:07,248 --> 01:05:09,455
You can't get away from it there, Dad.

850
01:05:10,168 --> 01:05:13,536
I don't know, somehow, on a ranch,
I don't know...

851
01:05:13,608 --> 01:05:16,976
War seems to be
city people's business somehow.

852
01:05:18,208 --> 01:05:21,132
Farmers. What's a farmer got to do
with war?

853
01:05:23,048 --> 01:05:24,288
You tired, Dad?

854
01:05:25,848 --> 01:05:29,216
My eyes, I guess.
I work too hard at the Draft Board.

855
01:05:30,608 --> 01:05:33,771
Better have my glasses looked at,
see if they're all right.

856
01:05:36,288 --> 01:05:39,098
I had a look at the bank account
the other day...

857
01:05:39,168 --> 01:05:41,694
not much left after my great fiasco.

858
01:05:44,288 --> 01:05:46,973
Let's not worry about money, Dad.

859
01:05:47,048 --> 01:05:49,050
Let's not worry about money, Dad.

860
01:05:52,488 --> 01:05:54,331
Let's don't worry about money.

861
01:06:03,448 --> 01:06:05,177
Hey, Rantani!

862
01:06:06,328 --> 01:06:08,092
Ain't this some sight?

863
01:06:08,168 --> 01:06:09,579
Beans!

864
01:06:10,368 --> 01:06:12,257
Yeah, boy, some beans.

865
01:06:12,328 --> 01:06:14,934
You come here everyday, boy,
what do you think...

866
01:06:15,008 --> 01:06:17,010
you gonna make them grow quicker?

867
01:06:26,088 --> 01:06:27,328
He's crazy.

868
01:06:33,888 --> 01:06:37,097
Hey, where have you been?

869
01:06:37,168 --> 01:06:39,899
Come on.

870
01:06:39,968 --> 01:06:41,857
We're gonna have lots of fun tonight.

871
01:06:53,488 --> 01:06:55,889
- You won another cigar.
- Wait a minute.

872
01:06:57,128 --> 01:06:59,699
You wanna try one? No?

873
01:07:02,368 --> 01:07:03,608
Pick up my cigar.

874
01:07:03,688 --> 01:07:05,975
- I'm waiting for somebody.
- You're waiting for me.

875
01:07:06,048 --> 01:07:07,049
No, I'm not.

876
01:07:07,128 --> 01:07:09,130
Why don't you let me
take you for a nice ride?

877
01:07:09,208 --> 01:07:11,859
If you don't stop bothering me,
I'll have to call someone.

878
01:07:11,928 --> 01:07:13,817
- Hello, Cal.
- What's the matter?

879
01:07:13,928 --> 01:07:17,137
I was trying to tell this gentleman
that I was waiting for somebody.

880
01:07:17,208 --> 01:07:20,052
This is a lousy place
to keep your girlfriend waiting for you.

881
01:07:20,128 --> 01:07:21,937
- Sir, it won't happen again.
- I hope not.

882
01:07:22,008 --> 01:07:24,739
Lots of lousy characters around here.
Sorry, miss.

883
01:07:25,608 --> 01:07:26,939
Here I am, lady.

884
01:07:28,688 --> 01:07:30,770
That's the first time
that ever happened to me.

885
01:07:30,848 --> 01:07:33,454
- What're you doing out here?
- I'm meeting Aron.

886
01:07:33,528 --> 01:07:36,372
I thought I'd come out early
and look around.

887
01:07:36,448 --> 01:07:39,816
- You never been out here before?
- Not at night, no.

888
01:07:41,048 --> 01:07:42,857
- What time you gonna meet him?
- At 8:00.

889
01:07:42,928 --> 01:07:45,932
Thought I'd try and cheer him up.
He's been so depressed lately.

890
01:07:46,008 --> 01:07:47,009
Yeah, I know.

891
01:07:47,088 --> 01:07:49,170
I'm so glad you happened to be here.

892
01:07:54,888 --> 01:07:55,855
8:00?

893
01:07:57,088 --> 01:07:58,613
You got a half hour?

894
01:08:03,288 --> 01:08:05,495
How are you, Cal?
We never see you around anymore.

895
01:08:05,568 --> 01:08:06,615
I'm around.

896
01:08:06,688 --> 01:08:09,897
I've been over to the house several times,
but you were never there.

897
01:08:09,968 --> 01:08:13,177
- I never go home anymore.
- Aron says he hardly ever sees you.

898
01:08:14,448 --> 01:08:16,291
I feel awfully sorry for him.

899
01:08:21,928 --> 01:08:24,135
You're terrible.

900
01:08:24,208 --> 01:08:26,973
That's the first time
that ever happened to me, too.

901
01:08:28,128 --> 01:08:30,256
Wonder if we can see Aron from here.

902
01:08:31,328 --> 01:08:33,934
I feel awfully sorry for him.
He's right, you know.

903
01:08:34,008 --> 01:08:37,012
I mean, it's awful, the war and people
killing each other.

904
01:08:37,088 --> 01:08:39,819
Why feel sorry for Aron?
Feel sorry for the people.

905
01:08:39,888 --> 01:08:42,459
But it just seems to affect him
so personally.

906
01:08:42,528 --> 01:08:44,371
I'll agree with that.

907
01:08:45,528 --> 01:08:46,734
He's right.

908
01:08:48,008 --> 01:08:49,737
He's always right.

909
01:08:49,848 --> 01:08:51,816
And he has always been right.

910
01:08:51,888 --> 01:08:53,572
Now let's talk about something else.

911
01:08:53,648 --> 01:08:54,695
All right.

912
01:08:56,248 --> 01:08:57,329
8:00.

913
01:08:57,608 --> 01:08:59,133
We got a lot to see.

914
01:09:00,288 --> 01:09:02,290
Will we be back in time for Aron?

915
01:09:05,648 --> 01:09:07,298
All right. I'd love to.

916
01:09:14,728 --> 01:09:15,695
Easy.

917
01:09:39,328 --> 01:09:42,696
Here's your cigar,
and where have you been hiding?

918
01:09:46,048 --> 01:09:47,288
- Who was that?
- Who?

919
01:09:47,368 --> 01:09:49,416
- That girl.
- I don't see nobody.

920
01:09:49,488 --> 01:09:53,129
She was standing right...
Girls follow you around, don't they?

921
01:09:54,688 --> 01:09:56,736
What are girls like that like?

922
01:09:57,288 --> 01:09:58,335
All right, never mind.

923
01:09:58,408 --> 01:10:01,218
These Huns have been the aggressors
in every war in Europe...

924
01:10:01,288 --> 01:10:02,733
since the time of Julius Caesar.

925
01:10:02,808 --> 01:10:06,335
I couldn't attempt to describe to you
the horrors committed by the Germans.

926
01:10:06,408 --> 01:10:07,455
Look.

927
01:10:07,528 --> 01:10:08,893
Would we have time?

928
01:10:09,168 --> 01:10:11,091
...after the Germans had been through...

929
01:10:11,168 --> 01:10:13,535
-the women of the town...
- That German's here again.

930
01:10:13,608 --> 01:10:16,578
It is not true. It is lies, all lies.

931
01:10:16,968 --> 01:10:20,290
Come on, Cal. Is it scary?

932
01:10:22,568 --> 01:10:23,854
Here we go.

933
01:10:33,528 --> 01:10:35,735
It is lies, all lies.

934
01:10:35,808 --> 01:10:38,254
I'd like to give that guy
a piece of my mind.

935
01:10:38,608 --> 01:10:40,372
See over there. That's Castroville.

936
01:10:40,448 --> 01:10:42,132
Everything looks so small down there.

937
01:10:42,208 --> 01:10:43,937
Higher and higher and higher and higher

938
01:10:44,008 --> 01:10:45,055
What?

939
01:10:45,128 --> 01:10:47,369
Growing and growing
and growing and growing

940
01:10:47,448 --> 01:10:51,169
- What are you talking about?
- I'll tell you sometime.

941
01:10:55,808 --> 01:10:57,458
Does Aron really love me?

942
01:10:59,488 --> 01:11:01,411
I seem to have sort of lost him.

943
01:11:01,488 --> 01:11:05,129
I mean, we're going
to be married someday, but...

944
01:11:05,208 --> 01:11:07,654
Well, if he does love me, he doesn't...

945
01:11:08,528 --> 01:11:10,053
I can't tell anymore.

946
01:11:12,728 --> 01:11:14,617
Cal, can I ask you something?

947
01:11:15,488 --> 01:11:16,728
Yeah, go ahead.

948
01:11:18,448 --> 01:11:20,815
These girls that you always
go around with.

949
01:11:20,888 --> 01:11:24,131
You know, remember there was
that little Mexican girl once.

950
01:11:24,208 --> 01:11:26,097
What are girls like that like?

951
01:11:29,808 --> 01:11:31,890
You don't really love them, do you?

952
01:11:33,728 --> 01:11:36,732
Why do you go out with them?
Is it because you're bad?

953
01:11:38,128 --> 01:11:39,778
You're not angry, are you?

954
01:11:42,648 --> 01:11:46,016
- Well, why do you, then? Are you bad?
- Do you think I'm bad?

955
01:11:48,288 --> 01:11:49,619
I don't know.

956
01:11:50,808 --> 01:11:54,096
I guess I don't know
what is good and what's bad.

957
01:11:54,168 --> 01:11:56,375
I mean, Aron is so good...

958
01:11:56,928 --> 01:11:58,453
and I'm not.

959
01:11:58,528 --> 01:12:00,530
Not good enough for Aron, anyway.

960
01:12:00,608 --> 01:12:02,895
Because sometimes when I'm with Aron...

961
01:12:03,448 --> 01:12:05,769
Aron likes to talk about our being in love...

962
01:12:05,848 --> 01:12:08,419
and think about it
and that's all right, but...

963
01:12:09,528 --> 01:12:12,532
These girls that you go out with, do you...

964
01:12:13,728 --> 01:12:16,254
Maybe I don't know what love is, exactly.

965
01:12:16,968 --> 01:12:20,336
I know love is good the way Aron says...

966
01:12:22,328 --> 01:12:24,615
but it's more than that, it's got to be.

967
01:12:26,688 --> 01:12:28,770
I shouldn't talk to you this way...

968
01:12:28,848 --> 01:12:31,010
but I don't know who else to talk to.

969
01:12:31,568 --> 01:12:33,855
Sometimes I think I'm really bad.

970
01:12:35,008 --> 01:12:37,215
Sometimes I don't know what to think.

971
01:12:39,848 --> 01:12:42,454
- Aron'II knock that out of you.
- Will he?

972
01:12:43,648 --> 01:12:44,774
He's got to.

973
01:12:45,648 --> 01:12:47,616
The way I figure it out...

974
01:12:48,448 --> 01:12:50,496
Aron never having had a mother...

975
01:12:51,688 --> 01:12:54,532
he's made her everything good
that he can think of...

976
01:12:55,168 --> 01:12:56,897
and that's what he thinks I am.

977
01:12:56,968 --> 01:12:59,699
That's who he's in love with.
It's not me at all.

978
01:13:01,328 --> 01:13:04,252
'Cause I'm not a bit like that made-up one.
Not a bit.

979
01:13:04,608 --> 01:13:07,373
I don't mean I think I'm really bad.

980
01:13:10,328 --> 01:13:11,773
Look at that star.

981
01:13:13,248 --> 01:13:15,410
It must be a planet, it's so bright.

982
01:13:16,368 --> 01:13:17,335
Probably.

983
01:13:22,408 --> 01:13:25,378
I bet that girl's waiting for you
down there somewhere.

984
01:13:27,008 --> 01:13:28,737
She can just wait.

985
01:13:29,208 --> 01:13:30,653
She was pretty.

986
01:13:34,568 --> 01:13:37,253
You've been awfully nice, Cal,
taking care of me.

987
01:13:57,208 --> 01:13:59,529
I love Aron. I do, really I do.

988
01:14:03,648 --> 01:14:05,138
I do.

989
01:14:10,808 --> 01:14:11,969
To give these fiends a lesson that...

990
01:14:12,048 --> 01:14:13,493
Have you seen Abra, Mr. AIbrecht?

991
01:14:13,568 --> 01:14:14,649
Lies. All lies.

992
01:14:14,728 --> 01:14:16,537
What's the matter with you tonight, Gus?

993
01:14:16,608 --> 01:14:18,178
Gus, come on.

994
01:14:18,768 --> 01:14:20,133
There's Aron.

995
01:14:21,408 --> 01:14:23,012
You're a good shoemaker.

996
01:14:25,008 --> 01:14:26,692
There's Aron, down there.

997
01:14:26,768 --> 01:14:28,691
Major, why don't you stay out of politics?

998
01:14:28,768 --> 01:14:29,929
Mr. AIbrecht.

999
01:14:30,768 --> 01:14:33,931
They're pushing him around.
What are they doing?

1000
01:14:35,248 --> 01:14:36,932
That'd kill Dad if he knew that.

1001
01:14:37,008 --> 01:14:39,614
Hey, operator,
when does this thing move again.

1002
01:14:39,688 --> 01:14:40,610
Hey!

1003
01:14:48,808 --> 01:14:50,651
Cal, don't!

1004
01:14:50,728 --> 01:14:52,492
Watch yourself, get back!

1005
01:14:53,848 --> 01:14:55,896
Please. Somebody pull him back.

1006
01:14:56,928 --> 01:14:58,339
Don't bother me!

1007
01:14:58,408 --> 01:15:00,058
Come on.

1008
01:15:07,168 --> 01:15:10,297
- Gus, come on, have a drink.
- No, Charlie, no drink.

1009
01:15:16,488 --> 01:15:18,138
What are you waiting for?

1010
01:15:20,848 --> 01:15:23,135
Mr. AIbrecht, calm down.
They're not bad fellows.

1011
01:15:23,208 --> 01:15:25,210
Aron, you are a child.

1012
01:15:30,248 --> 01:15:32,455
All I tried to do was buy him a drink.

1013
01:15:34,168 --> 01:15:35,215
Gustav.

1014
01:15:35,288 --> 01:15:36,335
Silence.

1015
01:15:36,408 --> 01:15:39,093
You all loved him a few weeks ago,
what's gotten into you?

1016
01:15:39,168 --> 01:15:41,091
I'm sick of him sticking up
for the Germans.

1017
01:15:41,168 --> 01:15:43,853
- You a friend of the Germans?
- I'm a friend of this German.

1018
01:15:43,928 --> 01:15:47,569
There are rose plants in that border there.
Please be careful where you step.

1019
01:15:47,648 --> 01:15:50,811
We liked him. He made us laugh
because of his funny German accent.

1020
01:15:50,888 --> 01:15:53,334
Let him read this
in his funny German accent.

1021
01:15:53,768 --> 01:15:56,339
- What is it?
- Let him come down and read it.

1022
01:15:56,408 --> 01:15:59,173
- He doesn't have to read anything.
- I will read it.

1023
01:15:59,608 --> 01:16:01,019
Here, give it to me.

1024
01:16:06,128 --> 01:16:08,813
"The Government, with deep regret,
informs...

1025
01:16:14,768 --> 01:16:18,568
"that your son was killed in action,
15th of April.

1026
01:16:19,928 --> 01:16:21,930
"He died a hero and an American."

1027
01:16:26,688 --> 01:16:28,929
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hopps. I did not...

1028
01:16:29,008 --> 01:16:30,533
You're not sorry enough.

1029
01:16:30,608 --> 01:16:33,817
- I don't think he's sorry.
- He's not sorry at all.

1030
01:16:33,888 --> 01:16:36,892
- Listen, why don't we all go on home--
- You're not sorry enough.

1031
01:16:36,968 --> 01:16:38,970
Why aren't you in the war?

1032
01:16:39,048 --> 01:16:40,698
This will make you sorry.

1033
01:17:09,688 --> 01:17:10,974
Hello, Charlie.

1034
01:17:11,688 --> 01:17:14,168
Danny, what are you fellows
doing here, anyway?

1035
01:17:14,248 --> 01:17:15,215
Get up.

1036
01:17:15,768 --> 01:17:18,339
Loretta, I didn't expect to find you here.

1037
01:17:18,808 --> 01:17:20,139
Evening, Rose.

1038
01:17:21,368 --> 01:17:24,656
Looks like they messed up
your rose garden a little here, Gus.

1039
01:17:25,048 --> 01:17:26,857
Somebody owes you an apology.

1040
01:17:34,168 --> 01:17:37,251
How about you folks all going home now?

1041
01:17:37,488 --> 01:17:39,297
I think this'll do for tonight.

1042
01:17:44,488 --> 01:17:46,377
Good evening, Mrs. AIbrecht.

1043
01:17:47,048 --> 01:17:48,379
- May I?
- Come in.

1044
01:17:53,288 --> 01:17:56,098
This place will be fixed up
just like it was before.

1045
01:17:56,168 --> 01:17:59,172
- I'm gonna see to it.
- Ja, He will see to it.

1046
01:18:07,168 --> 01:18:08,454
Where were you?

1047
01:18:11,168 --> 01:18:12,932
Where did you get his coat?

1048
01:18:24,088 --> 01:18:25,294
You all right?

1049
01:18:26,848 --> 01:18:30,409
You had to start slugging, didn't you?
Were you showing off for her?

1050
01:18:30,808 --> 01:18:32,492
You had to start slugging.

1051
01:18:33,048 --> 01:18:35,972
- I was trying to help you.
- I don't need your help.

1052
01:18:36,968 --> 01:18:40,256
If you want to slug people,
do it for yourself and not for me.

1053
01:18:40,328 --> 01:18:44,299
- And don't lie to me about trying to--
- Aron, I tried to help you!

1054
01:18:49,008 --> 01:18:52,455
- Great big Aron.
- You finished?

1055
01:18:53,768 --> 01:18:57,773
- No!
- Cal, stop it! Don't.

1056
01:18:57,848 --> 01:18:59,054
- Don't.
- Don't do that.

1057
01:18:59,128 --> 01:19:01,529
- Don't.
- Abra, don't do that!

1058
01:19:10,608 --> 01:19:11,689
Wait here.

1059
01:19:49,528 --> 01:19:51,212
I was trying to help him.

1060
01:19:54,208 --> 01:19:56,210
Who am I kidding?

1061
01:19:56,808 --> 01:19:58,537
I tried to kill him.

1062
01:20:00,928 --> 01:20:02,453
Mike, give me a drink.

1063
01:20:05,248 --> 01:20:06,852
- Don't drink any more.
- Why?

1064
01:20:06,928 --> 01:20:09,852
- No, please. It's not good for you.
- It's good for me.

1065
01:20:10,168 --> 01:20:14,253
- No, you're gonna get drunk.
- Yeah, I'm gonna get drunk.

1066
01:20:15,888 --> 01:20:19,017
Please forget it, what happened up
on the ferris wheel.

1067
01:20:19,328 --> 01:20:21,569
It didn't mean anything, really.

1068
01:20:21,728 --> 01:20:24,129
Please, forget it. It didn't mean anything.

1069
01:20:25,368 --> 01:20:27,496
Say it didn't. Please, say it didn't.

1070
01:20:30,248 --> 01:20:34,617
Someday he's gonna know
who his real son is.

1071
01:20:35,648 --> 01:20:36,615
What?

1072
01:20:38,368 --> 01:20:40,052
Someday he's gonna know.

1073
01:20:43,328 --> 01:20:45,490
I don't understand you. You scare me.

1074
01:20:48,768 --> 01:20:51,612
- I know. I scare myself.
- Abra.

1075
01:21:10,768 --> 01:21:12,452
Fix me another drink.

1076
01:21:18,488 --> 01:21:22,573
- I want that money. Now you give it to me.
- You know I haven't any money here.

1077
01:21:26,368 --> 01:21:27,335
Okay.

1078
01:21:28,088 --> 01:21:30,819
- When will you get it?
- In the morning, I suppose.

1079
01:21:31,968 --> 01:21:34,414
Okay. I'll sleep here.

1080
01:21:36,328 --> 01:21:38,899
Come on. You've gotta go home.

1081
01:21:38,968 --> 01:21:41,096
If you still feel the same way
in the morning...

1082
01:21:41,168 --> 01:21:42,897
you come back, we'll go to the bank...

1083
01:21:42,968 --> 01:21:45,619
and I'll see that you get everything
that's coming to you.

1084
01:21:45,688 --> 01:21:49,056
I'll buy out your share.
I'll go on and make a fortune with it.

1085
01:21:50,008 --> 01:21:54,297
Okay. That seems fair to me, Will.

1086
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:20,735
Abra.

1087
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:25,414
What?

1088
01:22:26,808 --> 01:22:28,094
- Who is it?
- Cal.

1089
01:22:30,328 --> 01:22:31,409
- Cal?
- Yeah.

1090
01:22:32,928 --> 01:22:35,852
- What on earth are you doing here?
- I want to see you.

1091
01:22:36,808 --> 01:22:38,936
Wait till I put something on.

1092
01:22:56,568 --> 01:22:59,538
I gotta tell you something.
Can you keep a secret?

1093
01:23:00,048 --> 01:23:02,130
Yes. What is it?

1094
01:23:03,408 --> 01:23:05,979
What's the matter? You look terrible.

1095
01:23:09,168 --> 01:23:11,330
- I got it.
- What?

1096
01:23:14,168 --> 01:23:17,490
Remember that money? Dad lost?

1097
01:23:17,568 --> 01:23:19,252
On that lettuce business?

1098
01:23:21,928 --> 01:23:25,455
- I got it.
- You mean you earned it all back?

1099
01:23:25,528 --> 01:23:28,213
- I've earned every cent.
- That's wonderful, Cal.

1100
01:23:32,168 --> 01:23:35,536
You got any time off tomorrow
from the hospital?

1101
01:23:37,168 --> 01:23:39,330
I get an hour at lunchtime. Why?

1102
01:23:40,128 --> 01:23:41,778
Thursday's Dad's birthday.

1103
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:46,850
And I'm gonna give a party for him.

1104
01:23:49,768 --> 01:23:54,490
And I want you and me,
you and Aron and me...

1105
01:23:55,488 --> 01:23:56,933
to be there.

1106
01:23:59,088 --> 01:24:02,535
I'm gonna give him that money
just like it was a birthday present.

1107
01:24:03,048 --> 01:24:05,699
You could come
and help me get some junk...

1108
01:24:05,768 --> 01:24:08,499
-and we could decorate the house.
- Sure.

1109
01:24:09,768 --> 01:24:12,089
And we'll get balloons...

1110
01:24:14,688 --> 01:24:18,693
-and all that kid stuff, birthday stuff.
- We can go to the five and 10.

1111
01:24:21,168 --> 01:24:23,455
- Will you do it?
- I'd like to.

1112
01:24:39,568 --> 01:24:42,174
I'm sort of...

1113
01:24:49,488 --> 01:24:50,899
Why did I hit Aron?

1114
01:24:53,448 --> 01:24:55,655
Why did I hit him so hard?

1115
01:25:06,568 --> 01:25:09,094
Will you help me?

1116
01:25:09,168 --> 01:25:11,409
Will you really help me?

1117
01:25:13,568 --> 01:25:15,013
I'll help you, Cal.

1118
01:25:19,808 --> 01:25:20,889
Be careful.

1119
01:25:25,248 --> 01:25:26,693
How'd I get up here?

1120
01:25:37,848 --> 01:25:40,692
- Is your father coming?
- Yeah.

1121
01:25:40,768 --> 01:25:43,692
- Cal, don't get nervous.
- I think it looks beautiful.

1122
01:25:44,168 --> 01:25:45,932
Don't you? I love the way it looks.

1123
01:25:46,008 --> 01:25:48,170
- It looks festive, doesn't it?
- Yes, it does.

1124
01:25:48,248 --> 01:25:49,852
Yes, Cal, it looks very pretty.

1125
01:25:49,928 --> 01:25:52,249
- Do you think this is childish?
- Not a bit.

1126
01:25:52,328 --> 01:25:55,252
The room looks lovely.
Your father's going to love it.

1127
01:25:56,248 --> 01:25:58,410
- How's the turkey?
- It's a good turkey.

1128
01:25:58,488 --> 01:26:00,570
- Smells ready.
- It'll be ready.

1129
01:26:00,648 --> 01:26:03,857
- Aron didn't get him anything?
- He told me he had something.

1130
01:26:12,208 --> 01:26:14,859
- What?
- He didn't tell me what it was.

1131
01:26:22,488 --> 01:26:25,059
- It won't stack up against mine, will it?
- No.

1132
01:26:25,608 --> 01:26:27,258
- Do you wanna see mine?
- I'd like to.

1133
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:28,898
- I got it wrapped up.
- Show it to me.

1134
01:26:28,968 --> 01:26:29,969
- Wanna see it?
- Yes.

1135
01:26:30,048 --> 01:26:31,095
Okay.

1136
01:26:33,208 --> 01:26:34,573
- You like it?
- It's pretty.

1137
01:26:34,648 --> 01:26:36,173
You think it's pretty?

1138
01:26:37,808 --> 01:26:39,492
Don't drink any more wine.

1139
01:26:42,928 --> 01:26:45,818
- Did Aron tell you what the present was?
- No.

1140
01:26:47,008 --> 01:26:49,773
- You sure?
- Honestly, he didn't.

1141
01:26:50,448 --> 01:26:52,849
I'd tell you if he did. Honestly, I would.

1142
01:26:53,968 --> 01:26:57,290
Now everything's gonna go off fine. Here.

1143
01:26:58,928 --> 01:27:00,293
The brooms.

1144
01:27:00,688 --> 01:27:03,168
- Don't you do anything to give me away.
- I wouldn't.

1145
01:27:03,248 --> 01:27:05,854
We'll let him come in
and let the house speak for itself.

1146
01:27:05,928 --> 01:27:09,819
- We'll act like it was any other old day.
- Yes. Wait, Cal.

1147
01:27:12,248 --> 01:27:13,454
Cal.

1148
01:27:18,008 --> 01:27:19,692
You look wonderful.

1149
01:27:21,288 --> 01:27:22,255
Thanks.

1150
01:27:32,088 --> 01:27:33,578
But I need my son.

1151
01:27:33,648 --> 01:27:36,697
It isn't that he doesn't want
to fight for his country. He does.

1152
01:27:36,768 --> 01:27:38,054
I need him to work the farm.

1153
01:27:38,128 --> 01:27:40,449
Things can't be as bad as you say,
Mr. Piscora.

1154
01:27:40,528 --> 01:27:42,929
You must be making plenty of money
out of your crops.

1155
01:27:43,008 --> 01:27:46,376
No money. I sold this year's crop
for 5 cents before I even planted it.

1156
01:27:46,448 --> 01:27:47,654
Everything cost so much now.

1157
01:27:47,728 --> 01:27:50,299
And now I got to sell next year crop.
So I need my boy.

1158
01:27:50,368 --> 01:27:52,291
I can do nothing about it, Mr. Piscora.

1159
01:27:52,368 --> 01:27:54,735
In all conscience,
I cannot excuse your son.

1160
01:27:54,808 --> 01:27:57,732
- Come on, Poppa.
- I don't like it.

1161
01:27:58,368 --> 01:28:01,053
I'm telling you. I don't like it.

1162
01:28:05,368 --> 01:28:07,336
Hello, Abra. Nice to see you.

1163
01:28:07,408 --> 01:28:10,537
- Gonna stay to dinner?
- Yes, I am. Is something the matter?

1164
01:28:10,608 --> 01:28:14,374
No, nothing. I guess I shouldn't
have taken that job in the Draft Board.

1165
01:28:15,048 --> 01:28:17,858
- Did you notice the snow on Mount Toro?
- Yes, I saw it.

1166
01:28:17,928 --> 01:28:20,169
Say, that means we got
a good year coming in.

1167
01:28:20,248 --> 01:28:23,616
- We could use it.
- Let's go in.

1168
01:28:43,488 --> 01:28:45,855
- Happy birthday, Dad.
- Happy birthday, Mr. Trask.

1169
01:28:45,928 --> 01:28:48,374
Is it possible? I'm very touched.

1170
01:28:48,448 --> 01:28:51,657
- Are you surprised?
- I had no idea. I'd forgotten completely.

1171
01:28:51,728 --> 01:28:55,369
- We knew you had, didn't we?
- Completely. I don't know what to say.

1172
01:28:59,128 --> 01:29:00,698
We got turkey.

1173
01:29:00,768 --> 01:29:04,215
- And champagne.
- Champagne, and we got all the things.

1174
01:29:06,968 --> 01:29:09,539
- We got the trimmings here.
- Isn't that pretty?

1175
01:29:14,368 --> 01:29:17,417
Got something for you.

1176
01:29:17,488 --> 01:29:20,378
Presents, too. Isn't that nice. Look.

1177
01:29:25,128 --> 01:29:27,415
- Ain't you gonna open it up?
- Yes.

1178
01:29:27,488 --> 01:29:31,698
Dad, Abra and I have one for you, too,
only we can't exactly give it to you.

1179
01:29:33,168 --> 01:29:36,729
I didn't tell Abra I was going to do this,
but we're engaged.

1180
01:29:39,968 --> 01:29:42,858
I couldn't have wished for anything nicer.

1181
01:29:44,288 --> 01:29:47,132
A lovely birthday present.

1182
01:29:48,248 --> 01:29:50,535
- You have my blessings.
- Thank you, Dad.

1183
01:29:51,808 --> 01:29:54,414
- But you haven't opened Cal's present yet.
- No.

1184
01:29:56,568 --> 01:29:59,492
But I can't imagine having
anything better than this.

1185
01:30:00,608 --> 01:30:01,655
Excuse me.

1186
01:30:03,088 --> 01:30:07,173
'Course I suspected it right along.
But, Cal, coming on my birthday.

1187
01:30:11,288 --> 01:30:12,414
What's this?

1188
01:30:14,408 --> 01:30:15,819
What is this?

1189
01:30:18,848 --> 01:30:23,012
I made it. And it's for you.
It's all the money you lost on the lettuce.

1190
01:30:23,088 --> 01:30:25,295
You made it? But how?

1191
01:30:27,488 --> 01:30:28,489
Go on.

1192
01:30:29,968 --> 01:30:31,254
- Beans.
- Beans?

1193
01:30:32,848 --> 01:30:35,977
Yes, we bought futures at 5 cents...

1194
01:30:36,608 --> 01:30:41,250
and the war came along
and the price went sky-high.

1195
01:30:42,528 --> 01:30:45,737
So, that's for you.

1196
01:30:46,928 --> 01:30:49,738
It's all the money you lost
in the lettuce business.

1197
01:30:50,968 --> 01:30:52,208
It's for you.

1198
01:30:54,128 --> 01:30:56,893
- I made it for you.
- You will have to give it back.

1199
01:30:59,288 --> 01:31:03,976
No, I made it for you, Dad.
I want you to have it.

1200
01:31:04,648 --> 01:31:07,811
- You will have to give it back.
- Who? I can't give it--

1201
01:31:07,888 --> 01:31:11,449
- To the people you got it from.
- No, the British Purchasing Agency?

1202
01:31:11,528 --> 01:31:14,213
- I can't give it back.
- Give it to the farmers you robbed.

1203
01:31:14,288 --> 01:31:15,813
We didn't rob anybody, Dad.

1204
01:31:15,888 --> 01:31:19,574
We paid 2 cents a pound,
2 cents over market for that stuff.

1205
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:23,816
I sign my name
and boys go out and some die...

1206
01:31:24,328 --> 01:31:26,490
and some live helpless
without arms and legs.

1207
01:31:26,568 --> 01:31:28,411
Not one will come back untorn.

1208
01:31:29,008 --> 01:31:31,773
Do you think I could take
a profit from that?

1209
01:31:34,328 --> 01:31:36,934
I don't want the money, Cal!
I couldn't take it!

1210
01:31:37,488 --> 01:31:40,219
- I thank you for the thought, but--
- I'll keep it for you.

1211
01:31:40,288 --> 01:31:43,053
I'll wrap it up
and we'll just keep it in here--

1212
01:31:43,128 --> 01:31:44,493
I'll never take it!

1213
01:31:44,568 --> 01:31:47,777
Son, I'd be happy if you'd give me...

1214
01:31:47,848 --> 01:31:50,818
something like your brother's given me.

1215
01:31:50,888 --> 01:31:54,688
Something honest and human and good.
Don't be angry, Son.

1216
01:31:55,488 --> 01:31:58,378
If you want to give me a present,
give me a good life.

1217
01:31:58,488 --> 01:32:00,411
That's something I could value.

1218
01:32:28,088 --> 01:32:29,453
I hate you!

1219
01:32:46,768 --> 01:32:48,452
What are you doing?

1220
01:32:54,568 --> 01:32:56,730
He doesn't want anything from me.

1221
01:32:57,128 --> 01:32:58,368
Cal, don't.

1222
01:33:00,968 --> 01:33:02,129
Please, don't.

1223
01:33:10,928 --> 01:33:11,895
Abra !

1224
01:33:32,728 --> 01:33:34,651
Don't you ever touch her again.

1225
01:33:37,288 --> 01:33:38,619
I don't trust you.

1226
01:33:41,368 --> 01:33:42,608
You're no good.

1227
01:33:43,528 --> 01:33:47,453
You're mean and vicious and wild.
And you always have been.

1228
01:33:47,808 --> 01:33:49,572
You know it, too, don't you?

1229
01:33:49,928 --> 01:33:52,329
Father and I have put up
with every vicious thing...

1230
01:33:52,408 --> 01:33:56,413
you could think of since you were a child.
And we've always forgiven you.

1231
01:33:56,968 --> 01:33:59,255
But now I don't want you to go near Abra.

1232
01:33:59,328 --> 01:34:02,457
I don't want you to talk with her.
Just stay away from her!

1233
01:34:29,088 --> 01:34:31,819
- You want to go some place with me?
- Why should I?

1234
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:36,772
I got something to show you.

1235
01:34:38,248 --> 01:34:41,889
- Think you'll find it very interesting.
- What are you talking about?

1236
01:34:42,968 --> 01:34:46,177
Maybe our mother didn't die
and go to heaven after all, Aron.

1237
01:34:46,848 --> 01:34:49,692
- What do you mean by that?
- Maybe she didn't.

1238
01:34:49,768 --> 01:34:51,577
Maybe she's alive someplace.

1239
01:34:53,608 --> 01:34:55,212
What are you up to now?

1240
01:34:55,288 --> 01:34:58,735
Remember when we were kids,
we used to make up stories about her?

1241
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:03,856
You said she must have looked
like heaven's youngest angel, remember?

1242
01:35:05,048 --> 01:35:07,255
Remember that time I shot that rabbit?

1243
01:35:07,928 --> 01:35:09,817
You cried and you said...

1244
01:35:09,928 --> 01:35:12,932
that she would have cried, too,
'cause she was so tenderhearted.

1245
01:35:13,008 --> 01:35:15,739
And you said I was bad,
you remember that?

1246
01:35:16,688 --> 01:35:20,056
I just want to show you something.
It's not gonna take very long.

1247
01:35:20,128 --> 01:35:21,414
What's the matter, you afraid?

1248
01:35:21,488 --> 01:35:23,855
I'm not afraid to look at anything
you could show me.

1249
01:35:23,928 --> 01:35:27,899
Can you look at the truth, just once?

1250
01:35:30,208 --> 01:35:34,532
Come on, you can look
at the truth just once. Can't you?

1251
01:35:36,008 --> 01:35:36,975
Come on.

1252
01:35:38,648 --> 01:35:41,572
I want to show you something.
It won't take very long.

1253
01:36:15,288 --> 01:36:16,449
Oh, Cal.

1254
01:36:18,568 --> 01:36:19,535
Hello.

1255
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:47,377
Mother, this is your other son, Aron.

1256
01:36:49,448 --> 01:36:51,689
Aron is everything that's good, Mother.

1257
01:37:00,248 --> 01:37:02,091
Say hello to your mother.

1258
01:37:16,208 --> 01:37:18,131
Say hello to your mother, Aron!

1259
01:37:19,208 --> 01:37:21,495
Joe!

1260
01:37:33,008 --> 01:37:34,931
- PIay another song!
- Quiet!

1261
01:37:37,408 --> 01:37:38,409
Five!

1262
01:37:38,888 --> 01:37:42,574
"I'm thinking of the lilac trees
that shook their purple plumes

1263
01:37:43,648 --> 01:37:46,777
"I'm thinking of the rivulet
with its cool and silvery flow

1264
01:37:47,328 --> 01:37:51,174
"Of the old gray rock that shadowed it
and the peppermint below"

1265
01:37:56,768 --> 01:38:00,056
- Where is Aron?
- I don't know. I'm not my brother's keeper.

1266
01:38:00,128 --> 01:38:01,732
- Where did you go?
- For a ride.

1267
01:38:01,808 --> 01:38:03,936
- What did you quarrel about?
- You.

1268
01:38:04,248 --> 01:38:06,979
- You're angry about the money.
- No, I'm not angry.

1269
01:38:07,288 --> 01:38:09,131
I like it. I think it's great.

1270
01:38:09,848 --> 01:38:11,896
I'm gonna go away
and take that money with me.

1271
01:38:11,968 --> 01:38:15,370
I think I'll start me a little business.
Just like my mother did.

1272
01:38:15,448 --> 01:38:19,419
- What do you know about your mother?
- I know where she is and what she is.

1273
01:38:19,488 --> 01:38:22,219
And I know why she left you.
Couldn't stand it.

1274
01:38:22,728 --> 01:38:25,459
You didn't really love her
any more than you do me.

1275
01:38:26,128 --> 01:38:28,574
Because of your goodness, your rightness.

1276
01:38:28,648 --> 01:38:31,299
You never gave either one of us
an inch, ever...

1277
01:38:31,368 --> 01:38:33,132
from what you thought was right.

1278
01:38:33,208 --> 01:38:36,974
You kept on forgiving us,
but you never really loved us.

1279
01:38:37,768 --> 01:38:39,770
I know why you didn't love me.

1280
01:38:39,848 --> 01:38:41,259
Because I'm like my mother...

1281
01:38:41,328 --> 01:38:44,172
and you never forgave yourself
for having loved her.

1282
01:38:46,248 --> 01:38:50,094
I'm not gonna forgive him.
I'm never gonna forgive him.

1283
01:38:50,168 --> 01:38:54,571
- Where is Aron?
- He's with her, with his mother.

1284
01:38:55,408 --> 01:38:57,809
She's over there in Monterey,
if you want to know.

1285
01:38:57,888 --> 01:38:59,652
She owns one of them houses.

1286
01:39:01,048 --> 01:39:03,654
I took Aron there tonight
because I was jealous.

1287
01:39:04,568 --> 01:39:08,698
I've been jealous all my life.
Jealous, I couldn't even stand it.

1288
01:39:13,008 --> 01:39:15,295
Tonight, I even tried to buy your love.

1289
01:39:17,328 --> 01:39:19,296
But now I don't want it anymore.

1290
01:39:21,848 --> 01:39:25,455
- I can't use it anymore.
- Don't talk to your father like that.

1291
01:39:29,088 --> 01:39:31,295
I don't want any kind of love anymore.

1292
01:39:33,128 --> 01:39:34,573
It doesn't pay off.

1293
01:39:35,088 --> 01:39:36,852
No future in it.

1294
01:39:39,248 --> 01:39:40,932
Let him go if he wants to.

1295
01:39:45,768 --> 01:39:47,532
No, I won't.

1296
01:39:59,848 --> 01:40:01,612
You hate me, too, don't you?

1297
01:40:03,048 --> 01:40:04,413
I'm afraid of you.

1298
01:40:09,288 --> 01:40:12,770
What you did to Aron tonight,
I don't know what it will do to him.

1299
01:40:15,248 --> 01:40:17,728
I feel like I'm to blame, too.

1300
01:40:19,208 --> 01:40:23,975
- Adam !
- Here. What is it?

1301
01:40:24,048 --> 01:40:26,938
...drunk and had a couple of fights.
He's gone kind of crazy.

1302
01:40:27,008 --> 01:40:29,818
He's at the station now.
Wait, I'll drive you down in my car.

1303
01:40:29,888 --> 01:40:30,935
Cal!

1304
01:40:37,408 --> 01:40:40,014
- What happened between you and Aron?
- Why?

1305
01:40:40,088 --> 01:40:43,137
He's gone kind of crazy.
He's drunk and had a couple of fights...

1306
01:40:43,208 --> 01:40:45,336
and seemed determined
to get himself hurt.

1307
01:40:45,408 --> 01:40:47,331
He's leaving on that troop train tonight...

1308
01:40:47,408 --> 01:40:49,809
and says he's gonna enlist tomorrow
at King City.

1309
01:40:49,888 --> 01:40:53,335
Adam's on his way down there now
to talk to him before the train leaves.

1310
01:40:53,408 --> 01:40:55,729
I think you better get down there.

1311
01:40:56,808 --> 01:40:58,617
- Yeah.
- My car's downstairs.

1312
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:57,535
Do you know what a stroke is, exactly?

1313
01:42:01,688 --> 01:42:04,737
This one is a leakage of blood in the brain
caused by shock.

1314
01:42:04,808 --> 01:42:06,890
There have been earlier, smaller leakages.

1315
01:42:06,968 --> 01:42:09,858
The left side is paralyzed,
and the right side partly.

1316
01:42:10,448 --> 01:42:13,054
In other words,
your father is nearly helpless.

1317
01:42:14,208 --> 01:42:17,257
- Will he die?
- He might live a week or a year.

1318
01:42:18,008 --> 01:42:19,533
He might die tonight.

1319
01:42:26,208 --> 01:42:29,451
- Will he know me?
- You'll have to find that out for yourself.

1320
01:42:33,928 --> 01:42:35,339
Good day.

1321
01:42:37,328 --> 01:42:40,650
Good day, Doctor. Good day, Sam.

1322
01:42:42,568 --> 01:42:45,378
"Cain rose up against his brother Abel,
and slew him.

1323
01:42:45,888 --> 01:42:49,859
"And Cain went away and dwelt
in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden."

1324
01:42:51,848 --> 01:42:54,374
Now why don't you go away some place?

1325
01:43:08,168 --> 01:43:11,058
- He's right.
- No.

1326
01:43:12,928 --> 01:43:15,374
Yes, he is. He's right. That's what I'll do.

1327
01:43:25,008 --> 01:43:27,170
Who's gonna wash these things for me?

1328
01:43:28,968 --> 01:43:30,049
Thank you.

1329
01:43:32,288 --> 01:43:34,177
- There you are.
- How is he?

1330
01:43:34,248 --> 01:43:37,092
He's fine. He's my darling.

1331
01:43:37,168 --> 01:43:38,977
Washed his face, combed his hair.

1332
01:43:39,048 --> 01:43:40,573
Can I go in there now?

1333
01:43:41,008 --> 01:43:44,376
Just for a minute. I want him to rest.
Gotta get lots of sleep.

1334
01:43:46,248 --> 01:43:49,889
- How is he, really?
- Haven't I seen you at the hospital?

1335
01:43:50,608 --> 01:43:52,690
- Not part of the family, are you?
- No.

1336
01:43:52,768 --> 01:43:54,099
I didn't think so.

1337
01:43:54,168 --> 01:43:57,297
I can tell you,
I won't have this job for long.

1338
01:43:57,368 --> 01:44:01,418
That's my luck. Always seem to get them
when they're old and ready to die off.

1339
01:44:15,528 --> 01:44:19,419
Now doesn't he look nice?
He's going to be a darling patient.

1340
01:44:20,048 --> 01:44:22,654
Even tried to smile at me,
didn't you, my dear?

1341
01:44:23,448 --> 01:44:25,655
- I don't want you to tire my patient.
- Please go.

1342
01:44:25,728 --> 01:44:28,698
Now listen, miss,
don't you try to order me about.

1343
01:44:29,368 --> 01:44:31,211
I'll report you to the doctor.

1344
01:44:31,528 --> 01:44:34,054
Will you go out of the room
and shut the door?

1345
01:45:08,088 --> 01:45:09,055
Father.

1346
01:45:12,328 --> 01:45:13,614
Can you hear me?

1347
01:45:19,128 --> 01:45:20,778
I did an awful thing.

1348
01:45:24,768 --> 01:45:25,815
I'm sorry.

1349
01:45:59,088 --> 01:46:01,090
Mr. Trask, can you hear me?

1350
01:46:02,128 --> 01:46:04,779
Is it just Cal you won't answer?

1351
01:46:05,328 --> 01:46:06,693
Can you answer?

1352
01:46:08,848 --> 01:46:11,055
I think you can understand me, though.

1353
01:46:11,888 --> 01:46:15,449
I think behind your eyes
you're just as alert as ever.

1354
01:46:16,528 --> 01:46:19,498
You understand everything I say
only you can't show it.

1355
01:46:26,808 --> 01:46:30,494
Excuse me, Mr. Trask,
for daring to speak to you this way...

1356
01:46:30,888 --> 01:46:34,973
but it's awful not to be loved.
It's the worst thing in the world.

1357
01:46:37,088 --> 01:46:39,534
Don't ask me how I know that.
I just know it.

1358
01:46:39,848 --> 01:46:43,409
It makes you mean and violent and cruel.

1359
01:46:43,488 --> 01:46:46,253
And that's the way
Cal has always felt, all his life.

1360
01:46:47,528 --> 01:46:50,532
I know you didn't mean it to be that way,
but it's true.

1361
01:46:52,248 --> 01:46:56,810
You never gave him your love.
You never asked him for his.

1362
01:46:58,008 --> 01:47:00,056
You never asked him for one thing.

1363
01:47:01,128 --> 01:47:04,735
Cal is going away, Mr. Trask.
But before he goes...

1364
01:47:06,928 --> 01:47:10,774
He did something very bad,
and I'm not asking you to forgive him.

1365
01:47:11,208 --> 01:47:13,973
You have to give him some sign
that you love him...

1366
01:47:14,288 --> 01:47:16,131
or else he'll never be a man.

1367
01:47:16,808 --> 01:47:20,893
He'll just keep on feeling guilty
and alone, unless you release him.

1368
01:47:22,448 --> 01:47:23,779
Please, help him.

1369
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:27,849
I love Cal, Mr. Trask,
and I want him to be whole and strong...

1370
01:47:27,928 --> 01:47:30,454
and you're the only one who can do it.

1371
01:47:30,528 --> 01:47:32,337
So try, please try.

1372
01:47:34,208 --> 01:47:37,291
If you could ask him for something.

1373
01:47:38,048 --> 01:47:40,858
Let him help you so that he knows
that you love him.

1374
01:47:41,728 --> 01:47:43,332
Let him do for you.

1375
01:47:46,648 --> 01:47:51,370
Excuse me, Mr. Trask, for daring
to speak to you this way, but I just had to.

1376
01:47:56,888 --> 01:47:57,969
You've tired my patient...

1377
01:47:58,048 --> 01:48:01,495
and I most certainly shall report it
to the doctor in the morning.

1378
01:48:03,688 --> 01:48:07,454
You don't know that he accuses you.
You don't know what he's thinking about.

1379
01:48:07,728 --> 01:48:10,379
Stop it, Cal.
You gonna cry for the rest of your life?

1380
01:48:10,448 --> 01:48:11,938
- No.
- Then stop it.

1381
01:48:12,688 --> 01:48:15,692
Go in there and talk to him
before it's too late.

1382
01:48:15,768 --> 01:48:18,533
- I can't.
- Please try.

1383
01:48:19,208 --> 01:48:20,494
Get it straight.

1384
01:48:21,488 --> 01:48:25,459
Get through to him, somehow.
Please try, Cal, before it's too late.

1385
01:48:31,848 --> 01:48:35,614
- Is there any coffee around here?
- I'll get you some in a minute.

1386
01:48:41,168 --> 01:48:42,169
Try.

1387
01:48:43,448 --> 01:48:45,655
Is there anything to read around here?

1388
01:48:47,088 --> 01:48:48,533
What would you like?

01:48:48,608 --> 01:48:52,454
- Something to get my mind off my feet.
- There's something in there.

1390
01:49:06,968 --> 01:49:10,575
I tried to believe it was born in me...

1391
01:49:10,648 --> 01:49:14,255
and that I couldn't help it,
but that's not so.

1392
01:49:16,528 --> 01:49:17,939
A man has a choice.

1393
01:49:18,168 --> 01:49:21,138
You used to say that was where
he was different from an animal.

1394
01:49:21,208 --> 01:49:22,733
You see, I remember.

1395
01:49:22,808 --> 01:49:26,369
A man has a choice,
and the choice is what makes him a man.

1396
01:49:28,608 --> 01:49:30,178
You see, I do remember.

1397
01:49:30,608 --> 01:49:34,169
- Look, I can't find any coffee.
- Get out!

1398
01:49:44,568 --> 01:49:45,535
Look.

1399
01:49:53,528 --> 01:49:56,657
Do something...

1400
01:49:58,768 --> 01:49:59,929
for me.

1401
01:50:00,008 --> 01:50:01,248
Yes.

1402
01:50:05,208 --> 01:50:08,132
That woman...

1403
01:50:08,728 --> 01:50:12,892
the nurse, can't stand her.

1404
01:50:15,008 --> 01:50:16,612
Get me another.

1405
01:50:31,808 --> 01:50:33,776
I can't stand her, either.

1406
01:51:24,008 --> 01:51:25,339
What did he say?

1407
01:51:31,768 --> 01:51:35,056
He said, "Don't get anybody else."

1408
01:51:36,528 --> 01:51:38,974
He said, "You stay with me...

1409
01:51:40,288 --> 01:51:41,972
"and you take care of me."

1410
01:52:49,408 --> 01:52:50,409
