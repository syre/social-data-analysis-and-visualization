1
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:20,562
This story is about Howard Beale,
the "Network News" anchorman on UBS TV.

2
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:23,524
In his time, Howard Beale had been
a mandarin of television...

3
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,526
the grand old man of news...

4
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:29,154
with a HUT rating of 16
and a 28 audience share.

5
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:32,950
In 1969, however, his fortunes
began to decline.

6
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,993
He fell to a 22 share.

7
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:38,330
The following year, his wife died,
and he was left a childless widower...

8
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,999
with an 8 rating
and a 12 share.

9
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,795
He became morose and isolated,
began to drink heavily.

10
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,382
On September 22, 1975,
he was fired...

11
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,384
effective in two weeks.

12
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,970
The news was broken to him
by Max Schumacher...

13
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,014
who was the president
of the News Division at UBS.

14
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,851
The two old friends
got properly pissed.

15
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:03,856
I was at CBS
with Ed Murrow in 1951.

16
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,983
Must've been 1950.

17
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:09,903
I was at NBC.
Associate producer.

18
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:14,324
Morning news.
I was just a kid... 26 years old.

19
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:22,249
Anyway, they were building the lower
level of the George Washington Bridge.

20
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:25,169
We were doing a remote from there.

21
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,425
And nobody told me.

22
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,679
7:00 a.m., I get a call.

23
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:39,349
"Where are you? You're supposed to be
on the George Washington Bridge?"

24
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:44,855
I jump out of bed,
throw my raincoat over my pajamas.

25
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,524
I run downstairs
and out into the street...

26
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:50,319
hail a cab and say to the cabbie...

27
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:53,447
"Take me to the middle
of the George Washington Bridge."

28
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,660
The cabbie turns around and says...

29
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,372
He says, "Don't do it, buddy.

30
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:08,128
You're a young man. You've got
your whole life ahead of you."

31
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,594
Didn't I tell you that before?

32
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,769
I'm gonna kill myself.

33
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,021
Shit, Howard.

34
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:30,400
I'm gonna blow my brains out
right on the air...

35
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,946
right in the middle
of the seven o'clock news.

36
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,700
You'll get a hell of a rating,
I'll guarantee that.

37
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,452
Fifty share easy.

38
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:43,497
- You think so?
- Sure.

39
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,209
We could make a series out of it.
"Suicide of the Week."

40
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,674
Why limit ourselves?
"Execution of the Week."

41
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,677
"Terrorist of the Week."

42
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,720
They'll love it.

43
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:03,100
Suicides. Assassinations.

44
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,603
Mad bombers.

45
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,106
Mafia hit men.

46
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,108
Automobile smashups.

47
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,277
"The Death Hour."

48
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:19,324
"A great Sunday night show
for the whole family."

49
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:24,121
Lt'd put fucking Disney
right off the air.

50
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,825
Let's do the Lenin deportation
at the end of three.

51
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,869
- Strong enough to bump?
- At one, then.

52
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:07,372
I'll do a lead on Sarah Jane Moore
to May Berry in San Francisco.

53
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,333
The film I saw
was of the chief of detectives.

54
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:14,379
I think we've got ten seconds
on the shooting itself.

55
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:17,132
The whole thing is 1:25.

56
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:20,469
- What does that come out?
- About 4:50.

57
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,765
- Can we use Squeaky Fromme?
- Let's do that at two.

58
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:29,269
Squeaky boarded the airport bus.

59
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,563
You using a map on him
for San Francisco?

60
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,816
I'd prefer newspapers.

61
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,361
What've we got left?

62
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:40,531
Gun control.
Patty Hearst affidavit.

63
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,575
Guerillas in Chad.
OPEC in Guiana.

64
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:11,687
Hello, Howard.
How are you?

65
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:24,741
Don't forget, Howard,
we're not using the 16.

66
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:33,208
The first attempt on President Ford's
life was 18 days ago...

67
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:35,961
and again yesterday in San Francisco.

68
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,297
In spite of the two attempts,
Mr. Ford says...

69
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,049
he will not become a prisoner
of the Oval Office...

70
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:44,303
a hostage
of would-be assassins.

71
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:48,307
The American people
are good people.

72
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:52,019
Democrats, Independents,
Republicans and others.

73
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:55,272
- How do you get mixed up that type?
- I don't know.

74
00:05:56,773 --> 00:06:01,153
If you're so hot, why go to strangers?
What's wrong with me?

75
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:06,992
Ready two.

76
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,579
Two. Cue Howard.

77
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:13,040
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like at this moment...

78
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:17,336
to announce that I will be retiring
from this program in two weeks' time...

79
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,213
because of poor ratings.

80
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:24,176
Since this show is the only thing
I had going for me in my life...

81
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,929
I have decided to kill myself.

82
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:32,518
I'm going to blow my brains out
on this program a week from today.

83
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,353
Ten seconds to commercial.

84
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,063
Tune in next Tuesday.

85
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:39,900
That should give the public relations
people a week to promote the show.

86
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,902
We oughta get a hell of a rating
out of that.

87
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,947
Fifty share easy.

88
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:51,286
- Listen. Did you hear that?
- What was that about?

89
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,665
Howard said he was going
to blow his brains out next Tuesday.

90
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:58,544
- What are you talking about?
- Didn't you hear him?

91
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,297
Howard said he was going
to kill himself next Tuesday.

92
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:07,261
What do you mean Howard said he
was going to kill himself next Tuesday?

93
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,346
He was supposed to do a tag.

94
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:13,183
He said, "Tune in next Tuesday.
I'm going to shoot myself."

95
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:14,685
What's going on?

96
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,479
He just said he was going
to blow his brains out.

97
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:19,523
What the fuck's going on?

98
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,568
- They wanna know what's going on.
- I can't hear you.

99
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,612
- Turn the studio mike on.
- We're on in 11 seconds.

100
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:28,824
- Ten seconds.
- What are you doing? Have you flipped?

101
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,577
- We better get him off.
- Get him off.

102
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:34,413
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Turn the sound off!

103
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,498
He's going on live!

104
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:38,834
- Key two.
- We're in trouble down here.

105
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,089
Go to standby!

106
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:50,220
Lou, can't we clear out the lobby?
There must be 100 people there.

107
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,764
- How am I gonna clear 'em out?
- Every TV station and wire service!

108
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,184
I could barely get in.

109
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:59,062
- Arthur, anything?
- Not so far.

110
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:02,191
Frank Hackett just walked in.
We had to abort the show.

111
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:04,484
So far over 900
fucking phone calls...

112
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:07,237
complaining about the foul language.

113
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:10,282
- What page are you putting it on?
- Hackett just walked in.

114
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:13,118
- ABC again.
- Tell 'em to go fuck themselves.

115
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,870
That goes for you, too, Marty.

116
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,622
You're off the air.

117
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:20,000
- He wants to talk to you.
- Who's replacing Beale?

118
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,961
- We're flying Snowden up.
- Everybody hold it.

119
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,339
Let's see how the other networks
handle this.

120
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:29,343
- The ten o'clock news opened with it.
- Good evening. Howard Beale...

121
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,428
They'll all make it
their lead story.

122
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:34,806
Howard Beale interrupted
his "Network News" program tonight...

123
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,100
to announce he was going
to kill himself.

124
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:39,478
An unusual thing happened
at a sister network...

125
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,772
UBS, this evening.

126
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:45,359
- How are we handling it?
- Halloway will make a statement...

127
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:49,821
at the end of the show that Howard's
been under great personal stress.

128
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,867
We've got a stockholders' meeting
tomorrow...

129
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:57,246
at which we will announce
the restructuring of management plan.

130
00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:00,499
I don't want this grotesque incident
to interfere with that.

131
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:04,545
I'll suggest Mr. Ruddy open with a short
statement washing this whole thing off.

132
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:09,341
You, Max, better have answers for those
nuts that always come to the meetings.

133
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,844
Mr. Beale has been under great
professional and personal strain.

134
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,887
I've got surprises for you, too!

135
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:16,306
I've had it up to here
with your division...

136
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,059
and it's annual
$33 million deficit!

137
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,770
Keep your hands off
my News Division, Frank.

138
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:24,565
We're responsible to corporate level,
not you.

139
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,900
We'll goddamn well see about that.

140
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:30,445
All right, take it easy.
How do we get Beale out of here?

141
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:34,616
I understand there are reporters
and camera crews in the lobby.

142
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,618
We've got a limo at the freight exit.

143
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:40,998
Howard, you'll spend the night at my
place. There'll be press around yours.

144
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,885
I want Snowden here by noon...

145
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,053
have Lester
cover the CIA hearings...

146
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:57,389
and give the White House
to Doris.

147
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,766
You're late for your screening, Max.

148
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:02,144
Right. Okay.

149
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:08,442
If John Wheeler calls,
switch him to projection room 7.

150
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:14,198
- I'm sorry, Bill. This Beale business.
- It's all right. Sit down.

151
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,533
Diana asked if she could sit in on this.

152
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:19,161
Fine. How's it going?

153
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:22,915
You'll like this footage better than
the stuff I showed you last time.

154
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,668
Max Schumacher.

155
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:30,339
Goddamn it! When?

156
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:34,927
Did he say anything?

157
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:38,597
All right, thank you.

158
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:44,603
The Communist Party believes the most
pressing political necessity today...

159
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:47,940
is the consolidation
of the revolutionary...

160
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:50,108
radical and democratic movements...

161
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:54,821
Harry, Howard Beale left my house
20 minutes ago.

162
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:56,865
Has he come in yet?

163
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:58,867
Let me know when he arrives.

164
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:03,330
- That's Laureen Hobbs, isn't it?
- Yeah.

165
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,707
This is from a David Susskind thing
a while back.

166
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,418
I think we can use some of this stuff.

167
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:14,091
What we're going to see now
is something really sensational.

168
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,636
The Flagstaff Independent Bank
of Arizona was ripped off last week...

169
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,931
by a terrorist group called
the Ecumenical Liberation Army.

170
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:25,310
They themselves took movies of the
rip-off while they were ripping it off.

171
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:29,231
The Ecumenical Liberation Army is not
the one that kidnapped Patty Hearst?

172
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,775
No, that's the Symbionese
Liberation Army.

173
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:34,152
This is the Ecumenical
Liberation Army.

174
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:37,447
They're the ones who kidnapped
Mary Ann Gifford three weeks ago.

175
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:40,701
There's a lot of liberation armies
in the revolutionary underground...

176
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,703
and a lot of kidnapped heiresses.

177
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:44,705
This is Mary Ann Gifford.

178
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,752
That's the Great Ahmed Khan.
He's their leader.

179
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:56,258
They actually shot this film
while they were ripping off the bank?

180
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,385
Wait till you see it.

181
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:01,346
I don't know whether to edit
or leave it raw like this.

182
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:06,393
This is terrific stuff!
Where did you get it?

183
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,312
I got everything
through Laureen Hobbs.

184
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:11,190
She's my contact
for all this stuff.

185
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:21,033
- I've got Howard on the other line.
- Put him on.

186
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,827
I've got Max on four. Pick up.

187
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:27,498
I'd like another shot.

188
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:31,293
- Come on, Howard.
- I don't mean the whole show.

189
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:35,172
I'd like to come on,
make some brief farewell statement...

190
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:38,300
and then turn the show over
to Jack Snowden.

191
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:42,346
I have 11 years at this network.
I have some standing in the industry.

192
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,015
I just don't want to go out
like a clown.

193
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:49,228
It'll be simple, dignified.
You and Harry can check the copy.

194
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,688
I think it'll take the strain
off the show.

195
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:57,528
- What do you think?
- Well, okay.

196
00:12:57,611 --> 00:13:00,906
And no booze today, Howard!

197
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:02,407
No booze.

198
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:11,834
George, can you come into my office
for a minute?

199
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:22,052
Barbara, is Tommy around?
I'd like to see the two of you.

200
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:33,772
This is Bill Herron from our West Coast
Special Programs Department.

201
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:36,900
George Bosch. Barbara Schlesinger.
Tommy Pellegrino.

202
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:40,946
I just saw footage of a special Bill's
doing on the revolutionary underground.

203
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,657
Most of it's tedious stuff of
Laureen Hobbs and two fatigue jackets...

204
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,118
muttering mutilated Marxism...

205
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:50,330
but he's got eight minutes
of a bank robbery...

206
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:52,416
that is sensational!

207
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:56,628
Authentic stuff shot
while the robbery was going on.

208
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,006
Remember the Mary Ann Gifford
kidnapping?

209
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:02,926
It's that bunch of nuts. She's in
the movie shooting off machine guns.

210
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,304
This is really terrific footage.

211
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,891
We can get a movie of the week
out of it, maybe even a series.

212
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,394
A series?
What are we talking about?

213
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:16,982
We've got a bunch of hobgoblin radicals,
the Ecumenical Liberation Army...

214
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:20,235
who go around taking home movies
of themselves robbing banks.

215
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:23,780
Maybe they'll take movies of themselves
kidnapping heiresses...

216
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:25,824
hijacking 747 s...

217
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:28,035
bombing bridges,
assassinating ambassadors.

218
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:33,165
We'd open each week's segment
with their authentic footage...

219
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:36,835
hire writers to write a story behind
that footage, and we've got a series.

220
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:41,798
A series about a bunch
of bank-robbing guerrillas?

221
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,928
What will we call it,
the "Mao Tse-Tung Hour"?

222
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:47,554
Why not?

223
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:49,890
They've got "Strike Force,"
"Task Force," "SWAT."

224
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:53,101
Why not Che Guevara
and his own little "Mod Squad"?

225
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:57,731
I sent you all a concept analysis report
yesterday. Did any of you read it?

226
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,860
Well, in a nutshell it said...

227
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:03,987
"The American people
are turning sullen."

228
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:07,824
They've been clobbered on all sides
by Vietnam, Watergate, inflation.

229
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:11,119
They've turned off, shot up, fucked
themselves limp, and nothing helps.

230
00:15:11,203 --> 00:15:14,748
So this concept analysis report
concludes...

231
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:19,545
the American people want somebody
to articulate their rage for them.

232
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:25,050
I've told you since I took this job
six months ago that I want angry shows.

233
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:27,261
I don't want conventional programming.

234
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:30,013
I want counterculture.
I want antiestablishment.

235
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,062
I don't want to play butch boss
with you people...

236
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:39,189
but when I took over
this department...

237
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:41,859
it had the worst programming record
in television history.

238
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:44,736
This network hasn't one show
in the top 20.

239
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,864
This network is an industry joke.

240
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:50,242
We better start putting together
one winner for next September.

241
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:52,244
I want a show developed...

242
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:55,914
based on the activities
of a terrorist group.

243
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:58,375
"Joseph Stalin and His Merry Band
of Bolsheviks."

244
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,795
I want ideas from you.
That is what you're paid for.

245
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:05,632
By the way, the next time I send
an audience research report around...

246
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:08,135
you'd better read it,
or I'll sack the lot of you.

247
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:09,845
Is that clear?

248
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:15,601
I'll be on the coast in four weeks. Can
you set up a meeting with Laureen Hobbs?

249
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:19,271
The business of management
is management.

250
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:22,691
At the time CCA took control,
the UBS TV network was foundering...

251
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:26,278
with less than seven percent
of national television revenues...

252
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:29,239
most network programs being sold
at station rates.

253
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:32,910
I am pleased to announce I am submitting
to the board of directors a plan...

254
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:35,704
for the coordination
of the main profit centers...

255
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:38,749
and with the specific intention
of making each division...

256
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:41,627
more responsive to management.

257
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,128
Point one.

258
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:48,008
"The division producing the lowest rate
of return has been the News Division...

259
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:53,639
with its $98 million budget and its
average annual deficit of $32 million."

260
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:58,143
I know, historically, news divisions
are expected to lose money.

261
00:16:58,227 --> 00:17:01,063
To our minds, this philosophy
is a wanton fiscal affront...

262
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:04,816
to be resolutely resisted.

263
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:10,364
The new plan calls for local news to be
transferred to Owned Stations Divisions.

264
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:13,951
News Radio would be transferred to
the UBS Radio Division...

265
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:18,121
and the News Division would be reduced
from an independent division...

266
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:22,709
to a department accountable
to network.

267
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:31,093
- What was that all about, Ed?
- This is not the time.

268
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:33,095
Why wasn't I told about this?

269
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:37,474
Why was I led up onto that podium and
humiliated in front of the stockholders?

270
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:39,977
Goddamn it! I spoke to John Wheeler
this morning...

271
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,688
and he assured me
that the News Division was safe.

272
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,982
If you want me to resign,
that's a bad way to do it.

273
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:47,943
We'll talk about this tomorrow
at our regular morning meeting.

274
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,040
Roll VTA.

275
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:04,334
Bring it up on one.
Ready now.

276
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:09,173
In five, four, three, two...

277
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:11,425
- One.
- One TVA.

278
00:18:12,885 --> 00:18:14,303
And...

279
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:17,556
cue announcer.

280
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:19,600
The "UBS Evening News"...

281
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:22,853
with Howard Beale.

282
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,813
Ready two.

283
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:26,398
Two. Cue power.

284
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:30,527
Good evening.
Today is Wednesday, September 24...

285
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:32,529
and this is my last broadcast.

286
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,908
Yesterday I announced
on this program...

287
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:38,952
that I was going to commit
public suicide...

288
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:41,538
admittedly an act of madness.

289
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:44,750
I'll tell you what happened.
I just ran out of bullshit.

290
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,085
- Cut him off.
- Leave him on.

291
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:49,963
Am I still on?

292
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:53,133
If this is how he wants to go out,
this is how he goes out.

293
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:55,469
I just ran out of bullshit.

294
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:58,013
Mr. Schumacher's here.
Do you want to talk to him?

295
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:00,015
Bullshit is all the reasons
we give for living.

296
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:04,394
If we can't think up reasons of our own,
we always have the God bullshit.

297
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:06,313
- We don't know why we go through...
- What is it?

298
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,857
Pointless pain,
humiliation and decay.

299
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:12,861
There better be someone, somewhere
who does know. That's the God bullshit.

300
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:16,365
He's saying that life is bullshit.
It is. What are you screaming about?

301
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:19,868
Man is a noble creature who can order
his own world. Who needs God?

302
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:24,957
If there's anybody who can look around
this demented world we live in...

303
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:28,043
and tell me man
is a noble creature...

304
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:30,420
believe me,
that man is full of bullshit.

305
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:35,133
- What's so goddamn funny?
- I can't help it. It's funny.

306
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:39,847
This is going out live
to 67 affiliates.

307
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,348
Leave him on.

308
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:45,936
And I was married for 33 years
of shrill, shrieking fraud.

309
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:49,606
- Mr. Hackett's trying to reach you.
- Tell Mr. Hackett to go fuck himself.

310
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:52,651
So I don't have any bullshit left.

311
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:56,780
I just ran out of it, you see.

312
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:04,997
Mr. Ruddy, could we have
one statement, please?

313
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:07,166
Sorry, I don't have
all the information yet.

314
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:14,548
If we could just have one statement
about Mr. Beale.

315
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:26,018
Max?

316
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:36,737
I'll want to see Mr. Beale
after this.

317
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:41,867
The way I hear it,
you were primarily responsible...

318
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,286
for this colossally
stupid prank.

319
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:47,331
- Is that the fact?
- That's the fact.

320
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,958
It was unconscionable.

321
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:56,757
- There is nothing more to say.
- I have something to say.

322
00:20:57,925 --> 00:21:00,761
I want to know why that debasement
of the News Division...

323
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:04,473
announced at the meeting this afternoon
was kept secret from me?

324
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:08,060
You and I go back 20 years.

325
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:10,646
I took this job
with your personal assurance...

326
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:14,483
that you'd back my autonomy
against any encroachment.

327
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:19,279
But ever since CCA acquired control
of UBS Systems ten months ago...

328
00:21:19,363 --> 00:21:21,698
Hackett's been taking over everything.

329
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:25,953
Who is running this network?
You or some conglomerate called CCA?

330
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:28,831
You're president
of the Systems Group.

331
00:21:28,914 --> 00:21:32,459
Hackett's nothing
but a hatchet man for CCA.

332
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:35,212
Nelson here,
president of the network...

333
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:38,048
and he hasn't a damned thing to say
about anything anymore.

334
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:40,717
I told you
at the stockholders' meeting...

335
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:44,596
that we would discuss all that
at our regular meeting tomorrow morning.

336
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,015
If you had been patient,
I would have explained...

337
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:49,643
that I, too, thought
Frank Hackett precipitate...

338
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:52,604
and that the reorganization of the
News Division would not be executed...

339
00:21:52,688 --> 00:21:55,232
until everyone,
specifically you, Max...

340
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:58,235
had been consulted and satisfied.

341
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:01,113
Instead, you sulked off
like a child...

342
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:04,241
and engaged this network
in a shocking and disgraceful episode.

343
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:06,285
Your position
is no longer tenable...

344
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:08,704
regardless of how management
is restructured.

345
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:13,000
I will expect your resignation
at 10:00 tomorrow morning.

346
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:16,795
We will coordinate our statements
to the least detriment of everyone.

347
00:22:18,964 --> 00:22:22,426
Bob McDonough will take over the News
Division until we sort all this out.

348
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:27,306
I'd like to see Mr. Beale now.

349
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:30,142
They're looking for him.
They don't know where he is.

350
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:35,147
Well, every day, five days a week
for 15 years...

351
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:38,775
I've been sitting behind that desk,
the dispassionate pundit...

352
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:41,862
reporting with seemly detachment...

353
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:45,532
the daily parade of lunacies
that constitute the news.

354
00:22:45,616 --> 00:22:47,034
Just once...

355
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:49,119
I wanted to say
what I really felt.

356
00:22:49,203 --> 00:22:50,829
Knock it off.

357
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:52,748
It was, after all, my last one.

358
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:12,476
- Have the overnight ratings come in?
- They're on your desk.

359
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,478
Have you got
yesterday's overnights?

360
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:16,772
- Shall I bring them in?
- Yeah.

361
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:25,572
These are the outlines submitted
by Universal for an hour series.

362
00:23:25,656 --> 00:23:28,700
You needn't bother to read them.
I'll tell them to you.

363
00:23:28,784 --> 00:23:33,372
The first one is set in an eastern
law school, presumably Harvard.

364
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:36,583
The series is irresistibly entitled
"The New Lawyers."

365
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:40,045
The running characters are: A crusty
but benign ex-Supreme Court justice...

366
00:23:40,087 --> 00:23:43,549
presumably Oliver Wendell Holmes
by way of Dr. Zorba...

367
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:47,052
a beautiful girl graduate student,
and the local district attorney...

368
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:49,054
who is brilliant
and sometimes cuts corners.

369
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:51,014
Next one.

370
00:23:51,098 --> 00:23:53,058
The second one's called
"The Amazon Squad."

371
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:54,685
Lady cops.

372
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:57,604
Running characters include a crusty
but benign police lieutenant...

373
00:23:57,688 --> 00:23:59,982
who's always getting heat
from the commissioner...

374
00:24:00,065 --> 00:24:03,777
a tough, hard-drinking detective who
thinks women belong in the kitchen...

375
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:07,573
and a brilliant, beautiful young cop
who's fighting the feminist battle.

376
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:09,700
We're up to our ears in lady cops.

377
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:12,870
Next is another one of those
investigative reporter shows.

378
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:15,581
A crusty but benign managing editor
who's always getting...

379
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:17,749
You know, Barbara...

380
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:22,087
the Arabs have decided to jack up
the price of oil another 20 percent.

381
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:26,884
The CIA has been caught opening
Senator Humphrey's mail.

382
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:30,888
There's a civil war in Angola.
Another one in Beirut.

383
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:34,725
New York City's still facing default.

384
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:37,644
They finally caught up
with Patricia Hearst.

385
00:24:37,728 --> 00:24:41,440
And the whole front page
of the Daily News is Howard Beale.

386
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:46,528
There's also a two-column story
on page one of the Times.

387
00:24:49,323 --> 00:24:51,658
Helen?
Call Mr. Hackett's office.

388
00:24:51,742 --> 00:24:54,161
See if he can give me
a few minutes this morning.

389
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:05,130
KTNS Kansas City refuses to carry
our "Network News Show" anymore...

390
00:25:05,214 --> 00:25:07,174
unless Beale is taken off the air.

391
00:25:07,216 --> 00:25:09,343
Did you see the overnights
on the "Network News"?

392
00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:12,137
It has an 8 in New York,
a 9 in L. A...

393
00:25:12,221 --> 00:25:14,640
and a 27 share in both cities.

394
00:25:14,723 --> 00:25:17,935
Last night, Howard Beale went on the air
and yelled "bullshit" for two minutes.

395
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:22,231
I can tell you tonight's show
will get a 30 share at least.

396
00:25:22,314 --> 00:25:25,526
- I think we've lucked into something.
- For God sakes, Diana!

397
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:28,820
Are you suggesting we put that lunatic
back on the air yelling "bullshit"?

398
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:32,366
Yes, I think we should put Beale back
on the air tonight and keep him on.

399
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:35,244
Did you see the news this morning?
Did you see the Times?

400
00:25:35,327 --> 00:25:37,955
We got press coverage on this
you couldn't buy for a million dollars.

401
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:43,961
That show jumped 5 points in one night.
Tonight's show will be at least 15.

402
00:25:44,044 --> 00:25:48,590
We've just increased our audience by
20 or 30 million people in one night!

403
00:25:48,674 --> 00:25:51,426
You won't get something like this dumped
into your lap the rest of your days.

404
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:55,639
You can't piss it away. Howard said
last night what every American feels.

405
00:25:55,722 --> 00:26:00,769
He's tired of all the bullshit!
He's articulating the popular rage!

406
00:26:00,853 --> 00:26:02,855
I want that show, Frank.

407
00:26:02,938 --> 00:26:05,148
I can turn that show
into the biggest smash on TV.

408
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:08,193
It's a news show.
It's not your department.

409
00:26:08,277 --> 00:26:11,029
I see Howard Beale
as a latter-day prophet...

410
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:15,200
a messianic figure inveighing
against the hypocrisies of our times!

411
00:26:15,242 --> 00:26:17,828
A strip Savonarola
Monday through Friday...

412
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:20,247
that will just go through the roof!

413
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:24,293
And I'm talking about
a six-dollar cost per thousand show.

414
00:26:24,376 --> 00:26:27,421
I'm talking about
130,000 dollar minutes.

415
00:26:27,504 --> 00:26:31,258
Figure out the revenues of a strip show
that sells for $100,000 a minute!

416
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:35,095
One show like that could pull
this network out of the hole!

417
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:38,390
It's being handed to us on a plate.
Let's not blow it.

418
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:41,685
Yes.

419
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:43,937
Tell him I'll be a few minutes.

420
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:49,735
- Let me think it over.
- Let's not go to committee on this.

421
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:53,614
It's 10:20. We want Beale in the studio
by 6:30. We don't want to lose momentum.

422
00:26:53,697 --> 00:26:57,784
For God sakes, we're talking about
putting an irresponsible man...

423
00:26:57,868 --> 00:27:00,370
on national television.

424
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,883
I'd like to talk to Legal Affairs,
Herb Thackery...

425
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:15,552
and Joe Donnelly
in Standards and Practices.

426
00:27:17,221 --> 00:27:20,432
You know I'll be eyeball to eyeball
with Mr. Ruddy on this.

427
00:27:20,474 --> 00:27:23,685
If I'm going to the mat with Ruddy,
I want to be sure of my ground.

428
00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:25,979
My ass is going on the line.

429
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:31,318
I'll get back to you.

430
00:27:35,072 --> 00:27:37,074
I don't believe the top brass...

431
00:27:37,157 --> 00:27:41,203
of a national television network
is sitting around their Caesar salads...

432
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:43,622
Top brass of a bankrupt
national television network...

433
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:46,333
with projected losses
of $150 million.

434
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:47,835
I don't care!

435
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:53,215
You can't be seriously proposing,
and the rest of us considering...

436
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:55,801
putting on a pornographic
network news show.

437
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:58,136
- The FCC would kill us.
- Sit down, Nelson.

438
00:27:58,178 --> 00:28:01,139
The FCC can't do anything
except rap our knuckles.

439
00:28:01,223 --> 00:28:04,393
I don't even want to think about
the litigious possibilities.

440
00:28:04,476 --> 00:28:07,771
- We could be up to our ears in lawsuits.
- The affiliates won't carry it.

441
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:10,858
The affiliates will kiss your ass
if you can hand them a hit show.

442
00:28:10,941 --> 00:28:13,193
- But popular reaction...
- We don't know the popular reaction.

443
00:28:13,277 --> 00:28:16,488
- That's what we have to find out.
- The New York Times...

444
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:19,992
The New York Times doesn't advertise
on our network.

445
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:26,248
All I know is, this violates
every canon of respectable broadcasting.

446
00:28:26,331 --> 00:28:29,543
We're not a respectable network.
We're a whorehouse network.

447
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:31,795
We have to take whatever we can get.

448
00:28:33,213 --> 00:28:35,174
I don't want any part of it.

449
00:28:35,257 --> 00:28:37,718
I don't fancy myself
the president of a whorehouse.

450
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:40,596
That's commendable of you, Nelson.
Now sit down.

451
00:28:41,722 --> 00:28:43,682
Your indignation
has been duly recorded.

452
00:28:43,724 --> 00:28:45,684
You can always resign tomorrow.

453
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:51,857
What in substance are we proposing?

454
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:55,861
Merely to add editorial comment
to our network news show.

455
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:59,698
Brinkley, Sevareid, Reasoner
all have their comments.

456
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:01,867
Now Howard Beale will have his.

457
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:05,996
I think we ought to give it a shot,
see what happens tonight. Telephone.

458
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:09,541
I don't want to be the messenger
who has to tell Schumacher about this.

459
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:13,378
He doesn't work at this network anymore.
Mr. Ruddy fired him last night.

460
00:29:13,462 --> 00:29:16,423
Bob McDonough is running
the News Division now.

461
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:19,843
Bob McDonough in News, please.

462
00:29:21,345 --> 00:29:23,472
I don't know.

463
00:29:23,555 --> 00:29:26,016
I may teach or write a book...

464
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:30,187
whatever the hell one does when one
approaches the autumn of one's years.

465
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:34,900
My God! Is that me?

466
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:38,195
Was I ever that young?

467
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:40,697
No, Howard brought in a picture
of Ed Murrow...

468
00:29:40,781 --> 00:29:43,242
and the CBS gang
when we were there.

469
00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:44,868
You wouldn't believe it!

470
00:29:44,952 --> 00:29:47,079
Walter Cronkite, Harry Reasoner...

471
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,164
Hollenbeck, Bob Trout.

472
00:29:49,248 --> 00:29:51,166
Is that you?

473
00:29:52,334 --> 00:29:56,088
Yeah. Okay, Dick,
we'll be in touch.

474
00:29:56,171 --> 00:30:00,592
Remember this kid you sent to interview
Cleveland Amory on vivisection?

475
00:30:04,304 --> 00:30:06,557
What's so funny?

476
00:30:09,142 --> 00:30:12,688
I jump out of bed in my pajamas,
I grab my raincoat, I run downstairs.

477
00:30:12,771 --> 00:30:15,399
I run out to the street
and hail a cab.

478
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:20,487
I yell at the driver, "Take me to the
middle of the George Washington Bridge."

479
00:30:22,614 --> 00:30:26,285
And the driver says,
"Don't do it, buddy. Don't do it!

480
00:30:26,368 --> 00:30:28,871
You're young. You've got
your whole life ahead of you."

481
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,166
Wait a minute.

482
00:30:32,249 --> 00:30:36,753
If you think that's funny,
wait till you hear this.

483
00:30:36,837 --> 00:30:38,797
I've come from Hackett's office.

484
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:41,633
He wants to put Howard
back on the air tonight.

485
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:44,761
Apparently the ratings went up
five points last night...

486
00:30:44,845 --> 00:30:48,140
and he wants Howard to go back on
and do his "angry man" thing.

487
00:30:48,182 --> 00:30:50,309
What are you talking about?

488
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:53,437
They want Howard to go back on
and yell "bullshit."

489
00:30:56,023 --> 00:30:57,983
They want Howard to go on...

490
00:30:58,025 --> 00:31:00,027
spontaneously letting out
his anger.

491
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:03,071
A latter-day prophet
denouncing the hypocrisies of our times.

492
00:31:03,155 --> 00:31:05,365
That sounds pretty good!

493
00:31:06,283 --> 00:31:07,701
Who's "they"?

494
00:31:07,784 --> 00:31:10,454
Hackett. Chaney was there.

495
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:13,665
The Legal Affairs guy.
Oh, and that girl from programming.

496
00:31:13,707 --> 00:31:16,168
Christensen?
What's she got to do with this?

497
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:19,004
- Are you kidding?
- I'm not kidding.

498
00:31:19,046 --> 00:31:22,799
I said, "We're running
a news department here, not a circus.

499
00:31:22,883 --> 00:31:25,427
And Howard Beale's
not a bearded lady.

500
00:31:25,511 --> 00:31:28,138
If you think I'll go along with
this bastardization of the news...

501
00:31:28,222 --> 00:31:31,642
you can have my resignation
along with Max Schumacher's.

502
00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:37,523
- I'm speaking for Howard Beale and..."
- That's my job you're turning down.

503
00:31:37,606 --> 00:31:40,442
I'd go nuts
without some kind of work.

504
00:31:40,526 --> 00:31:44,530
What's wrong with being an angry prophet
denouncing the hypocrisies of our times?

505
00:31:44,613 --> 00:31:46,323
What do you think, Max?

506
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:50,619
Do you want to be an angry prophet
denouncing the hypocrisies of our times?

507
00:31:50,702 --> 00:31:55,165
Yeah, I'd like to be an angry prophet
denouncing the hypocrisies of our times.

508
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:58,460
Then grab it!

509
00:32:04,925 --> 00:32:06,885
- Afternoon, Mr. Ruddy.
- Afternoon.

510
00:32:06,927 --> 00:32:08,887
Good afternoon, Mr. Ruddy.

511
00:32:12,015 --> 00:32:14,351
- He's waiting for you.
- Thank you.

512
00:32:20,649 --> 00:32:24,027
Nelson Chaney tells me Beale
may actually go on the air this evening.

513
00:32:25,821 --> 00:32:28,157
As far as I know,
Howard's going to do it.

514
00:32:30,784 --> 00:32:33,495
- Are you gonna sit still for this?
- Yes.

515
00:32:33,579 --> 00:32:36,290
I think Hackett's overstepped himself.

516
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:38,917
There's some kind of
corporate maneuvering going on.

517
00:32:39,001 --> 00:32:41,545
Hackett is clearly forcing
a confrontation.

518
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:43,797
That would account for his behavior
at the stockholders' meeting.

519
00:32:43,881 --> 00:32:48,468
However, I think he's making a serious
mistake with this Beale business.

520
00:32:48,552 --> 00:32:51,680
I suspect CCA will be upset...

521
00:32:51,763 --> 00:32:53,724
at Hackett's presumptuousness.

522
00:32:53,807 --> 00:32:55,934
Certainly Mr. Jensen will.

523
00:32:56,018 --> 00:32:59,563
So I'm going to let Hackett
have his head for a while.

524
00:32:59,646 --> 00:33:02,316
He just might lose it
over this Beale business.

525
00:33:06,528 --> 00:33:09,323
I'd like you to reconsider
your resignation.

526
00:33:09,406 --> 00:33:11,909
I assume Hackett
wouldn't take such steps...

527
00:33:11,992 --> 00:33:14,286
without some support
on the CCA board.

528
00:33:14,328 --> 00:33:17,206
I'll have to go directly to Mr. Jensen.

529
00:33:17,289 --> 00:33:20,501
When that happens, I'm going to need
every friend I've got...

530
00:33:20,584 --> 00:33:24,296
and I don't want Hackett's people
in all the divisional positions.

531
00:33:24,338 --> 00:33:26,548
So I'd like you to stay on.

532
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:32,513
Of course.

533
00:33:34,223 --> 00:33:36,975
Thank you, Max.

534
00:33:37,017 --> 00:33:39,478
This has been
the "UBS Evening News"...

535
00:33:39,561 --> 00:33:41,980
with Howard Beale.

536
00:33:42,064 --> 00:33:44,691
The initial response to the new
"Howard Beale Show"...

537
00:33:44,775 --> 00:33:46,818
was not auspicatory.

538
00:33:46,902 --> 00:33:48,946
The press was,
without exception, hostile...

539
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:51,198
and industry reaction negative.

540
00:33:51,281 --> 00:33:53,617
The ratings for the Thursday
and Friday shows...

541
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,203
were both 14,
but Monday's rating dropped a point...

542
00:33:56,286 --> 00:33:59,540
clearly suggesting the novelty
was wearing off.

543
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:03,544
Did you know there are
a number of psychics...

544
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:06,547
working as licensed brokers
on Wall Street?

545
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:09,049
Some counsel their clients
by use of tarot cards.

546
00:34:09,132 --> 00:34:12,845
They're all pretty successful,
even in a bear market and selling short.

547
00:34:12,928 --> 00:34:16,515
I met one of them last week
and thought of doing a show around her.

548
00:34:16,598 --> 00:34:19,226
"The Wayward Witch of Wall Street."
Something like that.

549
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:21,812
But if her tips were any good,
she could wreck the market.

550
00:34:21,895 --> 00:34:27,442
I called her this morning and asked her
how she was on predicting the future.

551
00:34:27,526 --> 00:34:30,195
She said she was
occasionally prescient.

552
00:34:30,279 --> 00:34:34,908
"For example," she said,
"I just had a vision of you...

553
00:34:34,992 --> 00:34:37,995
sitting in an office
with a craggy, middle-aged man...

554
00:34:38,078 --> 00:34:41,498
with whom you are
or will be emotionally involved."

555
00:34:41,582 --> 00:34:43,167
And here I am.

556
00:34:45,627 --> 00:34:48,172
She does all this with tarot cards?

557
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:51,133
This one operates
on parapsychology.

558
00:34:51,216 --> 00:34:55,512
She has trance-like episodes
and feels things in her energy field.

559
00:34:56,471 --> 00:35:00,184
- This lady could be very useful to you.
- In what way?

560
00:35:00,225 --> 00:35:02,853
You put on a news show.

561
00:35:02,936 --> 00:35:06,148
And here's somebody who can predict
tomorrow's news for you.

562
00:35:06,231 --> 00:35:08,567
Her name, aptly enough, is Sibyl.

563
00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:10,569
Sibyl the Soothsayer.

564
00:35:10,611 --> 00:35:13,197
You could give her
two minutes of trance...

565
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,908
at the end of the "Howard Beale Show,"
say once a week, Friday...

566
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:18,410
which is suggestively occult,
and she could oraculate.

567
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:22,581
Then next week everyone tunes in to see
how good her predictions were.

568
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:25,709
Maybe she could do the weather.

569
00:35:28,045 --> 00:35:31,006
Your "Network News Show" will need help
if it's going to hold.

570
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:33,550
Beale doesn't do the "angry man" thing
well at all.

571
00:35:33,634 --> 00:35:35,677
He's too kvetchy.
He's being irascible.

572
00:35:35,761 --> 00:35:38,931
We want a prophet, not a curmudgeon.
He should do more apocalyptic doom.

573
00:35:38,972 --> 00:35:42,809
I think you should have some writers
write some jeremiads for him.

574
00:35:44,186 --> 00:35:46,438
I see you don't fancy my suggestions.

575
00:35:48,649 --> 00:35:50,484
You're not serious?

576
00:35:50,567 --> 00:35:52,277
I'm serious.

577
00:35:53,821 --> 00:35:56,323
The fact is, I could make
your Beale show...

578
00:35:56,406 --> 00:36:00,369
the highest-rated news show in TV
if you'd let me have a crack at it.

579
00:36:01,328 --> 00:36:03,580
What do you mean,
"have a crack at it"?

580
00:36:03,664 --> 00:36:05,499
I'd like to program it for you.

581
00:36:05,582 --> 00:36:07,167
Develop it.

582
00:36:07,251 --> 00:36:11,964
I wouldn't interfere with
the news itself, but TV is show biz...

583
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:15,968
and even the news has to have
a little showmanship.

584
00:36:16,009 --> 00:36:18,303
My God, you are serious.

585
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:22,516
I watched your six o'clock news today.
It's straight tabloid.

586
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:26,103
You had a minute and a half of that lady
riding naked in Central Park...

587
00:36:26,186 --> 00:36:29,273
but you had less than a minute
of hard national and international news.

588
00:36:29,356 --> 00:36:32,067
It was all sex, scandal,
brutal crime, sports...

589
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:35,487
children with incurable diseases
and lost puppies.

590
00:36:35,529 --> 00:36:38,949
So I won't listen to protestations
of high standards of journalism...

591
00:36:39,032 --> 00:36:41,869
when you're on the streets, soliciting
audiences like the rest of us.

592
00:36:41,952 --> 00:36:45,956
All I'm saying is, if you're going
to hustle, at least do it right.

593
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:49,126
I'm going to bring this up at tomorrow's
meeting, but I don't like hassles.

594
00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:52,588
I was hoping we could work this out
between us. That's why I'm here.

595
00:36:54,131 --> 00:36:57,509
And I was hoping you were looking for
an emotional involvement...

596
00:36:57,551 --> 00:36:59,761
with a craggy, middle-aged man.

597
00:37:01,305 --> 00:37:03,307
I wouldn't rule that out entirely.

598
00:37:06,727 --> 00:37:09,062
All right, Diana...

599
00:37:09,146 --> 00:37:12,858
bring up all your ideas at the meeting,
because if you don't, I will.

600
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:16,862
I think Howard's making
a goddamn fool of himself...

601
00:37:16,904 --> 00:37:21,033
and so does everybody that Howard
and I know in this industry.

602
00:37:21,116 --> 00:37:23,494
It was a fluke.
Didn't work.

603
00:37:24,745 --> 00:37:27,831
So tomorrow, Howard goes back
to the old format...

604
00:37:27,915 --> 00:37:31,793
and all of this gutter depravity
comes to an end.

605
00:37:43,472 --> 00:37:45,349
I don't get it.

606
00:37:46,808 --> 00:37:49,811
You hung around until 7:30
and then came down here...

607
00:37:49,895 --> 00:37:52,814
just to pitch a couple
of loony show-biz ideas...

608
00:37:52,898 --> 00:37:56,777
when you knew goddamn well
I'd laugh you right out of the office.

609
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:59,238
I don't get it.

610
00:37:59,321 --> 00:38:02,157
What's your scam in this?

611
00:38:02,241 --> 00:38:07,621
My visit here tonight was a gesture made
out of your stature in the industry...

612
00:38:08,956 --> 00:38:11,625
and because I personally admired you
since I was a kid...

613
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:14,211
majoring in speech
at the University of Missouri.

614
00:38:15,504 --> 00:38:19,258
Sooner or later, with or without you,
I'm going to take over your news show.

615
00:38:19,341 --> 00:38:21,885
I figured I might as well start tonight.

616
00:38:23,136 --> 00:38:25,848
I think I once gave a lecture...

617
00:38:25,931 --> 00:38:29,184
at the University of Missouri.

618
00:38:29,268 --> 00:38:33,939
I was in the audience. I had
a schoolgirl crush on you for months.

619
00:38:35,566 --> 00:38:38,944
If we could get back for a moment
to that gypsy who predicted...

620
00:38:38,986 --> 00:38:43,240
all that about emotional involvements
and middle-aged men...

621
00:38:44,449 --> 00:38:46,869
what are you doing
for dinner tonight?

622
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,881
I can't make it tonight.
Call me tomorrow.

623
00:39:01,383 --> 00:39:04,553
- Do you have a favorite restaurant?
- I eat anything.

624
00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:08,140
I get a feeling I'm being made.

625
00:39:08,182 --> 00:39:09,641
You are.

626
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:13,979
I've got to warn you.
I don't do anything on my first date.

627
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:15,480
We'll see.

628
00:39:21,487 --> 00:39:23,739
Schmuck, what are you getting into?

629
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:49,264
I was married for four years
and pretended to be happy.

630
00:39:49,348 --> 00:39:51,975
I had six years of analysis
and pretended to be sane.

631
00:39:53,769 --> 00:39:56,438
My husband ran off
with his boyfriend...

632
00:39:56,522 --> 00:40:01,109
and I had an affair with my analyst who
told me I was the worst lay he ever had.

633
00:40:02,402 --> 00:40:05,280
I can't tell you how many men
have told me what a lousy lay I am.

634
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:08,575
I apparently have
a masculine temperament.

635
00:40:08,659 --> 00:40:12,538
I arouse quickly,
consummate prematurely...

636
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:15,666
and I can't wait to get my clothes
back on and get out of that bedroom.

637
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:20,838
I seem to be inept at everything
except my work.

638
00:40:21,713 --> 00:40:23,966
I'm good at my work.

639
00:40:24,049 --> 00:40:26,593
So I confine myself to that.

640
00:40:26,677 --> 00:40:30,138
All I want out of life
is a 30 share and a 20 rating.

641
00:40:31,723 --> 00:40:33,851
You're married, surely?

642
00:40:35,435 --> 00:40:36,854
Twenty-five years.

643
00:40:37,896 --> 00:40:41,191
I have a married daughter in Seattle
who's six months pregnant...

644
00:40:41,275 --> 00:40:46,405
and a younger girl who's starting
at Northwestern in January.

645
00:40:49,283 --> 00:40:51,201
Well, Max, here we are.

646
00:40:53,287 --> 00:40:56,039
Middle-aged man reaffirming
his middle-aged manhood...

647
00:40:56,123 --> 00:40:59,084
and a terrified young woman
with a father complex.

648
00:40:59,168 --> 00:41:01,670
What sort of script
can we make out of this?

649
00:41:03,755 --> 00:41:08,135
Corridor gossip says that you're
Frank Hackett's backstage girl.

650
00:41:09,178 --> 00:41:10,596
I'm not.

651
00:41:12,306 --> 00:41:15,642
Frank's a corporation man,
body and soul.

652
00:41:15,726 --> 00:41:17,728
He has no loves, lusts
or allegiances...

653
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:21,231
that are not consummately directed
toward becoming a CCA board member.

654
00:41:21,315 --> 00:41:24,151
Why should he bother with me?
I'm not even a stockholder.

655
00:41:26,028 --> 00:41:30,282
What about your loves,
lusts and allegiances?

656
00:41:30,365 --> 00:41:32,534
Is your wife in town?

657
00:41:32,618 --> 00:41:34,036
Yes.

658
00:41:35,329 --> 00:41:37,789
Then we better go to my place.

659
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:42,127
I can't hear you.
You'll have to talk a little louder.

660
00:41:48,842 --> 00:41:51,887
Yes, I hear you.

661
00:41:55,474 --> 00:41:56,892
Yes.

662
00:41:59,686 --> 00:42:01,146
Yes.

663
00:42:07,069 --> 00:42:08,529
Why me?

664
00:42:10,489 --> 00:42:12,699
I said, "Why me?"

665
00:42:33,053 --> 00:42:35,013
Howard in his office?

666
00:42:36,181 --> 00:42:41,228
I'm killing this whole screwball
"angry prophet" thing.

667
00:42:41,311 --> 00:42:43,522
Tonight we go back to straight news.

668
00:42:50,404 --> 00:42:53,991
Yeah? Max, I'm telling you he's fine.

669
00:42:54,032 --> 00:42:57,119
He's been sharp all day.
He's been as funny as hell.

670
00:42:57,202 --> 00:42:59,413
Had everybody cracking up
at the rundown meeting.

671
00:42:59,496 --> 00:43:01,498
I told him!

672
00:43:02,291 --> 00:43:03,709
Cue VTA.

673
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:05,919
Ready two.

674
00:43:08,213 --> 00:43:11,508
- Cue announcer.
- The "UBS Evening News"...

675
00:43:11,592 --> 00:43:13,594
with Howard Beale.

676
00:43:14,595 --> 00:43:18,432
Last night I was awakened
from a fitful sleep...

677
00:43:18,515 --> 00:43:21,185
shortly after 2:00 in the morning...

678
00:43:21,226 --> 00:43:24,313
by a shrill, sibilant,
faceless voice.

679
00:43:24,396 --> 00:43:28,025
I couldn't make it out at first
in the dark bedroom.

680
00:43:29,568 --> 00:43:32,196
I said, "I'm sorry.
You'll have to talk a little louder."

681
00:43:32,237 --> 00:43:35,949
- What do you want me to do?
- Nothing.

682
00:43:36,033 --> 00:43:39,328
The voice said to me,
"I want you to tell the truth.

683
00:43:39,411 --> 00:43:42,247
Not easy to do, because the people
don't want to know the truth."

684
00:43:42,331 --> 00:43:45,083
I said, "You're kidding?

685
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:47,085
What should I know about the truth?"

686
00:43:47,127 --> 00:43:51,715
But the voice said to me,
"Don't worry about the truth."

687
00:43:51,757 --> 00:43:53,759
I will put the words in your mouth."

688
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:56,762
I said,
"Is this the burning bush?

689
00:43:56,803 --> 00:43:58,263
I'm not Moses."

690
00:43:58,305 --> 00:44:01,600
The voice said, "I'm not God.
What has that got to do with it?"

691
00:44:01,642 --> 00:44:06,021
The voice said, "We're not talking
about eternal, absolute truth.

692
00:44:06,104 --> 00:44:08,816
We're talking about impermanent,
transient, human truth!

693
00:44:08,899 --> 00:44:11,777
I don't expect people
to be capable of truth...

694
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:14,404
but at least you're capable
of self-preservation."

695
00:44:15,489 --> 00:44:19,243
I said, "Why me?"

696
00:44:19,284 --> 00:44:22,037
The voice said, "Because you're
on television, dummy."

697
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,331
Beautiful.

698
00:44:24,414 --> 00:44:27,543
"Forty million Americans listen to you,
and after the show, maybe 50 million.

699
00:44:27,626 --> 00:44:31,839
I'm not asking you to walk the land
in sackcloth preaching the Armageddon.

700
00:44:31,922 --> 00:44:33,340
You're on TV."

701
00:44:34,091 --> 00:44:36,343
I thought about it for a moment.

702
00:44:37,803 --> 00:44:40,305
Then I said, "Okay."

703
00:45:00,951 --> 00:45:02,870
Close the door, Harry.

704
00:45:06,331 --> 00:45:09,209
Howard, I'm taking you off the air.

705
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:13,672
I think you're having a breakdown,
require treatment.

706
00:45:16,091 --> 00:45:19,344
This is not a psychotic episode.

707
00:45:19,386 --> 00:45:22,055
This is a cleansing moment of clarity.

708
00:45:26,435 --> 00:45:27,895
I'm imbued.

709
00:45:29,188 --> 00:45:33,275
I'm imbued with some special spirit.
It's not a religious feeling at all.

710
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:36,987
It's a shocking eruption
of great electrical energy.

711
00:45:37,029 --> 00:45:39,490
I feel vivid and flashing...

712
00:45:39,531 --> 00:45:44,703
as if suddenly I'd been plugged
into a great electromagnetic field.

713
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:49,291
I feel connected to all living things.

714
00:45:49,374 --> 00:45:52,503
To flowers, birds...

715
00:45:53,629 --> 00:45:55,631
all the animals of the world...

716
00:45:57,424 --> 00:46:02,888
and even to some great,
unseen living force...

717
00:46:02,971 --> 00:46:05,724
what I think the Hindus
call "prana."

718
00:46:06,975 --> 00:46:09,186
But it's not a breakdown.

719
00:46:09,228 --> 00:46:11,980
I've never felt more orderly
in my life.

720
00:46:12,064 --> 00:46:16,276
It is a shattering
and beautiful sensation.

721
00:46:17,152 --> 00:46:20,906
It is the exalted flow
of the space-time continuum...

722
00:46:20,989 --> 00:46:24,243
save that it is spaceless
and timeless...

723
00:46:25,661 --> 00:46:27,579
and such loveliness.

724
00:46:29,081 --> 00:46:34,545
I feel on the verge
of some great ultimate truth.

725
00:46:39,424 --> 00:46:44,763
And you will not take me off the air
for now or any other spaceless time!

726
00:46:51,979 --> 00:46:54,148
- Is he okay?
- He's just fainted.

727
00:46:54,231 --> 00:46:57,234
I better get him back to my house
again tonight.

728
00:46:57,317 --> 00:46:59,403
Help me get him up.

729
00:47:20,132 --> 00:47:22,092
This is crazy.

730
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:26,930
The whole place has gone crazy.
They just seem to hassle me.

731
00:48:47,302 --> 00:48:50,264
Wake up, Max,
because Howard's gone.

732
00:48:51,431 --> 00:48:54,518
I'll make you some coffee.

733
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,687
You don't know where he is?
The son of a bitch is a hit!

734
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:59,398
Goddamn it!
Over 2,000 phone calls!

735
00:48:59,481 --> 00:49:03,902
In the mail room, over 14,000 telegrams!
The response is sensational!

736
00:49:03,944 --> 00:49:06,196
Tell him.
Herb's phone hasn't stopped ringing.

737
00:49:06,238 --> 00:49:11,577
Every affiliate from Albuquerque
to Sandusky! Response is sensational!

738
00:49:11,618 --> 00:49:13,996
Yes. All right.

739
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:16,373
For you, Herb.
Go to your office.

740
00:49:16,415 --> 00:49:19,877
Moldanian called me. Joe Donnelly
called me. We've got a goddamn hit!

741
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:24,089
Show him the Times. We even got
an editorial in the New York Times.

742
00:49:24,173 --> 00:49:26,425
- "A Call to Morality."
- I don't know where he is.

743
00:49:26,466 --> 00:49:29,511
That crazy Beale has caught on. Don't
tell me you don't know where he is.

744
00:49:29,595 --> 00:49:32,181
He could be jumping off a roof
for all I know!

745
00:49:32,264 --> 00:49:35,684
The man is insane!
He's not responsible for himself!

746
00:49:35,767 --> 00:49:37,728
He needs care and treatment.

747
00:49:37,811 --> 00:49:42,024
All you grave robbers think about
is that he's a hit.

748
00:49:42,107 --> 00:49:44,651
It's just possible
that he isn't insane...

749
00:49:44,735 --> 00:49:47,905
that he is, in fact,
imbued with some special spirit.

750
00:49:47,946 --> 00:49:51,533
I'm supposed to be the romantic!
You're the hard-bitten realist!

751
00:49:51,617 --> 00:49:54,661
All right. Howard Beale
obviously fills a void.

752
00:49:54,745 --> 00:49:56,705
The audience
obviously wants a prophet...

753
00:49:56,788 --> 00:49:59,625
even a manufactured one...
even if he's as mad as Moses.

754
00:49:59,666 --> 00:50:02,336
By tomorrow he'll have a 50 share,
maybe a 60.

755
00:50:02,419 --> 00:50:04,379
Howard Beale
is processed instant God.

756
00:50:04,463 --> 00:50:07,257
It looks like he may go over bigger
than Mary Tyler Moore.

757
00:50:07,299 --> 00:50:10,093
I am not putting Howard
back on the air!

758
00:50:10,135 --> 00:50:12,137
It's not your show anymore.
It's mine.

759
00:50:15,182 --> 00:50:16,767
I gave her the show.

760
00:50:16,808 --> 00:50:20,020
I'm putting the "Network News Show"
under programming.

761
00:50:20,103 --> 00:50:23,232
Mr. Ruddy had a heart attack
and is not taking calls.

762
00:50:23,315 --> 00:50:26,276
In his absence,
I'm making all network decisions...

763
00:50:26,318 --> 00:50:29,947
including one I've been wanting to make
a long time: You're fired.

764
00:50:30,739 --> 00:50:32,658
I want you out of this building
by noon.

765
00:50:32,741 --> 00:50:36,036
I'll call security and have you
thrown out if you're still here.

766
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:41,291
Well, let's say
fuck you, Hackett.

767
00:50:41,333 --> 00:50:43,418
You want me out of here...

768
00:50:43,502 --> 00:50:47,381
you'll have to drag me and the whole
News Division out kicking and screaming.

769
00:50:47,464 --> 00:50:50,133
You think they'll quit their jobs
for you? Not in this recession.

770
00:50:50,175 --> 00:50:52,135
Ruddy will have your ass.

771
00:50:52,177 --> 00:50:55,681
I got a hit!
Ruddy doesn't count anymore!

772
00:50:55,764 --> 00:50:58,642
He was hoping I'd fall on my face
with this Beale show, but I didn't.

773
00:50:58,684 --> 00:51:01,687
It's a big, fat, big-titted hit...

774
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:03,939
and I don't have to waffle around
with Ruddy anymore.

775
00:51:04,022 --> 00:51:06,316
If he wants to take me before
the CCA board, let him.

776
00:51:06,358 --> 00:51:09,278
Do you think Ruddy is stupid enough
to go to the CCA board and say...

777
00:51:09,361 --> 00:51:11,655
"I'm taking our one hit show
off the air."

778
00:51:11,697 --> 00:51:16,493
Come November 14, I'll be at the annual
CCA Management Review Meeting...

779
00:51:16,535 --> 00:51:19,037
and I'll announce projected earnings
for this network...

780
00:51:19,121 --> 00:51:21,290
for the first time in five years!

781
00:51:21,373 --> 00:51:25,419
Believe me, Mr. Jensen will be
sitting there, rocking back and forth...

782
00:51:25,502 --> 00:51:29,965
and he'll say, "That's very good, Frank.
Keep it up."

783
00:51:30,048 --> 00:51:33,510
So don't have illusions about who's
running this network. You're fired.

784
00:51:33,594 --> 00:51:37,306
I want you out of your office before
noon, or I'll have you thrown out.

785
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,145
You go along with this?

786
00:51:44,521 --> 00:51:46,982
I told you I didn't want
a network hassle.

787
00:51:47,065 --> 00:51:50,652
I told you I'd much rather
work the Beale show out between us.

788
00:51:52,571 --> 00:51:54,907
Well, let's just say
fuck you, too, honey.

789
00:51:56,742 --> 00:51:59,077
Howard Beale may be my best friend.
I'll go to court.

790
00:51:59,161 --> 00:52:02,289
I'll put him in a hospital before I let
you exploit him like a carnival freak.

791
00:52:02,372 --> 00:52:04,208
You get your psychiatrist.
I'll get mine.

792
00:52:04,249 --> 00:52:07,711
I'm gonna spread this reeking business
in every newspaper...

793
00:52:07,753 --> 00:52:10,631
on every network, group and affiliate
in this country!

794
00:52:10,714 --> 00:52:12,883
I'm gonna make
a lot of noise about this!

795
00:52:12,925 --> 00:52:15,260
We need all the press we can get!

796
00:52:18,138 --> 00:52:20,224
Something going on
between you and Schumacher?

797
00:52:21,767 --> 00:52:23,393
Not anymore.

798
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:44,122
- How do you do, Mr. Beale?
- I must make my witness.

799
00:52:44,206 --> 00:52:46,291
Sure thing, Mr. Beale.

800
00:52:49,837 --> 00:52:52,548
Oil ministers of the OPEC nations
meeting in Vienna...

801
00:52:52,631 --> 00:52:57,010
still haven't decided how much
to increase the price of oil.

802
00:52:57,094 --> 00:53:00,222
Yeah? He came in the building
five minutes ago.

803
00:53:00,305 --> 00:53:03,058
Tell Snowden when he comes in
to let him go on.

804
00:53:03,141 --> 00:53:05,060
Did you get that, Paul?

805
00:53:06,311 --> 00:53:10,524
More on that story
from Edward Fletcher in Vienna.

806
00:53:10,607 --> 00:53:14,444
This has been the most divisive meeting
the oil states have ever had.

807
00:53:17,322 --> 00:53:19,867
The 13 nations of OPEC
have still not...

808
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:23,078
been able to decide by how much
to increase the price of oil.

809
00:53:24,746 --> 00:53:26,707
How much time we got?

810
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,960
We've got five seconds.
Hurry up.

811
00:53:34,464 --> 00:53:36,341
Take two. Cue Howard.

812
00:53:36,425 --> 00:53:39,970
I don't have to tell you things are bad.
Everybody knows things are bad.

813
00:53:40,012 --> 00:53:41,972
It's a depression.

814
00:53:42,014 --> 00:53:46,351
Everybody's out of work
or scared of losing their job.

815
00:53:46,393 --> 00:53:49,396
The dollar buys a nickel's worth.
Banks are going bust.

816
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:53,567
Shopkeepers keep guns under the counter.
Punks are running wild in the street.

817
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:56,445
Nobody anywhere seems to know
what to do, and there's no end to it.

818
00:53:57,863 --> 00:54:02,576
We know the air is unfit to breathe
and our food is unfit to eat.

819
00:54:02,659 --> 00:54:05,871
We sit watching our TVs
while some newscaster tells us...

820
00:54:05,954 --> 00:54:09,541
that today we had 15 homicides
and 63 violent crimes...

821
00:54:09,625 --> 00:54:11,543
as if that's the way
it's supposed to be!

822
00:54:11,627 --> 00:54:15,005
We know things are bad.
Worse than bad. They're crazy.

823
00:54:15,047 --> 00:54:18,383
Everything everywhere is going crazy,
so we don't go out anymore.

824
00:54:18,467 --> 00:54:21,887
We sit in the house. Slowly the world
we're living in is getting smaller.

825
00:54:21,929 --> 00:54:25,390
All we say is, "Please. At least
leave us alone in our living rooms.

826
00:54:25,432 --> 00:54:28,894
Let me have my toaster, my TV
my steel-belted radials.

827
00:54:28,977 --> 00:54:31,021
I won't say anything
Just leave us alone."

828
00:54:31,104 --> 00:54:34,608
I'm not gonna leave you alone.
I want you to get mad!

829
00:54:35,692 --> 00:54:38,195
I don't want you to protest or riot.

830
00:54:38,278 --> 00:54:40,864
Don't write to your congressman.
I don't know what to tell you to write.

831
00:54:40,948 --> 00:54:43,492
I don't know what to do
about depression, inflation...

832
00:54:43,575 --> 00:54:45,536
the Russians,
the crime in the streets.

833
00:54:45,619 --> 00:54:48,580
All I know is that first
you've got to get mad!

834
00:54:48,664 --> 00:54:51,708
You've got to say,
"I'm a human being, goddamn it!

835
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:53,794
My life has value!"

836
00:54:56,421 --> 00:55:00,884
So, I want you to get up now.

837
00:55:00,968 --> 00:55:04,346
I want all of you to get up
out of your chairs.

838
00:55:04,429 --> 00:55:07,766
I want you to get up now
and go to the window...

839
00:55:07,808 --> 00:55:11,103
open it,
stick your head out and yell...

840
00:55:11,145 --> 00:55:15,691
"I'm as mad as hell, and I'm
not gonna take this anymore!"

841
00:55:15,774 --> 00:55:17,693
I want you to get up right now.

842
00:55:17,776 --> 00:55:20,404
- Stay with him.
- Sit up! Go to your windows.

843
00:55:20,445 --> 00:55:22,739
Open them,
stick your head out and yell...

844
00:55:22,781 --> 00:55:25,909
"I'm as mad as hell, and I'm
not gonna take this anymore!"

845
00:55:26,952 --> 00:55:29,371
- How many stations does it go out live?
- Sixty-seven.

846
00:55:31,665 --> 00:55:33,625
"I'm not gonna take this anymore."

847
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:37,462
Then we'll figure out what to do
about the depression and the oil crisis.

848
00:55:37,504 --> 00:55:39,381
First, get out of your chairs...

849
00:55:39,464 --> 00:55:43,010
open the window,
stick your head out and yell...

850
00:55:43,093 --> 00:55:45,220
"I'm as mad as hell...

851
00:55:45,304 --> 00:55:47,639
and I'm not gonna
take this anymore!"

852
00:55:47,681 --> 00:55:49,892
- Who are you talking to?
- Atlanta.

853
00:55:49,975 --> 00:55:52,728
Are they yelling in Atlanta?

854
00:55:52,811 --> 00:55:54,771
But first you've gotta get mad.

855
00:55:54,813 --> 00:55:59,401
You've gotta say, "I'm as mad as hell,
and I'm not gonna take this anymore!"

856
00:55:59,485 --> 00:56:01,403
They're yelling in Baton Rouge.

857
00:56:02,654 --> 00:56:04,072
Get up!

858
00:56:04,156 --> 00:56:07,784
Son of a bitch!
We've struck the mother lode!

859
00:56:07,868 --> 00:56:11,830
Stick your head out of the window
and keep yelling.

860
00:56:11,914 --> 00:56:14,500
Yell, "I'm as mad as hell.

861
00:56:14,583 --> 00:56:16,335
I'm not gonna take this anymore."

862
00:56:16,418 --> 00:56:18,962
Just get up from your chairs.

863
00:56:19,004 --> 00:56:21,256
- Where you going?
- I want to see if anybody's yelling.

864
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:23,300
Open it and stick your head out.

865
00:56:23,383 --> 00:56:25,344
Yell and keep yelling...

866
00:56:26,678 --> 00:56:28,972
I'm mad as hell!

867
00:56:29,014 --> 00:56:31,099
I'm not gonna take this anymore!

868
00:56:36,063 --> 00:56:38,941
I'm mad as hell, and I'm
not gonna take it anymore!

869
00:56:58,836 --> 00:57:03,549
I'm mad as hell, and I'm not
going to take this anymore!

870
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:42,379
By mid-October, the "Howard Beale Show"
had settled in at a 42 share...

871
00:57:42,462 --> 00:57:46,466
more than equaling all the other
network news shows combined.

872
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:49,011
In the Nielsen ratings,
the "Howard Beale Show"...

873
00:57:49,094 --> 00:57:51,430
was the fourth-highest-rated show
of the month...

874
00:57:51,513 --> 00:57:54,975
surpassed only by "The Six Million
Dollar Man," "All in the Family"...

875
00:57:55,058 --> 00:57:56,310
and "Phyllis"...

876
00:57:56,393 --> 00:57:59,146
a phenomenal state of affairs
for a news show.

877
00:57:59,188 --> 00:58:02,649
On October 15, Diana Christensen
flew to Los Angeles...

878
00:58:02,733 --> 00:58:05,110
for what the trade calls
powwows and confabs...

879
00:58:05,194 --> 00:58:07,571
with her West Coast
programming execs...

880
00:58:07,654 --> 00:58:10,866
and to get production rolling
on the shows for the coming season.

881
00:58:10,949 --> 00:58:15,996
Christ! You brought half the William
Morris West Coast Office along with you.

882
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:20,876
I'm Diana Christensen, a racist lackey
of the imperialist ruling circles.

883
00:58:20,959 --> 00:58:23,670
I'm Laureen Hobbs,
a bad-ass commie nigger.

884
00:58:23,754 --> 00:58:26,381
Sounds like the basis
of a firm friendship.

885
00:58:26,465 --> 00:58:28,800
- We'll need more chairs.
- Anybody want coffee?

886
00:58:28,884 --> 00:58:31,178
I'd love some.

887
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:40,395
This is my lawyer, Sam Haywood,
and his associate, Merrill Grant.

888
00:58:42,731 --> 00:58:47,361
Miss Christensen, just what the hell's
this all about?

889
00:58:47,444 --> 00:58:50,739
Because, when a national
television network...

890
00:58:50,823 --> 00:58:55,244
in the person of booby here
comes to me and says...

891
00:58:55,285 --> 00:58:58,455
they want to put the ongoing struggle
of the oppressed masses...

892
00:58:58,539 --> 00:59:00,499
on prime-time television...

893
00:59:00,582 --> 00:59:02,501
I have to regard this askance!

894
00:59:02,584 --> 00:59:07,506
Mr. Haywood was saying
that our client, Miss Hobbs...

895
00:59:07,589 --> 00:59:11,635
wants it up front that
the political content of the show...

896
00:59:11,718 --> 00:59:13,971
has to be in her control.

897
00:59:14,054 --> 00:59:17,599
She can have it. I don't give a damn
about the political content.

898
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:20,185
What kind of show?

899
00:59:20,269 --> 00:59:23,272
I'm interested in doing
a weekly dramatic series...

900
00:59:23,355 --> 00:59:25,816
based on the
Ecumenical Liberation Army...

901
00:59:25,899 --> 00:59:29,695
and the first show has to be
a two-hour special on Mary Ann Gifford.

902
00:59:29,778 --> 00:59:35,242
I want a lot more film like the bank
rip-off the Ecumenical sent in.

903
00:59:35,284 --> 00:59:37,911
The way I see the series is...

904
00:59:37,995 --> 00:59:42,875
each week we open with an authentic act
of political terrorism...

905
00:59:42,958 --> 00:59:45,252
taken on the spot
and in the actual moment.

906
00:59:45,294 --> 00:59:48,213
Then we go to the drama behind
the opening film footage.

907
00:59:48,297 --> 00:59:50,424
That's your job, Miss Hobbs.

908
00:59:50,507 --> 00:59:54,469
You've got to get the Ecumenicals
to bring in that film footage for us.

909
00:59:54,553 --> 00:59:58,473
The network can't deal with them.
They are wanted criminals.

910
00:59:59,474 --> 01:00:02,436
The Ecumenical Liberation Army
is an ultra-left sect...

911
01:00:02,519 --> 01:00:04,062
creating political confusion...

912
01:00:04,146 --> 01:00:07,316
with wildcat violence
and pseudo-insurrectionary acts...

913
01:00:07,399 --> 01:00:09,568
which the Communist Party
does not endorse.

914
01:00:09,651 --> 01:00:12,863
The American masses are not yet ready
for open revolt.

915
01:00:12,946 --> 01:00:15,824
We would not want to produce
a television show...

916
01:00:15,908 --> 01:00:19,328
celebrating historically
deviational terrorism.

917
01:00:19,369 --> 01:00:22,289
I'm offering you an hour
of prime-time television every week...

918
01:00:22,331 --> 01:00:24,333
into which you can stick
whatever propaganda you want.

919
01:00:24,416 --> 01:00:27,794
The Ecumenicals are an undisciplined
ultra-left gang...

920
01:00:27,836 --> 01:00:30,380
whose leader is an eccentric,
to say the least.

921
01:00:30,464 --> 01:00:35,260
He calls himself the Great Ahmed Khan
and wears a hussar's shako.

922
01:00:35,344 --> 01:00:38,472
We're talking about
30 to 50 million people a shot.

923
01:00:38,514 --> 01:00:40,516
It's better than handing out...

924
01:00:40,599 --> 01:00:43,227
mimeographed pamphlets
on ghetto street corners.

925
01:00:49,441 --> 01:00:52,486
I'll have to take this matter
to the Central Committee.

926
01:00:53,654 --> 01:00:56,323
And I'd better check it out
with the Great Ahmed Khan.

927
01:00:57,991 --> 01:01:02,162
I'll be in L.A. Until Saturday,
and I'd like to get it rolling.

928
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:40,075
Well, Ahmed,
you ain't gonna believe this...

929
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:44,454
but I'm gonna make
a TV star outta you.

930
01:01:44,538 --> 01:01:47,875
Just like Archie Bunker.

931
01:01:47,916 --> 01:01:50,627
You gonna be a household word.

932
01:01:52,296 --> 01:01:54,756
What the fuck are you talking about?

933
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:57,676
- Thirty seconds.
- Ready VTA.

934
01:01:57,759 --> 01:01:59,928
One, you have the audience to pan.

935
01:02:00,012 --> 01:02:02,681
Two, you have the window to pull.

936
01:02:02,764 --> 01:02:04,892
Three, you're on the announcer.

937
01:02:04,975 --> 01:02:06,435
Twenty.

938
01:02:08,562 --> 01:02:09,855
Stand by VTA.

939
01:02:09,938 --> 01:02:13,275
Fifteen, 14, 13, 12...

940
01:02:13,317 --> 01:02:15,944
- Ready A.
- Roll VTA.

941
01:02:16,028 --> 01:02:18,614
Nine, 8, 7...

942
01:02:18,697 --> 01:02:21,742
6, 5, 4...

943
01:02:21,783 --> 01:02:23,785
3, 2, 1.

944
01:02:23,869 --> 01:02:25,454
Three, cue announcer!

945
01:02:25,537 --> 01:02:28,957
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it!
How do you feel?

946
01:02:28,999 --> 01:02:30,792
We're mad as hell...

947
01:02:30,876 --> 01:02:33,795
and we're not gonna take this anymore!

948
01:02:33,837 --> 01:02:35,797
Ladies and gentlemen,
the "Network News Hour"...

949
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:37,716
with Sybil the Soothsayer...

950
01:02:41,929 --> 01:02:45,516
Jim Webbing and his
It's-The-Emmes-Truth Department...

951
01:02:49,186 --> 01:02:51,730
Miss Mata Hari
and her skeletons in the closet.

952
01:02:56,109 --> 01:02:58,487
Plus tonight, another segment
of "Vox Populi."

953
01:03:02,658 --> 01:03:06,787
And starring the Mad Prophet
of the Airways, Howard Beale!

954
01:03:21,927 --> 01:03:24,346
Edward George Ruddy died today!

955
01:03:24,429 --> 01:03:27,015
Edward George Ruddy
was the chairman of the board...

956
01:03:27,099 --> 01:03:29,768
of the Union Broadcasting Systems...

957
01:03:29,852 --> 01:03:33,313
and he died at 11:00 this morning
of a heart condition.

958
01:03:33,355 --> 01:03:36,692
Woe is us!
We're in a lot of trouble!

959
01:03:40,154 --> 01:03:45,075
So, a rich little man
with white hair died.

960
01:03:45,868 --> 01:03:48,662
What does that got to do
with the price of rice, right?

961
01:03:48,704 --> 01:03:50,747
And why is that woe to us?

962
01:03:52,708 --> 01:03:54,793
Because you people...

963
01:03:54,877 --> 01:03:58,839
and 62 million other Americans
are listening to me right now.

964
01:03:58,922 --> 01:04:02,718
Because less than three percent
of you people read books.

965
01:04:04,136 --> 01:04:07,806
Because less than 15 percent of you
read newspapers.

966
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:11,643
Because the only truth you know
is what you get over this tube.

967
01:04:11,727 --> 01:04:15,230
Right now, there is a whole
and entire generation...

968
01:04:15,314 --> 01:04:18,525
that never knew anything
that didn't come out of this tube!

969
01:04:19,735 --> 01:04:23,989
This tube is the Gospel.
The ultimate revelation.

970
01:04:24,072 --> 01:04:26,241
This tube can make or break...

971
01:04:26,325 --> 01:04:29,036
presidents, popes, prime ministers.

972
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:34,291
This tube is the most awesome goddamn
force in the whole godless world...

973
01:04:34,374 --> 01:04:37,252
and woe is us if it ever falls
into the hands of the wrong people!

974
01:04:37,294 --> 01:04:40,589
And that's why woe is us
that Edward George Ruddy died.

975
01:04:41,507 --> 01:04:44,551
Because this company is now
in the hands of CCA...

976
01:04:44,635 --> 01:04:47,262
the Communication Corporation
of America.

977
01:04:47,346 --> 01:04:50,724
There's a new chairman of the board,
a man called Frank Hackett...

978
01:04:50,766 --> 01:04:52,768
sitting in Mr. Ruddy's office
on the 20th floor.

979
01:04:52,851 --> 01:04:57,105
And when the 12th largest company
in the world...

980
01:04:57,189 --> 01:05:00,609
controls the most awesome,
goddamn propaganda force...

981
01:05:00,692 --> 01:05:02,611
in the whole godless world...

982
01:05:02,694 --> 01:05:06,740
who knows what shit will be peddled
for truth on this network!

983
01:05:06,824 --> 01:05:09,827
So you listen to me.
Listen to me!

984
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:12,663
Television is not the truth.

985
01:05:12,746 --> 01:05:15,249
Television's
a goddamned amusement park!

986
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:19,545
Television is a circus, a carnival,
a traveling troupe of acrobats...

987
01:05:19,628 --> 01:05:23,215
storytellers, dancers, singers,
jugglers, sideshow freaks...

988
01:05:23,298 --> 01:05:26,134
lion tamers and football players.

989
01:05:26,176 --> 01:05:28,637
We're in the boredom-killing business.

990
01:05:30,681 --> 01:05:34,685
So if you want the truth,
go to God.

991
01:05:34,768 --> 01:05:37,146
Go to your gurus.

992
01:05:37,229 --> 01:05:39,273
Go to yourselves!

993
01:05:39,314 --> 01:05:43,443
Because that's the only place
you're ever gonna find any real truth.

994
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:48,949
But, man, you're never gonna get
any truth from us.

995
01:05:49,032 --> 01:05:51,952
We'll tell you anything you wanna hear.
We lie like hell.

996
01:05:51,994 --> 01:05:55,038
We'll tell you that Kojak
always gets the killer...

997
01:05:55,122 --> 01:05:58,333
and that nobody ever gets cancer
in Archie Bunker's house.

998
01:05:58,417 --> 01:06:00,752
And no matter how much trouble
the hero is in, don't worry.

999
01:06:00,836 --> 01:06:03,547
Look at your watch.
At the end of the hour he'll win!

1000
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:07,092
We'll tell you any shit
you want to hear!

1001
01:06:07,176 --> 01:06:10,929
We deal in illusions.
None of it is true!

1002
01:06:11,013 --> 01:06:14,975
But you people sit there,
day after day, night after night.

1003
01:06:15,058 --> 01:06:19,229
You're all ages, colors, creeds.
We're all you know.

1004
01:06:19,313 --> 01:06:22,232
You're beginning to believe
the illusions we're spinning here.

1005
01:06:22,316 --> 01:06:26,111
You're beginning to think the tube is
reality and your own lives are unreal.

1006
01:06:26,195 --> 01:06:28,280
You do whatever the tube tells you!

1007
01:06:28,363 --> 01:06:30,491
You dress like the tube,
eat like the tube...

1008
01:06:30,574 --> 01:06:33,702
raise your children like the tube,
even think like the tube.

1009
01:06:33,785 --> 01:06:37,331
This is mass madness, you maniacs!

1010
01:06:37,372 --> 01:06:40,125
In God's name, you people
are the real thing!

1011
01:06:40,209 --> 01:06:42,377
We are the illusion!

1012
01:06:42,461 --> 01:06:47,257
So turn off your television sets.
Turn them off right now.

1013
01:06:47,341 --> 01:06:49,343
Turn them off and leave them off.

1014
01:06:49,384 --> 01:06:52,596
Turn them off in the middle
of this sentence.

1015
01:06:52,679 --> 01:06:54,681
Turn them off!

1016
01:07:09,112 --> 01:07:11,990
UBS was running at a cash flow
of break-even point...

1017
01:07:12,074 --> 01:07:16,578
after taking into account $110 million
of negative cash flow from the network.

1018
01:07:16,662 --> 01:07:20,207
It was clear the fat on the network
had to be flitched off.

1019
01:07:20,290 --> 01:07:23,544
Please note an increase in projected
initial programming revenues...

1020
01:07:23,627 --> 01:07:25,712
in the amount of $21 million...

1021
01:07:25,754 --> 01:07:29,424
due to the phenomenal success
of the "Howard Beale Show."

1022
01:07:30,968 --> 01:07:35,681
I expect a positive cash flow
for the entire complex of 45 million...

1023
01:07:35,764 --> 01:07:38,016
achievable in this fiscal year...

1024
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:40,686
a year, in short,
ahead of schedule.

1025
01:07:41,478 --> 01:07:43,522
Beyond that...

1026
01:07:43,605 --> 01:07:46,441
this network may be
the most significant profit center...

1027
01:07:46,483 --> 01:07:48,902
of the communications complex...

1028
01:07:48,944 --> 01:07:53,073
and based upon the projected rate
of return on invested capital...

1029
01:07:53,157 --> 01:07:56,994
and if merger is accomplished,
the communications complex...

1030
01:07:57,077 --> 01:08:01,415
may well become the towering
and most profitable center...

1031
01:08:01,456 --> 01:08:04,126
in the entire CCA empire.

1032
01:08:06,128 --> 01:08:09,464
I await your questions and comments.

1033
01:08:09,548 --> 01:08:11,049
Mr. Jensen?

1034
01:08:11,842 --> 01:08:14,928
Very good, Frank. Exemplary.
Keep it up.

1035
01:08:40,621 --> 01:08:43,123
Buy you a cup of coffee?

1036
01:08:44,791 --> 01:08:46,335
Hell, yes.

1037
01:08:47,377 --> 01:08:49,796
Do you have to get back
to the office?

1038
01:08:49,838 --> 01:08:52,174
Nothing that can't wait.

1039
01:09:04,645 --> 01:09:08,232
I drop down to the news studios
now and then...

1040
01:09:08,315 --> 01:09:10,400
and ask Howard Beale about you.

1041
01:09:10,484 --> 01:09:13,654
He says you're doing fine.
Are you?

1042
01:09:14,404 --> 01:09:16,490
Are you keeping busy?

1043
01:09:16,532 --> 01:09:18,325
In a fashion.

1044
01:09:18,408 --> 01:09:22,663
This is the third funeral
I've been to in two weeks.

1045
01:09:22,704 --> 01:09:27,543
I have two other friends in the hospital
whom I visit regularly.

1046
01:09:27,584 --> 01:09:30,796
I've been to a couple of christenings.

1047
01:09:30,879 --> 01:09:34,633
All my friends seem to be dying
or having grandchildren.

1048
01:09:35,676 --> 01:09:38,011
You should be a grandfather yourself
about now.

1049
01:09:38,053 --> 01:09:40,848
You have a pregnant daughter
in Seattle, don't you?

1050
01:09:40,931 --> 01:09:42,975
Any day now.

1051
01:09:43,058 --> 01:09:45,561
My wife's out there
for the occasion.

1052
01:09:49,982 --> 01:09:53,527
I've thought many times of calling you.

1053
01:09:55,362 --> 01:09:57,739
I wish you had.

1054
01:10:00,576 --> 01:10:04,788
I bumped into Sybil the Soothsayer
in the elevator last week.

1055
01:10:04,872 --> 01:10:07,833
I said, "You know, Sybil,
about four months ago...

1056
01:10:07,916 --> 01:10:12,254
you predicted I would get involved
with a craggy, middle-aged man.

1057
01:10:12,296 --> 01:10:15,966
So far, all that's happened
has been one many-splendored night.

1058
01:10:16,049 --> 01:10:19,386
I don't call that
getting involved."

1059
01:10:19,428 --> 01:10:22,890
She said,
"Don't worry. You will."

1060
01:10:25,767 --> 01:10:29,354
It was a many-splendored night,
wasn't it, Max?

1061
01:10:31,398 --> 01:10:33,192
Yes, it was.

1062
01:10:35,861 --> 01:10:38,155
Are we going to get involved?

1063
01:10:40,782 --> 01:10:44,828
Yes. I need to become involved
very much.

1064
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:48,248
How about you?

1065
01:10:49,625 --> 01:10:52,586
I've reached for the phone to call you
a hundred times...

1066
01:10:52,669 --> 01:10:55,714
but I was sure you hated me for my part
in taking your news show away.

1067
01:10:57,549 --> 01:11:00,761
I probably did.
I don't know anymore.

1068
01:11:00,802 --> 01:11:05,849
All I know is,
I can't get you out of my mind.

1069
01:11:10,145 --> 01:11:12,815
Marty, I know what NBC offered them.

1070
01:11:12,898 --> 01:11:18,612
Go to 3.5, and I want an option
for a third run on all of them.

1071
01:11:18,654 --> 01:11:22,032
I'm in a big hurry, and you and Charlie
are supposed to be negotiating this.

1072
01:11:22,115 --> 01:11:24,159
Good-bye, good luck.
I'll see you Monday.

1073
01:11:27,746 --> 01:11:31,208
- Jimmy Caan's agent says absolutely nix.
- You can't win them all.

1074
01:11:31,291 --> 01:11:34,753
- Where can I reach you later today?
- You can't. I'll be gone all weekend.

1075
01:11:39,758 --> 01:11:44,680
NBC's offering 3.25 mil
per package of five James Bond movies...

1076
01:11:44,763 --> 01:11:47,808
and I think I'm gonna steal them
for 3.5...

1077
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:49,977
with a third run.

1078
01:11:58,485 --> 01:12:00,654
I'm gonna stick the "Mao Tse-tung Hour"
in at 8:00...

1079
01:12:00,696 --> 01:12:05,325
because we're having a lot of trouble
selling the "Mao Tse-tung Hour."

1080
01:12:14,084 --> 01:12:18,964
That "Mao Tse-tung Hour's" turning
into one big pain in the ass.

1081
01:12:20,048 --> 01:12:23,927
We're having heavy legal problems
with the federal government right now.

1082
01:12:25,345 --> 01:12:30,267
Two FBI guys turned up in Hackett's
office and served us with a subpoena.

1083
01:12:32,227 --> 01:12:36,482
They heard about our Flagstaff
bank rip-off film, and they want it.

1084
01:12:37,774 --> 01:12:40,444
Hackett told the FBI to fuck off.

1085
01:12:45,699 --> 01:12:47,618
We're getting around the FBI...

1086
01:12:47,701 --> 01:12:51,079
by doing the show in collaboration
with the news division.

1087
01:12:51,163 --> 01:12:53,457
We're standing on the First Amendment:
Freedom of the press...

1088
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:56,001
and the right to protect our sources.

1089
01:12:56,084 --> 01:12:59,755
Walter thinks we can knock out
the misprision of felony charge.

1090
01:13:07,554 --> 01:13:10,891
But he says absolutely nix
on going to series.

1091
01:13:10,933 --> 01:13:16,230
They'll hit us with "conspiracy
with an inducement to commit a crime."

1092
01:13:16,271 --> 01:13:18,398
Christ, it's cold in here.

1093
01:13:18,482 --> 01:13:23,070
We're paying these Ecumencial
Liberation Army nuts $10,000 a week...

1094
01:13:23,153 --> 01:13:26,657
in order to turn in authentic film
of their revolutionary activities.

1095
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:30,786
That inconstitutes
"inducement to commit a crime"...

1096
01:13:30,869 --> 01:13:34,289
and Walter says we'll all wind up
in federal prison.

1097
01:13:35,290 --> 01:13:40,337
I said, "Walter,
let the federal government sue us.

1098
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:42,714
We'll take them to the Supreme Court.

1099
01:13:42,798 --> 01:13:44,758
We'll be front page."

1100
01:13:46,385 --> 01:13:49,221
The New York Times
and the Washington Post...

1101
01:13:49,304 --> 01:13:51,223
will write editorials.

1102
01:13:51,306 --> 01:13:55,727
We'll be front page for months.
We'll have more press than Watergate.

1103
01:13:55,811 --> 01:14:00,649
All I need is six weeks
federal litigation...

1104
01:14:00,691 --> 01:14:04,319
and the "Mao Tse-tung Hour" can start
carrying its own time slot.

1105
01:14:20,752 --> 01:14:24,631
What's really bugging me now
is my daytime programming.

1106
01:14:25,674 --> 01:14:28,343
NBC's got a lock on daytime...

1107
01:14:28,427 --> 01:14:31,138
with their lousy game shows...

1108
01:14:31,221 --> 01:14:33,807
and I'd like to bust them.

1109
01:14:33,891 --> 01:14:38,353
I'm thinking of doing
a homosexual soap opera. "The Dykes."

1110
01:14:39,855 --> 01:14:42,566
The heartrending saga about a woman...

1111
01:14:42,649 --> 01:14:45,944
hopelessly in love
with her husband's mistress.

1112
01:14:46,028 --> 01:14:48,155
What do you think?

1113
01:14:59,249 --> 01:15:01,376
How long has it been going on?

1114
01:15:03,879 --> 01:15:05,464
A month.

1115
01:15:07,382 --> 01:15:10,636
I thought it was a transient thing,
blow over in a week.

1116
01:15:12,012 --> 01:15:17,017
I still pray to God
it's just a menopausal infatuation.

1117
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:21,939
But it is an infatuation, Louise.

1118
01:15:23,565 --> 01:15:26,527
There's no sense in my saying
I won't see her again, because I will.

1119
01:15:31,573 --> 01:15:35,244
You want me to leave,
check into a hotel?

1120
01:15:38,247 --> 01:15:40,249
Do you love her?

1121
01:15:43,669 --> 01:15:45,879
I don't know how I feel.

1122
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:51,552
I'm grateful I can feel anything.

1123
01:15:54,263 --> 01:15:56,265
I know I'm obsessed with her.

1124
01:15:58,767 --> 01:16:00,477
Then say it!

1125
01:16:01,478 --> 01:16:04,982
Don't keep telling me that
you're obsessed, you're infatuated!

1126
01:16:05,065 --> 01:16:07,526
Say that you're in love with her.

1127
01:16:10,154 --> 01:16:13,282
I'm in love with her.

1128
01:16:13,365 --> 01:16:17,786
Then get out! Go anywhere you want.
Go live with her, but don't come back!

1129
01:16:17,828 --> 01:16:22,416
Because after 25 years of building
a home and raising a family...

1130
01:16:22,499 --> 01:16:26,170
and all the senseless pain
that we have inflicted on each other...

1131
01:16:26,253 --> 01:16:29,631
I'm damned if I'll stand and have you
say you're in love with somebody else!

1132
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:36,138
This isn't the convention weekend
with your secretary, is it?

1133
01:16:36,180 --> 01:16:40,517
Or some broad that you picked up
after three belts of booze.

1134
01:16:40,601 --> 01:16:43,395
This is your great winter romance,
isn't it?

1135
01:16:43,479 --> 01:16:47,608
Your last roar of passion before
you settle into your emeritus years.

1136
01:16:47,691 --> 01:16:50,777
Is that what's left for me?
Is that my share?

1137
01:16:50,861 --> 01:16:53,697
She gets the winter passion,
and I get the dotage?

1138
01:16:53,780 --> 01:16:57,367
Am I supposed to sit home
knitting and purling...

1139
01:16:57,451 --> 01:17:01,079
while you slink back
like some penitent drunk?

1140
01:17:01,163 --> 01:17:03,248
I'm your wife, damn it...

1141
01:17:03,332 --> 01:17:05,459
and if you can't work up
a winter passion for me...

1142
01:17:05,501 --> 01:17:08,712
the least I require
is respect and allegiance!

1143
01:17:21,141 --> 01:17:24,603
I hurt!
Don't you understand that?

1144
01:17:26,688 --> 01:17:29,733
I hurt badly!

1145
01:17:37,699 --> 01:17:40,035
Oh, say something for God's sake.

1146
01:17:49,795 --> 01:17:52,172
I've got nothing to say.

1147
01:18:02,766 --> 01:18:05,185
I won't give you up easily.

1148
01:18:11,608 --> 01:18:14,444
I think perhaps it is better
if you move out.

1149
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:22,494
Does she love you?

1150
01:18:26,415 --> 01:18:30,210
I'm not sure she's capable
of any real feelings.

1151
01:18:30,252 --> 01:18:34,339
She's television generation.
She learned life from Bugs Bunny.

1152
01:18:34,423 --> 01:18:38,177
The only reality she knows
comes to her from over the TV set.

1153
01:18:40,012 --> 01:18:43,974
She's very carefully devised a number
of scenarios for all of us to play...

1154
01:18:44,057 --> 01:18:46,894
like a movie of the week.

1155
01:18:49,354 --> 01:18:52,274
My God, look at us.

1156
01:18:52,357 --> 01:18:55,652
Here we are going through
the obligatory middle-of-act-two...

1157
01:18:55,736 --> 01:18:59,698
"scorned wife throws
peccant husband out" scene.

1158
01:18:59,781 --> 01:19:03,202
But don't worry,
I'll come back to you in the end.

1159
01:19:03,285 --> 01:19:06,538
All of her plot outlines have me
leaving her and coming back to you...

1160
01:19:06,622 --> 01:19:11,251
because the audience won't buy a
rejection of the happy American family.

1161
01:19:14,129 --> 01:19:17,633
She does have one script
in which I kill myself.

1162
01:19:17,716 --> 01:19:21,929
An adapted-for-television version
of "Anna Karenina"...

1163
01:19:23,555 --> 01:19:26,225
where she's Count Vronsky
and I'm Anna.

1164
01:19:31,396 --> 01:19:33,607
You're in for some dreadful grief.

1165
01:19:36,568 --> 01:19:37,986
I know.

1166
01:19:38,070 --> 01:19:41,490
The "Mao Tse-tung Hour"
went on the air March 14.

1167
01:19:41,532 --> 01:19:43,867
It received a 47 share.

1168
01:19:43,951 --> 01:19:47,120
The network promptly committed
to 15 shows with an option for 10 more.

1169
01:19:47,204 --> 01:19:50,624
There were the usual
contractual difficulties.

1170
01:19:50,666 --> 01:19:54,294
"Equal to 20 percent except that such
a percentage shall be 30 percent...

1171
01:19:54,336 --> 01:19:57,047
for 90 minutes
or longer television programs."

1172
01:19:57,130 --> 01:19:59,925
Have we settled
that sub-licensing thing?

1173
01:20:00,008 --> 01:20:03,053
We want a clear definition here.

1174
01:20:03,137 --> 01:20:07,224
"Gross proceeds should consist of
all funds the sub-licensee receives...

1175
01:20:07,307 --> 01:20:09,476
not merely the net amount remitted...

1176
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:12,855
after payment to the sub-licensee
or distributor."

1177
01:20:12,938 --> 01:20:16,650
We're not sitting still for overhead
charges as a cost prior to distribution.

1178
01:20:16,733 --> 01:20:20,320
Don't fuck with my distribution costs!

1179
01:20:20,404 --> 01:20:22,364
I'm making a lousy 215 per segment.

1180
01:20:22,406 --> 01:20:24,908
I'm already deficiting 25 grand a week
with Metro!

1181
01:20:24,992 --> 01:20:26,910
I'm paying William Morris 10 percent
off the top!

1182
01:20:26,994 --> 01:20:29,413
I'm giving this turkey ten thousand
per segment and five to this fruitcake.

1183
01:20:29,496 --> 01:20:32,374
And, Helen, don't start
no shit with me about a piece again.

1184
01:20:32,457 --> 01:20:35,252
I'm paying Metro 20 percent for all
foreign and Canadian distribution...

1185
01:20:35,335 --> 01:20:37,421
and that's after recoupment!

1186
01:20:37,504 --> 01:20:41,467
The Communist Party won't see a nickel
outta this show until syndication.

1187
01:20:41,550 --> 01:20:44,011
The Party's in for 7,500 a week
production expenses!

1188
01:20:44,094 --> 01:20:47,848
I'm not giving
this pseudo-insurrectionary a piece.

1189
01:20:47,931 --> 01:20:51,977
I won't give him script approval or
cut him in on my distribution charges.

1190
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:54,021
You fucking fascist!

1191
01:20:54,104 --> 01:20:56,940
Did you see the film we made
of the San Marino jail breakout...

1192
01:20:57,024 --> 01:21:00,110
demonstrating the rising up of a
seminal prisoner class infrastructure?

1193
01:21:00,194 --> 01:21:03,989
You can blow the seminal prisoner class
infrastructure out your ass!

1194
01:21:04,072 --> 01:21:06,700
I'm not knocking down
my goddamn distribution charges!

1195
01:21:08,243 --> 01:21:12,039
Man, give her
the fucking overhead clause.

1196
01:21:13,165 --> 01:21:15,167
Who's gonna believe this?

1197
01:21:17,586 --> 01:21:21,173
Let's get back to page 22.
Five, small "a."

1198
01:21:21,256 --> 01:21:23,842
"Subsidiary rights."

1199
01:21:23,926 --> 01:21:27,471
- Where are we now?
- Middle of page 22, "Subsidiary rights."

1200
01:21:27,554 --> 01:21:31,308
"As used herein, 'subsidiary rights'
means without limitation any and all..."

1201
01:21:42,027 --> 01:21:47,074
Over the past two days, you've had
opportunity to meet Diana Christensen...

1202
01:21:47,157 --> 01:21:50,369
our vice president
in charge of programming.

1203
01:21:50,452 --> 01:21:55,123
This afternoon, you all saw some of the
stuff she's set up for the new season.

1204
01:22:04,466 --> 01:22:08,595
You all know that she is the woman
behind the "Howard Beale Show."

1205
01:22:15,227 --> 01:22:18,647
We all know she's beautiful.

1206
01:22:19,648 --> 01:22:22,484
We all know she's brainy.

1207
01:22:22,526 --> 01:22:27,489
I was thinking, before we start digging
into our chateaubriands...

1208
01:22:29,491 --> 01:22:32,077
let's show her how we feel about her.

1209
01:22:47,509 --> 01:22:50,471
We've got the number one show
in television!

1210
01:22:53,807 --> 01:22:58,187
At next year's affiliates' meeting, I'll
be telling you we've got the top five!

1211
01:23:04,526 --> 01:23:07,237
Last year, we were
the number four network.

1212
01:23:07,321 --> 01:23:09,740
Next year, we're number one!

1213
01:23:10,574 --> 01:23:12,034
We're number one!

1214
01:23:12,784 --> 01:23:14,703
We're number one!

1215
01:23:25,589 --> 01:23:29,051
It is exactly 7:00
here in Los Angeles...

1216
01:23:29,092 --> 01:23:33,055
and right now over a million homes
using television in this city...

1217
01:23:33,096 --> 01:23:35,265
are turning their dials
to channel three...

1218
01:23:35,349 --> 01:23:37,935
and that's our channel!

1219
01:23:44,817 --> 01:23:47,027
Howard Beale!

1220
01:23:49,947 --> 01:23:52,407
Stop it! Stop it!

1221
01:23:52,491 --> 01:23:54,827
Listen to me,
and listen carefully...

1222
01:23:54,910 --> 01:23:59,414
because this is your goddamn life
I'm talking about today.

1223
01:24:00,499 --> 01:24:03,502
In this country, when one company wants
to take over another company...

1224
01:24:03,585 --> 01:24:05,879
they simply buy up a controlling share
of the stock...

1225
01:24:05,921 --> 01:24:08,423
but first they have to file notice
with the government.

1226
01:24:08,465 --> 01:24:11,593
That's how CCA took over the company
that owns this network.

1227
01:24:11,677 --> 01:24:15,097
But now somebody's buying up CCA.

1228
01:24:15,139 --> 01:24:18,892
Somebody called
the Western World Funding Corporation.

1229
01:24:18,976 --> 01:24:21,270
They filed the notice this morning.

1230
01:24:21,353 --> 01:24:25,357
Who in the hell is
the Western World Funding Corporation?

1231
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:28,944
It is a consortium of banks
and insurance companies...

1232
01:24:29,027 --> 01:24:32,698
who are not buying CCA for themselves
but as agents for somebody else.

1233
01:24:32,781 --> 01:24:35,117
And who is this somebody else?
They won't tell you.

1234
01:24:35,159 --> 01:24:37,411
They won't tell you.
They won't tell the Senate.

1235
01:24:37,452 --> 01:24:41,540
They won't tell the SEC, the FCC,
the Justice Department.

1236
01:24:41,623 --> 01:24:45,460
This is Mr. Hackett.
Do you have a New York call for me?

1237
01:24:45,544 --> 01:24:47,963
Do you want to
turn that down, please?

1238
01:24:48,046 --> 01:24:51,091
I will tell you who
they're buying CCA for.

1239
01:24:51,175 --> 01:24:55,345
They're buying it for the
Saudi Arabian Investment Corporation.

1240
01:24:55,429 --> 01:24:57,389
They're buying it for the Arabs!

1241
01:24:57,473 --> 01:25:00,476
Clarence? Frank Hackett here.
How's everything back in New York?

1242
01:25:00,559 --> 01:25:02,561
How's the good lady?

1243
01:25:05,856 --> 01:25:09,651
Take it easy.
I don't know what you're talking about.

1244
01:25:09,735 --> 01:25:12,446
When? Tonight's show?

1245
01:25:13,447 --> 01:25:15,699
Clarence, take it easy.

1246
01:25:16,909 --> 01:25:21,246
The "Howard Beale Show" is just going on
out here. You get it 3 hours earlier.

1247
01:25:21,330 --> 01:25:25,501
Take it easy! How the hell could
I see it? It's just going on now!

1248
01:25:30,839 --> 01:25:33,675
When did Mr. Jensen call?

1249
01:25:33,759 --> 01:25:36,470
We all know that the Arabs control...

1250
01:25:36,553 --> 01:25:40,265
$16 billion in this country.

1251
01:25:40,349 --> 01:25:44,436
They own a chunk of Fifth Avenue,
20 downtown pieces of Boston...

1252
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:49,191
a part of the port of New Orleans,
an industrial park in Salt Lake City.

1253
01:25:49,274 --> 01:25:51,527
They own big hunks
of the Atlanta Hilton...

1254
01:25:51,610 --> 01:25:54,112
the Arizona Land and Cattle Company...

1255
01:25:54,196 --> 01:25:56,490
the Security National Bank
in California...

1256
01:25:56,573 --> 01:25:58,659
the Bank of the Commonwealth
in Detroit.

1257
01:25:58,742 --> 01:26:03,205
They control Aramco, so that puts them
into Exxon, Texaco and Mobil Oil.

1258
01:26:03,247 --> 01:26:07,668
They're all over! New Jersey,
Louisville, St. Louis, Missouri.

1259
01:26:07,709 --> 01:26:12,381
And that's only what we know about.
There's more we don't know about.

1260
01:26:12,464 --> 01:26:15,843
Because all of those Arab
petrol dollars are washed...

1261
01:26:15,884 --> 01:26:19,221
through Switzerland and Canada
and the biggest banks in this country.

1262
01:26:19,304 --> 01:26:23,433
For example, what we don't know about
is this CCA deal...

1263
01:26:23,517 --> 01:26:27,020
and all the other CCA deals.

1264
01:26:27,104 --> 01:26:30,774
Right now the Arabs have screwed us out
of enough American dollars...

1265
01:26:30,858 --> 01:26:32,901
to come right back
and with our own money...

1266
01:26:32,985 --> 01:26:37,197
buy General Motors,
IBM, ITT, AT&T...

1267
01:26:37,281 --> 01:26:41,243
Du Pont, U.S. Steel
and 20 other American companies.

1268
01:26:41,326 --> 01:26:44,204
Hell, they already own
half of England!

1269
01:26:45,247 --> 01:26:46,748
Listen to me.

1270
01:26:46,790 --> 01:26:48,959
Listen to me, goddamn it!

1271
01:26:49,042 --> 01:26:51,128
The Arabs are simply buying us.

1272
01:26:51,211 --> 01:26:54,798
There's only one thing
that can stop them! You!

1273
01:26:55,883 --> 01:26:57,551
You!

1274
01:26:57,634 --> 01:27:00,888
So I want you to get up now.

1275
01:27:00,971 --> 01:27:03,515
I want you to get up
out of your chairs.

1276
01:27:03,599 --> 01:27:06,435
I want you to get up right now
and go to the phone.

1277
01:27:06,477 --> 01:27:09,229
I want you to get up from your chairs,
go to the phone...

1278
01:27:09,313 --> 01:27:13,192
get in your cars, drive into
the Western Union offices in town.

1279
01:27:13,275 --> 01:27:16,653
I want you to send a telegram
to the White House.

1280
01:27:16,737 --> 01:27:19,198
- Oh, my God.
- By midnight tonight...

1281
01:27:19,281 --> 01:27:22,075
I want a million telegrams
in the White House!

1282
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:26,288
I want them wading knee-deep
in telegrams at the White House.

1283
01:27:26,371 --> 01:27:30,792
I want you to get up right now and
write a telegram to President Ford...

1284
01:27:30,834 --> 01:27:35,631
saying "I'm as mad as hell,
and I'm not gonna take this anymore!

1285
01:27:35,714 --> 01:27:38,884
I don't want the banks
selling my country to the Arabs!

1286
01:27:38,967 --> 01:27:42,346
I want the CCA deal stopped now!"

1287
01:27:42,429 --> 01:27:45,057
I want the CCA deal stopped now!

1288
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:49,061
Come on. I want the CCA deal
stopped now!

1289
01:28:12,125 --> 01:28:14,920
- Could we have the room?
- Sure.

1290
01:28:23,303 --> 01:28:27,391
I'd like to see a typed script
and run through a couple more times.

1291
01:28:27,474 --> 01:28:30,352
But as for this whole CCA deal...

1292
01:28:30,394 --> 01:28:33,772
with the Saudis, you know a lot more
about that, Frank, than I would.

1293
01:28:33,856 --> 01:28:35,816
Is it true?

1294
01:28:39,695 --> 01:28:43,657
The CCA has two billion in loans
with the Saudis...

1295
01:28:43,740 --> 01:28:46,660
and they hold
every pledge we've got.

1296
01:28:47,870 --> 01:28:50,747
We need that Saudi money bad.

1297
01:28:52,916 --> 01:28:55,419
The show is a disaster.

1298
01:28:56,920 --> 01:29:00,382
Unmitigated disaster!
The death knell.

1299
01:29:01,550 --> 01:29:05,012
I'm ruined. I'm dead.
I'm finished.

1300
01:29:06,305 --> 01:29:09,892
Maybe we're overstating Beale's clout
with the public.

1301
01:29:11,310 --> 01:29:13,770
An hour ago, Clarence McElheny
called me from New York.

1302
01:29:13,854 --> 01:29:15,772
It was 10:00 in the East...

1303
01:29:15,856 --> 01:29:20,360
and our people in the White House report
they were knee-deep in telegrams.

1304
01:29:20,402 --> 01:29:25,199
By tomorrow morning,
they'll be suffocating in telegrams!

1305
01:29:25,282 --> 01:29:27,242
Can the government stop the deal?

1306
01:29:27,326 --> 01:29:31,872
They can hold it up. The SEC could hold
it up for 20 years if they wanted to.

1307
01:29:31,955 --> 01:29:33,415
I'm finished.

1308
01:29:33,499 --> 01:29:36,210
Any second that phone's gonna ring,
and Clarence McElheny...

1309
01:29:36,293 --> 01:29:40,047
is gonna tell me Mr. Jensen wants me
in his office tomorrow morning...

1310
01:29:40,130 --> 01:29:43,217
so he can personally chop my head off!

1311
01:29:44,301 --> 01:29:46,678
Four hours ago,
I was the sun god at CCA...

1312
01:29:46,762 --> 01:29:49,973
Mr. Jensen's handpicked golden boy,
the heir apparent.

1313
01:29:51,016 --> 01:29:55,145
Now, I'm a man
without a corporation.

1314
01:29:56,647 --> 01:29:59,650
Let's get back to Howard Beale.

1315
01:29:59,733 --> 01:30:03,070
You're not seriously gonna pull
Beale off the air.

1316
01:30:07,616 --> 01:30:11,703
Mr. Jensen's unhappy with Howard Beale
and wants him discontinued.

1317
01:30:11,787 --> 01:30:14,039
He may be unhappy,
but he isn't stupid enough...

1318
01:30:14,122 --> 01:30:16,959
to withdraw the number one show
on television out of pique.

1319
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,587
Two billion dollars isn't pique!
That's the wrath of God!

1320
01:30:20,629 --> 01:30:22,631
And the wrath of God wants
Howard Beale fired!

1321
01:30:22,714 --> 01:30:27,886
What for? Every other network will grab
him. He'll be on the air for ABC.

1322
01:30:27,970 --> 01:30:30,806
I'm gonna impale the son of a bitch
with a sharp stick through the heart.

1323
01:30:30,889 --> 01:30:32,891
We'll lose $40 million in revenues.

1324
01:30:32,975 --> 01:30:36,895
I'll take a contract out on him.
I'll hire professional killers.

1325
01:30:36,979 --> 01:30:39,064
No, I'll do it myself.

1326
01:30:39,148 --> 01:30:44,611
I'll strangle him with a sash cord.
Jesus!

1327
01:30:44,695 --> 01:30:46,905
I don't think Jensen's
gonna fire anybody.

1328
01:30:55,789 --> 01:30:58,917
Yes, Clarence.
I've already booked my flight.

1329
01:31:01,295 --> 01:31:04,131
Can you give me a little more time
than that? I've got the red-eye flight.

1330
01:31:04,173 --> 01:31:07,718
I won't be back in New York
till 6:00 tomorrow morning.

1331
01:31:10,429 --> 01:31:12,598
That'll be just fine.

1332
01:31:12,681 --> 01:31:14,725
I'll see you then.

1333
01:31:22,733 --> 01:31:26,695
Mr. Jensen wants to meet
with Howard Beale personally.

1334
01:31:26,778 --> 01:31:30,449
He wants Mr. Beale in his office
at 10:00 tomorrow morning.

1335
01:31:36,872 --> 01:31:39,833
The final revelation is at hand!

1336
01:31:39,875 --> 01:31:44,046
I have seen the shattering
vulgarizations of ultimate clarity.

1337
01:31:44,129 --> 01:31:48,634
The light is impending.
I bear witness to the light!

1338
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:12,825
Good morning, Mr. Beale.
They tell me you're a madman.

1339
01:32:12,908 --> 01:32:14,451
Only desultorily.

1340
01:32:14,535 --> 01:32:16,787
- How are you now?
- I'm as mad as a hatter.

1341
01:32:16,870 --> 01:32:18,288
Who isn't?

1342
01:32:19,373 --> 01:32:21,291
I'm taking you into
our conference room.

1343
01:32:21,375 --> 01:32:24,711
Seems more seemly a setting
for what I have to say to you.

1344
01:32:26,130 --> 01:32:28,882
I started as a salesman.

1345
01:32:28,924 --> 01:32:31,885
I sold sewing machines,
automobile parts...

1346
01:32:31,927 --> 01:32:34,763
hair brushes
and electronic equipment.

1347
01:32:34,847 --> 01:32:38,016
They say I can sell anything.

1348
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:41,145
I'd like to try
to sell something to you.

1349
01:32:44,773 --> 01:32:46,733
Valhalla, Mr. Beale.

1350
01:32:46,817 --> 01:32:48,777
Please sit down.

1351
01:33:17,931 --> 01:33:22,936
You have meddled with the primal forces
of nature, Mr. Beale...

1352
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:25,063
and I won't have it!

1353
01:33:25,814 --> 01:33:27,274
Is that clear?

1354
01:33:27,357 --> 01:33:30,027
You think you merely stopped
a business deal.

1355
01:33:30,110 --> 01:33:32,070
That is not the case.

1356
01:33:32,154 --> 01:33:34,615
The Arabs have taken billions of dollars
out of this country...

1357
01:33:34,698 --> 01:33:37,034
and now they must put it back!

1358
01:33:37,117 --> 01:33:42,206
It is ebb and flow, tidal gravity.
It is ecological balance!

1359
01:33:43,707 --> 01:33:45,667
You are an old man...

1360
01:33:45,709 --> 01:33:49,546
who thinks in terms
of nations and peoples.

1361
01:33:49,630 --> 01:33:52,132
There are no nations.
There are no peoples.

1362
01:33:52,216 --> 01:33:54,384
There are no Russians.
There are no Arabs.

1363
01:33:54,468 --> 01:33:57,137
There are no Third Worlds.
There is no West.

1364
01:33:57,179 --> 01:34:02,351
There is only one holistic system
of systems!

1365
01:34:02,434 --> 01:34:06,688
One vast and immane,
interwoven, interacting...

1366
01:34:06,772 --> 01:34:11,068
multi-variant, multinational
dominion of dollars!

1367
01:34:11,151 --> 01:34:14,321
Petrol dollars, electro dollars,
multi-dollars.

1368
01:34:14,363 --> 01:34:19,409
Reichsmarks, rins, rubles, pounds
and shekels!

1369
01:34:21,537 --> 01:34:24,414
It is the international system
of currency...

1370
01:34:24,498 --> 01:34:29,503
which determines the totality
of life on this planet.

1371
01:34:30,379 --> 01:34:34,925
That is the natural order
of things today.

1372
01:34:35,926 --> 01:34:39,972
That is the atomic...

1373
01:34:40,055 --> 01:34:42,182
and subatomic...

1374
01:34:42,224 --> 01:34:46,603
and galactic structure
of things today.

1375
01:34:48,355 --> 01:34:50,691
And you have meddled...

1376
01:34:50,774 --> 01:34:54,361
with the primal forces of nature!

1377
01:34:55,571 --> 01:35:00,159
And you will atone!

1378
01:35:01,243 --> 01:35:03,245
Am I getting through to you?

1379
01:35:07,416 --> 01:35:11,378
You get up on
your little 21-inch screen...

1380
01:35:12,921 --> 01:35:17,050
and howl about America
and democracy.

1381
01:35:18,260 --> 01:35:20,179
There is no America.

1382
01:35:20,262 --> 01:35:22,639
There is no democracy.

1383
01:35:22,723 --> 01:35:26,602
There is only IBM and ITT...

1384
01:35:26,643 --> 01:35:28,312
and AT&T...

1385
01:35:28,395 --> 01:35:32,357
and Du Pont, Dow, Union Carbide...

1386
01:35:32,441 --> 01:35:33,984
and Exxon.

1387
01:35:34,067 --> 01:35:37,696
Those are the nations
of the world today.

1388
01:35:37,779 --> 01:35:40,574
What do you think the Russians
talk about in their councils of state?

1389
01:35:40,657 --> 01:35:42,242
Karl Marx?

1390
01:35:42,284 --> 01:35:44,870
They get out their
linear programming charts...

1391
01:35:44,953 --> 01:35:47,915
statistical decision theories,
minimax solutions and compute...

1392
01:35:47,998 --> 01:35:52,169
price-cost probabilities of their
transactions and investments like we do.

1393
01:35:52,252 --> 01:35:57,174
We no longer live in a world
of nations and ideologies, Mr. Beale.

1394
01:35:57,257 --> 01:35:59,426
The world...

1395
01:35:59,510 --> 01:36:02,429
is a college of corporations...

1396
01:36:02,471 --> 01:36:05,390
inexorably determined...

1397
01:36:05,474 --> 01:36:08,769
by the immutable bylaws
of business.

1398
01:36:11,396 --> 01:36:14,399
The world is a business.

1399
01:36:16,235 --> 01:36:20,531
It has been since man
crawled out of the slime.

1400
01:36:23,075 --> 01:36:27,496
And our children will live,
Mr. Beale...

1401
01:36:29,331 --> 01:36:31,291
to see that...

1402
01:36:33,335 --> 01:36:35,379
perfect world...

1403
01:36:36,964 --> 01:36:40,300
in which there's no war or famine...

1404
01:36:40,384 --> 01:36:42,886
oppression or brutality.

1405
01:36:44,805 --> 01:36:48,809
One vast and ecumenical
holding company...

1406
01:36:48,851 --> 01:36:53,230
for whom all men will work to serve
a common profit...

1407
01:36:53,313 --> 01:36:58,694
in which all men will hold
a share of stock...

1408
01:36:58,777 --> 01:37:01,196
all necessities provided...

1409
01:37:02,406 --> 01:37:05,909
all anxieties tranquilized...

1410
01:37:07,494 --> 01:37:10,831
all boredom amused.

1411
01:37:17,212 --> 01:37:22,009
And I have chosen you, Mr. Beale...

1412
01:37:22,092 --> 01:37:24,845
to preach this evangel.

1413
01:37:24,928 --> 01:37:26,680
Why me?

1414
01:37:27,890 --> 01:37:30,517
Because you're on television, dummy!

1415
01:37:31,810 --> 01:37:33,896
Sixty million people watch you...

1416
01:37:33,979 --> 01:37:36,815
every night of the week,
Monday through Friday.

1417
01:37:38,025 --> 01:37:40,319
I have seen the face of God.

1418
01:37:42,905 --> 01:37:45,157
You just might be right, Mr. Beale.

1419
01:37:47,159 --> 01:37:49,203
That evening Howard Beale
went on the air...

1420
01:37:49,244 --> 01:37:52,539
to preach the corporate cosmology
of Arthur Jensen.

1421
01:37:52,581 --> 01:37:57,211
Last night I got up here and asked you
to fight for your heritage...

1422
01:37:57,294 --> 01:37:59,713
and you did,
and it was beautiful.

1423
01:37:59,755 --> 01:38:02,800
Six million telegrams were received
at the White House.

1424
01:38:02,883 --> 01:38:06,220
The Arab takeover of CCA
has been stopped.

1425
01:38:06,261 --> 01:38:08,430
The people spoke, the people won.

1426
01:38:08,514 --> 01:38:11,308
It was a radiant eruption
of democracy.

1427
01:38:12,392 --> 01:38:16,355
But I think that was it, fellas.

1428
01:38:16,438 --> 01:38:19,066
That sort of thing is not likely
to happen again...

1429
01:38:19,149 --> 01:38:22,194
because at the bottom
of all our terrified souls...

1430
01:38:22,277 --> 01:38:25,113
we know that democracy
is a dying giant...

1431
01:38:25,197 --> 01:38:28,408
a sick, sick, dying,
decaying political concept...

1432
01:38:28,492 --> 01:38:30,452
writhing in its final pain.

1433
01:38:30,494 --> 01:38:34,248
I don't mean that the United States
is finished as a world power.

1434
01:38:34,331 --> 01:38:37,501
The U. S is the richest,
most advanced country in the world...

1435
01:38:37,584 --> 01:38:39,628
light-years ahead
of any other country...

1436
01:38:39,711 --> 01:38:43,632
and the Communists won't take over the
world because they're deader than we.

1437
01:38:43,674 --> 01:38:45,717
What is finished...

1438
01:38:47,302 --> 01:38:49,596
is the idea that this great country...

1439
01:38:49,638 --> 01:38:55,102
is dedicated to the freedom and
flourishing of every individual in it.

1440
01:38:56,186 --> 01:38:59,356
It's the individual that's finished.

1441
01:38:59,439 --> 01:39:03,277
It's the single, solitary human being
that's finished.

1442
01:39:04,319 --> 01:39:08,866
It's every single one of you
out there that's finished.

1443
01:39:08,949 --> 01:39:13,996
Because this is no longer a nation
of independent individuals.

1444
01:39:15,164 --> 01:39:20,627
It's a nation of some 200 million
transistorized, deodorized...

1445
01:39:20,711 --> 01:39:23,464
whiter-than-white,
steel-belted bodies...

1446
01:39:23,505 --> 01:39:26,508
totally unnecessary
as human beings...

1447
01:39:26,550 --> 01:39:29,720
and as replaceable as piston rods.

1448
01:39:40,522 --> 01:39:43,901
Well, the time has come to say...

1449
01:39:43,984 --> 01:39:47,404
is "dehumanization"
such a bad word?

1450
01:39:47,488 --> 01:39:50,657
Whether it's good or bad,
that's what is so.

1451
01:39:50,699 --> 01:39:53,118
The whole world
is becoming humanoid...

1452
01:39:53,202 --> 01:39:56,330
creatures that look human
but aren't.

1453
01:39:56,371 --> 01:39:58,332
The whole world, not just us.

1454
01:39:58,373 --> 01:40:01,752
We're just the most advanced,
so we're getting there first.

1455
01:40:02,795 --> 01:40:07,007
The whole world's people
are becoming mass-produced...

1456
01:40:07,090 --> 01:40:10,052
programmed, numbered and...

1457
01:40:10,093 --> 01:40:12,179
It was an admissible argument
that Howard Beale...

1458
01:40:12,262 --> 01:40:14,723
advanced in the days that followed.

1459
01:40:14,765 --> 01:40:18,018
It was, however,
also a very depressing one.

1460
01:40:18,101 --> 01:40:21,396
Nobody particularly cared to hear
his life was utterly valueless.

1461
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:23,440
By the end of the first week
in June...

1462
01:40:23,524 --> 01:40:25,442
the show dropped
one ratings point...

1463
01:40:25,526 --> 01:40:28,987
and its trend of shares
dipped under 48 for the first time...

1464
01:40:29,071 --> 01:40:30,823
since last November.

1465
01:40:30,906 --> 01:40:32,866
You're his goddamn agent, Lou!

1466
01:40:32,950 --> 01:40:35,118
I'm counting on you to talk sense
into the lunatic!

1467
01:40:35,202 --> 01:40:38,121
Nobody wants to hear about
dying democracy and dehumanization!

1468
01:40:39,581 --> 01:40:41,959
I'm sorry I'm late.

1469
01:40:42,042 --> 01:40:45,629
We're getting rumbles from the agencies.
The sponsors will bail out soon!

1470
01:40:45,712 --> 01:40:47,881
This is a breach of contract!

1471
01:40:47,965 --> 01:40:51,510
This isn't the Howard Beale we signed.
Get him off the corporate universe kick.

1472
01:40:51,593 --> 01:40:53,762
I'll pull him off the air!

1473
01:40:53,846 --> 01:40:56,890
I told him! I've been telling him
every day for a week!

1474
01:40:56,974 --> 01:41:00,352
I am sick of telling him!
Now you tell him!

1475
01:41:07,776 --> 01:41:09,653
Jesus Christ!

1476
01:41:13,365 --> 01:41:17,953
You could help me with Howard. He
listens to you. You're his best friend.

1477
01:41:18,036 --> 01:41:20,455
I'm tired of all this hysteria
about Howard Beale!

1478
01:41:20,539 --> 01:41:23,125
Every time you come back from seeing
somebody in your family...

1479
01:41:23,208 --> 01:41:25,502
you're in a morbid,
middle-aged mood!

1480
01:41:25,586 --> 01:41:28,922
And I'm tired of finding you on the
goddamn phone every time I turn around!

1481
01:41:28,964 --> 01:41:32,342
I'm tired of being an accessory
in your life!

1482
01:41:32,426 --> 01:41:34,803
I'm tired of pretending
to write this dumb book...

1483
01:41:34,887 --> 01:41:38,432
about my maverick days
in the early years of television.

1484
01:41:38,515 --> 01:41:42,269
Every goddamned executive fired
from a network in the last 20 years...

1485
01:41:42,311 --> 01:41:46,482
has written this dumb book about
the great early years of television!

1486
01:41:46,565 --> 01:41:49,943
And nobody wants a dumb, damn,
goddamn book...

1487
01:41:50,027 --> 01:41:52,196
about the early days of television!

1488
01:41:52,279 --> 01:41:55,240
Terrific. Maybe you can start
a whole new career as an actor!

1489
01:41:58,118 --> 01:42:02,706
After living with you for six months,
I'm turning into one of your scripts!

1490
01:42:03,707 --> 01:42:06,418
This is not a script.

1491
01:42:06,502 --> 01:42:09,797
There's some real, actual life
going on here.

1492
01:42:10,881 --> 01:42:14,384
I went to visit my wife today
because she's in a state of depression...

1493
01:42:14,468 --> 01:42:18,138
so depressed that my daughter
flew from Seattle to be with her...

1494
01:42:18,180 --> 01:42:20,516
and I feel lousy about that.

1495
01:42:20,599 --> 01:42:24,686
I feel lousy about the pain
that I've caused my wife and kids.

1496
01:42:24,770 --> 01:42:29,441
I feel guilty and conscious-stricken and
those things you think sentimental...

1497
01:42:29,525 --> 01:42:33,695
but which my generation called
simple human decency.

1498
01:42:37,783 --> 01:42:40,494
And I miss my home...

1499
01:42:40,536 --> 01:42:43,413
because I'm beginning
to get scared shitless.

1500
01:42:43,497 --> 01:42:46,750
Because all of a sudden it's closer to
the end than it is to the beginning...

1501
01:42:46,834 --> 01:42:50,087
and death is suddenly
a perceptible thing to me...

1502
01:42:50,170 --> 01:42:52,714
with definable features.

1503
01:42:56,635 --> 01:43:01,473
You're dealing with a man
that has primal doubts...

1504
01:43:01,557 --> 01:43:04,393
and you've got to cope with it.

1505
01:43:04,476 --> 01:43:09,356
I'm not some guy discussing male
menopause on the "Barbara Walters Show."

1506
01:43:09,398 --> 01:43:12,651
I'm the man that you presumably love.

1507
01:43:13,735 --> 01:43:16,780
I'm part of your life.

1508
01:43:16,864 --> 01:43:18,699
I live here.

1509
01:43:18,740 --> 01:43:20,284
I'm real!

1510
01:43:21,326 --> 01:43:24,580
You can't switch
to another station.

1511
01:43:29,042 --> 01:43:30,461
Well...

1512
01:43:32,004 --> 01:43:34,798
what exactly is it
you want me to do?

1513
01:43:38,802 --> 01:43:41,680
I just want you to love me.

1514
01:43:43,223 --> 01:43:46,560
I just want you to love me,
primal doubts and all.

1515
01:43:49,021 --> 01:43:51,565
You understand that, don't you?

1516
01:43:56,403 --> 01:43:58,614
I don't know how to do that.

1517
01:44:10,292 --> 01:44:13,003
I'll be with you in a minute, Max.

1518
01:44:18,258 --> 01:44:21,845
By the first week in July, the
"Howard Beale Show" was down 11 points.

1519
01:44:21,929 --> 01:44:23,889
Hysteria swept through the network.

1520
01:44:23,972 --> 01:44:27,017
He's a plague! He's smallpox!
He's typhoid!

1521
01:44:27,100 --> 01:44:29,895
I don't want to follow his goddamn show!
I want out of the 8:00 spot.

1522
01:44:29,978 --> 01:44:32,481
I've got enough troubles
without Howard Beale as a lead-in.

1523
01:44:32,564 --> 01:44:34,775
You guys scheduled me up against
"Tony Orlando and Dawn"!

1524
01:44:34,858 --> 01:44:38,445
NBC's got "Little House on the Prairie."
ABC's got "The Bionic Woman."

1525
01:44:38,487 --> 01:44:41,365
You gotta do something
about Howard Beale!

1526
01:44:41,448 --> 01:44:43,617
Get him off the air!
Get him off!

1527
01:44:43,700 --> 01:44:45,786
Do something! Do anything!

1528
01:44:45,869 --> 01:44:49,748
We're trying to find a replacement! I'm
going to look at audition footage now!

1529
01:44:49,832 --> 01:44:53,460
And how when the sick heal!

1530
01:44:53,544 --> 01:44:56,547
Man, I tell you I saw it!

1531
01:44:56,630 --> 01:45:00,175
It was heavy, baby.

1532
01:45:00,259 --> 01:45:02,511
I saw the earth quake...

1533
01:45:02,594 --> 01:45:06,515
and I saw the moon became like blood.

1534
01:45:06,598 --> 01:45:10,811
And every mountain and island
was moved from its place.

1535
01:45:10,894 --> 01:45:14,898
No, no, damn it! If we wanted hell-fire,
we'd get Billy Graham!

1536
01:45:14,982 --> 01:45:18,569
We don't want faith healers, evangelists
or Oberammergau passion players!

1537
01:45:18,652 --> 01:45:22,990
What about that terrific new messiah
ABC was to sign for our competition?

1538
01:45:24,074 --> 01:45:25,492
That's him.

1539
01:45:27,536 --> 01:45:30,164
That's him?

1540
01:45:31,540 --> 01:45:33,459
Jesus. Turn him off!

1541
01:45:34,626 --> 01:45:38,255
I've got three more,
but you've already seen the best ones.

1542
01:45:38,338 --> 01:45:40,299
I've got a guru from Spokane...

1543
01:45:40,382 --> 01:45:43,177
and two more hell-fires
who see visions of the Virgin Mary.

1544
01:45:43,260 --> 01:45:47,222
We're not gonna find a replacement
for Beale. Let's stop kidding ourselves.

1545
01:45:47,264 --> 01:45:50,350
Fully-fledged messiahs
don't come in bunches.

1546
01:45:50,434 --> 01:45:53,645
We either go with Howard Beale
or we go without him.

1547
01:45:53,729 --> 01:45:56,648
My reports say we'll do better
without him.

1548
01:45:56,732 --> 01:45:59,651
It would be disaster to let
this situation go on another week.

1549
01:45:59,735 --> 01:46:02,446
By then he'll be down 16 points...

1550
01:46:02,529 --> 01:46:05,324
and the trend irreversible,
if it isn't already.

1551
01:46:07,242 --> 01:46:10,287
I think we should fire Howard.

1552
01:46:12,956 --> 01:46:16,418
Arthur Jensen has taken
a strong personal interest...

1553
01:46:16,460 --> 01:46:18,462
in the "Howard Beale Show."

1554
01:46:20,714 --> 01:46:22,674
I'm having dinner with him tonight.

1555
01:46:22,758 --> 01:46:26,678
Let me have another crack at Jensen.
Meet in my office at 10:00 tonight.

1556
01:46:26,762 --> 01:46:29,556
Diana, give me copies of all
your audience research reports.

1557
01:46:29,598 --> 01:46:31,767
I may need them for Jensen.

1558
01:46:31,850 --> 01:46:34,102
Is 10:00 convenient for everyone?

1559
01:47:05,509 --> 01:47:09,972
I think the time has come
to reevaluate our relationship, Max.

1560
01:47:11,056 --> 01:47:12,850
So I see.

1561
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:16,979
I don't like the way this script of ours
is turning out.

1562
01:47:18,105 --> 01:47:20,732
It's turning into a seedy little drama.

1563
01:47:20,816 --> 01:47:25,237
Middle-aged man leaves wife and family
for young, heartless woman, goes to pot.

1564
01:47:25,320 --> 01:47:28,240
"The Blue Angel" with Marlene Dietrich
and Emil Jannings.

1565
01:47:28,323 --> 01:47:31,034
- I don't like it.
- So you're gonna cancel the show.

1566
01:47:31,118 --> 01:47:33,370
- Right.
- Let me do that.

1567
01:47:34,997 --> 01:47:37,833
The simple fact is, Max...

1568
01:47:37,916 --> 01:47:40,252
that you're a family man.

1569
01:47:40,335 --> 01:47:43,839
It's beautiful you like a home and kids,
but I am incapable of such commitment.

1570
01:47:43,922 --> 01:47:46,467
All you'll get from me is another
couple of months of intermittent sex...

1571
01:47:46,550 --> 01:47:50,429
and recriminate and ugly little scenes
like the one we had last night.

1572
01:47:50,512 --> 01:47:54,475
I'm sorry for all those things
I said to you last night.

1573
01:47:54,558 --> 01:47:56,977
You're not the worst fuck
I've ever had.

1574
01:47:57,019 --> 01:47:59,438
Believe me, I've had worse.

1575
01:48:01,231 --> 01:48:04,902
You don't puff or snorkel
and make death-like rattles.

1576
01:48:04,985 --> 01:48:07,446
As a matter of fact,
you're rather serene in the sack.

1577
01:48:08,989 --> 01:48:11,909
Why is it that a woman always thinks
that the most savage thing...

1578
01:48:11,992 --> 01:48:15,829
she can say to a man
is to impugn his cocksmanship?

1579
01:48:16,914 --> 01:48:20,751
I'm sorry I impugned your cocksmanship.

1580
01:48:20,834 --> 01:48:25,380
I gave up comparing genitals
back in the schoolyard.

1581
01:48:34,848 --> 01:48:37,601
You're being docile as hell
about this.

1582
01:48:38,644 --> 01:48:41,730
Hell, Diana, I knew it was over
with us weeks ago.

1583
01:48:42,773 --> 01:48:45,526
Will you go back to your wife?

1584
01:48:47,194 --> 01:48:49,988
I'll give it a try,
but I don't think she'll jump at it.

1585
01:48:50,072 --> 01:48:52,032
Don't worry about me.

1586
01:48:52,074 --> 01:48:54,743
I'll manage. I always have,
I always will.

1587
01:48:54,827 --> 01:48:56,870
I'm more concerned about you.

1588
01:48:56,954 --> 01:48:59,456
You're not the boozer type.

1589
01:48:59,540 --> 01:49:03,502
So I figure a year, maybe two,
before you crack up...

1590
01:49:03,585 --> 01:49:06,171
or jump out of
your 14th floor office window.

1591
01:49:06,255 --> 01:49:09,383
Stop selling, Max.
I don't need you.

1592
01:49:21,061 --> 01:49:24,731
I don't want your pain! I don't want
your menopausal decay and death!

1593
01:49:24,773 --> 01:49:27,109
- I don't need you, Max! Get out!
- You need me!

1594
01:49:28,068 --> 01:49:32,990
You need me badly! Because I'm
your last contact with human reality.

1595
01:49:33,073 --> 01:49:35,159
I love you!

1596
01:49:35,242 --> 01:49:39,121
And that painful, decaying love
is the only thing between you...

1597
01:49:39,204 --> 01:49:41,999
and the shrieking nothingness
you live the rest of the day.

1598
01:49:42,082 --> 01:49:44,001
Then don't leave me.

1599
01:49:47,045 --> 01:49:48,964
It's too late.

1600
01:49:50,215 --> 01:49:52,551
There's nothing left in you
that I can live with.

1601
01:49:55,888 --> 01:50:00,476
You're one of Howard's humanoids.
If I stay with you, I'll be destroyed.

1602
01:50:02,227 --> 01:50:05,147
Like Howard Beale was destroyed.

1603
01:50:05,189 --> 01:50:08,442
Like Laureen Hobbs was destroyed.

1604
01:50:08,525 --> 01:50:13,697
Like everything you and the institution
of television touch is destroyed.

1605
01:50:20,162 --> 01:50:22,247
You're television incarnate.

1606
01:50:23,832 --> 01:50:26,084
Indifferent to suffering...

1607
01:50:26,877 --> 01:50:29,004
insensitive to joy.

1608
01:50:30,506 --> 01:50:34,343
All of life is reduced
to the common rubble of banality.

1609
01:50:38,013 --> 01:50:40,474
War, murder, death...

1610
01:50:41,725 --> 01:50:44,603
are all the same to you
as bottles of beer.

1611
01:50:45,646 --> 01:50:49,608
And the daily business of life
is a corrupt comedy.

1612
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:54,696
You even shatter the sensations
of time and space...

1613
01:50:54,780 --> 01:50:59,284
into split seconds
and instant replays.

1614
01:51:03,080 --> 01:51:05,040
You're madness, Diana.

1615
01:51:06,875 --> 01:51:08,794
Virulent madness.

1616
01:51:11,296 --> 01:51:14,341
And everything you touch
dies with you.

1617
01:51:18,887 --> 01:51:21,723
But not me.

1618
01:51:21,807 --> 01:51:24,309
Not as long as I can feel pleasure...

1619
01:51:25,644 --> 01:51:27,229
and pain...

1620
01:51:31,316 --> 01:51:32,818
and love.

1621
01:51:44,163 --> 01:51:46,373
And it's a happy ending.

1622
01:51:47,749 --> 01:51:51,462
Wayward husband
comes to his senses...

1623
01:51:51,545 --> 01:51:53,714
returns to his wife...

1624
01:51:53,755 --> 01:51:56,758
with whom he's established
a long and sustaining love.

1625
01:51:58,093 --> 01:52:01,972
Heartless young woman left alone
in her arctic desolation.

1626
01:52:05,142 --> 01:52:07,144
Music up with a swell.

1627
01:52:10,189 --> 01:52:11,899
Final commercial.

1628
01:52:14,735 --> 01:52:18,197
And here are a few scenes
from next week's show.

1629
01:52:30,334 --> 01:52:32,252
How'd it go?

1630
01:52:48,769 --> 01:52:53,440
Mr. Jensen was unhappy at the idea
of taking Howard Beale off the air.

1631
01:52:54,775 --> 01:52:56,944
Mr. Jensen thinks Howard Beale
is bringing...

1632
01:52:57,027 --> 01:53:00,823
a very important message
to the American people.

1633
01:53:03,116 --> 01:53:06,495
So he wants Howard Beale on the air,
and he wants him kept on.

1634
01:53:08,664 --> 01:53:11,959
Mr. Jensen feels we're too catastrophic
in our thinking.

1635
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,503
I argued that television
was a volatile industry...

1636
01:53:14,586 --> 01:53:18,423
in which success and failure
were determined week by week.

1637
01:53:19,466 --> 01:53:22,344
Mr. Jensen said he did not like
volatile industries...

1638
01:53:22,427 --> 01:53:26,140
and suggested with a certain
sinister silkiness...

1639
01:53:27,641 --> 01:53:31,228
that volatility in business
usually reflected bad management.

1640
01:53:32,521 --> 01:53:35,482
He didn't really care if Howard Beale
was the number one show or the 50th.

1641
01:53:35,566 --> 01:53:38,068
He didn't really care
if the Beale show lost money.

1642
01:53:39,194 --> 01:53:41,780
He wants Howard Beale on the air...

1643
01:53:41,864 --> 01:53:44,116
and he wants him kept on.

1644
01:53:44,158 --> 01:53:48,287
I would describe his position on this
as inflexible.

1645
01:53:50,205 --> 01:53:52,166
Where does that put us, Diana?

1646
01:53:53,292 --> 01:53:56,837
That puts us in the shithouse.
That's where that puts us.

1647
01:53:59,631 --> 01:54:02,509
Do you want me to go through this?

1648
01:54:03,635 --> 01:54:07,431
The Beale show Q score
is down to 33.

1649
01:54:08,515 --> 01:54:12,060
Most of this loss occurred in the child
and teen and 18-34 categories...

1650
01:54:12,144 --> 01:54:14,980
which were our key core markets.

1651
01:54:16,148 --> 01:54:18,817
It's the AR department's carefully
considered judgment, and mine...

1652
01:54:18,859 --> 01:54:23,489
that if we get rid of Beale, we should
maintain a respectable share...

1653
01:54:23,572 --> 01:54:25,782
with a comparable Q level.

1654
01:54:25,866 --> 01:54:29,328
The other show segments, Sybil the
Soothsayer, Jim Webbing, Vox Populi...

1655
01:54:29,411 --> 01:54:32,498
have all developed
their own audiences.

1656
01:54:32,539 --> 01:54:37,127
Our AR reports show that it is Beale
that is the destructive force here.

1657
01:54:38,337 --> 01:54:40,714
Minimally, we're talking about...

1658
01:54:40,756 --> 01:54:43,759
a ten-point differential in shares.

1659
01:54:43,842 --> 01:54:45,803
I think Joe oughta spell it out
for us.

1660
01:54:47,805 --> 01:54:50,891
A 28 share
is 80,000 dollar minutes.

1661
01:54:50,974 --> 01:54:53,685
I think we can sell complete positions
on the whole.

1662
01:54:53,727 --> 01:54:56,438
As a matter of fact, we're just getting
into the pre-Christmas gift-sellers...

1663
01:54:56,522 --> 01:55:00,108
and the agencies are coming back to me
with four-dollar CPMs.

1664
01:55:00,192 --> 01:55:05,197
If that's any indication, we're talking
$40-$45 million loss in annual revenues.

1665
01:55:05,280 --> 01:55:08,534
- Want the flak from the affiliates?
- We know all about it, Herb.

1666
01:55:08,575 --> 01:55:12,329
You would describe Mr. Jensen's position
on Beale as inflexible?

1667
01:55:12,412 --> 01:55:15,290
Intractable and adamantine.

1668
01:55:17,167 --> 01:55:20,379
What do we do about this Beale
son of a bitch?

1669
01:55:22,548 --> 01:55:24,800
I suppose we'll have to kill him.

1670
01:55:27,678 --> 01:55:30,639
I don't suppose you have any ideas
on that, Diana?

1671
01:55:34,101 --> 01:55:35,561
Well...

1672
01:55:37,437 --> 01:55:40,107
what would you fellas say
to an assassination?

1673
01:55:42,025 --> 01:55:44,570
I think I can get
the Mao Tse-tung people...

1674
01:55:44,653 --> 01:55:47,239
to kill Beale for us
as one of their shows.

1675
01:55:48,365 --> 01:55:53,036
In fact, it'll make a hell of
a kick-off show for the season.

1676
01:55:53,120 --> 01:55:56,039
We're facing heavy opposition on the
other networks for Wednesday nights...

1677
01:55:56,123 --> 01:55:59,585
and the "Mao Tse-tung Hour"
could use a sensational opener.

1678
01:56:01,795 --> 01:56:05,424
It could be done right on camera
in the studio.

1679
01:56:07,092 --> 01:56:09,303
We oughta get a fantastic
look-in audience...

1680
01:56:09,386 --> 01:56:12,514
for the assassination of Howard Beale
as our opening show.

1681
01:56:13,599 --> 01:56:16,310
If Beale dies...

1682
01:56:16,351 --> 01:56:20,439
what would our continuing obligation
to the Beale Corporation be?

1683
01:56:20,522 --> 01:56:23,609
I know our contract with Beale
contains a buy-out clause...

1684
01:56:23,650 --> 01:56:25,861
triggered by his death
or incapacity.

1685
01:56:25,944 --> 01:56:29,364
There must be a formula for
the computation of the purchase price.

1686
01:56:29,448 --> 01:56:33,452
Offhand, I think it was based on
a multiple of 1975 earnings...

1687
01:56:33,494 --> 01:56:37,331
with a base period in 1975,
which I think was 50 percent...

1688
01:56:37,372 --> 01:56:40,209
of salary, plus 25 percent
of the first year's profit...

1689
01:56:40,292 --> 01:56:43,420
multiplied by the unexpired portion
of the contract.

1690
01:56:43,504 --> 01:56:45,380
I don't think the show...

1691
01:56:45,464 --> 01:56:48,008
has any substantial syndication value,
would you say, Diana?

1692
01:56:48,091 --> 01:56:50,052
Syndication profits are minimal.

1693
01:56:51,220 --> 01:56:54,014
We're talking about a capital crime.

1694
01:56:55,057 --> 01:56:57,851
The network can't be implicated.

1695
01:57:08,195 --> 01:57:12,407
I hope you don't have any hidden
tape machines in this office, Frank.

1696
01:57:14,535 --> 01:57:17,496
The issue is,
shall we kill Howard Beale or not?

1697
01:57:17,579 --> 01:57:20,165
I'd like to hear
some more opinions on that.

1698
01:57:20,249 --> 01:57:23,710
I don't see we have any option.
Let's kill the son of a bitch.

1699
01:57:23,794 --> 01:57:25,462
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's hear it!

1700
01:57:25,546 --> 01:57:27,256
How do you feel?

1701
01:57:27,339 --> 01:57:29,007
We're mad as hell...

1702
01:57:29,049 --> 01:57:31,802
and we're not gonna
take this anymore!

1703
01:57:31,885 --> 01:57:35,639
Ladies and gentlemen, the "Network
News Hour" with Sybil the Soothsayer...

1704
01:57:39,226 --> 01:57:43,564
Jim Webbing and his
It's-the-Emmes-Truth Department.

1705
01:57:45,899 --> 01:57:49,987
Miss Mata Hari
and her skeletons in the closet.

1706
01:57:52,406 --> 01:57:54,700
Tonight another segment
of "Vox Populi."

1707
01:57:59,496 --> 01:58:03,876
And starring the Mad Prophet
of the Airways, Howard Beale!

1708
01:58:23,437 --> 01:58:27,858
...network news anchorman
on the UBS "Network News Show"...

1709
01:58:27,941 --> 01:58:31,904
known to millions
as the Mad Profit of the Airwaves...

1710
01:58:31,945 --> 01:58:35,741
was shot to death tonight in
a fusillade of automatic rifle fire...

1711
01:58:35,782 --> 01:58:38,035
just as he began
this evening's broadcast.

1712
01:58:38,118 --> 01:58:41,580
We never compromise,
so why should you?

1713
01:58:41,622 --> 01:58:45,042
Canada Dry Mixers.
Why compromise?

1714
01:58:45,125 --> 01:58:48,754
Have you seen the other side
of where you live?

1715
01:58:48,796 --> 01:58:52,633
- What's this stuff?
- Some cereal. It's good for you.

1716
01:58:52,716 --> 01:58:55,636
- Did you try it?
- I'm not gonna try it. You try it.

1717
01:58:55,677 --> 01:58:58,138
I'm not gonna try it.

1718
01:58:58,222 --> 01:59:00,224
- Let's get Mikey to try it!
- Yeah!

1719
01:59:00,307 --> 01:59:02,267
He won't eat it.
He hates everything.

1720
01:59:02,309 --> 01:59:06,271
The extraordinary incident occurred in
full view of his millions of viewers.

1721
01:59:06,355 --> 01:59:10,818
The assassins were members of
the Ecumenical Liberation Army...

1722
01:59:10,859 --> 01:59:12,986
two of whom were apprehended.

1723
01:59:13,070 --> 01:59:16,949
The leader of the group known
as the Great Ahmed Khan escaped.

1724
01:59:16,990 --> 01:59:19,493
This was the story of Howard Beale...

1725
01:59:19,535 --> 01:59:23,831
the first known instance of a man who
was killed because he had lousy ratings.
