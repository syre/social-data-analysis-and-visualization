1
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,699
<i>He was growing into middle age...</i>

2
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:18,200
<i>and was living then in a bungalow
on Woodland Avenue.</i>

3
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,499
<i>He installed himself
in a rocking chair...</i>

4
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,799
<i>and smoked a cigar down
in the evenings...</i>

5
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,899
<i>as his wife wiped her pink hands
on an apron...</i>

6
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,900
<i>and reported happily
on their two children.</i>

7
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,899
<i>His children knew his legs...</i>

8
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,899
<i>the sting of his mustache
against their cheeks.</i>

9
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:47,799
<i>They didn't know how their father made
his living or why they so often moved.</i>

10
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,600
<i>They didn't even know
their father's name.</i>

11
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,099
<i>He was listed in the city directory
as Thomas Howard.</i>

12
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,699
<i>And he went everywhere unrecognized...</i>

13
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,299
<i>and lunched with Kansas City
shopkeepers and merchants...</i>

14
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:07,100
<i>calling himself a cattleman
or a commodities investor...</i>

15
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,600
<i>someone rich and leisured
who had the common touch.</i>

16
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,399
<i>He had two incompletely healed
bullet holes in his chest...</i>

17
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,199
<i>and another in his thigh.</i>

18
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,899
<i>He was missing the nub
of his left middle finger...</i>

19
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,000
<i>and was cautious,
lest that mutilation be seen.</i>

20
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,799
<i>He also had a condition that was
referred to as "granulated eyelids"...</i>

21
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,599
<i>and it caused him
to blink more than usual...</i>

22
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,600
<i>as if he found creation
slightly more than he could accept.</i>

23
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,399
<i>Rooms seemed hotter
when he was in them.</i>

24
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,699
<i>Rains fell straighter.</i>

25
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,699
<i>Clocks slowed.</i>

26
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,900
<i>Sounds were amplified.</i>

27
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,999
<i>He considered himself
a Southern loyalist and guerrilla...</i>

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,199
<i>in a Civil War that never ended.</i>

29
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,400
<i>He regretted neither his robberies, nor
the 17 murders that he laid claim to.</i>

30
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,499
<i>He had seen another summer under
in Kansas City, Missouri...</i>

31
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,700
<i>and on September 5th
in the year 1881...</i>

32
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,500
<i>he was 34 years old.</i>

33
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,399
You just... You just slide them things
right in there, right in your sleeve...

34
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,599
and then, when you get ready,
you just shake it out.

35
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,900
Like that, right there.
You shake it out.

36
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,699
Mary Todd Lincoln, tyrant's wife, fall
into hysterics when the moon was full.

37
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,399
President's men would tie her up
with hay-baling wire...

38
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,799
keep her from ripping
her husband's ears off.

39
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,499
You never heard word one about the wife of
the Confederacy's Jefferson Davis, did you?

40
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,499
- I didn't.
- No, you didn't.

41
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,800
He did his duty by her.

42
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,899
- Oh, my God, I'm speaking to children.
- No, I get it, I get it, I get it.

43
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,399
The president of the Confederacy discerned
his wife's needs and satisfied them...

44
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,800
with the utmost skill
and the utmost courtesy.

45
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,899
- Charley, you spit all over my boot.
- Sorry. Sorry, sorry, Jesse.

46
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,200
- Here, get it off.
- I'll wipe it... I'll wipe it off.

47
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,099
But Abraham Lincoln probably sent
his wife on a shopping expedition.

48
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,700
- A three-act play.
- With money stole from us.

49
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,700
Chow!

50
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,799
I think insanity run on both sides
of that Lincoln family.

51
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,899
You're right about that.

52
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,400
The river... You jump in the river.

53
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,299
- Chow!
- Don't be shy now, Dick.

54
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,799
- One more piece of meat.
- When you diddle a lot...

55
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,200
There's a good piece of bacon fat
in there for him.

56
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,799
Excuse me.

57
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,300
I see I've traipsed right on in
and interrupted you.

58
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,099
Who are you, then?

59
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,900
Bob Ford.

60
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,500
Charley's brother?

61
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,400
Yeah.

62
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,999
I was lying when I said
I just happened down here.

63
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,200
I've been looking for you. I feel lousy
I didn't say so at the outset.

64
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,599
Folks take me for a nincompoop...

65
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,499
on account of the shabby first impression
I make, whereas I think of myself...

66
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,799
as being just a rung down
from the James brothers.

67
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,999
I was hoping if I ran into you
aside from those peckerwoods...

68
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,900
I could show you how special I am.

69
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,599
I honestly believe I'm destined
for great things, Mr. James.

70
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,900
I got qualities that don't come shining
through right at the outset.

71
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,700
You give me a chance, I'll get
the job done. I guarantee you that.

72
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,200
Hey, Dick, is it true
you diddled a squaw?

73
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,399
Come on, you can tell me. I've always
wanted to lay down with a redskin.

74
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,700
Well, Charley...

75
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,899
there's a feeling that
comes over you...

76
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,699
getting inside a woman whose hands
has scalped a congregation.

77
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,699
There's this thunderous sound
that comes from their cooch...

78
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,099
on account of the fact that
they birth a child standing upright...

79
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,299
like a wild animal.
- What's it sound like?

80
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:34,199
Whatever a thunderous cooch sounds like
there, Charley. I don't know.

81
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,799
No.

82
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,299
They got a noisy quim
on account of the fact that...

83
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:44,100
they use their cunnis as a saddlebag
to carry sundries across the plains.

84
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,499
Come on, what'd it really feel like?
Did it feel good?

85
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,999
Come on, fess up, now.

86
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,800
I like you, Charley.

87
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,999
I like you too, Charley.

88
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,900
Well...

89
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,900
You're not so special, Mr. Ford.

90
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,099
You're just like any other tyro who's
prinked himself up for an escapade.

91
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:10,800
Hoping to be a gunslinger
like them nickel books are about.

92
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,700
You may as well quench
your mind of it...

93
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
because you don't have
the ingredients, son.

94
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,799
Well, I'm sorry to hear
you feel that way...

95
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,900
as I put such stock
in your opinions.

96
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,399
As for me being a gunslinger, I've just
got this one granddaddy Paterson Colt...

97
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,099
and a borrowed belt to stick it in.

98
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,300
But I also got an appetite
for greater things.

99
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,600
I hoped by joining up with you, it'd put
me that much closer to getting them.

100
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,100
Well, what am I supposed
to say to that?

101
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,499
Let me be your sidekick tonight.

102
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,799
Sidekick?

103
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,099
So you can examine my grit
and intelligence.

104
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,999
I don't know what it is about you...

105
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,499
but the more you talk,
the more you give me the willies.

106
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,299
Now, I don't believe I want you anywhere
within earshot this evening, okay?

107
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,700
You understand?

108
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:34,200
- Well, I'm sorry...
- Why don't you just get now? Scat.

109
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,500
All right.

110
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,099
I was with a girl once, wasn't a squaw.

111
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,299
But she was pretty.

112
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:54,600
She had yellow hair like a...

113
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,499
Oh, like something.

114
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,499
Like hair bobbed from
a ray of sunlight?

115
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,099
Yeah. Yeah, like that.

116
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,999
Boy, you... You talk good.

117
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,600
You can hide things in vocabulary.

118
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,399
Maybe you and me could write
her a note, send it by post?

119
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,199
See, all you gotta do, Ed...

120
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,400
is predict her needs
and beat her to the punch.

121
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,099
Well, this girl, she has
a real specific job.

122
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,799
- Specific?
- We was only together once.

123
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,699
She...

124
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:37,399
She was afraid of lightning,
and she came up under the wagon and...

125
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,499
just cuddled right up to me.

126
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,400
She give me a kind price too.

127
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,500
Well, I'll be. That is specific.

128
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,799
Yeah, sure,
she'd been with other people...

129
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,999
but the kind of things
she said to me...

130
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
people just don't say
unless they really mean it.

131
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,199
<i>My love said she would marry only me</i>

132
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,399
<i>And Jove himself could
not make her care.</i>

133
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,199
<i>For what women say to
lovers, you'll agree</i>

134
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,200
<i>One writes on running water or on air.</i>

135
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,300
My God, that's good.
Let's write her that.

136
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,299
No.

137
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,600
Poetry don't work on whores.

138
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,800
How do you do?

139
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,300
Am I too late
to wish you a happy birthday?

140
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,799
How'd you know?

141
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,199
You'd be surprised
at what I got stored away.

142
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,999
I'm an authority on the James boys.

143
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,400
Is you?

144
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,899
Well... Well, your brother Frank and I,
we just had a real nice visit.

145
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:55,399
Just chit-chatting about this and that,
right over there.

146
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,499
And must've been a hundred subjects
entertained...

147
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,800
Good Lord, you know
what this stew needs?

148
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,399
Dumplings?

149
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,499
Noodles.

150
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,999
You eat yourself some noodle stew
and your clock'll tick all night.

151
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,800
You ever see that woman up in Fayette?
Suck noodles up her nose.

152
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,599
- In Fayette?
- I don't believe I have.

153
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,799
You never heard of her, huh?

154
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,400
You got canals up there
you never dreamed of.

155
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,499
I don't like to harp on a subject...

156
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,299
I don't care who comes with me.
Never have.

157
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,800
That's why they call me gregarious.

158
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,999
I hear you and young Stovepipe here
had a real nice visit.

159
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,399
Your boys have got about a acre
of lumber to haul, dingus.

160
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,600
You better goose them down yonder.

161
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:04,299
<i>The James Gang committed over 25 bank,
train and stagecoach robberies...</i>

162
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,699
<i>from 1867 to 1881.</i>

163
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,899
<i>But except for Frank and Jesse James...</i>

164
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:15,399
<i>all the original members
were now either dead or in prison.</i>

165
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:20,899
<i>- mine eye
All my soul and all my every part</i>

166
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,399
<i>And for this sin, there is no remedy</i>

167
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,399
<i>It is so grounded inward in my heart.</i>

168
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,799
<i>So for their last
robbery at Blue Cut...</i>

169
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,599
<i>the brothers recruited a gang
of petty thieves and country rubes...</i>

170
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,200
<i>culled from the local hillsides.</i>

171
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,200
Right on schedule, Buck!

172
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,199
Snuff those lanterns!

173
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,199
Look at those fools. They're gonna trip
and shoot each other into females.

174
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,200
I bet you I could find them husbands
if they do.

175
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,800
Fan out!

176
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,300
Hold your fire!

177
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,500
- Watch him!
- Going down.

178
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,200
Hold your fire, you idiots!

179
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,500
Hold your fire!

180
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,099
Let me in.

181
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,199
Buck! Boys!

182
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,099
Buck, this way!

183
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,400
Do you think that lock will hold?

184
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,099
No, I don't.

185
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,100
Let's go, let's go.

186
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,700
Let's not get clever, nor courageous,
any of you.

187
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,300
Hey there, boys!
These are all for me?

188
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,600
Looks like Christmas morning in here.

189
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,000
Hey, friend.

190
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,999
You mind if I have a peek around?

191
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,100
This shit. Nope.

192
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,200
Nope.

193
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,199
You got anything good here?

194
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,600
It could be.

195
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,300
Open that safe.

196
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,200
Do it!

197
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,999
- You didn't have to bop him.
- Yeah, he did. They needed convincing.

198
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,699
They got their company rules,
I got my mean streak...

199
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,000
and that's how
we get things done around here.

200
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:22,900
- Get on over here and attend to this thing.
- Come on, go.

201
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,399
Hold your fire, you idiots!

202
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,100
Dig deeper.

203
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,299
- Come on!
- Give me your money.

204
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,399
- And you, stand up.
- Let's see your hands.

205
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,000
What have you got?

206
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,500
Speak English.

207
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,300
Money. Money. You understand that?

208
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,300
Give me your money!

209
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,700
There's some receipts.

210
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,300
I got fives.

211
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,300
Jesse. Jesse.

212
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,600
Don't look good.

213
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,200
There ain't no 100,000 dollars
in here, Dick.

214
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,600
Get down on your knees.

215
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,599
Why?

216
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,100
Well, you ought to pray.

217
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,500
I'm gonna kill you.

218
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,900
Get at!

219
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,500
You're gonna have to make me.

220
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,500
All right.

221
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:31,100
Don't shoot him! No, don't shoot him.

222
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:46,100
Don't tell me what I can
and cannot do, Ed.

223
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,900
Round them up!

224
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,999
<i>Chicago newspaper publishers made a great
deal of the Blue Cut train robbery...</i>

225
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,199
<i>alleging that in no state
but Missouri...</i>

226
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,299
<i>would the James brothers be tolerated
for 12 years.</i>

227
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,600
Hey.

228
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,400
Can you keep a secret?

229
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,100
It depends on what you're concealing.

230
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,599
You afraid of the dark?

231
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,599
No.

232
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,600
You superstitious?

233
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:50,000
I put... I put an acorn in the window
to keep the lightning out.

234
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:43,199
Kid, you must've crept
up on cat's paws.

235
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,600
I'll wager that's the first and last
time you'll ever be caught off-guard.

236
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,900
How old are you?

237
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,700
Twenty.

238
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:00,699
Except, well, I guess I won't
really be 20 till...

239
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,699
Till January, so...

240
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,500
I'm 19.

241
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Yeah, you feel older than that, though,
don't you?

242
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,600
Yeah, I do.

243
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:35,900
Hey, Frank, you...
You think the sheriff's out already?

244
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,700
- More than likely.
- Yeah.

245
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,699
I had a real fine time tonight.

246
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,099
- You think so?
- Yup. Yeah.

247
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,599
Hey, I wasn't just flapping my lips
about my kid brother and me.

248
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,399
What I figured was if you and Jesse could
gauge our courage and our daring...

249
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,799
you might just make us
your regular sidekicks.

250
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,900
Your courage and your daring.

251
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:07,499
I about heard all I want to about sidekicks.
You sound like your damn brother.

252
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:12,599
Yeah. Well, I'll be square with you,
it's Bob who put me up to it. He's...

253
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,099
He's got plans for the James boys
I can't even get the hang of.

254
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,800
- They're that complicated.
- Yeah?

255
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,799
Well, you can just
get shed of that idea.

256
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,999
Because after tonight,
there'll be no more shenanigans.

257
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,999
You can jot that down
in your little diary.

258
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,899
September 7th, 1881, the James Gang
robbed one last train at Blue Cut...

259
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,300
and gave up their nightriding for good.

260
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,500
Wait.

261
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,600
Well, how are you gonna
make your living?

262
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:56,000
Maybe I'll sell shoes.

263
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,099
I can't believe I woke
up this morning...

264
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,599
wondering if my daddy
would loan me his overcoat...

265
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,599
and here it is just past midnight...

266
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,399
I've already robbed a rail road train
and I'm sitting in a rocking chair...

267
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,299
chatting with none other
than Jesse James.

268
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,900
Yeah, it's a wonderful world.

269
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,399
What's this?

270
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,000
Oh, yeah.

271
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:39,499
I was real agitated this morning, so I was
wondering if I would know you or Frank...

272
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:45,199
tell you all apart, and so I had
this clipping that described you both.

273
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,499
Want me to read it?

274
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,799
Go on.

275
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:53,799
Well... I gotta find it. Hold on.

276
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,199
Here. Here.

277
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,599
"Jesse James, the youngest, has a face
as smooth and innocent as a schoolgirl.

278
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:05,099
The blue eyes, very clear and
penetrating, are never at rest.

279
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,799
His form is tall and graceful
and capable of great endurance...

280
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,399
and great effort.

281
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,300
Jesse is lighthearted, reckless,
and devil-may-care.

282
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,899
- There's always a smile on his lips..."
- All right, all right, all right.

283
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:23,600
Well, yeah, then it just... Frank, Frank,
Frank. That's nothing. And then...

284
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,699
You know what I got
right next to my bed?

285
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:42,899
<i>Is The Train Robbers, or, A Story
of the James Boys by R.W. Stevens.</i>

286
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,299
I mean, many's the night I stayed up...

287
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,599
with my eyes open
and my mouth open...

288
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,700
just reading about your escapades
in the Wide Awake Library.

289
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,500
They're all lies, you know.

290
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,900
Yeah, of course they are.

291
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:08,400
You don't have to keep smoking that
if it's making you bungey.

292
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,899
<i>Alexander Franklin James
would be in Baltimore...</i>

293
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:38,500
<i>when he would read of
the assassination of Jesse James.</i>

294
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,500
<i>He had spurned his younger brother
for being peculiar and temperamental.</i>

295
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,899
<i>But once he perceived
that he would never see Jesse again...</i>

296
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:06,400
<i>Frank would be wrought-up,
perplexed, despondent.</i>

297
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,400
My brother and me are hardly
on speaking terms these days.

298
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:52,100
Well, I wasn't gonna mention it.

299
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,899
Are you scared?

300
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,199
No, I'm just surprised a little.

301
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,999
They ain't as succulent as I like,
the devil to clean...

302
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,199
but if a man skins them
and fries them in garlic and oil...

303
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,199
mercy, them's good eating.

304
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,500
Well, I never been that hungry.

305
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,300
I give them names.

306
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,200
Such as?

307
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,399
Such as enemies.

308
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:36,100
I give them names of enemies.

309
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:51,900
Go tell Wood and Charley
to get their gatherings together.

310
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,900
All right.

311
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,900
Me too?

312
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,000
You can stay.

313
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,000
All right.

314
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,900
Hey.

315
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,099
- What do you want, peckerwood?
- Nothing.

316
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,899
Except to say Jesse wants
you two to gather your parts...

317
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,699
get on your horses
and get out of town.

318
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,600
And me to stick around.

319
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,399
Well, whoa, I'm his cousin...

320
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,299
I'll have you know.

321
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,799
My mama's his daddy's sister.

322
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,900
Is that how they described it to you,
Wood?

323
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,999
You better watch your tongue,
young sapling.

324
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,499
Why is it me who's gotta rattle his
hocks out of town and not you, Bunny?

325
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,399
Put your horns away.
If I know Jess...

326
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,099
there's some real nasty
sad-suzie work's gotta be done...

327
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:54,099
and Bob's the ninny that has to do it.

328
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,300
Oh, yeah, I'm sure that's it, Charley.

329
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:03,700
You only met him 12 hours ago.
He doesn't even know your name.

330
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:08,200
Wood! You tell your daddy
I'll be in Kentucky in October.

331
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,599
We can hunt some birds together.

332
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,799
All right.

333
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:18,200
So how come it's Bob who gets to stay?

334
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,800
Bob's gonna move my gear to a house
down the street.

335
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,699
See?

336
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,399
- I don't mind.
- Yeah, well.

337
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,400
Sounds like an adventure.

338
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,399
<i>They moved to 1017 Troost Avenue
at night...</i>

339
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:43,800
<i>so that the neighborhood couldn't get a
good look at them or their belongings.</i>

340
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,399
<i>Then Bob thought Jesse
would give him eight hours' sleep...</i>

341
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,700
<i>and a daydreaming goodbye.</i>

342
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,999
<i>But with a second day
in the Thomas Howard house...</i>

343
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,899
<i>Bob thought he might never go...</i>

344
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:03,600
<i>but might be brought in
as a good-natured cousin to the boy...</i>

345
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,800
<i>and a gentleman helper to Zee.</i>

346
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,799
<i>He went everywhere with Jesse.</i>

347
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,299
<i>They made trips
to the Topeka Exchange Saloon...</i>

348
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:18,199
<i>where Jesse could spend nearly
60 minutes sipping one glass of beer...</i>

349
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,099
<i>and still complain about feeling tipsy.</i>

350
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,299
<i>Bob would rarely vouchsafe his opinions
as they talked.</i>

351
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:29,599
<i>If spoken to, he would fidget and grin.</i>

352
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,799
<i>If Jesse palavered with another person,
Bob secretaried their dialogue...</i>

353
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,699
<i>getting each inflection,
reading every gesture and tic...</i>

354
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:41,099
<i>as if he wanted to compose
a biography of the outlaw...</i>

355
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:45,000
<i>or as if he were preparing
an impersonation.</i>

356
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,700
Go away.

357
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:09,300
Used to be couldn't no one sneak up
on Jesse James.

358
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:13,000
Now you think otherwise?

359
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,300
I ain't never seen you
without your guns, neither.

360
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,899
I can't figure it out.

361
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,499
Do you wanna be like me...

362
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,900
or do you wanna be me?

363
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:46,000
I'm just making fun, is all.

364
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,199
<i>Bob was sent away cordially
the next day...</i>

365
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,899
<i>with a goodbye from Jesse...</i>

366
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:57,700
<i>but nothing from Zee
beyond what good manners demanded.</i>

367
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,100
<i>It was 40 miles to his sister's farm
from Kansas City.</i>

368
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:09,700
<i>And it was well into the afternoon
by the time he arrived there.</i>

369
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,999
<i>Mrs. Martha Bolton rented
the Harbison farm in 1879...</i>

370
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,099
<i>just after becoming a widow.</i>

371
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,999
<i>And she made a good income
by giving rooms and meals...</i>

372
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,299
<i>to her brothers Charley, Wilbur and Bob,
and to members of the James Gang...</i>

373
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,999
<i>who would appear
whenever they needed seclusion.</i>

374
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,899
Dick! You're gonna make her sick!

375
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:33,399
She's gonna upchuck
if you don't watch out!

376
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,799
<i>Wood Hite had been spurned by Martha
in his affections...</i>

377
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,599
<i>and his attempt to switch his pursuit
to her daughter...</i>

378
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,699
<i>was being thwarted by Dick Liddil.</i>

379
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:45,199
Wait a second, you assured me
that you were not ticklish.

380
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,399
Howdy!

381
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,399
What's going on, now?
What's going on...?

382
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,399
- Howdy!
- Were you fibbing about that?

383
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,100
- No.
- Not at all.

384
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,599
You're not supposed to peek, Dick.

385
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,199
Well, you're just so pretty
I can't help myself.

386
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,899
- You need to be warning him about that.
- Howdy.

387
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:05,999
Worry about the field instead, might
be able to worry about the work...

388
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,599
Howdy!

389
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,699
- Finally home.
- I'm so glad, Bob.

390
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,599
I'm in that room too, Bob.
Don't mess with my things.

391
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,500
All right, Grandpa.

392
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,199
"July 9th. Diligence, tact,
and a keen sense of responsibility...

393
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:33,500
capacity for detail are your dominant
traits. Your sense of duty's strong."

394
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,699
How long you been there?

395
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:22,500
Just now arrived. Did I miss much?

396
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:26,999
Not unless you never seen a man
wash his dirty carcass before.

397
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,599
Boy, you got a big old pecker
for being such a little squirrel.

398
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,500
That what you come here to see, Dick?

399
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,900
No.

400
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,499
Your brother said that Jesse kept
you in Kansas City some extra days.

401
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,500
What was the reason?

402
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:48,099
Well, I'm not at liberty
to say exactly.

403
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:54,500
Let me ask you this. Did Jesse mention
that me and Cummins were in cahoots?

404
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,099
Is that so?

405
00:37:56,100 --> 00:38:00,399
Oh, dear. I went on and said too much,
have I?

406
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,400
Well, who else is
partners with you two?

407
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:09,599
See, he'll cut our throats if he finds
out. You don't know him like I do.

408
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,699
You do Jesse dirt,
you connive behind his back...

409
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,400
boy, he'll come after you
with a cleaver.

410
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,600
So, what are you two cahoots
cooking up?

411
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,300
Don't know that I should say.

412
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,799
I'm not gonna wheedle
the dang news from you.

413
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,799
How about we'll leave it a mystery...

414
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:36,900
and then we won't neither one of us
regret our little chat?

415
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,400
Can you hand me that
six-gun there, Bob?

416
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:57,899
If you so much as mention my name
to Jesse...

417
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,399
boy, I'll find out about it.

418
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,599
You had better believe that.

419
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,799
And I'll look you up.

420
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:11,399
I'll knock on your door,
and I will be as mad as a hornet.

421
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,500
I will be hot.

422
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:19,100
You be careful with that iron, Dick.

423
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:30,299
You know where I stand on these matters
and that's all there is to it.

424
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:34,800
Me and you can be as friendly as pigs
from now on.

425
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,099
I'm Bunny Ford, stick your hands
up in the air!

426
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,700
Mister.

427
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,200
Oh, you have some nerve.

428
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:19,900
We were just reading about the
James boys among the Mexicans.

429
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,599
What's this? This ain't Jesse.

430
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,899
- You don't know that.
- He would've never wore no mustache.

431
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,399
Never was anywheres near a cannon.

432
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,999
Let me see that picture.

433
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,999
Boy, I can't even calculate
what I'm looking at.

434
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,299
- Give me that.
- Ever since he was a child...

435
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,599
Bob's collected whatsoever he could
find about the James brothers.

436
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,999
Yeah, got himself a little museum
in his room.

437
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,099
Next time you come snooping around,
you better strap on a shooting iron!

438
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,799
Well, you can see how scared I am.

439
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:54,600
You too, Wood Hite. Cross me again,
I'll put a bullet through your head!

440
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,599
Boy, you...

441
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,399
Son, you better recollect
who my cousin is...

442
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,599
because you've seemed to misremembered
that Jesse loves me like the Good Book.

443
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:07,399
Now, you may play it like you're a
dangerous person in the grocery store...

444
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,999
but don't misremember
who you be accounting to...

445
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,599
if I so much get my feelings hurt.
- I don't care!

446
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,299
Do I have to yell "suwee"?

447
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,499
Why don't we make up,
be pleasant for once?

448
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,499
Why don't we pass the evening
like pleasant human beings?

449
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,600
I like your nickel suit, cowboy.

450
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,200
You see something?

451
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,300
Just a bird.

452
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,199
<i>The month of October came...</i>

453
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,799
<i>and Jesse began seeing Pinkerton
operatives in every floor walker...</i>

454
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:07,100
<i>street sweeper, and common man
poking about in a store.</i>

455
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,199
<i>On the morning of the 11th,
he would wake his wife...</i>

456
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:16,300
<i>with the Scripture pertaining to
the Holy Family's flight into Egypt.</i>

457
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:24,900
<i>Overnight, the Thomas Howard clan
vanished from Kansas City.</i>

458
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:37,399
<i>Shortly thereafter,
four of the Blue Cut train robbers...</i>

459
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:41,100
<i>were arrested in shacks near Glendale.</i>

460
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,800
<i>How Jesse could have known
remains a mystery.</i>

461
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,099
<i>Theirs was a wandering existence.</i>

462
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,999
<i>Men who choose to be outlaws...</i>

463
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,900
<i>cannot afford to remain in one place
for very long.</i>

464
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,399
- Well, goodness. Maybe I'll change my mind.
- Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

465
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,799
- Martha.
- Buck up, man.

466
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,599
<i>Wood and Dick would bicker
across the entire state of Kentucky...</i>

467
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:34,699
<i>until they made Russellville, home
of Major George Hite, Wood's father...</i>

468
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:38,700
<i>and uncle to Frank and Jesse James.</i>

469
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:48,899
You stay away from this one.

470
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,799
She's my daddy's wife.

471
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,100
You got it?

472
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,600
Did you cook this, ma'am?

473
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,200
I've got a nigger woman.

474
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,300
How's that?

475
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:35,499
Dick asked if I cooked this.

476
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,900
Did you?

477
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,500
No.

478
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,100
She knew what he was like
when she married him.

479
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:23,900
I guess we're the night owls,
you and I.

480
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,100
I'm glad.

481
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,900
How come?

482
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,499
You're interesting to look at.

483
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:38,900
You have a real pleasant disposition.

484
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:44,400
And I don't know, you sort of
make me feel warm all over.

485
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:51,100
You know, I'm what they call a...
An inamorato.

486
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:59,700
Well, I knew
there had to be a name for it.

487
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,999
You and the Hites
don't get along too well...

488
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,100
if I'm to trust Wood and his version
of the situation.

489
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,599
We hate each other like poison,
if you wanna know the truth.

490
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:18,200
Most of the Hites wouldn't spit on me
if I was on fire.

491
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,499
They say that when a woman's on fire...

492
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:27,800
you're supposed to roll her around on the
ground and cover her with your body.

493
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:31,900
Well, you are a naughty tease.

494
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,800
Isn't it about bedtime?

495
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,000
Well, I'll just kiss
those dainty nubbins.

496
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,300
Good night.

497
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,900
Would you stop?

498
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:25,200
Boy, I believe I drank too much coffee.

499
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,200
I gotta go visit the privy
something terrible.

500
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:03,599
This is embarrassing.

501
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:08,600
Now, you go ahead and do your duty.
I don't mind.

502
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:13,099
I've sort of got stage fright with
a strange man in the commode with me.

503
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:14,899
I ain't strange.

504
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:18,700
I'm built just like the rest of them.

505
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:24,600
You look awful pretty.

506
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:27,199
Do I?

507
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:32,800
I haven't never in my life seen
such well-shaped limbs.

508
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,500
Is Wood awake?

509
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,000
It's just me.

510
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:57,800
And I bet you thought I was a lady.

511
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:46,900
Well, you ain't much of a housekeeper,
are you?

512
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,900
You didn't just happen by.

513
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:56,100
Why not?

514
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:26,200
Go on and take a load off your feet.

515
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,799
You ought to get yourself a wife.

516
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,399
Yeah.

517
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,100
I suppose.

518
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:02,999
I was gonna ask Martha.
Charley's sister.

519
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,300
I was gonna ask her
if she could imagine it.

520
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:11,099
But I guess Wood has plans of his own.

521
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:14,600
And there's always Dick Liddil
getting in the way.

522
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,499
I'll give it some thought, though.

523
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:20,400
Your crops come in?

524
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:26,700
No, I don't got much.
Just a garden patch and a pasture.

525
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:31,300
I was sick at planting time.

526
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,800
So...

527
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:38,300
Ed, how you feeling now?

528
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,200
Why?

529
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,300
You're acting queer.

530
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:58,499
Well, you and me ain't been
just real good friends lately.

531
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:02,500
That's not your fault,
you understand that.

532
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,500
You hear talk, though.

533
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:10,000
Talk?

534
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,100
People tell you things.

535
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:25,700
Why don't you give me an example?

536
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:32,200
Jim Cummins come by here.

537
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,100
Jim Cummins.

538
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:38,600
Oh, and Jim says:

539
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:44,900
"You know them boys
that got caught in the Blue Cut deal?"

540
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:51,600
Well, Jim says he got word...

541
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:58,300
that you're planning to kill them.

542
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:02,400
Why would I do that?

543
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,500
That's just talk probably.

544
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:13,799
Jim Cummins. He say anything else?

545
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:18,600
Nope. No, that was it, basically.

546
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:31,400
That still don't explain
why you're scared.

547
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:37,699
Well, I'm in the same situation,
you see.

548
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,399
I was terrified I saw you ride up.

549
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,599
- I just happened by, Ed.
- Suppose you heard gossip, though.

550
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,699
Suppose you heard Jim Cummins
come by, you might have thought...

551
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:51,799
that we were planning to capture you or
get that reward, and that ain't true.

552
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:55,000
But you might have suspected it.

553
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:15,299
Haven't heard a lick of gossip lately.

554
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:20,600
I got 600 dollars stashed away.
I don't need no governor's reward.

555
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,400
Well, it's the principle too.

556
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,299
Well...

557
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:35,700
- I'm glad I stopped by.
- Oh, me too.

558
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:03,600
What do you say
if we were to go for a ride?

559
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:11,400
We can go into town.
I'll buy you dinner.

560
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:15,300
Then I'll be on my way.

561
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,000
Okay.

562
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,200
You ready to go for a ride?

563
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:46,300
We going to your place?

564
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:53,300
You seen Ed Miller lately?

565
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,800
Nobody has.

566
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:03,200
Must have gone off to California.

567
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,600
I'd still like to know
where we're going.

568
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:18,700
If you were going to see Jim Cummins,
wouldn't you follow this road?

569
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,900
I guess so.

570
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,400
Howdy.

571
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:23,400
Oh, are you friends of my pa's?

572
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:30,300
We're friends of Jim Cummins.

573
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:36,599
Well, it so happens
he's been gone since August.

574
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:39,500
And never said where he gone to.

575
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,999
- I'm Matt Collins.
- Albert Ford.

576
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,800
Very happy to meet you.

577
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:59,000
- Dick Turpin.
- Pleased to make your acquaintance.

578
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,999
I don't know where he is!
Leave me alone!

579
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,700
Shut your mouth!
You shut your mouth!

580
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:20,299
- You shut your mouth.
- I don't know where he is!

581
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:23,199
- I don't know!
- Get in there.

582
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,399
Shut up.

583
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,800
- I don't know where he is!
- Shut up.

584
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,599
- I don't know!
- Shut up.

585
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,899
- Jesus.
- Shut up.

586
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,399
Jesse, he's just a kid.

587
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:37,199
He knows where his uncle Jim is and
that's gonna make him old soon enough.

588
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,699
- Maybe he doesn't know.
- He knows!

589
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:41,499
You need to ask and ask sometimes.

590
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:46,000
Sometimes a child don't remember so much
at first. But it'll come back to him.

591
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,899
My goodness, she's about to rip off,
sweetie.

592
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:52,099
Just a little more here
to get her started.

593
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:54,999
Then I think I can rip her off
like a page from a book.

594
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Jesus, he can't even talk.

595
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,699
Where's Jim?

596
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:03,299
Where's Jim?

597
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,399
Where's Jim? Where's Jim?

598
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:09,099
Where's Jim? Where's Jim? Where's Jim?

599
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:11,899
- Where's Jim?
- Quit it!

600
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:14,499
You bastard! I don't know where he is!

601
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:17,499
You won't believe me!
You never even gave me a chance!

602
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:20,400
You kept my... You kept my mouth shut!

603
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:24,499
I never know where Jim is or
when he comes! So leave me alone.

604
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:27,800
Get off me, you son of a bitch!

605
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:22,099
I'm worn out.

606
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:25,900
I can't. No, see...

607
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,099
My mind's all tangled anyway.

608
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:35,500
Little deals like this
just make me feel dirty.

609
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:58,600
Are you all right, Jesse?

610
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,199
<i>Jesse was sick...</i>

611
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:33,599
<i>with rheums, and aches
and lung congestions.</i>

612
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:37,699
<i>Insomnia stained
his eye sockets like soot.</i>

613
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:41,600
<i>He read auguries in
the snarled intestines of chickens...</i>

614
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:46,299
<i>or the blow of cat hair
released to the wind.</i>

615
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:52,200
<i>And the omens promised bad luck,
which moated and dungeoned him.</i>

616
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,699
How come it's you
that's gotta do all the chores?

617
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:40,800
Charley and Bob pay extry to Martha
so that they don't have to.

618
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:44,200
It still don't seem fair.

619
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:52,500
Martha.

620
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:56,900
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

621
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:02,900
You come from Kentucky?

622
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:10,200
Why do you have your head in a hole,
Martha?

623
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:16,900
Wood and Dick had a shooting scrape
a few months ago.

624
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:19,800
Cover the kettle, Ida.

625
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:27,400
And what did you and Dick
get in a scrape about?

626
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:34,499
Well, he tampered
with my daddy's wife...

627
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:37,999
while a pork chop
burned on the skillet...

628
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,500
so I shot at him.

629
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:49,900
Ida! Do not stick your thumb
in the cream when you skim it.

630
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:55,599
His chicanery and his
philandering ways...

631
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,699
has instigated such malice.

632
01:04:57,700 --> 01:05:02,600
He's a yellow snake in the grass
and he can't be trusted, Martha.

633
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:08,800
Dick told me a complete other version
of that affray.

634
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:12,799
Wood Hite's downstairs.

635
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:15,400
You mean he's here?

636
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:20,800
Yeah, he come in late last night.

637
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:24,899
Hey, simmer down!

638
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:30,300
Don't get into a fracas up there, you
boys! I've got breakfast almost ready.

639
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:43,400
He's still sucking air.

640
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:46,800
But I think he's a goner.

641
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:00,200
Maybe y'all better come wish him well
on his journey.

642
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:28,500
Wood?

643
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,499
You were a good fellow, Wood.

644
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:36,599
Oh, I sure hope you're not
in frightful pain, Wood.

645
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:41,200
I'd get you something to drink,
but I'm afraid you'd just choke on it.

646
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:44,099
Little Ida's gonna miss you.

647
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:47,100
So is the rest of the family.

648
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:53,900
Well, one thing's settled.
Can't take him into Richmond.

649
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:56,100
Why not?

650
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:59,399
Well, one, sheriff'll put Bob in jail.

651
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:03,399
And two, Jesse'll find out his cousin
Wood's been shot in our house...

652
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:07,700
and then that'll be the end
of each and every one of us.

653
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:20,799
"And in one merciless, violent thrust
broke in...

654
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:23,799
and carried all before him,
and scented and brewed...

655
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:26,499
reeking with blood of my virginity...

656
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:32,000
up to its utmost length in my body."

657
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:36,400
He ain't disappeared,
if that's what you were hoping.

658
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,499
What chapter you on?

659
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:47,699
She's met some Algerian corsair
down at Gibraltar.

660
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:50,900
Got herself all agitated.

661
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:54,599
How's that leg?

662
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:59,600
Full of torment, Bob.
Thanks for asking.

663
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:47,399
<i>Blessed are the poor in spirit...</i>

664
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:50,600
<i>for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</i>

665
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:57,600
Blessed are them that mourn,
for they shall be comforted.

666
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:01,700
Blessed are the...

667
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:06,700
Meek.

668
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:10,900
Blessed are the meek.

669
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:48,199
- Is it him?
- Yeah.

670
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:51,399
Why is he here? Does he know
about Wood, do you think?

671
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:53,899
I don't know. All I know is
he don't miss very much.

672
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:58,800
- What should I say about you if he asks?
- Tell him I'm in K.C. with Mattie.

673
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:04,599
He was buffalo hunting.
He was thrilled to meet yours truly.

674
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:08,699
Yeah, over there in Europe there's only
two Americans they know for certain...

675
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:12,500
Mark Twain and Jesse James.

676
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:17,100
- Why, it's the kid.
- How's everything?

677
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:21,399
- I never take off my gun belts.
- Yeah?

678
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:23,900
Good thinking.

679
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:32,300
Well, Charley, did you hurt your leg?

680
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:36,099
Yeah, I slipped...
I slipped off the roof...

681
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:39,899
and I smacked down into a snow bank
like a ton of stupidness.

682
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:42,699
One second I'm screaming,
"Whoa, Nelly!"

683
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:46,300
Next second, poof,
I'm neck-deep in snow.

684
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:53,000
Well, whatever possessed you
to climb a roof in December?

685
01:12:58,100 --> 01:13:01,799
There was a k..a kite. What
am I saying? There was a cat.

686
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:04,499
A cat. It was on the roof
and I went after him.

687
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:09,900
It was a tomcat yowling
and what all, and I slipped.

688
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,000
I thought maybe your club foot
was gaining on you.

689
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:35,499
Oh, yeah.

690
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:40,700
Dick went to Kansas City to be
with his wife. He was here for a bit.

691
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:02,499
Hey, here's a cute story, Jess.

692
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:05,999
Bobby was what, 11 or 12...

693
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,699
and you were by far
his most admired personage.

694
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:10,999
He couldn't get enough.

695
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:15,399
It was "Jesse this" and "Jesse that" and
"Jesse this" from sunrise to sunset.

696
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:16,699
Fascinating.

697
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:18,599
No, there's more. This is cute.

698
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:23,499
We're at supper and Bob asks,
"You know what size boot Jesse wears?"

699
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:27,399
- Charley, Jesse doesn't wanna hear this.
- Shush, now, Bob, let me tell it.

700
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:30,599
Bob says... He says, "You know
what size boot Jesse wears?"

701
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:33,999
He says, "Six and a half." He says,
"Ain't that a big enough boot...

702
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,899
for a man 5'8 "tall?"

703
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:39,899
I decided to josh him a little, you know,
he being my kid brother and everything.

704
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:43,199
So I said, "He doesn't have
toes is why."

705
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:44,899
That's a really stupid story.

706
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:49,699
"He was dangling his feet off a culvert
and a catfish nibbled his toes off."

707
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:53,300
Bob taxed himself trying to picture it.

708
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:02,799
That'd be a good joke if it was funny.

709
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:06,200
Isn't that a cute story, Jess?

710
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:19,000
Give me some more conversations, Bob.

711
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:28,499
I got one. This one's about as
crackerjack. It's the one about your..

712
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:31,300
Let Bob tell it.

713
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:34,400
All right.

714
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:42,299
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

715
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:47,200
About how you and Jesse
have so much in common.

716
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:51,099
Go on, Bob.

717
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:53,799
Yeah, come on, Bob.

718
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:57,000
Tell us a story.

719
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:03,500
- Nope. No.
- Come on, entertain Jesse. He's here.

720
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:12,000
Come on.

721
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,099
Well, if you'll pardon my saying so,
I guess...

722
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:27,000
it is interesting the many ways
you and I overlap and whatnot.

723
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:30,399
I mean, you begin with our daddies.

724
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:33,499
Your daddy was a pastor
at the New Hope Baptist Church...

725
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:39,100
and my daddy was a pastor
at the church in Excelsior Springs.

726
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:44,900
You're the youngest of three James boys,
and I'm the youngest of five Ford boys.

727
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:48,699
Between Charley and me,
there's another brother, Wilbur...

728
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:50,999
with six letters in his name.

729
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:56,799
And between Frank and you, is another
brother Robert, also with six letters.

730
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:01,500
And my Christian name
is Robert, of course.

731
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:04,199
You have blue eyes, I have blue eyes.

732
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:09,100
You're 5'8 "tall, I'm 5'8" tall.

733
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:18,499
Me, I must have had a list as long as
your nightshirt when I was 12, but...

734
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:22,900
I seem to have lost some curiosities
over the years.

735
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:43,300
Ain't he something?

736
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:59,499
Did I ever tell you the story about
that scalawag, George Shepherd?

737
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:01,599
Shepherd's one of
Quantrill's lieutenants.

738
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:04,799
He give me a story much like Bob's
what bring him to mind.

739
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,499
Going on about how much
we had in common, and so on...

740
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:10,199
so he could get in the gang.

741
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:13,499
How could I have known
he had a grudge against me?

742
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:18,199
How could I have known
he was lying to get on my good side?

743
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:23,299
I said, "George, come on aboard.
Glad to have you."

744
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:29,000
George thought he was smart,
except he wasn't.

745
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:32,399
One morning, George rides into camp...

746
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:35,500
and about 20 guns open up on him.

747
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:43,700
See, old George, he only had one eye. You
gotta have two eyes, you wanna get Jesse.

748
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:51,700
You ought not think of me
like you do George Shepherd.

749
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:55,299
You brought him to mind.

750
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:58,500
Well, it's not very flattering.

751
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:07,299
Sure is good eating, Martha.

752
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:09,699
Well, I'm so glad you enjoyed it.

753
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:12,700
How come George
had a grudge against you?

754
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:21,700
I said, how come George
had a grudge against you?

755
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:31,499
Well, you see, George had a nephew
he wanted me to protect during the war.

756
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,899
This nephew had 5000 dollars on him.

757
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:38,599
It just so happens he winds up killed
and someone swipes that money.

758
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:42,699
And when George is in prison,
someone whispers to him:

759
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:47,300
"It was Jesse James
slit the boy's throat."

760
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:54,500
It was just mean gossip, was it?

761
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:59,600
Bob's the expert. Let's put it to him.

762
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:06,399
Oh, dear, I made him cranky.

763
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:10,299
I'm not cranky. I just been
through this before is all.

764
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:13,699
Most people get around on making fun
of me. They don't ever let up.

765
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:15,899
Someone's getting
awful fresh over there.

766
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:19,500
Woman, shut your face for once.

767
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,099
Don't want you to skip off
to your room and pout...

768
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:31,499
without knowing why I come by
for this visit.

769
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:33,899
Why? So you could
tell us how sorry you are...

770
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:37,300
you had to slap
our cousin Albert around?

771
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,999
I come by...

772
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,599
to ask if one of you two Fords...

773
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:59,399
would care to ride with me
in a journey or two.

774
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:02,899
I guess we both agree
it ought to be Charley.

775
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:06,600
You've been acting sort of testy.

776
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:39,499
Have you seen Wood Hite lately?

777
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:43,900
No. Not at all.

778
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,799
I swear that stew
had some squirrel meat in it.

779
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:57,299
- Still arguing with you, is it?
- Yeah.

780
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:59,399
- You're Charles Ford?
- Yes, ma'am.

781
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:02,300
You've seen me once or twice before.

782
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:05,299
I got a letter from George Hite.

783
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:09,100
He hasn't seen hide nor hair of him.

784
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:12,699
And you say you haven't seen Wood?

785
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:16,700
No, I... I can't imagine
where he could be.

786
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:45,200
Yeah?

787
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:48,500
You finished with your sleeping?

788
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:52,500
I could use a couple more hours
if it's no trouble.

789
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:05,800
Yeah.

790
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:13,099
I been holding a discussion with myself
over if I ought to tell you this or no.

791
01:23:13,100 --> 01:23:16,700
My good side won out and...

792
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,800
Well, I wanna make a clean breast
of things.

793
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:25,299
Yeah, my mind's a little cobwebby
is the only drawback.

794
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:31,000
I could use a little...
A little more sleep.

795
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:35,600
You know I went to Kentucky?

796
01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:37,799
Yeah.

797
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:41,100
I come back through
Saline County and...

798
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,999
I think to myself:

799
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:49,700
"Why not stop by and see Ed Miller?"

800
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,600
So I do.

801
01:23:56,600 --> 01:24:00,800
Well, things are not
to my satisfaction.

802
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,700
Ed's got himself all worked up
over something.

803
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:10,500
I can see that he's lying like a rug.

804
01:24:12,900 --> 01:24:16,499
So I say to myself, "Enough's enough."

805
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:20,200
And I say to Ed, "Come on, Ed.

806
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:23,500
Let's go for a ride."

807
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:28,200
You understand what I'm saying?

808
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:32,400
Going for a ride is like...

809
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:36,600
Going for a ride
is like giving him what-for?

810
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:40,300
Exactly.

811
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:46,300
So...

812
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:50,800
Ed and Jesse...

813
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:55,500
they argue on the road.

814
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:02,300
Did you ever count the stars?

815
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:09,700
I can't ever get the same number.
They keep changing on me.

816
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:14,600
I don't even know
what a star is exactly.

817
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:19,499
Well, your body knows.

818
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:22,900
It's your mind that forgot.

819
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:35,700
You go on ahead, partner.
I'll catch up with you.

820
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,800
It's okay.

821
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:44,000
It's okay, sweetheart. It's okay.

822
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:49,500
And when push came to shove...

823
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:58,800
Jesse shot and killed him.

824
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:04,000
Jesse did.

825
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:08,200
You got it.

826
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:11,600
You...

827
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:29,499
So, you see, your...

828
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:32,099
Your cousin, he got off easy.

829
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:34,600
I was just playing with Albert.

830
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:39,199
Yeah, I made him squeal
once or twice myself.

831
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:43,100
I'm just not as thorough as you are.

832
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:57,500
You got a tale to swap with me now?

833
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:08,600
I don't get your meaning.

834
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:15,299
Seems to me, if you have something
to confess in exchange...

835
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:18,300
it'd only be right...

836
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:22,600
that you'd spit it out now.

837
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:36,500
I can't think of a single thing.

838
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:41,499
About Wood Hite, for example.

839
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:46,499
I'm not gonna... I been saying over and
over I can't figure out where he's gone.

840
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:49,699
Now, I'm not gonna change my story
just to have something to spit.

841
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:53,300
- Why was your brother so agitated?
- Which?

842
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:55,400
Bob.

843
01:28:55,900 --> 01:28:59,599
That's just his way. He's antsy.

844
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:02,000
You know?

845
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:20,700
You go on back to sleep now.

846
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:25,500
You got me agitated now, you see?

847
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:35,799
Yeah, just ain't no peace
when old Jesse's around.

848
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:39,700
You ought to pity my poor wife.

849
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:43,799
Ed Miller was a good friend of mine.

850
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:47,899
He introduced me to you
at that one poker game.

851
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:52,900
I'm a little angry with you, if you
wanna know the God's honest truth.

852
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:57,800
You ought to pity me too.

853
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:46,599
<i>As proof of his confederacy with the
James Gang, Bob told the authorities..</i>

854
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:50,299
<i>that Dick Liddil was sleeping over
at the rented farmhouse...</i>

855
01:30:50,300 --> 01:30:54,000
<i>while his ruined leg mended.</i>

856
01:30:58,100 --> 01:31:02,800
<i>And then, created a map
of the Harbison property...</i>

857
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:09,099
<i>leaving out the creek where
Wood Hite's remains now moldered.</i>

858
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:11,499
Right, you boys are cornered!

859
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:16,900
Come on out peaceably
and nobody'll get shot up!

860
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:23,100
Don't shoot!

861
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:29,700
Come on out and show yourself!

862
01:31:43,900 --> 01:31:45,699
Hello.

863
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:47,799
We got him.

864
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:50,700
Give me that Colt, son.

865
01:31:54,700 --> 01:31:57,499
- All right.
- Andrew James Liddil...

866
01:31:57,500 --> 01:32:00,599
I have a warrant here
for your arrest...

867
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:05,199
<i>Snowstorms would move over Missouri
that Sunday, February 19th...</i>

868
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:09,100
<i>shutting down commerce
for more than two days.</i>

869
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:12,699
- Go, go, go.
- Are the papers here?

870
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:16,499
- He wanted to know if the papers are here.
- I don't care what he wants.

871
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:18,599
<i>Yet this wouldn't
prevent Robert Ford...</i>

872
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:21,099
<i>from presenting himself
to Governor Crittenden...</i>

873
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:24,399
<i>at the Craig Rifles Ball on Wednesday.</i>

874
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:28,099
I deem it a great privilege
on this glorious occasion...

875
01:32:28,100 --> 01:32:30,299
to recognize publicly...

876
01:32:30,300 --> 01:32:33,099
the intelligent and
effective assistance...

877
01:32:33,100 --> 01:32:38,099
that Captain Henry Craig has rendered
the state of Missouri and myself...

878
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:41,999
in our joint quest
to rid Jackson County...

879
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,099
of the James band.

880
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:46,899
The task that Captain Craig
has assumed...

881
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:51,199
will require fearless courage,
extraordinary vigilance...

882
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:55,100
and an unerring selection
of instrumentalities.

883
01:32:55,300 --> 01:33:00,199
Well, I've gotten the signal from
my wife that enough is enough.

884
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:02,699
However, before I sit...

885
01:33:02,700 --> 01:33:06,299
I would like to ask you
to join me in a toast...

886
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:10,099
to a great son
of the state of Missouri...

887
01:33:10,100 --> 01:33:14,900
my friend, Henry Craig.
- Here, here.

888
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:29,200
Yes.

889
01:33:29,300 --> 01:33:32,000
Just let my attorney know.

890
01:33:38,700 --> 01:33:42,299
Who is that? Who is it?

891
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:44,800
Get out of the way now.

892
01:33:53,900 --> 01:33:58,199
You know, you're more goddamn trouble
than you're worth, Bob.

893
01:33:58,200 --> 01:33:59,999
I was just gonna say hello.

894
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,399
No, you weren't gonna do that, Bob.
That's not why you're down here.

895
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:08,899
You think it's your goddamn coming-out.
You think you're the belle of the ball.

896
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:13,299
Now you get upstairs and try to keep your
identity secret, you silly little bastard.

897
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:17,000
The governor'll see you in good time.
Take him up, boys.

898
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:23,999
<i>Bob would later be cross-examined
repeatedly...</i>

899
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,299
<i>about the exact nature of the deal
he had made with the authorities.</i>

900
01:34:28,300 --> 01:34:32,200
<i>And he was never consistent
in his recollections.</i>

901
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:40,299
My wife's asleep in the other room,
so let's speak as quietly as we can.

902
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:43,500
So you're Dick Little.

903
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:46,699
Liddil.

904
01:34:46,700 --> 01:34:48,899
I beg your pardon?

905
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:50,699
I spell it with two D's.

906
01:34:50,700 --> 01:34:53,199
He's given us a full confession,
governor.

907
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:55,499
Newspapers haven't caught onto it yet.

908
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:59,199
And you've guaranteed him
a conditional pardon...

909
01:34:59,200 --> 01:35:04,000
and amnesty for all the robberies
he's committed.

910
01:35:04,700 --> 01:35:06,900
You Robert Ford?

911
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:11,700
How old are you?

912
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,599
Twenty.

913
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:17,299
You surrender to Sheriff Timberlake
as well?

914
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:21,299
No, no, governor. That's his brother,
Charley Ford, he's in the James Gang.

915
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:24,199
But little Bob here,
we got nothing on Bob.

916
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:27,700
He's just acting in capacity as a...

917
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:32,100
private detective.

918
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:34,599
Jesse James sent me a telegram
last month...

919
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:37,899
saying he'd kill me
if he had to wreck a train to do it.

920
01:35:37,900 --> 01:35:40,699
He said once I got in his hands,
he'd cut my heart out...

921
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:43,399
and eat it in strips like it was bacon.

922
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:46,200
I'll wreck his train first.

923
01:35:52,900 --> 01:35:57,199
I'm sorry, Your Excellency.
I was thinking about something else.

924
01:35:57,200 --> 01:35:59,699
Jesse James is nothing more
than a public outlaw...

925
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:02,699
who made his reputation
by stealing whatever he wanted...

926
01:36:02,700 --> 01:36:05,099
killing whoever got in his way.

927
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:08,899
You'll hear some fools say he's getting
back at Republicans and Union men...

928
01:36:08,900 --> 01:36:11,799
for the wrongs his family suffered
during the war.

929
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:16,999
But his victims have scarcely been selected
with reference to their political views.

930
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,899
I'm saying his sins
will soon find him out.

931
01:36:19,900 --> 01:36:22,699
I'm saying his cup of iniquity is full.

932
01:36:22,700 --> 01:36:25,699
I'm saying Jesse James
is a desperate case...

933
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:29,500
and may require a desperate remedy.

934
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Y'all got the right man for the job.

935
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:54,299
Come on. Come on, now.

936
01:36:54,300 --> 01:36:56,800
Come on, now.

937
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:43,700
Have you ever considered suicide?

938
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:51,100
I can't say that I have. There's always
something else I wanted to do.

939
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:57,299
Or my predicaments changed, or I saw
my hardships from a different slant.

940
01:37:57,300 --> 01:38:02,600
You know all what can happen.
It never seemed respectable.

941
01:38:08,500 --> 01:38:11,499
I'll tell you one thing
that's for certain.

942
01:38:11,500 --> 01:38:16,400
You won't mind dying
once you've peeked over the other side.

943
01:38:19,300 --> 01:38:22,499
You'll no more wanna go back
to your body than...

944
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:25,800
you'd wanna spoon up your own puke.

945
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:34,399
Hey, since we're looking
to rob banks...

946
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:39,199
I was wondering if we could
add another fella to the gang...

947
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:43,700
and sort of see if we couldn't
come out of our next job alive.

948
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:51,200
Bob wanted to know could he ride with us
next time we took on a savings bank or...

949
01:38:56,600 --> 01:39:00,000
A savings bank or a...

950
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:03,400
A rail road.

951
01:39:09,900 --> 01:39:13,399
Bob isn't much more than a boy
to most appearances.

952
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:16,299
But there's about two tons
of sand in him.

953
01:39:16,300 --> 01:39:19,699
And he'll stand with a shooter
when that's what's called for.

954
01:39:19,700 --> 01:39:24,900
And he's smart too.
He's about as intricate as they come.

955
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:29,700
You forget I already met the kid.

956
01:39:30,100 --> 01:39:33,399
Hell, he surely thinks highly of you.

957
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:36,899
All of America thinks highly of me.

958
01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:40,299
Still, not like you got two million
names to snatch out of a sock...

959
01:39:40,300 --> 01:39:43,300
whenever you need a third man.

960
01:39:45,900 --> 01:39:49,099
I can see you trying to
wear me down on this.

961
01:39:49,100 --> 01:39:52,200
That's my main intention.

962
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:03,299
<i>Robberies would be conceived
but never carried out...</i>

963
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:07,499
<i>in Nebraska, Colorado and Missouri.</i>

964
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:08,699
<i>During this time...</i>

965
01:40:08,700 --> 01:40:12,899
<i>Henry Craig enjoined Robert Ford to return
to Elias' Grocery Store in Richmond...</i>

966
01:40:12,900 --> 01:40:16,399
<i>and await instructions
from Sheriff James Timberlake.</i>

967
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:18,899
All right, three cans...

968
01:40:18,900 --> 01:40:23,500
peaches. Two cans...

969
01:40:23,900 --> 01:40:26,699
Two cans sifted peas.

970
01:40:26,700 --> 01:40:29,200
One bottle...

971
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:35,200
Mary's Morning Tonic, and a half...

972
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:40,900
Half a sack of flour.

973
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:44,100
I'll be right with you.

974
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:02,400
I haven't seen any sign of him.

975
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:06,300
Well, do you know where he's living?

976
01:41:06,500 --> 01:41:08,800
No.

977
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,400
No?

978
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:16,099
Well, I can't guess how he does it...

979
01:41:16,100 --> 01:41:20,599
but he is always knowledgeable
about what's going on.

980
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:25,800
He's gonna know I've been here with you.
You ought to take that for granted.

981
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:32,300
And he will kill you
if he gets the chance.

982
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:38,100
Are you willing to risk that?

983
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:44,400
Yes, I am.

984
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:49,200
I've been a nobody all my life.

985
01:41:49,300 --> 01:41:51,399
I was the baby.

986
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:55,700
I was the one they made promises to
that they never kept.

987
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:01,600
And ever since I can remember it,
Jesse James has been as big as a tree.

988
01:42:04,100 --> 01:42:07,299
I'm prepared for this, Jim...

989
01:42:07,300 --> 01:42:09,699
and I'm gonna accomplish it.

990
01:42:09,700 --> 01:42:11,999
I know I won't get
but this one opportunity...

991
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,800
and you can bet your life
I'm not gonna spoil it.

992
01:42:26,900 --> 01:42:28,900
Well...

993
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:31,699
wait for your chance.

994
01:42:31,700 --> 01:42:35,899
Don't let yourself be found alone
with him, and do not...

995
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:39,200
let him get behind you.

996
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:08,600
You been chosen.

997
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:15,100
Well, what do you mean?

998
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:18,199
Well, your brother said that
you might wanna join us.

999
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:22,400
But maybe you like this grocery store
more than you said you did.

1000
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:27,599
- So you missed me?
- Oh, yeah.

1001
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:31,100
I been crying myself
to sleep every night.

1002
01:43:39,800 --> 01:43:41,899
Don't let him see us so much as wink.

1003
01:43:41,900 --> 01:43:46,499
He's suspicious as a damn coyote,
and he don't trust you one iota.

1004
01:43:46,500 --> 01:43:48,399
- Well, I guess that makes...
- Hey.

1005
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:53,800
He already put away Ed Miller. He said so
like it was something piddly he'd done.

1006
01:44:33,900 --> 01:44:39,000
If we're ever alone for more than a minute,
I'd like a chance to talk to you further.

1007
01:45:17,900 --> 01:45:21,000
They gave me ten days.

1008
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,400
For what?

1009
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:30,200
For arresting him.

1010
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:38,000
You and me, huh?

1011
01:45:40,700 --> 01:45:44,199
It's gonna happen one way or another,
Charley. It's gonna happen.

1012
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:46,899
So it might as well be us
who get rich on it.

1013
01:45:46,900 --> 01:45:50,899
- Bob, he's our friend.
- He murdered Ed Miller.

1014
01:45:50,900 --> 01:45:54,900
And he's gonna murder Liddil and
Cummins if the chance ever comes.

1015
01:45:55,400 --> 01:46:00,900
It seems to me Jesse's riding from
man to man, saying goodbye to the gang.

1016
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:04,800
So your friendship could put you
under the pansies.

1017
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:11,300
I'll grind it fine in my mind, Bob. I
can't go any further than that right now.

1018
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,400
You'll come around.

1019
01:46:16,600 --> 01:46:19,199
You think it's all made up, don't you?

1020
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:23,500
You think it's all yarns
and newspaper stories.

1021
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:33,700
He's just a human being.

1022
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:44,899
From now on, you two
won't go anywhere without me.

1023
01:46:44,900 --> 01:46:50,400
From now on, you'll ask for my permission!
From now on, you'll ask to be excused!

1024
01:47:45,400 --> 01:47:50,599
Charley, take them horses
around the barn. Bob, you go on inside.

1025
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:52,099
- Hello, Mary.
- Hi.

1026
01:47:52,100 --> 01:47:56,100
Look at this rotten parsnip
I found in the compost heap.

1027
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:08,200
You never mentioned Bob would be here.

1028
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:15,500
Maybe he was saving it
as a pleasant surprise.

1029
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:22,800
Got two cousins for company now.

1030
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:34,299
How it's gonna be is...

1031
01:48:34,300 --> 01:48:39,400
we'll leave next Monday afternoon
and ride down to Platte City.

1032
01:48:41,300 --> 01:48:44,200
How far is that from Kansas City?

1033
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:48,700
Platte City's 30 miles south.

1034
01:48:49,400 --> 01:48:54,599
You and me and Charley'll
sleep in the woods overnight...

1035
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:59,900
and we'll strike the Wells Bank
sometime before the court recesses.

1036
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:07,600
What time will that be exactly?

1037
01:49:12,300 --> 01:49:15,800
Well, you don't need to know that.

1038
01:49:29,900 --> 01:49:33,099
You know, I'm real comfortable
with your brother.

1039
01:49:33,100 --> 01:49:36,399
Hell, he's ugly as sin,
he smells like a skunk...

1040
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:39,999
and he's so ignorant
he couldn't drive nails in the snow...

1041
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,999
but he's sort of easy to be around.

1042
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:46,700
I can't say the same for you, Bob.

1043
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:52,500
Well, I'm sorry to hear you say that.

1044
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:57,699
You know how it is when you're with
your girlfriend and the moon's out...

1045
01:49:57,700 --> 01:50:02,600
and you know she wants to be kissed,
even though she never said so?

1046
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:07,500
Yeah.

1047
01:50:09,300 --> 01:50:13,599
Well, you're giving me signs
that grieve my soul...

1048
01:50:13,600 --> 01:50:16,099
and make me wonder...

1049
01:50:16,100 --> 01:50:18,799
maybe your mind's
been changed about me.

1050
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:23,200
Well, what do you want me to do?
Swear my good faith on the Bible?

1051
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:42,600
You two having a spat?

1052
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:50,400
I was getting ready to be angry.

1053
01:50:54,900 --> 01:50:58,200
Sit over here closer, kid.

1054
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:01,700
Come on.

1055
01:51:11,900 --> 01:51:14,899
Charley, you'll stay with the animals.

1056
01:51:14,900 --> 01:51:16,999
Me and the kid...

1057
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:21,900
will walk into that bank
just before noon.

1058
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:25,999
Bob will move that cashier...

1059
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:29,399
away from the shotgun
that's under the counter...

1060
01:51:29,400 --> 01:51:32,399
and I'll creep up
behind that cashier...

1061
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:34,999
and I'll cock his head back like so.

1062
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:36,199
And I'll say:

1063
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:39,199
"How come an off-scouring
like you is still sucking air...

1064
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:41,599
when so many of mine
are in coffins?" I'll say:

1065
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:45,399
"How did you get to reach 20 without
leaking out all over your clothes?"

1066
01:51:45,400 --> 01:51:49,599
And if I don't like his attitude,
I will slit that phildoodle so deep...

1067
01:51:49,600 --> 01:51:53,500
he will flop on the floor like a fish.

1068
01:51:56,300 --> 01:51:59,500
My God, what just happened?

1069
01:52:07,900 --> 01:52:11,599
Boy, I could hear
your gears grinding...

1070
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:15,099
hear your little motor wondering,
"My gosh, what's next?

1071
01:52:15,100 --> 01:52:17,400
What's happening to me?"

1072
01:52:18,300 --> 01:52:20,399
You were precious to behold, Bob.

1073
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:23,499
You were white as spit
in a cotton field.

1074
01:52:23,500 --> 01:52:26,900
You got him. You got him.

1075
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:32,600
You wanna know how that feels? Unpleasant.
I honestly can't recommend it.

1076
01:52:37,200 --> 01:52:40,299
The old Charley looked stricken!

1077
01:52:40,300 --> 01:52:42,299
I was. I was.

1078
01:52:42,300 --> 01:52:48,200
"This is plumb unexpected," old Charley
was thinking."That done ruined my day."

1079
01:52:55,100 --> 01:52:57,500
Hell. Hell.

1080
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:32,300
<i>Jesse slept with Bob
in the children's room that night.</i>

1081
01:53:32,700 --> 01:53:36,200
<i>And Bob remained awake.</i>

1082
01:53:38,100 --> 01:53:42,399
<i>He could see that there was a gun
on the nightstand.</i>

1083
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:47,299
<i>He could imagine its cold nickel
inside his grip...</i>

1084
01:53:47,300 --> 01:53:51,700
<i>its two-pound weight
reached out and aimed.</i>

1085
01:54:21,900 --> 01:54:24,900
I need to go to the privy.

1086
01:54:25,200 --> 01:54:29,500
You think you do, but you don't.

1087
01:54:51,800 --> 01:54:54,899
You wait for grace, now.

1088
01:54:54,900 --> 01:54:58,499
- Thank you, Mama.
- Thank you, Zee. God, that looks good.

1089
01:54:58,500 --> 01:55:00,299
- Thank you, Zee.
- You're welcome.

1090
01:55:00,300 --> 01:55:04,200
Well, is this fit to eat
or will it just do?

1091
01:55:06,300 --> 01:55:08,499
Woman's cooking's
always been a scandal.

1092
01:55:08,500 --> 01:55:11,799
Cut her meat and the whole table moves.

1093
01:55:11,800 --> 01:55:14,099
You want a biscuit?
You gonna have a biscuit?

1094
01:55:14,100 --> 01:55:18,800
Here's some butter.
Come on. Come on.

1095
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:21,299
Oh, shoot.

1096
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:25,199
<i>And so it went,
Jesse was increasingly cavalier...</i>

1097
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:29,099
<i>merry, moody, fey...</i>

1098
01:55:29,100 --> 01:55:32,100
<i>unpredictable.</i>

1099
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:36,099
<i>He camouflaged his depressions
and derangements...</i>

1100
01:55:36,100 --> 01:55:40,299
<i>with masquerades
of extreme cordiality, courtesy...</i>

1101
01:55:40,300 --> 01:55:43,900
<i>and goodwill towards others.</i>

1102
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:48,499
<i>But even as he jested,
or tickled his boy in the ribs...</i>

1103
01:55:48,500 --> 01:55:52,299
<i>Jesse would look over at Bob
with melancholy eyes...</i>

1104
01:55:52,300 --> 01:55:57,200
<i>as if the two were meshed
in an intimate communication.</i>

1105
01:55:59,100 --> 01:56:01,899
<i>Bob was certain that the man
had unriddled him...</i>

1106
01:56:01,900 --> 01:56:04,699
<i>had seen through his reasons
for coming along...</i>

1107
01:56:04,700 --> 01:56:08,899
<i>that Jesse could forecast each of Bob's
possible moves and inclinations...</i>

1108
01:56:08,900 --> 01:56:10,899
<i>and was only acting the innocent...</i>

1109
01:56:10,900 --> 01:56:16,800
<i>in order to lull Bob into stupid
tranquility and miscalculation.</i>

1110
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:40,600
How long you been studying me?

1111
01:56:41,700 --> 01:56:45,300
You're gonna break a lot of hearts.

1112
01:56:52,300 --> 01:56:54,400
How do you mean?

1113
01:57:02,700 --> 01:57:05,400
It's a present.

1114
01:57:09,100 --> 01:57:11,299
It's heavy.

1115
01:57:11,300 --> 01:57:14,300
Well, you gonna look inside?

1116
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,399
It's April Fools' Day, you know.

1117
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:20,100
It ain't no joke.

1118
01:57:26,700 --> 01:57:29,200
Oh, such extravagance.

1119
01:57:29,800 --> 01:57:32,699
Don't that nickel just shine, though?

1120
01:57:32,700 --> 01:57:34,399
It's more than I could hope for.

1121
01:57:34,400 --> 01:57:37,399
I figured that granddaddy Colt
may blow into fragments...

1122
01:57:37,400 --> 01:57:40,399
next time you try
to squeeze the trigger.

1123
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:43,299
Well, you might have something there.

1124
01:57:43,300 --> 01:57:46,800
Tom, supper's ready.

1125
01:57:47,100 --> 01:57:49,299
I'll be right there, sweetheart.

1126
01:57:49,300 --> 01:57:52,500
I might be too excited to eat.

1127
01:57:54,900 --> 01:57:58,300
You know what John Newman Edwards
once wrote about me?

1128
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:01,399
He said I didn't trust
two men in 10,000...

1129
01:58:01,400 --> 01:58:04,899
and even them I was cautious around.

1130
01:58:04,900 --> 01:58:07,800
Government's sort of run me ragged.

1131
01:58:08,900 --> 01:58:11,999
I'm going the long way around the barn
to say that...

1132
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:16,399
I been feeling cornered
and just plain ornery as of late...

1133
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:22,000
and I'd be pleased if you'd accept
that gun as my way of apologizing.

1134
01:58:23,500 --> 01:58:26,399
Heaven knows I'd be ornerier
if I were in your position.

1135
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:30,400
No. No, I haven't been
acting correctly.

1136
01:58:31,300 --> 01:58:35,800
Seems I hardly recognize myself
when I'm greased.

1137
01:58:37,900 --> 01:58:40,599
I go on journeys out of my body...

1138
01:58:40,600 --> 01:58:45,499
and look at my red hands
and my mean face...

1139
01:58:45,500 --> 01:58:50,100
and I wonder about that man
that's gone so wrong.

1140
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:56,900
I've been becoming a problem to myself.

1141
01:59:08,700 --> 01:59:10,900
Well...

1142
01:59:16,700 --> 01:59:22,200
- I better wash my hands if supper's on.
- Yeah, go ahead.

1143
01:59:34,700 --> 01:59:38,500
<i>The day before he died was Palm Sunday.</i>

1144
01:59:38,600 --> 01:59:42,099
<i>And Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Howard,
their two children...</i>

1145
01:59:42,100 --> 01:59:44,299
<i>and their cousin Charles Johnson...</i>

1146
01:59:44,300 --> 01:59:50,400
<i>strolled to the Second Presbyterian
Church to attend the 10:00 service.</i>

1147
01:59:51,900 --> 01:59:54,399
<i>Bob remained at the cottage...</i>

1148
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:58,700
<i>and slyly migrated from room to room.</i>

1149
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:02,399
<i>He walked into the master bedroom...</i>

1150
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:07,100
<i>and inventoried the clothes
on the hangers and hooks.</i>

1151
02:00:12,500 --> 02:00:16,700
<i>He sipped from the water glass
on the vanity.</i>

1152
02:00:18,100 --> 02:00:23,300
<i>He smelled the talcum and lilacs
on Jesse's pillowcase.</i>

1153
02:00:30,300 --> 02:00:32,699
<i>His fingers skittered over his ribs...</i>

1154
02:00:32,700 --> 02:00:37,500
<i>to construe the scars
where Jesse was twice shot.</i>

1155
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:45,900
<i>He manufactured a middle finger
that was missing the top two knuckles.</i>

1156
02:00:52,400 --> 02:00:56,200
<i>He imagined himself at 34.</i>

1157
02:00:57,300 --> 02:01:01,200
<i>He imagined himself in a coffin.</i>

1158
02:01:02,400 --> 02:01:04,299
<i>He considered possibilities...</i>

1159
02:01:04,300 --> 02:01:08,500
<i>and everything wonderful
that could come true.</i>

1160
02:01:35,400 --> 02:01:38,200
He's not gonna kill us.

1161
02:01:42,600 --> 02:01:45,600
Yeah, he is.

1162
02:01:47,100 --> 02:01:50,400
Well, I'll stay awake so he can't.

1163
02:02:02,900 --> 02:02:06,200
You're imagining things.

1164
02:02:17,600 --> 02:02:20,500
Ain't gonna be no Platte City.

1165
02:02:21,300 --> 02:02:24,800
That's Jesse fooling with us.

1166
02:02:40,300 --> 02:02:43,500
Go to sleep, Charley.

1167
02:03:16,200 --> 02:03:18,700
Morning.

1168
02:03:21,600 --> 02:03:24,000
Charley.

1169
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:56,300
Bob, how much did you want to eat?

1170
02:03:59,900 --> 02:04:03,200
I'm feeling sort of peculiar.

1171
02:04:21,500 --> 02:04:24,900
Why is it you're looking so interested?

1172
02:04:25,500 --> 02:04:28,599
You think it's intelligent
to go out like that...

1173
02:04:28,600 --> 02:04:31,300
so all creation can see your guns?

1174
02:04:48,100 --> 02:04:50,500
Hi.

1175
02:04:59,900 --> 02:05:03,700
Come on, let's go see
what your mama's doing.

1176
02:05:03,900 --> 02:05:06,900
Timmy, get that door, would you?

1177
02:05:10,200 --> 02:05:13,499
- Well, you lost your shoe, sweetheart.
- Yeah, I did.

1178
02:05:13,500 --> 02:05:18,600
That's gonna be a problem.
They don't sell those one at a time.

1179
02:05:19,200 --> 02:05:22,100
We lost a shoe, Mama.

1180
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:26,300
Will you put that up for Daddy,
would you?

1181
02:05:28,500 --> 02:05:32,100
- What you doing, you lose a shoe?
- Yeah.

1182
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:51,599
It's only meant to go on top,
to complement.

1183
02:05:51,600 --> 02:05:54,400
Yeah, I know. Sometimes, I...

1184
02:06:18,100 --> 02:06:21,699
Bob, everything's getting cold!

1185
02:06:21,700 --> 02:06:26,000
- Where's Mary?
- She's outside, darling.

1186
02:06:26,100 --> 02:06:28,800
Mary?

1187
02:06:31,600 --> 02:06:35,100
What do you think goes on
in that noggin of his?

1188
02:06:37,200 --> 02:06:39,499
Nothing.

1189
02:06:39,500 --> 02:06:43,100
I was talking about his mind,
not yours.

1190
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:45,399
Oh, yeah.

1191
02:06:45,400 --> 02:06:48,000
Oh, I get it.

1192
02:07:42,500 --> 02:07:44,799
Well, hello now.

1193
02:07:44,800 --> 02:07:48,800
"The arrest and confession
of Dick Liddil."

1194
02:07:53,100 --> 02:07:56,200
You don't say so.

1195
02:08:09,600 --> 02:08:12,099
That's very strange.

1196
02:08:12,100 --> 02:08:15,199
Says here Dick surrendered
three weeks ago.

1197
02:08:15,200 --> 02:08:18,499
You must have been
right in the neighborhood.

1198
02:08:18,500 --> 02:08:22,000
Well, apparently,
they kept it a secret.

1199
02:08:32,300 --> 02:08:36,300
If I get to Kansas City soon,
I'll ask somebody about it.

1200
02:09:16,100 --> 02:09:18,700
You two ready?

1201
02:09:21,500 --> 02:09:25,000
I will be, by noon.

1202
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,899
<i>There is a ship
She sails the sea</i>

1203
02:09:59,900 --> 02:10:02,799
<i>She's loaded deep
As deep can be</i>

1204
02:10:02,800 --> 02:10:05,599
<i>But not as deep
As the love I'm in</i>

1205
02:10:05,600 --> 02:10:10,200
<i>I know not if I sink or swim</i>

1206
02:10:10,300 --> 02:10:12,900
<i>The water is wide</i>

1207
02:10:13,100 --> 02:10:20,099
<i>I can't cross o'er
And neither have I wings to fly</i>

1208
02:10:20,100 --> 02:10:24,099
<i>Give me a boat
That can carry two</i>

1209
02:10:24,100 --> 02:10:27,099
<i>Both shall row My love and I</i>

1210
02:10:27,100 --> 02:10:30,799
<i>For love is gentle
And love is kind</i>

1211
02:10:30,800 --> 02:10:33,999
<i>Sweetest flower
When first it's new</i>

1212
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:37,699
<i>But love grows old
And waxes cold</i>

1213
02:10:37,700 --> 02:10:41,099
<i>And fades away
Like the morning dew</i>

1214
02:10:41,100 --> 02:10:44,299
<i>There is a ship
She sails the sea</i>

1215
02:10:44,300 --> 02:10:47,399
I guess I'll take my guns off...

1216
02:10:47,400 --> 02:10:50,300
for fear the neighbors might spy them.

1217
02:11:22,700 --> 02:11:26,100
Don't that picture look dusty?

1218
02:13:07,300 --> 02:13:11,200
What have...? What have you done?

1219
02:13:12,700 --> 02:13:15,200
Jesse.

1220
02:13:19,900 --> 02:13:21,800
Jesse?

1221
02:13:22,100 --> 02:13:24,899
Jesse? Jesse?

1222
02:13:24,900 --> 02:13:27,700
Jesse!

1223
02:13:27,800 --> 02:13:30,800
No!

1224
02:13:34,100 --> 02:13:36,999
No. Jess...

1225
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:42,300
Come back. Oh, come back.

1226
02:13:43,500 --> 02:13:48,199
Oh, Jesse! No!

1227
02:13:48,200 --> 02:13:52,299
Oh, Bob. Have you done this?!

1228
02:13:52,300 --> 02:13:55,600
I swear to God I didn't.

1229
02:13:55,700 --> 02:13:58,000
It was an accident, Zee.

1230
02:13:59,300 --> 02:14:03,600
Come on. Pistol went off accidentally.

1231
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:49,399
Put my name.

1232
02:14:49,400 --> 02:14:52,800
Why, what'd you do? I shot him.

1233
02:14:59,100 --> 02:15:02,000
You might wanna keep that.

1234
02:15:39,100 --> 02:15:42,000
Thank you all very much.

1235
02:15:49,300 --> 02:15:51,999
<i>The resulting prints
sold for 2 dollars apiece...</i>

1236
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:57,500
<i>and were the models for the lithographed
covers on a number of magazines.</i>

1237
02:16:02,100 --> 02:16:07,699
<i>Soon a thousand strangers were making
spellbound pilgrimages to the cottage...</i>

1238
02:16:07,700 --> 02:16:13,099
<i>or were venerating the iced remains
in Seidenfaden's cooling room.</i>

1239
02:16:13,100 --> 02:16:17,799
<i>The man who offered 30,000 dollars for the
body of President Garfield's assassin...</i>

1240
02:16:17,800 --> 02:16:21,899
<i>sent a telegram to City Marshal
Enos Craig offering 50,000...</i>

1241
02:16:21,900 --> 02:16:24,299
<i>for the body
of Jesse Woodson James...</i>

1242
02:16:24,300 --> 02:16:28,000
<i>so that he could go around the country
with it...</i>

1243
02:16:29,500 --> 02:16:35,400
<i>or at least sell it to P.T. Barnum
for his Greatest Show on Earth.</i>

1244
02:16:38,500 --> 02:16:41,799
<i>Another photograph was taken
of the renowned American bandit...</i>

1245
02:16:41,800 --> 02:16:44,599
<i>nestled in his bed of ice.</i>

1246
02:16:44,600 --> 02:16:48,999
<i>And it was this shot that was most
available in sundries and apothecaries...</i>

1247
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:52,899
<i>to be viewed in a stereoscope
alongside the sphinx...</i>

1248
02:16:52,900 --> 02:16:57,800
<i>the Taj Mahal,
and the catacombs of Rome.</i>

1249
02:17:22,100 --> 02:17:24,199
Hello, here!

1250
02:17:24,200 --> 02:17:26,999
"The arrest and confession
of Dick Liddil."

1251
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:32,299
Young man, I thought you told me
you didn't know Dick had surrendered.

1252
02:17:32,300 --> 02:17:37,099
You mean he did? I didn't know.

1253
02:17:37,100 --> 02:17:39,099
But I knew I had not fooled him.

1254
02:17:39,100 --> 02:17:43,899
And he knew, as well as I, in that moment
that I intended to bring him to justice.

1255
02:17:43,900 --> 02:17:47,699
But he would not kill me in the
presence of his wife and children.

1256
02:17:47,700 --> 02:17:51,800
And so he was smiling
to throw me off-guard.

1257
02:17:54,100 --> 02:17:57,700
Well, it's all right, anyway, Bob.

1258
02:17:58,700 --> 02:18:01,699
<i>It was widely felt that
Bob possessed some acting talent...</i>

1259
02:18:01,700 --> 02:18:04,199
<i>and Charley, not a jot.</i>

1260
02:18:04,200 --> 02:18:07,899
That picture's awful dusty.

1261
02:18:07,900 --> 02:18:11,199
<i>Charley was only expected
not to slouch or mutter...</i>

1262
02:18:11,200 --> 02:18:16,800
<i>and to transport his sicknesses
to the alley before letting them go.</i>

1263
02:18:45,300 --> 02:18:47,699
And that's...

1264
02:18:47,700 --> 02:18:51,300
how I killed Jesse James.

1265
02:18:53,900 --> 02:18:57,599
<i>By October of 1883, Bob Ford
could be identified correctly...</i>

1266
02:18:57,600 --> 02:19:02,499
<i>by more citizens than could
the president of the United States.</i>

1267
02:19:02,500 --> 02:19:07,399
<i>He was as renowned at 20 as Jesse was
after 14 years of grand larceny.</i>

1268
02:19:07,400 --> 02:19:10,099
You won't get your hooks into me.

1269
02:19:10,100 --> 02:19:14,999
That's right. That's right.
Sit next to your boyfriend. Jezebel.

1270
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,299
<i>Charley was
increasingly superstitious...</i>

1271
02:19:17,300 --> 02:19:20,199
<i>increasingly subject
to the advice of soothsayers...</i>

1272
02:19:20,200 --> 02:19:24,399
<i>who promised to cure his miseries
with pipe smoke and poultices.</i>

1273
02:19:24,400 --> 02:19:28,500
You been spending too much time
with Gypsies, Charley.

1274
02:19:33,400 --> 02:19:35,600
Shit.

1275
02:19:39,100 --> 02:19:42,099
The picture's awful dusty.

1276
02:19:42,100 --> 02:19:46,099
<i>Something began to change
in Charley's stage portrayal of Jesse.</i>

1277
02:19:46,100 --> 02:19:48,799
<i>His gait seemed more practiced.</i>

1278
02:19:48,800 --> 02:19:52,199
<i>His voice was spookily similar
to the man's.</i>

1279
02:19:52,200 --> 02:19:54,799
<i>His newly suggested dialogue
was analogous...</i>

1280
02:19:54,800 --> 02:19:58,700
<i>to a script Jesse might
have originated.</i>

1281
02:20:00,700 --> 02:20:03,299
<i>He began to look at his younger brother
with spite...</i>

1282
02:20:03,300 --> 02:20:06,099
<i>as if he suspected that
in some future performance...</i>

1283
02:20:06,100 --> 02:20:11,500
<i>he might present himself to a
live cartridge in Robert Ford's gun.</i>

1284
02:20:11,900 --> 02:20:14,099
Murderer!

1285
02:20:14,100 --> 02:20:16,499
Cur!

1286
02:20:16,500 --> 02:20:19,100
Coward!

1287
02:20:21,800 --> 02:20:26,699
You wanna investigate my courage?
Do you?

1288
02:20:26,700 --> 02:20:31,400
Find out! Find out!

1289
02:20:35,100 --> 02:20:37,900
Nobody.

1290
02:20:51,600 --> 02:20:54,300
Coward!

1291
02:21:18,600 --> 02:21:24,299
<i>By his own approximation, Bob
assassinated Jesse James over 800 times.</i>

1292
02:21:24,300 --> 02:21:28,199
<i>He suspected no one in history
had ever so often or so publicly...</i>

1293
02:21:28,200 --> 02:21:32,300
<i>recapitulated an act of betrayal.</i>

1294
02:21:36,600 --> 02:21:39,599
<i>Bob always challenged
the allegations of cowardice...</i>

1295
02:21:39,600 --> 02:21:42,799
<i>but Charley seemed
to agree with them.</i>

1296
02:21:42,800 --> 02:21:46,699
<i>He spoke of Mrs. Zee James
as certain priests might the Madonna...</i>

1297
02:21:46,700 --> 02:21:49,999
<i>and composed long soul-describing
letters to her...</i>

1298
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:53,100
<i>begging her forgiveness...</i>

1299
02:21:53,500 --> 02:21:57,000
<i>none of which he mailed.</i>

1300
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:30,500
<i>Charley Ford became all that his countrymen
wanted an assassin of Jesse James to be.</i>

1301
02:22:33,800 --> 02:22:40,600
<i>Jesse James was a man
Who killed many men</i>

1302
02:22:40,900 --> 02:22:45,599
<i>He robbed the Glendale train</i>

1303
02:22:45,600 --> 02:22:51,699
<i>And he stole from the rich
And he gave to the poor</i>

1304
02:22:51,700 --> 02:22:57,399
<i>He had a hand
And a heart and a brain</i>

1305
02:22:57,400 --> 02:23:03,099
<i>Well, Jesse had a wife
To mourn for his life</i>

1306
02:23:03,100 --> 02:23:08,299
<i>Three children
They were brave</i>

1307
02:23:08,300 --> 02:23:14,199
<i>But that dirty little coward
Who shot Mr. Howard</i>

1308
02:23:14,200 --> 02:23:20,100
<i>Has laid Jesse James in his grave</i>

1309
02:23:20,300 --> 02:23:26,099
<i>It was Robert Ford
That dirty little coward</i>

1310
02:23:26,100 --> 02:23:30,599
<i>I wonder how does he feel</i>

1311
02:23:30,600 --> 02:23:36,499
<i>For he ate at Jesse's bread
And he slept in Jesse's bed</i>

1312
02:23:36,500 --> 02:23:41,999
<i>And he laid poor Jesse in his grave</i>

1313
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:47,699
<i>Well, Jesse had a wife
To mourn for his life</i>

1314
02:23:47,700 --> 02:23:52,799
<i>Three children
They were brave</i>

1315
02:23:52,800 --> 02:23:58,599
<i>But that dirty little coward
Who shot Mr. Howard</i>

1316
02:23:58,600 --> 02:24:03,700
<i>Has laid poor Jesse in his grave</i>

1317
02:24:14,300 --> 02:24:17,300
I'm Robert Ford.

1318
02:24:27,100 --> 02:24:31,700
It was two children, not three.

1319
02:24:42,200 --> 02:24:43,500
Hey.

1320
02:24:44,400 --> 02:24:47,699
You get yourself home, son, okay?

1321
02:24:47,700 --> 02:24:52,600
Come on. Get out of here.
Get out of my place.

1322
02:25:23,500 --> 02:25:25,899
<i>He thought, at his angriest...</i>

1323
02:25:25,900 --> 02:25:30,500
<i>about visiting the kin
of Jesse's slaughtered victims:</i>

1324
02:25:31,600 --> 02:25:35,800
<i>Mrs. William Westfall in Plattsburg...</i>

1325
02:25:37,400 --> 02:25:41,400
<i>the Wymore family in Clay County...</i>

1326
02:25:45,600 --> 02:25:50,800
<i>perhaps even Mrs. Joseph Heywood
in Northfield, Minnesota.</i>

1327
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:56,199
<i>He would go to their homes
and give his name as Robert Ford...</i>

1328
02:25:56,200 --> 02:26:00,000
<i>the man who killed Jesse James.</i>

1329
02:26:00,600 --> 02:26:04,500
<i>He imagined they would
be grateful to him.</i>

1330
02:26:54,600 --> 02:26:59,799
<i>It was only with Dorothy Evans that
Bob spoke revealingly or plainly...</i>

1331
02:26:59,800 --> 02:27:05,100
<i>and it was with her that he spoke of
things he didn't know he knew.</i>

1332
02:27:25,900 --> 02:27:30,099
<i>He told her that he had no real memory
of the shooting and its aftermath.</i>

1333
02:27:30,100 --> 02:27:34,699
<i>He could remember lifting the gun
that Jesse had given him...</i>

1334
02:27:34,700 --> 02:27:38,899
<i>and then it was Good Friday and he was
reading about the funeral proceedings...</i>

1335
02:27:38,900 --> 02:27:42,300
<i>as if they'd happened a long time ago.</i>

1336
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:46,000
Why did you kill him?

1337
02:27:49,500 --> 02:27:52,400
Well, he was gonna kill me.

1338
02:27:56,700 --> 02:28:00,800
So you were scared
and that's the only reason?

1339
02:28:02,700 --> 02:28:04,499
Yeah.

1340
02:28:04,500 --> 02:28:07,500
And the reward money.

1341
02:28:12,400 --> 02:28:16,100
Do you want me to change the subject?

1342
02:28:23,400 --> 02:28:26,700
You know what I expected?

1343
02:28:26,800 --> 02:28:29,700
Applause.

1344
02:28:31,400 --> 02:28:36,400
I was only 20 years old then. I couldn't
see how it would look to people.

1345
02:28:39,600 --> 02:28:43,200
I was surprised by what happened.

1346
02:28:43,400 --> 02:28:46,200
They didn't applaud.

1347
02:28:48,800 --> 02:28:50,799
<i>He was ashamed of his boasting...</i>

1348
02:28:50,800 --> 02:28:53,999
<i>his pretensions of courage
and ruthlessness.</i>

1349
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:58,600
<i>He was sorry about his
cold-bloodedness, his dispassion...</i>

1350
02:28:59,400 --> 02:29:04,700
<i>his inability to express
what he now believed was the case:</i>

1351
02:29:06,400 --> 02:29:10,199
<i>That he truly regretted
killing Jesse...</i>

1352
02:29:10,200 --> 02:29:13,699
<i>that he missed the man
as much as anybody...</i>

1353
02:29:13,700 --> 02:29:17,700
<i>and wished his murder
hadn't been necessary.</i>

1354
02:29:36,300 --> 02:29:38,599
<i>Even as he circulated his saloon...</i>

1355
02:29:38,600 --> 02:29:43,200
<i>he knew that the smiles disappeared
when he passed by.</i>

1356
02:29:43,400 --> 02:29:45,399
<i>He received so many menacing letters...</i>

1357
02:29:45,400 --> 02:29:49,800
<i>that he could read them
without any reaction except curiosity.</i>

1358
02:29:52,700 --> 02:29:58,400
<i>He kept to his apartment all day,
flipping over playing cards...</i>

1359
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:04,400
<i>looking at his destiny
in every king and jack.</i>

1360
02:30:07,700 --> 02:30:12,900
<i>Edward O'Kelly came up from Bachelor
at 1 p.m. on the 8th.</i>

1361
02:30:13,500 --> 02:30:17,599
<i>He had no grand scheme, no strategy...</i>

1362
02:30:17,600 --> 02:30:20,099
<i>no agreement with higher authorities...</i>

1363
02:30:20,100 --> 02:30:23,800
<i>nothing beyond
a vague longing for glory...</i>

1364
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:29,100
<i>and a generalized wish
for revenge against Robert Ford.</i>

1365
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:40,200
- How'd it go last night?
- Not so bad.

1366
02:30:42,500 --> 02:30:44,800
The other one.

1367
02:30:46,400 --> 02:30:49,399
<i>Edward O'Kelly would be ordered
to serve a life sentence...</i>

1368
02:30:49,400 --> 02:30:52,399
<i>in the Colorado Penitentiary
for second-degree murder.</i>

1369
02:30:52,400 --> 02:30:55,399
<i>Over 7000 signatures
would eventually be gathered...</i>

1370
02:30:55,400 --> 02:30:57,799
<i>on a petition asking for
O'Kelly's release...</i>

1371
02:30:57,800 --> 02:31:03,399
<i>and in 1902, Governor James B. Orman
would pardon the man.</i>

You shouldn't be wearing that stickpin
again there, Bob. Opals are unlucky.

1373
02:31:09,300 --> 02:31:14,399
My luck's not very good as it is. I don't
think an opal's gonna change that much.

1374
02:31:14,400 --> 02:31:16,700
I hear you.

1375
02:31:29,400 --> 02:31:32,200
<i>There would be no eulogies for Bob...</i>

1376
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:37,799
<i>no photographs of his body
would be sold in sundries stores...</i>

1377
02:31:37,800 --> 02:31:43,000
<i>no people would crowd the streets in
the rain to see his funeral cortege...</i>

1378
02:31:43,900 --> 02:31:46,999
<i>no biographies would be written
about him...</i>

1379
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:50,500
<i>no children named after him.</i>

1380
02:31:51,200 --> 02:31:56,800
<i>No one would ever pay 25 cents
to stand in the rooms he grew up in.</i>

1381
02:32:00,400 --> 02:32:03,100
Hello, Bob.

1382
02:32:03,600 --> 02:32:08,599
<i>The shotgun would ignite,
and Ella Mae would scream...</i>

1383
02:32:08,600 --> 02:32:12,399
<i>but Robert Ford would only lay
on the floor and look at the ceiling...</i>

1384
02:32:12,400 --> 02:32:15,099
<i>the light going out of his eyes...</i>

1385
02:32:15,100 --> 02:32:18,700
<i>before he could find the right words.</i>
