1
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,137
- Hi!
- Ok, Francois?

2
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,097
And you?

3
00:01:25,341 --> 00:01:27,570
Stephane... Francois...

4
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,093
- Still on the team?
- As ready as ever.

5
00:01:37,621 --> 00:01:39,293
Hello.

6
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,496
- This one?
- At the back, please.

7
00:01:56,781 --> 00:01:58,294
Hi, I'm Herve.

8
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:00,897
A sports teacher here for 3 years.

9
00:02:01,781 --> 00:02:03,691
Welcome to all our new colleagues.

10
00:02:03,981 --> 00:02:06,370
The students can be tough...

11
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:09,699
but they're good kids.

12
00:02:10,182 --> 00:02:12,411
Hi, I'm Olivier.

13
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:14,698
I teach physical science...

14
00:02:14,941 --> 00:02:17,819
and I've been here for 4 years.

15
00:02:18,941 --> 00:02:20,375
I'm Patrick,

16
00:02:20,702 --> 00:02:23,933
and I teach multiplication tables,

17
00:02:24,222 --> 00:02:26,177
and sometimes mathematics!

18
00:02:26,462 --> 00:02:28,259
I've been at this school

19
00:02:28,542 --> 00:02:30,373
for a number of years.

20
00:02:30,663 --> 00:02:34,620
Hello, I'm Anne.
I used to work in the Lyon suburbs.

21
00:02:34,862 --> 00:02:36,420
I teach English.

22
00:02:36,662 --> 00:02:39,018
I'm looking for my new colleagues.

23
00:02:39,263 --> 00:02:40,694
Hi, I'm Isabelle

24
00:02:41,102 --> 00:02:42,012
Nice to meet you.

25
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,456
I'm Christiane.

26
00:02:44,263 --> 00:02:48,460
I'm Frederic,
I teach history and geography.

27
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:50,455
and I used to work
out in suburbs of Paris.

28
00:02:50,702 --> 00:02:53,695
I'm happy to be in the city now.

29
00:02:54,503 --> 00:02:57,620
I'm Julie, the year supervisor.
I'd like to welcome you all

30
00:02:57,863 --> 00:03:00,378
and wish you a good year.

31
00:03:00,983 --> 00:03:03,052
I'm Aline and I'm the cook

32
00:03:03,302 --> 00:03:05,737
I'd like to welcome you all.

33
00:03:05,983 --> 00:03:07,462
Thank you, Aline!

34
00:03:09,303 --> 00:03:13,137
Hello. I'm Gilles,
I've been teaching mathematics

35
00:03:13,383 --> 00:03:17,137
for many years

36
00:03:17,383 --> 00:03:21,774
I'm retiring at the end of this year

37
00:03:22,064 --> 00:03:25,214
I'd like to wish the new arrivals
plenty of courage.

38
00:03:28,744 --> 00:03:31,417
I'm Francois
I teach French.

39
00:03:31,664 --> 00:03:33,893
And I'm starting
my fourth year here

40
00:03:34,143 --> 00:03:35,975
Welcome everybody.

41
00:03:44,464 --> 00:03:46,534
We'll meet up at midday...

42
00:03:46,824 --> 00:03:49,463
in the canteen for a drink
to mark the new year.

43
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,896
You get Wednesday like you wanted!

44
00:04:05,185 --> 00:04:07,380
We could swap our classes

45
00:04:09,744 --> 00:04:11,622
Nice, nice...

46
00:04:11,865 --> 00:04:13,742
Not nice, not nice at all.

47
00:04:13,985 --> 00:04:15,578
He's nice.

48
00:04:15,825 --> 00:04:18,737
Not nice, watch him.
Not nice at all.

49
00:04:18,985 --> 00:04:21,500
Nice, not nice.

50
00:04:21,746 --> 00:04:23,383
She's not nice at all.

51
00:04:31,865 --> 00:04:33,457
Arthur, your cap.

52
00:04:35,026 --> 00:04:36,982
Good morning.

53
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,462
That's my place.

54
00:04:43,346 --> 00:05:04,623
Get lost!

55
00:05:11,306 --> 00:05:12,979
Calm down now!

56
00:05:16,626 --> 00:05:17,695
Stop stirring things up

57
00:05:17,987 --> 00:05:19,466
Remove your hood, please

58
00:05:19,707 --> 00:05:22,302
You two back there,
there's place here.

59
00:05:22,547 --> 00:05:24,617
- One up front.
- There's room here too!

60
00:05:24,906 --> 00:05:27,263
Let's get one thing clear...

61
00:05:32,867 --> 00:05:36,463
We waste 5 minutes
lining outside,

62
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,299
5 coming up, 5 setting down:

63
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:40,026
15 minutes out of hour

64
00:05:40,267 --> 00:05:42,941
Do you realize
what 15 lost minutes means?

65
00:05:43,188 --> 00:05:44,337
With 25 hours a week

66
00:05:44,627 --> 00:05:46,265
and 30 weeks in the year,

67
00:05:46,507 --> 00:05:48,657
we lose thousands of minutes.

68
00:05:48,908 --> 00:05:51,217
In other schools,
they do a full work.

69
00:05:52,228 --> 00:05:55,106
Imagine how far ahead they get
in a year

70
00:05:56,188 --> 00:05:57,462
Figure it out!

71
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,142
We never do an hour.

72
00:05:59,548 --> 00:06:01,026
Hand up to speak.

73
00:06:03,028 --> 00:06:05,588
We never do an hour
You always say that!

74
00:06:05,828 --> 00:06:09,423
Teachers say we do an hours class
but we never do.

75
00:06:12,148 --> 00:06:14,946
8.30 to 9.25 doesn't make an hour.

76
00:06:15,228 --> 00:06:17,378
All right it's 55 minutes.

77
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:19,620
That’s an important point

78
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:24,745
Stop saying other schools do an hour
They don't!

79
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:28,624
All I'm saying is that
we waste time. Like now.

80
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,939
To start with,

81
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:32,508
take out a sheet of paper,

82
00:06:33,109 --> 00:06:36,068
fold it in two so that it can stand

83
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,227
on the edge of your desk clearly

84
00:06:39,469 --> 00:06:42,223
and using block capitals,

85
00:06:42,749 --> 00:06:45,103
write your full name.

86
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:46,981
Why write our names?

87
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:48,549
To know who you are

88
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,509
- But you know us!
- We had you last year.

89
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:55,424
Esmeralda,
half of the kids here are new.

90
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:58,821
Be happy. That way
people will know your name

91
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,383
I'm not doing it

92
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,269
I won't if you don't

93
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,426
You're right

94
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:08,379
For those of you who don’t know me,
I'm Mr. Marin

95
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,745
- A marine?
- Very funny

96
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:13,668
Corny!

97
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,620
He wiped you out, sir

98
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,070
Come on, it shouldn’t take so long

99
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,865
Five minutes to write a name

100
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,983
It's ridiculous

101
00:07:49,072 --> 00:07:51,221
A biscuit for the firs day?

102
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,348
I'm OK, thanks

103
00:07:55,671 --> 00:07:58,583
Rachel, a biscuit will buck you up

104
00:08:03,712 --> 00:08:06,862
All right. "Witty"

105
00:08:07,151 --> 00:08:09,142
That's word
we'll try to explain later.

106
00:08:10,112 --> 00:08:11,750
Are there any other words

107
00:08:12,032 --> 00:08:14,785
that you don't understand?

108
00:08:15,872 --> 00:08:18,625
The word "condescension"

109
00:08:19,072 --> 00:08:21,267
Yes, that's a complicated word.

110
00:08:21,511 --> 00:08:23,264
Do you have any idea

111
00:08:23,552 --> 00:08:25,588
what that might mean?

112
00:08:25,832 --> 00:08:27,663
A vague idea but I'm not sure

113
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:30,026
You're not sure?

114
00:08:30,272 --> 00:08:32,991
We'll talk about that later then

115
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,310
- Yes, Damien
- "Argentine".

116
00:08:36,952 --> 00:08:38,943
Argentine. What does that mean?

117
00:08:39,473 --> 00:08:41,782
It's people who live in Argentina.

118
00:08:42,393 --> 00:08:44,543
Right, the inhabitants of Argentina

119
00:08:44,952 --> 00:08:46,989
Of course not

120
00:08:47,553 --> 00:08:49,545
Damien, who lives in Argentina?

121
00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:51,306
The Argentines

122
00:08:51,593 --> 00:08:54,027
In a soccer match
Argentina's players

123
00:08:54,313 --> 00:08:55,541
are called...

124
00:08:56,193 --> 00:08:57,512
Footballers

125
00:08:59,153 --> 00:08:59,869
Let's move on

126
00:09:00,713 --> 00:09:03,705
Any other difficult words
in the text?

127
00:09:05,074 --> 00:09:06,062
Henriette

128
00:09:07,473 --> 00:09:11,262
Is there anything
that you didn't understand?

129
00:09:14,913 --> 00:09:15,982
"Henceforth".

130
00:09:17,434 --> 00:09:18,229
"Henceforth".

131
00:09:18,874 --> 00:09:20,272
"Henceforth"

132
00:09:20,554 --> 00:09:23,068
Thanks for the prompt, Samantha.

133
00:09:26,515 --> 00:09:30,427
I think that will do,
Let's take a look at these words.

134
00:09:30,714 --> 00:09:33,148
All right. Austrian

135
00:09:33,434 --> 00:09:36,824
Wey was the one
who picked the word Austrian

136
00:09:37,074 --> 00:09:38,143
Yes, Esmeralda.

137
00:09:38,394 --> 00:09:40,464
We all know what "Austrian" is.

138
00:09:40,754 --> 00:09:44,303
- People from Austria.
- Wey doesn't know and...

139
00:09:44,594 --> 00:09:46,506
Maybe, but everyone else knows!

140
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:50,707
We get the message. You didn't
know "misleading"

141
00:09:50,994 --> 00:09:54,145
...so you're not really
in any position to talk.

142
00:09:54,395 --> 00:09:56,147
But everyone knows
what "Austrian" means.

143
00:09:56,436 --> 00:09:58,231
Nobody's perfect.

144
00:10:00,435 --> 00:10:03,268
- "Austrian" is not a very,
important word, Wey.

145
00:10:03,516 --> 00:10:06,632
It refers to someone
from the land of Austria,

146
00:10:06,955 --> 00:10:09,150
which is pretty tiny country.

147
00:10:09,395 --> 00:10:11,068
We can live without the word.

148
00:10:11,716 --> 00:10:15,185
Can anyone name a famous Austrian?

149
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:18,155
Mozart.

150
00:10:19,276 --> 00:10:21,630
- Who?
- Wol Fang Amadeus Mozart.

151
00:10:21,915 --> 00:10:25,545
- "Wol Fung" maybe if he
were English, not Austrian.

152
00:10:25,836 --> 00:10:28,396
Any other famous Austrians?

153
00:10:28,635 --> 00:10:31,275
Austria could vanish
no one would notice.

154
00:10:32,796 --> 00:10:35,754
Seriously, it's south of Germany.
So check a map, Wey,

155
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:38,755
You'll see where it is.

156
00:10:38,996 --> 00:10:39,634
Souleymane,

157
00:10:39,876 --> 00:10:41,787
...can you note the words too?

158
00:10:42,036 --> 00:10:43,264
I forgot my things.

159
00:10:43,956 --> 00:10:46,151
No one can land you some paper...

160
00:10:46,436 --> 00:10:48,792
I'll do it at home.

161
00:10:49,276 --> 00:10:51,711
You'll do it at home. Sure you will.
That's your approach

162
00:10:51,997 --> 00:10:53,395
Only work at home.

163
00:10:53,636 --> 00:10:54,785
I'm serious!

164
00:10:55,037 --> 00:10:59,427
If I could be sure of that...

165
00:10:59,676 --> 00:11:01,986
Don't worry. It'll be ok

166
00:11:02,237 --> 00:11:05,070
Let's move on to "succulent".

167
00:11:05,357 --> 00:11:08,155
"Succulent" is a word that we'll try
to guess the meaning of.

168
00:11:09,437 --> 00:11:10,711
What's is "succulent"?

169
00:11:10,957 --> 00:11:11,945
Suck

170
00:11:12,557 --> 00:11:14,228
Suck off.

171
00:11:15,358 --> 00:11:16,710
Very funny, Boubacar.

172
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:18,271
Very witty indeed,

173
00:11:20,117 --> 00:11:21,470
Here's a sentence...

174
00:11:22,517 --> 00:11:24,348
...with "succulent".

175
00:11:24,678 --> 00:11:29,353
"Bill enjoys a succulent...

176
00:11:31,398 --> 00:11:32,387
...cheeseburger. "

177
00:11:32,678 --> 00:11:34,190
Cheeseburgers stink!

178
00:11:35,557 --> 00:11:37,276
- Who said that?
- Me.

179
00:11:37,558 --> 00:11:38,911
Why "cheeseburger"?

180
00:11:39,798 --> 00:11:45,031
Well, since you say that, you
think cheeseburgers aren't succulent.

181
00:11:45,678 --> 00:11:47,476
Maybe, but they're crap.

182
00:11:47,758 --> 00:11:51,467
OK, but what I just said
should have made the penny drop.

183
00:11:51,718 --> 00:11:53,630
- What does that mean?
- Mean what?

184
00:11:53,918 --> 00:11:55,351
The penny thing...

185
00:11:57,198 --> 00:11:58,187
To make the penny drop,

186
00:11:58,438 --> 00:12:01,236
No one knows the expression?

187
00:12:01,518 --> 00:12:03,554
If the penny drops,
it means you understand.

188
00:12:03,838 --> 00:12:05,430
When I say,

189
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:09,831
if cheeseburger stink
they're not succulent,

190
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,196
that should help you see
what "succulent" means.

191
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:16,391
- What's with the Bills?
- What bills?

192
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,788
The name Bill.

193
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:20,550
You always use weird names.

194
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:23,836
Weird? A recent US President
was called Bill.

195
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:28,317
Why don't you use Aissata
or Rachid or Ahmed...

196
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:30,231
You always use whitey names.

197
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,430
What names?

198
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,473
- Honky names.
- What's honky?

199
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,432
Honkies, Frenchies, frogs.

200
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,669
You're not French?

201
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,238
No, I'm not French.

202
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,829
I didn't know.

203
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:44,347
I am, but not proud of it.

204
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:47,671
Fine, I'm not either

205
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,591
Why use these names?

206
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,833
Khoumba, if I start choosing names

207
00:12:54,121 --> 00:12:56,680
to suit all your origins, it'll
never end.

208
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,552
Just change a little!

209
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,391
What do you suggest?

210
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:04,797
Aissata! Fatou, no!

211
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,190
- No, Aissata.
- Aissata, Aissata!

212
00:13:36,681 --> 00:13:39,832
Excuse me. You have class 4/3
in French?

213
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,673
I'm class supervisor too.

214
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,311
Know what book you'll be reading?

215
00:13:45,081 --> 00:13:47,151
No, I haven't decided.

216
00:13:48,241 --> 00:13:52,793
In history I'll start with
Ancien Regime

217
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:57,593
If you want to link into that,
what kind of books are there?

218
00:13:59,722 --> 00:14:02,440
The Enlightenment will
be tough for them.

219
00:14:03,082 --> 00:14:05,835
How about Voltaire? Is he tough?

220
00:14:06,082 --> 00:14:07,960
He's not easy.

221
00:14:08,243 --> 00:14:09,560
Candide, is simple...

222
00:14:10,881 --> 00:14:12,361
Not in their year

223
00:14:13,003 --> 00:14:14,152
Zadig...

224
00:14:15,002 --> 00:14:18,233
Yes, but it'd be tough

225
00:14:51,843 --> 00:14:52,912
You have 20 seconds.

226
00:14:53,164 --> 00:14:54,642
No, we've not finished yet!

227
00:14:55,363 --> 00:14:57,480
We've not finished yet!

228
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:59,755
We can't spend 2 hours on the
imperfect.

229
00:15:03,564 --> 00:15:05,520
Dalla, I can give you the time.

230
00:15:09,163 --> 00:15:10,722
Sir, my pen keeps leaking!

231
00:15:11,604 --> 00:15:13,322
- It's crap
- Who has a handkerchief?

232
00:15:13,685 --> 00:15:14,834
Me!

233
00:15:15,524 --> 00:15:16,239
Rabah!

234
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:18,918
Ask before you stand.

235
00:15:20,564 --> 00:15:22,520
- May I?
- Yes.

236
00:15:24,884 --> 00:15:27,160
- Gently, Ok...
- The perv!

237
00:15:27,644 --> 00:15:28,713
He touched her tits!

238
00:15:28,964 --> 00:15:31,000
Just give him the handkerchief.

239
00:15:31,244 --> 00:15:33,997
Spare us your comments.

240
00:15:34,245 --> 00:15:36,075
God dam pedophile!

241
00:15:37,485 --> 00:15:39,759
- Quiet!
- Sir?

242
00:15:40,685 --> 00:15:44,041
Why the imperfect indicative?

243
00:15:45,205 --> 00:15:47,560
Cut it out!

244
00:15:48,045 --> 00:15:51,560
- Why not just imperfect?
- Quiet, Souleymane.

245
00:15:51,846 --> 00:15:54,597
All right, Esmeralda,
why the indicative?

246
00:15:54,925 --> 00:15:57,918
If I knew, I wouldn't ask.

247
00:15:58,205 --> 00:16:02,801
I can imagine. Anyone know why we
specify the imperfect indicative?

248
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,957
Why not just the imperfect?

249
00:16:05,246 --> 00:16:07,713
Nassim?
May I wash my hands?

250
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,401
Go on, wash them and get it over with.

251
00:16:11,126 --> 00:16:12,764
Make it quick.

252
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,564
He'll take a week!

253
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,284
- I'll go with him.
- Enough

254
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:19,035
The imperfect indicative is

255
00:16:21,206 --> 00:16:23,766
different than another imperfect

256
00:16:24,886 --> 00:16:26,399
Which imperfect is that?

257
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,601
Agam?
- The imperfect subjunctive.

258
00:16:29,846 --> 00:16:30,835
Exactly.

259
00:16:31,126 --> 00:16:35,324
The Imperfect subjunctive.
Can anyone give me an example?

260
00:16:37,646 --> 00:16:39,922
I don't believe it, Khoumba,
but go on.

261
00:16:40,206 --> 00:16:44,041
I may be wrong...

262
00:16:44,327 --> 00:16:45,600
I think so too.

263
00:16:45,886 --> 00:16:47,525
- I were
- I were.

264
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:49,684
From the verb "to werr"

265
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,719
- I don't know...
- I wuz.

266
00:16:51,966 --> 00:16:54,276
I were, we were, you were

267
00:16:54,567 --> 00:16:58,196
All right. Not bad but you use it
wrongly.

268
00:16:58,488 --> 00:17:03,117
You vaguely recall
the imperfect subjunctive.

269
00:17:03,407 --> 00:17:05,238
Imagine I say:

270
00:17:05,487 --> 00:17:08,001
"He insist...

271
00:17:08,247 --> 00:17:10,317
"that I be... "

272
00:17:12,327 --> 00:17:15,524
Let's say "in shape".
"He insists that I be in shape"

273
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:18,407
What is "be" in that example?

274
00:17:18,767 --> 00:17:20,679
The present subjunctive.

275
00:17:20,927 --> 00:17:23,999
Very good. For the imperfect
subjunctive,

276
00:17:24,288 --> 00:17:28,042
we follow the sequence of tenses
and use a past:

277
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:29,357
"He insisted... "

278
00:17:29,607 --> 00:17:32,121
- "He insisted that I... "
Khoumba?

279
00:17:32,368 --> 00:17:34,325
- Were.
- Were. Yes.

280
00:17:34,608 --> 00:17:36,838
You really think I'll tell my mom:

281
00:17:37,087 --> 00:17:40,364
"He insisted that I were'd been in shape?

282
00:17:40,648 --> 00:17:43,924
Not I were'd been.
Learn to use it first

283
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,563
"That I were in shape"

284
00:17:46,848 --> 00:17:49,487
- The sequence of tenses.
- No one says that.

285
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:51,963
I was right!

286
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,403
"I were".

287
00:17:54,648 --> 00:17:57,766
Will you let me answer the question?

288
00:17:58,009 --> 00:18:00,079
If you care.
- You may.

289
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:04,561
- Before mastering something,
the imperfect subjunctive,

290
00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:07,448
you're telling me it's no use.

291
00:18:07,689 --> 00:18:10,283
Start by mastering it,

292
00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:13,760
then you can call its use into question.

293
00:18:14,048 --> 00:18:16,244
Sir, why are you criticizing us?

294
00:18:16,489 --> 00:18:20,448
They're right, that's the way
people talked in the old days.

295
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:23,197
Even my gran didn't say that.

296
00:18:23,489 --> 00:18:26,163
Or your great granddad
It's from the Middle Ages!

297
00:18:26,449 --> 00:18:27,883
No it isn't.

298
00:18:28,169 --> 00:18:29,727
It is!

299
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,119
It's bourgeois...

300
00:18:31,369 --> 00:18:35,806
Tell me, when was the last time

301
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,369
you heard someone talk like that?

302
00:18:37,609 --> 00:18:40,841
Yesterday, with friends,
we used the imperfect subjunctive.

303
00:18:41,091 --> 00:18:42,319
No, someone normal!

304
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:45,408
All right, all right.

305
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:47,959
The people on the streets...

306
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,281
Can I reply?

307
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,360
Yep.

308
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:56,244
I'll talk this over, but calmly.

309
00:18:56,491 --> 00:18:59,880
All right, not everyone talks that way.

310
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:02,850
In fact, people who do are pretty rare.

311
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:05,558
I'd even say only snobs...

312
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:08,849
...use the imperfect subjunctive.

313
00:19:09,131 --> 00:19:11,042
What's a snob?

314
00:19:11,331 --> 00:19:15,210
Snobs are slightly affected,
slightly precious people

315
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:17,646
who tend to put on airs.

316
00:19:17,931 --> 00:19:18,966
Homosexuals?

317
00:19:20,491 --> 00:19:22,641
No, not homosexuals...

318
00:19:23,451 --> 00:19:25,043
You can be affected and refined

319
00:19:25,292 --> 00:19:28,363
without being homosexual.

320
00:19:28,691 --> 00:19:30,444
In any case,

321
00:19:30,731 --> 00:19:34,691
this register may seem
formal and a bit affected,

322
00:19:34,931 --> 00:19:36,887
and even bourgeois.

323
00:19:37,131 --> 00:19:40,727
But these different registers exist

324
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:42,882
...as I keep telling you,

325
00:19:43,171 --> 00:19:47,006
...you need to be able to use them

326
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:49,402
...Familiar, current, formal,
oral and written.

327
00:19:49,691 --> 00:19:51,410
Move between them
and use them all. Yes, Lucie?

328
00:19:52,132 --> 00:19:56,251
How do we know what's written
and what's for oral?

329
00:19:56,732 --> 00:19:59,371
Why is a word more one for one register?

330
00:19:59,612 --> 00:20:02,046
Normally, that's something

331
00:20:02,293 --> 00:20:05,329
that you pick up as you go along

332
00:20:06,132 --> 00:20:09,090
You need to use intuition.

333
00:20:09,493 --> 00:20:11,323
What's this?

334
00:20:11,573 --> 00:20:14,929
Intuition is when you can't use thinking

335
00:20:15,212 --> 00:20:18,762
When you can't really...

336
00:20:19,013 --> 00:20:21,367
It's not knowing
but more like sensing something.

337
00:20:21,612 --> 00:20:23,410
When you sense things

338
00:20:24,293 --> 00:20:26,012
What if you don't sense?

339
00:20:27,253 --> 00:20:29,642
If you don't sense them, well…

340
00:20:29,893 --> 00:20:32,885
You gain intuition
by using the language.

341
00:20:33,134 --> 00:20:36,284
That's when you learn to distinguish...

342
00:20:36,533 --> 00:20:39,173
almost automatically
between oral and written styles.

343
00:20:40,093 --> 00:20:43,005
- Souleymane wants to say something.
- Shut it.

344
00:20:43,254 --> 00:20:44,811
What does he want to say?

345
00:20:45,053 --> 00:20:46,202
Go on!

346
00:20:46,614 --> 00:20:49,207
Calm down

347
00:20:50,734 --> 00:20:52,405
Cut it out. No fighting

348
00:20:52,694 --> 00:20:54,969
- I'll whop you
- Don't act tough!

349
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,609
What's wrong? Boubacar, turn around.

350
00:21:00,734 --> 00:21:02,531
- What is it?
- Nothing

351
00:21:02,975 --> 00:21:06,330
- Apparently not.
- Don't send him to the principal.

352
00:21:07,534 --> 00:21:09,969
If I tell you,
I'm good for Guantanamo.

353
00:21:10,215 --> 00:21:11,647
Guantanamo! Guantanamo!

354
00:21:11,933 --> 00:21:13,002
I'll be tased!

355
00:21:13,294 --> 00:21:14,249
You won't be tased.

356
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:17,328
- You have a question?
- Yep

357
00:21:17,615 --> 00:21:18,445
So ask it

358
00:21:18,734 --> 00:21:21,646
- It's too wicked
- It's not

359
00:21:21,934 --> 00:21:23,766
It's the pits for you
- Just ask it

360
00:21:24,055 --> 00:21:25,773
- I have your word?
- Hurry up

361
00:21:26,014 --> 00:21:29,404
This is what I heard, ok?
I didn't say it but I heard...

362
00:21:29,695 --> 00:21:32,289
People say you like men.

363
00:21:37,455 --> 00:21:38,889
I didn't say it!

364
00:21:39,135 --> 00:21:41,728
- Who says that?
- Just people

365
00:21:41,975 --> 00:21:43,966
They say Mr. Marin likes men"

366
00:21:44,215 --> 00:21:45,888
Others say that, not you?

367
00:21:46,296 --> 00:21:48,570
- You not interested?
- No way

368
00:21:48,854 --> 00:21:51,051
- So why do you ask?
- For the others.

369
00:21:51,335 --> 00:21:52,609
I'm spokesman

370
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:55,728
- But you don't care?
- If you like men, fine

371
00:21:57,296 --> 00:21:59,968
- So is it true?
- You are asking me.

372
00:22:00,255 --> 00:22:02,850
Homosexual isn’t an insult, sir.

373
00:22:04,215 --> 00:22:06,446
You say it isn't but it seems
to be a problem for you.

374
00:22:06,736 --> 00:22:09,967
You find it odd, men liking men.

375
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:14,005
Maybe it is, I don't know
It is true or not?

376
00:22:14,296 --> 00:22:16,287
No, it's not. Feel better now?

377
00:22:16,697 --> 00:22:17,651
Yeah? Sure.

378
00:22:20,576 --> 00:22:22,407
Sorry to disappoint you.

379
00:22:24,537 --> 00:22:27,334
All right, if Souleymane doesn't mind

380
00:22:27,616 --> 00:22:29,766
now he's settle his hang-ups,

381
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:32,247
let's get back
to the imperfect indicative.

382
00:22:37,417 --> 00:22:39,135
Yeah, like that! Not bad

383
00:22:45,377 --> 00:22:46,856
- What are you doing?
- Stop.

384
00:22:47,097 --> 00:22:48,415
- What's up?
- Get lost

385
00:22:52,818 --> 00:22:55,331
Who asked you? Look at your mug
- Get lost

386
00:22:55,656 --> 00:22:57,568
- It's fucking ok!
Take these jerks,

387
00:22:57,858 --> 00:22:59,052
then we'll see

388
00:22:59,297 --> 00:23:01,254
Go on, show me your backs

389
00:23:01,538 --> 00:23:03,972
- These guys suck.
- Another one.

390
00:23:04,577 --> 00:23:07,011
- Classy display
- You bet

391
00:23:07,258 --> 00:23:09,533
- Got one for me?
- Can't afford it

392
00:23:09,777 --> 00:23:11,177
- How much?
- Too much!

393
00:23:11,418 --> 00:23:13,773
Stop thinking I'm broke like you!

394
00:23:19,137 --> 00:23:22,767
She screwed up there
She thinks it's regular verb

395
00:23:23,018 --> 00:23:25,087
No the verb's swim. Swimmed.

396
00:23:32,898 --> 00:23:35,777
Justine! "Swimmed"!

397
00:23:37,738 --> 00:23:39,615
Justine, work it out yourself

398
00:23:41,498 --> 00:23:44,616
Swummed. That's better,
it mixes the two.

399
00:23:45,459 --> 00:23:47,528
Swammed!

400
00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:53,012
She put swemmed

401
00:23:55,739 --> 00:23:58,617
- Ok, thank you
- Try swommed

402
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:01,730
You can sit down

403
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:03,335
Let's see.

404
00:24:03,619 --> 00:24:05,052
Let's see

405
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:06,893
She can’t write

406
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,809
She can’t write? Can you, Rabah?

407
00:24:10,099 --> 00:24:11,612
- You bet
- Go on then

408
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,457
Conjugate it properly

409
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,055
- Swummed
- No

410
00:24:18,379 --> 00:24:19,653
Continue.

411
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,650
Swammed

412
00:24:24,899 --> 00:24:25,775
Wrong again

413
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,172
Just kidding

414
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,371
- It’s not like that
- So what is it?

415
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,615
Without an I

416
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,692
Right, no I

417
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:43,015
Why make fun of Justine,

418
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,053
when you can’t do better?

419
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:49,253
Justine wasn’t so wrong

420
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:52,055
That’s enough

421
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,771
You cant focus for more
than 20 seconds

422
00:24:59,021 --> 00:25:00,295
like 3 year olds

423
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:04,011
People aged 14 or 15
like you’re supposed to be

424
00:25:04,541 --> 00:25:07,578
If I ask a question
they should know

425
00:25:07,861 --> 00:25:10,250
Your kidding around goes too far!

426
00:25:10,501 --> 00:25:11,570
Not at all

427
00:25:11,821 --> 00:25:13,812
- Everyone thinks so
- Dead right

428
00:25:14,101 --> 00:25:16,934
Everyone thinks so
or only you think so?

429
00:25:17,221 --> 00:25:18,415
No, everyone!

430
00:25:18,661 --> 00:25:21,300
I think you push it.

431
00:25:21,822 --> 00:25:26,772
If I cut you some slack,
you'll never get anywhere

432
00:25:27,102 --> 00:25:28,854
You go too far!

433
00:25:29,142 --> 00:25:31,211
And you know why

434
00:25:34,902 --> 00:25:38,133
I’m sick of these clowns!
Sick of them!

435
00:25:38,741 --> 00:25:40,971
I can’t take any more

436
00:25:41,262 --> 00:25:44,573
They’re nothing,
they know nothing...

437
00:25:44,862 --> 00:25:48,172
they look right through you
when you try to teach them

438
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:50,060
They cat stay in their shit

439
00:25:50,303 --> 00:25:51,816
I’m not going to help them

440
00:25:53,422 --> 00:25:56,016
They’re so basic, so insincere

441
00:25:56,302 --> 00:25:58,100
...always looking for trouble

442
00:25:58,342 --> 00:25:59,696
Go ahead, guys

443
00:25:59,983 --> 00:26:01,938
...Stay in your crap neighborhood

444
00:26:02,222 --> 00:26:05,977
You’ll be here all yours lives
and it serves you right

445
00:26:06,223 --> 00:26:10,899
Ill see the principal and tell him
I’m not working with 3/2 again.

446
00:26:11,583 --> 00:26:15,337
No more technology
for the rest of the year. Too bad

447
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:19,338
It’s been three months now and
they haven’t done a single thing

448
00:26:19,863 --> 00:26:23,572
Have you seen them in the yard?
It’s like they’re in heat

449
00:26:23,863 --> 00:26:27,334
They’re all over each other,
like animals

450
00:26:27,584 --> 00:26:28,494
It’s crazy. It’s the same in class

451
00:26:28,784 --> 00:26:31,934
Kevin spent a whole hour doing

452
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:37,171
I’ve never seen the like
of it in 5 years!

453
00:26:41,264 --> 00:26:43,779
Enough, no more!

454
00:26:44,424 --> 00:26:46,732
We’re not animals!

455
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:54,782
Sorry I’m…

456
00:26:56,904 --> 00:26:58,258
It’s dumb.

457
00:27:02,944 --> 00:27:06,015
Come on. Let's get some air

458
00:27:15,144 --> 00:27:17,499
One extract isn’t a lot to read

459
00:27:17,745 --> 00:27:19,576
No one did it?

460
00:27:22,344 --> 00:27:24,222
We’re wasting time here

461
00:27:25,065 --> 00:27:26,737
Let’s read it again then

462
00:27:28,186 --> 00:27:29,413
Who wants to read?

463
00:27:32,705 --> 00:27:35,822
Great! Excellent work
atmosphere today.

464
00:27:36,385 --> 00:27:37,784
Khoumba, go on.

465
00:27:38,745 --> 00:27:39,416
No way.

466
00:27:40,705 --> 00:27:41,661
You won’t read?

467
00:27:42,185 --> 00:27:43,699
I don’t want to

468
00:27:44,065 --> 00:27:46,500
The class revolves
around your desires?

469
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:49,534
- I don’t want to read
- Don’t care

470
00:27:51,865 --> 00:27:53,503
What did Khoumba just do?

471
00:27:54,345 --> 00:27:55,904
- Wey?
- Sneer

472
00:27:56,186 --> 00:27:58,780
I meant her attitude,
What did she show?

473
00:27:59,225 --> 00:28:01,137
Insolence.

474
00:28:01,906 --> 00:28:03,703
That’s right, you’re an expert

475
00:28:07,146 --> 00:28:10,343
You’re all angrulo with me

476
00:28:10,626 --> 00:28:12,379
What is this?
- That’s not true

477
00:28:12,627 --> 00:28:15,424
Try saying it in French. What am I?

478
00:28:16,387 --> 00:28:17,136
Angrulo

479
00:28:17,666 --> 00:28:19,019
Say it in everyday French

480
00:28:19,307 --> 00:28:21,298
- You’ve got it in for me
- That’s normal French

481
00:28:25,947 --> 00:28:27,266
I just want you to read

482
00:28:27,508 --> 00:28:30,418
I have the right to ask you
to read, don’t I?

483
00:28:30,707 --> 00:28:32,140
Don’t you think so?
- No.

484
00:28:33,187 --> 00:28:33,937
No one has read it

485
00:28:34,227 --> 00:28:36,695
and you’re picking on me.

486
00:28:36,987 --> 00:28:38,500
I’m not. I want to work

487
00:28:38,787 --> 00:28:41,460
and I’ve chosen you
as I have the rights to.

488
00:28:41,707 --> 00:28:42,742
Drop it.

489
00:28:43,027 --> 00:28:45,063
Shut up and start reading

490
00:28:45,387 --> 00:28:46,661
I won’t read

491
00:28:46,907 --> 00:28:50,502
You tell me to shut up,
then to read. What is this?

492
00:28:50,787 --> 00:28:51,902
What’s what?

493
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:53,337
Make your mind up,

494
00:28:53,587 --> 00:28:54,815
Think it through

495
00:28:55,107 --> 00:28:57,417
Well talk it over after class

496
00:28:57,708 --> 00:28:59,300
It won’t be fun
- Sure

497
00:28:59,867 --> 00:29:01,904
You won’t say that later

498
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:06,826
Esmeralda, are you on strike too
or can you read for us?

499
00:29:07,107 --> 00:29:08,541
It’s her life

500
00:29:08,828 --> 00:29:11,296
In that case, will you read for us?

501
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:13,618
I'd be delighted to

502
00:29:13,868 --> 00:29:15,460
All right, were listening

503
00:29:15,708 --> 00:29:16,663
"Dear Kitty

504
00:29:16,909 --> 00:29:20,025
I’m known as a bundle
of contradictions.

505
00:29:20,428 --> 00:29:22,658
"As I’ve told you several times...

506
00:29:22,909 --> 00:29:25,218
..."my soul is split in two

507
00:29:25,748 --> 00:29:28,137
"my mocking approach to
everything, my joy in life,

508
00:29:28,388 --> 00:29:30,026
..."On one side

509
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:31,702
my exuberant cheerfulness

510
00:29:31,948 --> 00:29:35,065
..."and my ability
to take things lightly

511
00:29:35,429 --> 00:29:39,024
"By that I mean not seeing
any wrong in flirting...

512
00:29:39,268 --> 00:29:42,739
..."giving a kiss, embracing someone,

513
00:29:42,988 --> 00:29:45,139
..."or telling a tasteless joke

514
00:29:45,709 --> 00:29:48,668
"That side lies in wait
pushing back the other side...

515
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:52,982
..." which is more beautiful,
purer and deeper.

516
00:29:53,469 --> 00:29:55,108
"The truth is that no one knows,

517
00:29:55,349 --> 00:29:57,817
..."Anne's better side...

518
00:29:58,069 --> 00:29:59,821
..."and that's why most people...

519
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,225
..."can't stand me.

520
00:30:01,469 --> 00:30:05,382
"I can be an amusing clown
for an afternoon

521
00:30:05,629 --> 00:30:08,542
..."but then everyone

522
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:12,699
"has had enough of me,

523
00:30:12,949 --> 00:30:14,383
..."So the nice Anne has never once,

524
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:15,700
..."been seen in company

525
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:18,862
"But, in her loneliness,
she always triumphs.

526
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,859
"My best to you. Anne Franck.
Anne's diary ends here

527
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,544
It ends here. Why?

528
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:27,266
Because the police turned up
at the rooms

529
00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:29,939
...where they were hiding
and deported them.

530
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,305
She died shortly after

531
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:35,299
...That's what I asked earlier
We talked about it.

532
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,940
I learn about Anne Frank

533
00:30:38,231 --> 00:30:41,666
because she talks about herself
and so I get to know her.

534
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:46,264
When I ask you to write
your own self-portraits,

535
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,069
...I'll expect the same.

536
00:30:48,351 --> 00:30:51,866
...In other words, to learn things
through your feelings,

537
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:54,387
...You can talk about facts...

538
00:30:55,111 --> 00:30:59,024
...that will allow
me to know you better.

539
00:31:00,791 --> 00:31:02,783
Yes, Lucie?

540
00:31:03,032 --> 00:31:04,783
What we write

541
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:10,465
won't be as gripping as...
as what Anne Franck wrote

542
00:31:10,752 --> 00:31:14,028
Our lives aren't as gripping.
- All right

543
00:31:14,311 --> 00:31:14,869
Juliette?

544
00:31:16,831 --> 00:31:20,108
Someone aged 70
could talk about their life,

545
00:31:20,352 --> 00:31:25,025
...but we have nothing to tell at 13,

546
00:31:25,392 --> 00:31:28,464
At 14, 15 or even 13
you've had experiences

547
00:31:28,952 --> 00:31:31,910
- Less then someone aged 70
They’ve live a lot more.

548
00:31:34,071 --> 00:31:35,505
- OK
- They’ve seen life.

549
00:31:35,792 --> 00:31:39,421
It’s funny. You don’t think
your lives are interesting.

550
00:31:39,713 --> 00:31:42,670
We just come to school, go home,
eat and sleep.

551
00:31:43,992 --> 00:31:46,666
You come to school, eat, sleep, fine

552
00:31:46,913 --> 00:31:49,506
The bare facts of your life are dull

553
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:53,508
But what you feel is interesting
- That’s my business

554
00:31:53,792 --> 00:31:56,023
Maybe, but I’m interested

555
00:31:56,312 --> 00:31:57,825
That’s different

556
00:31:58,113 --> 00:31:59,341
Why is it different?

557
00:32:00,553 --> 00:32:02,544
Because you're a teacher.

558
00:32:03,233 --> 00:32:04,984
It’s not the teacher talking.

559
00:32:05,273 --> 00:32:06,991
- It’s the human being
- It’s your job

560
00:32:09,873 --> 00:32:12,945
I think you’re only saying that
to get us to talk and stuff

561
00:32:13,193 --> 00:32:14,865
...but its not true.

562
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:17,428
It isn’t? What isn’t true?

563
00:32:17,833 --> 00:32:22,190
The fact that you’re interested
in knowing all that

564
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:24,226
So I’m not interested at all

565
00:32:24,474 --> 00:32:26,668
...and I’m pushing at this

566
00:32:26,954 --> 00:32:28,910
...to convince you its interesting?

567
00:32:29,154 --> 00:32:31,588
Not as much as you say

568
00:32:32,194 --> 00:32:34,661
Maybe I am exaggerating a little.

569
00:32:35,514 --> 00:32:38,904
It’s only natural since
you don’t agree with me

570
00:32:39,315 --> 00:32:41,509
But, deep down, I’m totally sincere

571
00:32:41,754 --> 00:32:45,350
Why it is such a problem for you

572
00:32:45,634 --> 00:32:47,943
...to talk about your lives?
Boubacar.

573
00:32:48,193 --> 00:32:49,991
Well there stuff...

574
00:32:51,355 --> 00:32:52,868
There’s private stuff.

575
00:32:53,234 --> 00:32:55,429
Of course

576
00:32:55,714 --> 00:32:59,468
What could be hard to say
about your private lives?

577
00:33:00,394 --> 00:33:01,145
Burak.

578
00:33:01,395 --> 00:33:04,306
- We may be ashamed
to say certain things

579
00:33:05,394 --> 00:33:07,545
Yes, it has to do with shame.

580
00:33:07,795 --> 00:33:11,071
Things you find it hard to say
and even harder to write.

581
00:33:13,195 --> 00:33:15,425
On your life, when were you ashamed?

582
00:33:15,675 --> 00:33:18,547
You can be ashamed of pal's mom...

583
00:33:19,195 --> 00:33:21,629
Why? Because you find her ugly?

584
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:26,549
No. For instance, Rabah's mom,

585
00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:28,866
She offered me lunch but I refused

586
00:33:29,155 --> 00:33:30,475
because I was ashamed

587
00:33:31,156 --> 00:33:32,474
Ashamed to eat with her?

588
00:33:33,075 --> 00:33:35,270
Because it’s beneath you?
- No.

589
00:33:35,996 --> 00:33:38,305
I don’t understand, Tell me why.

590
00:33:38,597 --> 00:33:42,305
I’m ashamed to eat with her
because I respect her.

591
00:33:42,675 --> 00:33:45,634
You never eat with people who
you respect?

592
00:33:45,917 --> 00:33:48,588
I mean, she’s not my girlfriend!

593
00:33:49,676 --> 00:33:53,550
You can only eat with
a girlfriend...

594
00:33:53,796 --> 00:33:55,945
Tell me why. I’m interested

595
00:33:56,196 --> 00:33:58,756
I can’t explain it.
In any case, I’m ashamed

596
00:33:58,996 --> 00:34:02,750
I always hang out with Rabah

597
00:34:03,036 --> 00:34:05,231
so I respect his mom

598
00:34:05,517 --> 00:34:06,916
I don’t eat in front of her

599
00:34:07,517 --> 00:34:11,395
So if Boubacar eats in front of us
he doesn’t respects us

600
00:34:11,797 --> 00:34:13,196
No, it’s not that!

601
00:34:15,117 --> 00:34:18,631
- You can’t understand.
- I’m not smart enough?

602
00:34:18,877 --> 00:34:21,266
You just can’t understand.

603
00:34:21,597 --> 00:34:22,268
Rabah?

604
00:34:22,517 --> 00:34:25,031
I was at a party with Camemberters

605
00:34:25,277 --> 00:34:26,789
Camemberters?

606
00:34:27,077 --> 00:34:28,032
Yeah, like you

607
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:29,272
What's a Camemberter?

608
00:34:29,837 --> 00:34:31,792
Someone who stinks of cheese

609
00:34:32,117 --> 00:34:35,951
So the people at the party
stank of cheese?

610
00:34:36,238 --> 00:34:38,388
They were all in suits and ties.

611
00:34:38,637 --> 00:34:41,469
I was in my baggies and
got these weird looks

612
00:34:41,757 --> 00:34:43,271
You were ashamed?

613
00:34:43,558 --> 00:34:44,832
Because of the looks

614
00:34:45,078 --> 00:34:47,512
They were embarrassed because of you

615
00:34:47,797 --> 00:34:49,389
...and you felt the same

616
00:34:49,638 --> 00:34:50,957
They weren’t embarrassed

617
00:34:51,238 --> 00:34:54,229
They looked at me
like I was an E.T.

618
00:34:54,477 --> 00:34:55,387
You are an E.T.!

619
00:34:55,638 --> 00:34:57,390
"Why’s that Arab here?"

620
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,350
Ok, so it was a race thing

621
00:34:59,638 --> 00:35:02,198
I don’t know

622
00:35:02,438 --> 00:35:04,554
But the snacks were bacon-flavored

623
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,872
So I... abstained

624
00:35:10,158 --> 00:35:13,549
Right. Bacon, ham... Ok, I get it

625
00:35:14,319 --> 00:35:15,308
Wey...

626
00:35:15,558 --> 00:35:18,197
Young people now have no shame.

627
00:35:18,479 --> 00:35:20,356
Young people now? Like you?

628
00:35:20,879 --> 00:35:21,675
Yeah

629
00:35:21,959 --> 00:35:24,553
- Drop your briefs!
- They have no shame

630
00:35:25,278 --> 00:35:27,509
It’s normal. Always normal

631
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,478
Are you like them?

632
00:35:29,759 --> 00:35:31,350
- No.
- Are you ashamed?

633
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,509
Yes, ashamed of them.

634
00:35:36,399 --> 00:35:38,151
I’ll waste your ugly mug!

635
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,628
Anyone can speak, but
you stay polite, OK.

636
00:35:43,879 --> 00:35:46,439
So why are you ashamed for them?

637
00:35:46,839 --> 00:35:49,751
They have no shame

638
00:35:49,999 --> 00:35:52,195
They yell, they hit each other.
They make jokes,

639
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,317
bother others. No shame

640
00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:56,512
Wey, aren’t you confusing

641
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,152
shame and discipline?

642
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,590
You find the others...

643
00:36:00,879 --> 00:36:02,393
rowdy and impolite.

644
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,717
It can be shameful too

645
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,558
Louise?

646
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,950
You can be ashamed of your appearance

647
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,395
Absolutely

648
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,308
Tell me Louise

649
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,909
what are you ashamed of?

650
00:36:19,961 --> 00:36:21,280
My ears

651
00:36:21,561 --> 00:36:22,709
Your ears?

652
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,791
Can we see? You’re ashamed of your ears?

653
00:36:26,401 --> 00:36:28,278
What’s wrong with them?

654
00:36:28,521 --> 00:36:30,431
They stick out

655
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,955
- You think they stick out
- Mine too

656
00:36:33,241 --> 00:36:34,959
I think that covers it all.

657
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,432
You have all you need
to figure it out

658
00:36:38,681 --> 00:36:41,275
Take out your exercise books.

659
00:36:42,641 --> 00:36:47,032
Note the following exercise
for next Thursday

660
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:54,320
It’s very simple:
Write your self portrait.

661
00:37:00,081 --> 00:37:02,152
A self-portrait
isn’t an autobiography.

662
00:37:02,401 --> 00:37:05,712
I don’t want your life story

663
00:37:06,002 --> 00:37:08,037
Describe yourself and your personality.

664
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:11,270
We’ll read them in class

665
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,951
...and see how we can use them

666
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:26,394
Khoumba.

667
00:37:26,963 --> 00:37:29,317
You know I want to see you

668
00:37:34,843 --> 00:37:36,594
Give me your report book

669
00:37:36,842 --> 00:37:37,592
Why?

670
00:37:37,842 --> 00:37:39,594
You know why.

671
00:37:45,323 --> 00:37:48,041
No, give it to me. Politely.

672
00:37:48,283 --> 00:37:50,001
That’s enough now

673
00:37:50,484 --> 00:37:53,042
Put your photo on it

674
00:37:58,283 --> 00:38:00,592
Is it normal to refuse to read

675
00:38:00,843 --> 00:38:02,834
when teacher asks you to?
Is that normal?

676
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:05,154
There’s others in the class.

677
00:38:05,443 --> 00:38:07,593
I can’t turn a blind eye to this.

678
00:38:07,883 --> 00:38:09,077
Can I?

679
00:38:09,323 --> 00:38:10,551
OK.

680
00:38:13,563 --> 00:38:15,838
What happened this summer?

681
00:38:17,204 --> 00:38:19,274
What happened during the vacation?

682
00:38:19,524 --> 00:38:21,116
- I didn’t see you
- I know.

683
00:38:21,403 --> 00:38:22,677
I’m intrigued.

684
00:38:22,923 --> 00:38:24,277
At the end of the year in June

685
00:38:24,524 --> 00:38:26,879
...we’d gotten on pretty well together

686
00:38:27,164 --> 00:38:29,598
You participated in class.

687
00:38:29,884 --> 00:38:32,193
Since September,
since the start of this year,

688
00:38:32,445 --> 00:38:34,436
You’re not cooperative,

689
00:38:35,044 --> 00:38:38,515
...You keep sulking,
You refuse to read... What happened?

690
00:38:38,764 --> 00:38:41,757
I don’t like reading now.
Can you hurry, please?

691
00:38:42,045 --> 00:38:43,841
No, I won’t hurry!

692
00:38:50,444 --> 00:38:51,479
Explain.

693
00:38:51,724 --> 00:38:54,796
Why have things changed
all of a sudden?

694
00:38:55,045 --> 00:38:56,957
I can’t stay a kid forever

695
00:38:57,924 --> 00:39:00,200
So it’s a kid thing to cooperate?

696
00:39:00,445 --> 00:39:03,039
That's it
- There's others in the class.

697
00:39:03,286 --> 00:39:04,877
Of course, when you work, it's

698
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:08,844
I haven’t finished.

699
00:39:09,085 --> 00:39:10,599
My moms waiting for me

700
00:39:10,845 --> 00:39:12,995
I want an apology first

701
00:39:13,244 --> 00:39:15,476
An apology for what you did

702
00:39:16,405 --> 00:39:18,522
"I apologize for
being insolent, sir"

703
00:39:18,766 --> 00:39:19,357
Sorry. Ok?

704
00:39:19,646 --> 00:39:21,841
No, not sorry.

705
00:39:22,085 --> 00:39:24,156
"I apologize for being insolent"

706
00:39:24,485 --> 00:39:25,634
Go ahead

707
00:39:27,126 --> 00:39:28,878
"I apologize, sir"

708
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:31,838
- "No, I apologize
for being insolent"

709
00:39:32,126 --> 00:39:34,401
Be sincere. I want a real apology

710
00:39:34,646 --> 00:39:36,523
Can you hurry up, please?

711
00:39:36,805 --> 00:39:38,876
- My moms waiting
- For your apology

712
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:40,316
Let’s deal with this

713
00:39:40,566 --> 00:39:42,318
I want a sincere apology

714
00:39:42,566 --> 00:39:45,478
...that’ll stand for the rest of the year

715
00:39:45,726 --> 00:39:47,445
We won’t go on like this

716
00:39:47,687 --> 00:39:50,996
I apologize for being insolent.

717
00:39:52,406 --> 00:39:53,395
More conviction!

718
00:39:54,727 --> 00:39:56,797
I’m not saying it 50 times

719
00:39:57,046 --> 00:39:59,116
- You two,
What are you up to?

720
00:39:59,366 --> 00:40:01,357
We’re waiting

721
00:40:01,646 --> 00:40:03,524
Hurry, I’m listening

722
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:06,076
I apologize for being insolent.

723
00:40:06,326 --> 00:40:07,476
May I go now, please?

724
00:40:15,807 --> 00:40:17,001
I didn’t mean it

725
00:40:28,207 --> 00:40:32,121
Two weeks ago, at the last meeting

726
00:40:32,327 --> 00:40:34,046
the teachers suggested

727
00:40:35,047 --> 00:40:38,643
introducing a penalty point system
for the students

728
00:40:38,888 --> 00:40:42,005
...based on the driving license system

729
00:40:42,247 --> 00:40:44,921
If student broke a rule

730
00:40:45,168 --> 00:40:47,284
...they would lose points

731
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:50,520
As its teachers idea,
I’ll let them to speak

732
00:40:50,767 --> 00:40:54,886
Since last September...

733
00:40:55,129 --> 00:40:57,642
...we’ve noticed an increase
in problems within the school.

734
00:40:58,088 --> 00:41:00,966
Punishment has no effect
on the students

735
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,483
So we had the idea

736
00:41:02,769 --> 00:41:03,996
...of a penalty system

737
00:41:04,248 --> 00:41:08,606
The students would have
for example six points each

738
00:41:08,849 --> 00:41:12,922
and depending on the misdeed
they’d lose one or two points.

739
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:15,325
And when they run out of points?

740
00:41:15,568 --> 00:41:18,447
They go before the disciplinary committee.

741
00:41:18,849 --> 00:41:21,044
As a parents representative...

742
00:41:21,329 --> 00:41:25,368
...this is typical
of the schools bad habits…

743
00:41:26,129 --> 00:41:28,324
You always condemn the students...

744
00:41:29,409 --> 00:41:30,888
...but never praise them

745
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:33,166
They earn praise on their own

746
00:41:33,409 --> 00:41:37,084
They do it with their grades,
by moving up a class

747
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:39,639
and we do it in staff meetings...

748
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:42,244
...by encouraging them to work.

749
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:46,409
There’s the honor roll,
the congratulations.

750
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:48,043
that all counts.

751
00:41:48,289 --> 00:41:49,848
In your system

752
00:41:50,129 --> 00:41:52,518
...you take away points for misdeeds

753
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,169
but why not further

754
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:57,401
...and give points to those
who do good things?

755
00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:59,488
Like gold stars.

756
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:02,165
I’m all for praising the students.

757
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:06,403
but if student collect points
and end up with 34 points, say,

758
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:10,240
...That leaves room
for all kinds of trouble,

759
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:11,645
...we can’t control

760
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:14,200
Without going as far...

761
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:15,680
as these imaginary 34 points

762
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:18,922
...six points to start with,

763
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:22,242
means they can cause trouble
without punishment.

764
00:42:22,531 --> 00:42:26,649
Losing a point or two
isn’t a real punishment.

765
00:42:26,891 --> 00:42:30,008
It can create
a dangerous sense of impunity.

766
00:42:30,291 --> 00:42:33,566
For me, the ideas
totally wrong-headed.

767
00:42:33,811 --> 00:42:34,926
In that case,

768
00:42:35,211 --> 00:42:36,850
...we could find a punishment

769
00:42:37,091 --> 00:42:40,527
...where the students
lose all their points in one go...

770
00:42:42,491 --> 00:42:45,881
But why bother with the points
in that case?

771
00:42:46,732 --> 00:42:48,562
It’s tricky

772
00:42:48,851 --> 00:42:50,807
- What you call a sense of impunity
gives us a room to maneuver,

773
00:42:51,051 --> 00:42:54,010
...When you’re dealing
with punishments.

774
00:42:54,252 --> 00:42:58,803
that are cut and dried,

775
00:42:59,052 --> 00:43:01,646
you can’t adapt them to each case

776
00:43:01,892 --> 00:43:03,644
I don’t agree

777
00:43:03,932 --> 00:43:05,206
The rules apply in the same way

778
00:43:05,451 --> 00:43:07,488
...to all the students

779
00:43:07,733 --> 00:43:09,529
They break them, they’re punished

780
00:43:09,772 --> 00:43:12,366
If not, why bother with rules?

781
00:43:12,612 --> 00:43:15,081
Dealing with extremely strict rules

782
00:43:15,332 --> 00:43:16,846
...creates the greatest tension...

783
00:43:17,092 --> 00:43:18,411
Take cell phones

784
00:43:18,692 --> 00:43:22,447
We agreed on a rule...

785
00:43:22,732 --> 00:43:23,802
...that cell phones
were not allowed in class

786
00:43:24,053 --> 00:43:26,203
Sorry, but I break that rule

787
00:43:26,452 --> 00:43:28,728
...because it wasn’t problem for me

788
00:43:29,012 --> 00:43:31,924
There’s room to be tolerant.

789
00:43:32,172 --> 00:43:33,969
The reign of the arbitrary.

790
00:43:34,533 --> 00:43:36,967
No, the law
and the spirit of the law.

791
00:43:37,253 --> 00:43:40,050
We could talk all night
but its not possible

792
00:43:40,332 --> 00:43:43,131
We have other topics to tackle.

793
00:43:43,373 --> 00:43:47,764
In particular, one vital issue,

794
00:43:48,213 --> 00:43:52,445
a very sensitive one,
concerning the staff coffee machine.

795
00:43:52,774 --> 00:43:55,333
It’s a sensitive issue, all right

796
00:43:55,894 --> 00:43:59,771
There’s a real problem this year...

797
00:44:01,933 --> 00:44:05,370
...The price of a coffee has gone up
from 40 centimes

798
00:44:05,614 --> 00:44:07,252
to 50 centimes

799
00:44:07,494 --> 00:44:09,405
That may seem petty...

800
00:44:09,693 --> 00:44:11,012
...but with several coffees a day,

801
00:44:11,254 --> 00:44:14,372
...at 8, 10 or 4
in the afternoon...

802
00:44:14,654 --> 00:44:18,408
it works out a lot

803
00:44:19,014 --> 00:44:21,483
...So we've clubbed together
to buy a coffee maker.

804
00:44:23,055 --> 00:44:26,730
- That way we can drink
as much coffee as we want...

805
00:44:27,014 --> 00:44:30,246
...without having to count.

806
00:44:31,015 --> 00:44:34,132
- Mr. Pierre will be delighted
to reply.

807
00:44:34,374 --> 00:44:41,084
- First of all, this machine
was installed in 2001...

808
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:41,407
to replace a machine

809
00:44:41,654 --> 00:44:43,566
...that needed the intervention of...

810
00:44:43,815 --> 00:44:46,329
...an outside company for restocking

811
00:44:46,614 --> 00:44:49,925
...repairs etc.
It was very expensive

812
00:44:50,175 --> 00:44:51,574
And not at all profitable

813
00:44:52,215 --> 00:44:55,890
We switched to the new machine,
which isn’t profitable yet

814
00:44:56,295 --> 00:44:58,013
I’m sorry to hear that!

815
00:44:58,255 --> 00:44:59,928
And so we increased

816
00:45:00,576 --> 00:45:04,170
...the price of coffee by ten centimes.

817
00:45:04,415 --> 00:45:07,294
The thing has to be
economically viable

818
00:45:08,096 --> 00:45:11,884
- Nobody’s shocked?
- It’s clear and logical for me.

819
00:45:38,976 --> 00:45:41,490
- Good evening. Don’t move
- We have to go

820
00:45:41,737 --> 00:45:43,090
We haven’t finished

821
00:45:57,537 --> 00:45:59,926
" Respect

822
00:46:00,177 --> 00:46:03,374
" Adolescents
learn to respect their teachers...

823
00:46:03,617 --> 00:46:05,847
..." because of threats...

824
00:46:06,137 --> 00:46:08,047
..." or the fear of having problems

825
00:46:08,297 --> 00:46:10,448
" For starters, I respect you...

826
00:46:10,697 --> 00:46:13,131
..." and respect must be mutual

827
00:46:13,658 --> 00:46:16,536
For instance,
I didn’t say you’re hysterical

828
00:46:16,777 --> 00:46:18,973
..." so why do you say I am?

829
00:46:20,497 --> 00:46:22,613
" I’ve always respected you

830
00:46:22,857 --> 00:46:25,930
..." so I don’t understand
why I have to write this.

831
00:46:27,498 --> 00:46:32,492
" I know you have it in for me
but don’t know why.

832
00:46:33,538 --> 00:46:35,688
" I shall sit at the back...

833
00:46:35,978 --> 00:46:38,889
..." to avoid any other conflicts.

834
00:46:39,658 --> 00:46:41,569
" unless you come looking for them.

835
00:46:42,539 --> 00:46:44,257
" I admit I can be insolent...

836
00:46:44,498 --> 00:46:47,171
..." but only if provoked.

837
00:46:47,419 --> 00:46:49,614
" I wont look at you again,.

838
00:46:49,859 --> 00:46:52,816
" so you cant say
my look is insolent.

839
00:46:53,218 --> 00:46:55,095

841

00:47:01,458 --> 00:47:02,573
" And so, from now on,

843
00:47:02,859 --> 00:47:04,929
..." I wont spell to you again.. "

844
00:47:05,179 --> 00:47:07,056
Signed Khoumba.

845
00:47:07,738 --> 00:47:09,172
- What is it?
- Secret.

846
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:11,256
- A secret?
- A secret.

847
00:47:11,499 --> 00:47:13,729
It won’t stay a secret for long.

848
00:47:19,059 --> 00:47:21,335
Esmeralda,
Why have you changed places?

849
00:47:21,579 --> 00:47:22,169
No reason.

850
00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:24,613
I felt like it.

851
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:27,979
- A problem?
- No, not at all.

852
00:47:29,019 --> 00:47:30,338
No problem.

853
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:32,736
I wanted a change of scene.

854
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:42,055
Ok, that’s enough.
Let’s get to work.

855
00:47:42,981 --> 00:47:44,299
No, sir, please!

856
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:47,171
Please, sir!

857
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,576
You’re just copying
what you did at home

858
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:52,420
You’ve had plenty of time

859
00:47:54,141 --> 00:47:54,936
Esmeralda.

860
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:58,020
I have to?

861
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:00,491
Yes, absolutely.

862
00:48:03,501 --> 00:48:04,980
My name is Esmeralda Ouertani.

863
00:48:05,581 --> 00:48:06,457
I'm 14...

864
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:09,134
...I live on Allee du Pere Dhuit...

865
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:11,212
...Paris 20,

866
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:14,412
...with my two parents and
my three brothers and sisters.

867
00:48:14,661 --> 00:48:15,410
Later,

868
00:48:15,701 --> 00:48:17,293
...I’d like to be a policewoman...

869
00:48:17,541 --> 00:48:21,011
...because people say
all policeman are bad,

870
00:48:21,261 --> 00:48:23,092
...and so we need good ones.

871
00:48:23,341 --> 00:48:25,902
If not, I’d like to be a rapper...

872
00:48:26,142 --> 00:48:29,053
...and I’m fan of Bakar, Medine,

873
00:48:29,821 --> 00:48:32,211
...Younes, Marvin and Mafiak1 Fry.

874
00:48:32,461 --> 00:48:33,258
Otherwise,

875
00:48:33,542 --> 00:48:36,931
I like eating, sleeping
and hanging out in the hood.

876
00:48:37,701 --> 00:48:38,690
Or rather?

877
00:48:39,181 --> 00:48:40,410
- The neighborhood.
- You can say it right.

878
00:48:41,101 --> 00:48:42,774
When you write,

879
00:48:43,221 --> 00:48:45,177
you use the standard style...

880
00:48:45,462 --> 00:48:48,340
Don’t make me correct you.

881
00:48:48,982 --> 00:48:50,210
Wey, go on.

882
00:48:52,982 --> 00:48:55,018
My names Wey, I’m Chinese.

883
00:48:55,302 --> 00:48:58,691
I’m 15, I have two sisters,
I’m the youngest.

884
00:48:58,942 --> 00:49:00,534
My hobby is playing video games

885
00:49:00,782 --> 00:49:02,818
at least 4 hours a day.

886
00:49:04,183 --> 00:49:06,491
I find it hard
using French correctly.

887
00:49:06,782 --> 00:49:09,251
It’s so hard expressing myself...

888
00:49:09,502 --> 00:49:11,812
...that others don’t understand me.

889
00:49:12,343 --> 00:49:14,776
That’s why I don’t communicate much.

890
00:49:16,142 --> 00:49:20,134
I hardly ever go out.
Nothing much interests me outside...

891
00:49:21,022 --> 00:49:25,083
The environment doesn’t suit me here
since I’m allergic

892
00:49:25,383 --> 00:49:27,021
...but i don’t know what.

893
00:49:27,543 --> 00:49:30,296
Allergic to yourself, that’s what.

894
00:49:30,542 --> 00:49:31,737
That’s good, Wey.

895
00:49:32,023 --> 00:49:34,491
I feel I know you better...

896
00:49:34,784 --> 00:49:37,216
...after hearing your self portrait.

897
00:49:37,943 --> 00:49:41,459
That’s the goal. To tell us things.

898
00:49:42,144 --> 00:49:44,293
He’s just happens to be good,
not ours

899
00:49:44,583 --> 00:49:46,256
No, not at all.

900
00:49:46,543 --> 00:49:48,262
I can congratulate Wey

901
00:49:48,504 --> 00:49:49,822
and I'd gladly congratulate you,

902
00:49:50,104 --> 00:49:53,380
if you manage to do it well.

903
00:49:53,624 --> 00:49:54,898
Rabah, read us...

904
00:49:55,183 --> 00:49:56,334
…your self portrait
- No.

905
00:49:56,584 --> 00:49:58,892
How can I congratulate you
if you don’t?

906
00:49:59,143 --> 00:49:59,860
I don’t need that.

907
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:02,659
Make your mind up

908
00:50:02,944 --> 00:50:04,172
We’re listening.

909
00:50:05,024 --> 00:50:06,696
My name's Rabah. I’m 14.

910
00:50:06,944 --> 00:50:08,218
I listen to rap.

911
00:50:08,904 --> 00:50:12,340
I love my village in Kabylia
and go there every year.

912
00:50:12,583 --> 00:50:15,816
I like music, rap and slam.

913
00:50:16,065 --> 00:50:18,703
I have two brothers
but I don’t like school.

914
00:50:18,945 --> 00:50:20,582
I don’t like tramps.

915
00:50:20,824 --> 00:50:22,258
I like Zidane.

916
00:50:22,504 --> 00:50:25,224
I like to talk and I like
Psy 4 de la Rime's videos,

917
00:50:25,465 --> 00:50:26,614
...Go Marseille!

918
00:50:26,904 --> 00:50:29,020
We can manage without Marseille.

919
00:50:29,265 --> 00:50:30,094
Go Paris!

920
00:50:30,345 --> 00:50:32,859
We don’t need it in a self-portrait

921
00:50:33,145 --> 00:50:34,578
- That’s all.
- He skipped two lines.

922
00:50:35,104 --> 00:50:35,742
Cut it out.

923
00:50:38,745 --> 00:50:40,224
Go, dude.

924
00:50:40,506 --> 00:50:42,541
Boubacar!
- I like to make love

925
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:46,054
I like to look good for the women

926
00:50:47,425 --> 00:50:48,654
and I like summer,

927
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:50,424
...to see girls cleavage.

928
00:50:52,665 --> 00:50:54,656
Why not, Rabah?

929
00:50:54,946 --> 00:50:56,424
I never wrote that.

930
00:50:56,705 --> 00:50:58,377
It looks like your writing.

931
00:50:58,665 --> 00:50:59,415
No way!

932
00:51:02,186 --> 00:51:04,142
There’s no shame in liking cleavage.

933
00:51:04,425 --> 00:51:07,736
It's not a sin.

934
00:51:08,626 --> 00:51:11,981
Souleymane stop rocking
and read your self-portrait.

935
00:51:12,266 --> 00:51:14,301
- I’m very curious
- Huh?

936
00:51:14,586 --> 00:51:15,985
No, not huh.

937
00:51:16,746 --> 00:51:17,657
I wrote nothing.

938
00:51:17,906 --> 00:51:20,261
- I saw your writing earlier
- No, I wrote nothing

939
00:51:20,706 --> 00:51:21,661
You did

940
00:51:21,906 --> 00:51:23,784
- Nothing
- We're listening.

941
00:51:26,266 --> 00:51:28,541
I'm Souleymane.
I have nothing to say about me

942
00:51:28,787 --> 00:51:30,743
because no one knows me but me

943
00:51:33,187 --> 00:51:35,336
- Bravo!
- All right

944
00:51:35,626 --> 00:51:37,504
That’s good. A bit long maybe

945
00:51:41,786 --> 00:51:44,506
You can’t make the effort
that the others did?

946
00:51:45,707 --> 00:51:47,346
I don’t talk about myself.

947
00:51:47,627 --> 00:51:49,777
How come the others do?

948
00:51:50,066 --> 00:51:53,855
That’s their problem
I don’t talk about my life

949
00:51:54,107 --> 00:51:57,062
He just can’t write, that's all!

950
00:51:57,067 --> 00:51:58,564
What's up, you cop?

951
00:51:58,599 --> 00:52:00,060
You talking to me, cop?

952
00:52:00,307 --> 00:52:02,457
I can live with it

953
00:52:02,748 --> 00:52:04,704
- Enough!
- Arrest guys...

954
00:52:04,987 --> 00:52:07,138
...instead of talking to me.
Got your cuffs?

955
00:52:07,427 --> 00:52:09,100
Your breath stinks!

956
00:52:10,467 --> 00:52:12,344
- Chill.
- Heard of Aquafresh?

957
00:52:12,627 --> 00:52:13,742
Souleymane…

958
00:52:14,028 --> 00:52:15,746
there's no need
to be offensive.

959
00:52:16,028 --> 00:52:17,620
Need a toothbrush?

960
00:52:17,867 --> 00:52:18,743
Souleymane,

961
00:52:19,028 --> 00:52:23,418
...You’re a lot better
at oral insults than writing

962
00:52:24,189 --> 00:52:26,338
He can’t even write his name.

963
00:52:26,708 --> 00:52:28,858
Zip it! What does this say?

964
00:52:29,148 --> 00:52:30,502
Spare us your Koran.

965
00:52:30,788 --> 00:52:34,463
Shut it. What’s wrong
with the Koran.

966
00:52:34,708 --> 00:52:35,663
I’ll spare you when you calm dawn

967
00:52:35,908 --> 00:52:36,465
It’s the Koran.

968
00:52:36,749 --> 00:52:37,464
Bullshit!

969
00:52:37,749 --> 00:52:41,058
What’s that tattoo, Souleymane?

970
00:52:41,348 --> 00:52:42,622
Why are you showing it?

971
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:44,979
He claims it's Koran

972
00:52:46,469 --> 00:52:48,777
What is it? Why are you showing us?

973
00:52:49,029 --> 00:52:52,021
It means shut your mouth.

974
00:52:52,309 --> 00:52:53,822
It doesn’t mean that

975
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:56,747
So give us the real translation
Go on, tell us

976
00:52:57,349 --> 00:52:58,577
I don’t want to

977
00:52:58,869 --> 00:53:02,020
You show it in my class so tell us.

978
00:53:04,029 --> 00:53:06,260
It says here, right here:

979
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:10,468
"If your words are less important
than silence, keep quiet. "

980
00:53:10,749 --> 00:53:12,819
What I said

981
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:17,787
It’s not what you said.

982
00:53:18,029 --> 00:53:19,702
Why isn’t it the same?

983
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:21,941
It’s different.
I think it sounds better

984
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:24,226
Yes it’s better put.

985
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:28,826
If only you could write such
interesting things on paper,

986
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:30,384
that would be great

987
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:31,824
I think so too.

988
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:33,787
That proves you can do it.

989
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:38,466
After these fires few
self-portraits, Id like you,

990
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:41,178
to rewrite them and polish them...

991
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:45,218
...making sure you answer
the questions that we listed:

992
00:53:45,471 --> 00:53:47,425
what I like and don’t like...

993
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:50,385
my qualities and flaws
who I’d like to be?

994
00:53:51,711 --> 00:53:52,939
Come in.

995
00:53:55,791 --> 00:53:58,225
Stand up please. Good morning.

996
00:53:58,711 --> 00:54:00,667
That goes for those at the back too

997
00:54:00,951 --> 00:54:03,988
Come on, stand up.

998
00:54:05,111 --> 00:54:07,910
Cherif, you heard me?
Everyone has to stand.

999
00:54:08,152 --> 00:54:11,621
It’s a way of greeting an adult

1000
00:54:11,911 --> 00:54:14,425
It doesn’t mean
submission or humiliation.

1001
00:54:14,671 --> 00:54:16,151
Good. Sit back down

1002
00:54:18,031 --> 00:54:21,388
I’ve come to introduce
a new student.

1003
00:54:21,672 --> 00:54:22,548
Carl.

1004
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:25,669
Try to make him welcome...

1005
00:54:25,911 --> 00:54:28,345
...until the end of the year.

1006
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:31,464
Thank you

1007
00:54:32,752 --> 00:54:35,391
Carl, go sit in the third row,
in that free place

1008
00:54:35,672 --> 00:54:38,789
Khoumba, move your things

1009
00:54:42,472 --> 00:54:44,747
Take a sheet of paper and a pen

1010
00:54:44,993 --> 00:54:47,506
and try to catch up with the others

1011
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:48,901
...We’ll talk after

1012
00:54:52,393 --> 00:54:55,782
Don’t forget the homework
for Monday without fail.

1013
00:54:56,472 --> 00:54:58,543
Let’s finish with this

1014
00:54:59,953 --> 00:55:02,905
Carl, stay here a minute or two

1015
00:55:11,833 --> 00:55:12,868
Welcome

1016
00:55:13,273 --> 00:55:15,503
I don’t know if you know

1017
00:55:15,793 --> 00:55:18,990
but I'm Mr. Marin,
your class supervisor.

1018
00:55:19,553 --> 00:55:22,148
If there’s a problem, tell me.

1019
00:55:23,712 --> 00:55:26,750
I know who you are...
why you’re here

1020
00:55:27,034 --> 00:55:28,149
The principal told me

1021
00:55:28,394 --> 00:55:30,623
but that doesn’t matter for me

1022
00:55:30,873 --> 00:55:33,467
We'll start from scratch here

1023
00:55:33,713 --> 00:55:36,022
It will all go well.

1024
00:55:36,794 --> 00:55:39,388
You’ve seen that we...

1025
00:55:39,633 --> 00:55:41,989
Were on self-portraits to be
handed in next Monday.

1026
00:55:42,233 --> 00:55:45,146
- Maybe you could do one too
- OK.

1027
00:55:45,393 --> 00:55:46,952
Know when the next class is?

1028
00:55:49,674 --> 00:55:51,153
Monday, 9.30

1029
00:55:51,434 --> 00:55:52,833
Good.

1030
00:55:54,674 --> 00:55:56,665
You like French?

1031
00:55:58,115 --> 00:55:59,706
Like everyone, I guess.

1032
00:56:03,314 --> 00:56:05,271
That doesn’t mean much.

1033
00:56:05,554 --> 00:56:07,068
Ok, off you go.

1034
00:56:08,394 --> 00:56:09,952
Good bye

1035
00:56:10,874 --> 00:56:12,672
You know what a self-portrait is?

1036
00:56:12,915 --> 00:56:14,268
- Yes.
- You’re sure?

1037
00:56:14,515 --> 00:56:15,788
Yes.

1038
00:56:16,515 --> 00:56:17,834
Have a good day.

1039
00:56:29,075 --> 00:56:32,303
Pleased to meet you

1040
00:56:32,595 --> 00:56:34,028
Sit down, please.

1041
00:56:35,515 --> 00:56:37,824
Thank you for coming

1042
00:56:38,075 --> 00:56:39,554
I know it isn’t easy

1043
00:56:40,956 --> 00:56:43,345
We're very pleased with Wey

1044
00:56:43,636 --> 00:56:47,787
Very pleased. All the teachers
at the staff meeting said so.

1045
00:56:48,076 --> 00:56:50,351
He's kind, he's pleasant...

1046
00:56:50,636 --> 00:56:52,830
It's good to have him in class.

1047
00:56:53,316 --> 00:56:54,953
And it’s showing in his grades.

1048
00:56:55,716 --> 00:56:57,547
we have...

1049
00:56:57,836 --> 00:57:01,033
the usual good grades in mathematics.
He's doing well there

1050
00:57:01,395 --> 00:57:02,954
13/20.

1051
00:57:03,716 --> 00:57:05,468
In French,
we have a 9 here

1052
00:57:05,717 --> 00:57:07,672
Not a lot

1053
00:57:08,876 --> 00:57:12,870
He doesn’t speak French very well
yet but that’s only normal

1054
00:57:13,157 --> 00:57:15,511
He speaks a lot.
He tells me about a lot of things.

1055
00:57:16,796 --> 00:57:18,947
He talks about his computer

1056
00:57:19,197 --> 00:57:19,947
He’s into that

1057
00:57:20,197 --> 00:57:21,754
Always too late

1058
00:57:21,997 --> 00:57:23,429
He works too late?

1059
00:57:23,716 --> 00:57:25,355
Yes, too late, not sleep good.

1060
00:57:25,597 --> 00:57:27,588
After, school not good.

1061
00:57:28,956 --> 00:57:31,150
...Eyes get sick after

1062
00:57:33,236 --> 00:57:35,876
He may spend a lot of time
on the computer

1063
00:57:36,117 --> 00:57:37,835
but things are fine at school
for now

1064
00:57:38,557 --> 00:57:41,833
He works well
and he doesn’t seem tired

1065
00:57:44,597 --> 00:57:48,146
Nassim... I’d like him to do...

1066
00:57:48,878 --> 00:57:50,834
He can go far. He has all he needs

1067
00:57:53,317 --> 00:57:55,751
At his age, I wasn’t that lucky

1068
00:57:56,757 --> 00:57:57,713
I’m behind him

1069
00:57:58,438 --> 00:58:00,712
Anything he needs, I get him

1070
00:58:01,198 --> 00:58:02,835
But he has to do right

1071
00:58:03,638 --> 00:58:06,105
Things are good at home with him

1072
00:58:06,398 --> 00:58:08,958
but I’d like him
to keep on studying

1073
00:58:09,238 --> 00:58:11,309
Me and his mother,

1074
00:58:11,598 --> 00:58:13,111
we’d like to be proud of him

1075
00:58:13,358 --> 00:58:14,791
That’s what we ask of him

1076
00:58:15,317 --> 00:58:18,550
I think we all agree
on what we need to do.

1077
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:22,716
It’s crazy how alike you are

1078
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:24,756
We're lookers in family

1079
00:58:24,999 --> 00:58:26,636
You’re right.

1080
00:58:27,159 --> 00:58:31,152
An adolescent who talks
with his family,

1081
00:58:31,398 --> 00:58:34,391
...who has good grades,

1082
00:58:34,639 --> 00:58:36,310
...who has friends,

1083
00:58:36,558 --> 00:58:39,312
even if he’s a bit of a loner,

1084
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,715
...he’s an outcast?

1085
00:58:41,999 --> 00:58:45,435
He’s a boy who talks with adults,
who exchanges with them

1086
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:46,873
Maybe he doesn’t with you

1087
00:58:47,159 --> 00:58:49,628
but that means

1088
00:58:50,199 --> 00:58:53,987
...he’s just a teenager
trying to define himself.

1089
00:58:54,919 --> 00:58:57,752
I was useless at school for years,

1090
00:58:57,999 --> 00:59:01,709
...I rejected the idea
of marking us fit in with the system.

1091
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:03,632
Do his black clothes bother you?

1092
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:06,189
The way he looks?

1093
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:08,633
I don’t get it.

1094
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:13,191
I’d like him to go to the best,

1095
00:59:14,679 --> 00:59:16,113
to Henri IV.

1096
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,113
Why?

1097
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:20,670
Standards again...

1098
00:59:20,919 --> 00:59:23,434
Because they have
very high standards.

1099
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:27,159
A mother wants the best for her son

1100
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,318
She’s scared I’ll feel lost
in high school because of others

1101
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:34,348
...went to fancy private schools.

1102
00:59:34,601 --> 00:59:36,875
and Dolto Hogh isn’t like that

1103
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:41,354
It’s a pity that the teachers...

1104
00:59:42,001 --> 00:59:43,957
I don't want to accuse anyone

1105
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,956
Go on, accuse us. It’s a pleasure

1106
00:59:48,681 --> 00:59:50,511
Why don’t you try

1107
00:59:51,161 --> 00:59:53,721
...to push the better students

1108
00:59:53,961 --> 00:59:56,351
...a little harder, say?

1109
00:59:56,601 --> 00:59:59,991
They get bogged down
by other students...

1110
01:00:00,241 --> 01:00:02,392
...who aren’t as good

1111
01:00:02,681 --> 01:00:05,320
My mom makes stuff up.
Dolto High isn’t useless.

1112
01:00:07,281 --> 01:00:09,477
- I didn’t say useless,
I said average

1113
01:00:10,361 --> 01:00:12,158
I didn’t call it useless

1114
01:00:14,842 --> 01:00:18,357
- We talked about Souleymane
a great deal...

1115
01:00:19,042 --> 01:00:20,520
...at the staff meeting

1116
01:00:21,321 --> 01:00:23,517
Many teachers have complained
about his attitude

1117
01:00:23,762 --> 01:00:27,276
...that is very negative.

1118
01:00:27,561 --> 01:00:28,835
What?

1119
01:00:29,082 --> 01:00:30,834
Many complain...

1120
01:00:31,122 --> 01:00:34,670
...that he comes without his things,

1121
01:00:34,961 --> 01:00:36,998
...When he comes, as he’s often absent

1122
01:00:37,242 --> 01:00:40,315
- I think you know that
- No we didn’t know

1123
01:00:41,082 --> 01:00:43,437
Souleymane tells us he works hard

1124
01:01:00,963 --> 01:01:02,521
She doesn’t think so.

1125
01:01:03,283 --> 01:01:06,673
- There have been notes
in his report book...

1126
01:01:06,923 --> 01:01:08,322
...since September, 3 month now

1127
01:01:09,923 --> 01:01:13,120
Notes about the problems
he was having.

1128
01:01:13,363 --> 01:01:16,561
- She signs them without knowing
because she cant read.

1129
01:01:18,643 --> 01:01:20,122
You read the notes too?

1130
01:01:20,643 --> 01:01:23,203
Yes, but I'm just his brother. You see?

1131
01:01:23,724 --> 01:01:26,601
But you knew there was a problem?

1132
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:29,956
- No, I didn’t know.
He says things are fine when I ask

1133
01:01:30,804 --> 01:01:32,203
Does he work at home?

1134
01:01:32,804 --> 01:01:34,031
He stays in his room

1135
01:01:47,965 --> 01:01:50,159
She doesn’t understand the notes

1136
01:01:50,404 --> 01:01:51,519
I realize that

1137
01:01:52,004 --> 01:01:54,040
You know the situation now

1138
01:01:54,325 --> 01:01:57,280
I'm telling you officially:
there's a problem

1139
01:01:57,564 --> 01:02:00,716
- Talk to him.
- I'll talk to him about it

1140
01:02:05,004 --> 01:02:07,313
Just having an idea.

1141
01:02:07,925 --> 01:02:09,644
Maybe conversation with his father

1142
01:02:09,925 --> 01:02:12,155
could help.

1143
01:02:12,444 --> 01:02:16,404
I'll talk to my father
and see what we can do

1144
01:02:16,966 --> 01:02:19,115
We're not settling scores.

1145
01:02:19,644 --> 01:02:21,124
We want to improve things

1146
01:02:37,966 --> 01:02:39,115
- Your mom?
- You bet.

1147
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:45,201
- Ugly old crow!
- She hates photos

1148
01:02:47,206 --> 01:02:49,925
Me and my bro pissed her off

1149
01:02:50,206 --> 01:02:52,640
Sir! Souleymane has a photos

1150
01:02:52,926 --> 01:02:53,962
...for his self-portrait

1151
01:02:54,206 --> 01:02:55,958
Cut it out, my photos are crap.

1152
01:02:56,246 --> 01:02:57,884
- That’s a good idea.
- Get your down

1153
01:02:59,206 --> 01:03:01,402
Painters do self-portraits

1154
01:03:01,646 --> 01:03:04,114
- I'm no painter
- Yes, I know that.

1155
01:03:04,406 --> 01:03:05,634
Let's go

1156
01:03:05,886 --> 01:03:07,001
Caps, please

1157
01:03:18,386 --> 01:03:21,820
I spend all my free time
playing the guitar.

1158
01:03:22,067 --> 01:03:24,216
If you’re typing, hurry and finish
to let the others...

1159
01:03:24,506 --> 01:03:29,023
...type up their self-portraits

1160
01:03:31,745 --> 01:03:32,973
Souleymane,
Dont blow the place up!

1161
01:03:34,984 --> 01:03:37,136
- You know what you’re doing?
- Yeah

1162
01:03:37,385 --> 01:03:40,343
As a computer genius
you’ll put it all back after.

1163
01:03:40,585 --> 01:03:42,175
Don’t worry.

1164
01:03:42,423 --> 01:03:44,097
I’m counting on you.

1165
01:03:49,144 --> 01:03:51,864
- Ok, Carl?
- Yes, sir

1166
01:03:52,265 --> 01:03:54,494
- I can’t see it?
- No, not yet.

1167
01:03:54,743 --> 01:03:56,017
Sir?

1168
01:03:57,425 --> 01:03:59,494
How do you spell Lafayette?

1169
01:03:59,744 --> 01:04:02,780
- How do you mean?
- Like Galeries Lafayette.

1170
01:04:03,226 --> 01:04:04,544
Why mention that?

1171
01:04:04,825 --> 01:04:07,258
I go there often
so I want to add it

1172
01:04:07,904 --> 01:04:12,182
Wow! That’s four metro stops
A huge leap from your neighborhood

1173
01:04:12,624 --> 01:04:14,932
We're not Hicks

1174
01:04:15,183 --> 01:04:16,058
We're city kids

1175
01:04:16,542 --> 01:04:19,820
Really? You go into
the center of Paris?

1176
01:04:20,303 --> 01:04:22,658
I go everywhere. The 1st, the 5th,

1177
01:04:22,903 --> 01:04:24,496
the 20th, the 12th, the 19th

1178
01:04:25,105 --> 01:04:26,502
Why do you go to the 5th?

1179
01:04:26,744 --> 01:04:28,142
In the 5th, I go to see pals

1180
01:04:28,423 --> 01:04:30,858
...in high school

1181
01:04:31,104 --> 01:04:32,297
Near Luxembourg.

1182
01:04:32,742 --> 01:04:34,222
The Luxembourg gardens?

1183
01:04:34,503 --> 01:04:36,493
Not the gardens, Luxembourg.

1184
01:04:37,143 --> 01:04:38,372
The country?

1185
01:04:38,664 --> 01:04:42,780
No, the Luxembourg metro station!

1186
01:04:44,181 --> 01:04:45,093
So you do get out and about

1187
01:04:47,423 --> 01:04:49,174
I see you two have made up

1188
01:04:49,422 --> 01:04:52,460
- It's our business
- And not yours

1189
01:04:52,782 --> 01:04:54,374
So, how do you spell Lafayette?

1190
01:04:54,742 --> 01:04:59,294
Lafayette is L-A-F-A-Y-E-T-T-E.

1191
01:05:00,142 --> 01:05:01,700
With a capital

1192
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:05,371
Much better now!

1193
01:05:06,182 --> 01:05:07,694
Much better

1194
01:05:07,942 --> 01:05:10,171
Yes, that is a good photo

1195
01:05:10,421 --> 01:05:12,572
- You could add a legend.
- A legend?

1196
01:05:13,143 --> 01:05:14,620
Like a story or tale.

1197
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:18,618
A caption under the photo
like in papers.

1198
01:05:18,859 --> 01:05:21,170
You mean, like in Le Parisien?

1199
01:05:21,421 --> 01:05:23,218
Yes, like in Le Parisien

1200
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:25,575
What could you put? Who is she?

1201
01:05:25,819 --> 01:05:27,493
- My old woman.
- Meaning?

1202
01:05:27,741 --> 01:05:30,619
- My mother
- You could say she's your mother.

1203
01:05:30,861 --> 01:05:33,421
Then you could explain

1204
01:05:33,702 --> 01:05:36,009
...why she's making this gesture
to the photographer

1205
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:38,693
They'd pissed her off

1206
01:05:38,979 --> 01:05:40,016
I'm not gonna write that!

1207
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:43,252
- So why is she doing that?
- She hates photos

1208
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:46,014
So write that
"My mother hate having

1209
01:05:46,259 --> 01:05:47,330
..."her photo taken".

1210
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:51,493
That's a legend.

1211
01:05:52,178 --> 01:05:53,327
- Understand?
- Yeah

1212
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:57,335
Do that with all the photos
and you're set

1213
01:06:19,858 --> 01:06:22,327
- Printed everything?
- Yeah, I’m good

1214
01:06:25,737 --> 01:06:27,375
Excellent

1215
01:06:29,818 --> 01:06:31,410
What are you doing now, sir?

1216
01:06:31,658 --> 01:06:35,492
As you can see,
I’m putting the photos up

1217
01:06:35,738 --> 01:06:37,011
...to get a global view

1218
01:06:39,658 --> 01:06:42,332
The others read out,
their self-portraits

1219
01:06:43,258 --> 01:06:45,293
...so you’re going to put yours...

1220
01:06:45,817 --> 01:06:46,931
...on show.

1221
01:06:47,176 --> 01:06:48,850
You know my photos suck

1222
01:06:49,097 --> 01:06:51,566
Not at all, they’re very good

1223
01:06:51,857 --> 01:06:52,812
Sure

1224
01:06:53,057 --> 01:06:55,365
When a student does good work,

1225
01:06:55,659 --> 01:06:57,693
...I let the whole class see it

1226
01:06:57,937 --> 01:06:59,734
You’re just winding me up

1227
01:06:59,977 --> 01:07:02,205
No, I wind you up if I feel

1228
01:07:02,498 --> 01:07:04,374
...you can do better. This is good.

1229
01:07:06,416 --> 01:07:07,734
That's bullshit

1230
01:07:07,975 --> 01:07:11,491
If you've finished,
come and take a look

1231
01:07:11,856 --> 01:07:13,927
...at Souleymane's masterpiece

1232
01:07:14,337 --> 01:07:15,610
Slowly

1233
01:07:19,416 --> 01:07:20,769
I'll straighten them

1234
01:07:21,135 --> 01:07:24,208
Look at the tattoo!
You're hideous!

1235
01:07:56,653 --> 01:07:58,770
I like playing soccer

1236
01:07:59,014 --> 01:08:01,130
I like playing computer games

1237
01:08:01,374 --> 01:08:03,569
I like playing with pretty girls

1238
01:08:03,814 --> 01:08:06,203
I like vacations in the Carribean

1239
01:08:06,454 --> 01:08:09,650
I like fries, zouk and dancehall music

1240
01:08:10,212 --> 01:08:13,206
I like watching MTV Base

1241
01:08:13,453 --> 01:08:15,648
and I like my parents and my brother.

1242
01:08:15,894 --> 01:08:18,966
I like my pals and staying up all night

1243
01:08:19,254 --> 01:08:21,893
I like the series on the slave trade

1244
01:08:22,133 --> 01:08:26,605
I like my hood
I like the series Homeland Security

1245
01:08:27,293 --> 01:08:30,886
I like eating in restaurants
and going wild.

1246
01:08:32,214 --> 01:08:34,329
I hate people crying for no reason

1247
01:08:34,573 --> 01:08:36,927
I hate techno and tectonic

1248
01:08:37,172 --> 01:08:39,768
I hate guys and girls who show off

1249
01:08:40,094 --> 01:08:42,731
I hate visiting my brother in jail

1250
01:08:43,212 --> 01:08:45,853
I hate talent contest shows on TV

1251
01:08:46,094 --> 01:08:50,370
I hate politicians,
the war in Iraq,

1252
01:08:50,611 --> 01:08:52,648
Goths and skaters

1253
01:08:52,893 --> 01:08:55,644
I hate teachers who are too strict

1254
01:08:55,892 --> 01:08:58,359
I hate mathematics, racists

1255
01:08:58,611 --> 01:09:00,365
and I hate Materazzi

1256
01:09:00,613 --> 01:09:04,922
I hates the Paul Eluard school
and I like being here

1257
01:09:10,371 --> 01:09:13,249
I have something to say

1258
01:09:14,333 --> 01:09:16,322
Could you listen to me, please?

1259
01:09:16,811 --> 01:09:20,165
I have something to say
The mother of Wey

1260
01:09:20,413 --> 01:09:23,050
...a student in 4/3
has been arrested

1261
01:09:23,290 --> 01:09:25,405
She was in France illegally.

1262
01:09:25,650 --> 01:09:27,209
She has been picked up

1263
01:09:27,490 --> 01:09:30,084
and may be tried next week

1264
01:09:30,370 --> 01:09:33,328
She may be deported to China.
I thought you should know

1265
01:09:33,609 --> 01:09:34,646
as its important

1266
01:09:34,892 --> 01:09:37,279
She's been here 3 years now!

1267
01:09:39,329 --> 01:09:42,765
I know but that's how it goes,

1268
01:09:43,049 --> 01:09:44,449
wrong place, wrong time

1269
01:09:44,690 --> 01:09:46,203
Not the father?

1270
01:09:46,449 --> 01:09:47,598
He doesn’t have papers either

1271
01:09:47,891 --> 01:09:50,245
but they don’t bother him

1272
01:09:51,769 --> 01:09:53,963
To start with

1273
01:09:54,207 --> 01:09:56,678
as lawyers cost a lot

1274
01:09:56,929 --> 01:09:59,727
we could do a collection

1275
01:10:00,008 --> 01:10:02,683
and maybe even go to court

1276
01:10:02,969 --> 01:10:06,279
to try have some influence
on the verdict

1277
01:10:06,650 --> 01:10:08,161
Will Wey have to leave?

1278
01:10:09,170 --> 01:10:12,161
Not for now but you never know.

1279
01:10:16,648 --> 01:10:17,763
Well,

1280
01:10:18,169 --> 01:10:20,045
I feel kind of pathetic after that

1281
01:10:21,488 --> 01:10:23,844
I had something to tell you,

1282
01:10:24,089 --> 01:10:25,885
...but this isn’t a good time

1283
01:10:26,168 --> 01:10:28,203
You’ve said too much now

1284
01:10:31,928 --> 01:10:33,441
I'm pregnant

1285
01:10:36,648 --> 01:10:38,718
That calls for a celebration!

1286
01:10:42,607 --> 01:10:44,166
How far gone?

1287
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:48,155
Two months. I'll only have a drop

1288
01:10:52,727 --> 01:10:54,399
Just a drop

1289
01:10:54,646 --> 01:10:56,718
Bravo, Vincent!
I didn’t do it on purpose!

1290
01:10:57,448 --> 01:11:00,086
Who shook it?

1291
01:11:00,606 --> 01:11:01,675
Any names yet? If it’s a boy, say?

1292
01:11:01,925 --> 01:11:03,964
...You already know?

1293
01:11:04,208 --> 01:11:06,595
If it’s a boy, I like Enguerran.

1294
01:11:07,886 --> 01:11:09,158
Seriously?

1295
01:11:09,445 --> 01:11:12,484
What a handicap!
That won't be easy

1296
01:11:12,726 --> 01:11:15,798
I hope not. Thanks a lot!

1297
01:11:19,046 --> 01:11:20,684
You all have a glass?

1298
01:11:20,926 --> 01:11:23,119
Hold on a second

1299
01:11:25,366 --> 01:11:27,595
I have two wishes

1300
01:11:28,405 --> 01:11:30,396
I have two wishes

1301
01:11:30,645 --> 01:11:32,840
My first wish

1302
01:11:33,086 --> 01:11:36,315
is that Wey's mom stays in France

1303
01:11:38,167 --> 01:11:40,838
And my second wish

1304
01:11:41,085 --> 01:11:43,756
...is that my child will be
as intelligent as Wey

1305
01:11:56,963 --> 01:11:58,157
"Jackie Chan"!

1306
01:11:59,404 --> 01:12:00,438
C'mon, play

1307
01:12:08,164 --> 01:12:10,393
I didn’t do nothing

1308
01:12:11,682 --> 01:12:13,516
He just fell!

1309
01:12:31,042 --> 01:12:32,872
Play, Souleymane

1310
01:12:36,603 --> 01:12:40,313
- What do you say, Mali man?
- What’s up, you Caribbean shit?

1311
01:12:40,563 --> 01:12:43,474
Malian bastard!

1312
01:12:43,723 --> 01:12:44,632
Motherfucker

1313
01:12:45,162 --> 01:12:46,435
C’mon lets play!

1314
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:49,282
- Caribbean fag!
- I’ll waste the fucker

1315
01:12:49,522 --> 01:12:50,159
Shut up

1316
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:55,195
Blow Thierry Henri, faggot

1317
01:12:59,282 --> 01:13:01,274
Stand there. Talk loud enough

1318
01:13:01,563 --> 01:13:04,200
for them to hear
and try to convince them.

1319
01:13:04,442 --> 01:13:05,794
Go ahead

1320
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:09,590
The African Cup of Nations
will be starting soon

1321
01:13:10,961 --> 01:13:13,111
I'm glad Morocco's playing

1322
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:15,558
It's the best team in the world
in my opinion.

1323
01:13:15,802 --> 01:13:16,711
The sick thing is

1324
01:13:16,961 --> 01:13:19,679
that my pals,
the Malians aren't playing.

1325
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:21,272
It's tough for them.

1326
01:13:21,882 --> 01:13:24,918
They weren't good enough to qualify.

1327
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:29,678
Morocco would have let them play
on a friendly basis...

1328
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:32,879
but 4-0 is really hurts

1329
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:36,796
- 4-0 how?
- Last time

1330
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:40,190
...Mali played Morocco,
they wasted 4-0

1331
01:13:41,519 --> 01:13:43,112
But the weird thing is

1332
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:46,872
...when Mali doesn't play

1333
01:13:47,119 --> 01:13:49,760
...it's like all the Africans here,

1334
01:13:50,001 --> 01:13:51,558
...aren't African

1335
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,107
With each cup, they all go crazy

1336
01:13:54,598 --> 01:13:58,672
but when Mali doesn’t play,
they keep a low profile.

1337
01:13:58,919 --> 01:14:00,398
Weird.

1338
01:14:00,959 --> 01:14:03,598
So, whether Mali plays in the
African Cup of Nations or not,

1339
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:06,750
...the Africans in this class
feel more or less African. Ok.

1340
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:11,597
Thank you, Nassim.

1341
01:14:12,758 --> 01:14:15,430
I get the feeling
your words are directed

1342
01:14:15,717 --> 01:14:17,198
...at your neighbor, Souleymane

1343
01:14:17,439 --> 01:14:18,587
Morocco jerk's

1344
01:14:18,838 --> 01:14:20,032
...not even on my radar,

1345
01:14:21,878 --> 01:14:23,757
Arthur is next

1346
01:14:27,518 --> 01:14:30,511
I see you have your notes
just like a politician

1347
01:14:30,759 --> 01:14:32,350
- Exactly
- That's good

1348
01:14:32,638 --> 01:14:35,594
Speak up Arthur.
Esmeralda, let him speak first

1349
01:14:35,837 --> 01:14:37,271
I want to defend my look

1350
01:14:37,558 --> 01:14:41,388
...A lot of people say it sucks

1351
01:14:42,677 --> 01:14:46,875
I don’t dish your clothes,
so you don’t dish mine.

1352
01:14:48,796 --> 01:14:50,592
Clothes are freedom of speech

1353
01:14:51,517 --> 01:14:55,111
I dress how I want
you dress how you want, ok

1354
01:14:55,517 --> 01:14:57,746
I dress like this to be different

1355
01:14:57,998 --> 01:15:00,750
...and not follow the others
like sheep.

1356
01:15:01,036 --> 01:15:03,425
You're the sheep here!

1357
01:15:03,795 --> 01:15:07,186
I feel better being myself

1358
01:15:07,436 --> 01:15:08,869
and not being like others

1359
01:15:11,434 --> 01:15:14,712
I also think
if there were 22 goths here,

1360
01:15:14,996 --> 01:15:17,348
...and one guy like you
you'd keep quiet then

1361
01:15:19,357 --> 01:15:22,109
There's a contradiction
in what you say

1362
01:15:22,395 --> 01:15:24,862
You want to be you.
Are those clothes you?

1363
01:15:25,114 --> 01:15:28,903
Those clothes are worn
by a huge number of people

1364
01:15:29,196 --> 01:15:32,153
Most people who wear them
are gloomy inside

1365
01:15:32,397 --> 01:15:34,750
...so we're all kind of alike

1366
01:15:35,155 --> 01:15:39,146
- You're all alike, you're all gloomy,
so that’s not you.

1367
01:15:39,437 --> 01:15:41,470
By being different

1368
01:15:41,955 --> 01:15:43,786
You're different and the same.

1369
01:15:44,554 --> 01:15:46,432
Thank you for taking a stand

1370
01:15:46,715 --> 01:15:49,274
...and being brave enough to do so

1371
01:15:49,915 --> 01:15:51,347
Boubacar, go on

1372
01:15:51,634 --> 01:15:53,671
Boubacar, my pal

1373
01:15:54,395 --> 01:15:55,874
Listen to him

1374
01:15:58,592 --> 01:15:59,948
I’ve come up to reply to Nassim

1375
01:16:01,434 --> 01:16:03,504
He says that since Mali

1376
01:16:03,793 --> 01:16:08,266
isn’t in the Africa Cup of Nations
black Africans have no team to support

1377
01:16:08,794 --> 01:16:10,863
But he's forgetting Ivory Coast!

1378
01:16:11,113 --> 01:16:13,387
With an ace player Didier Drogba

1379
01:16:14,194 --> 01:16:17,626
He beats any Moroccan

1380
01:16:18,313 --> 01:16:21,146
He plays for Chelsea
What Moroccan plays in England?

1381
01:16:21,393 --> 01:16:22,382
They're not up to it

1382
01:16:23,113 --> 01:16:25,422
I'm through.

1383
01:16:25,674 --> 01:16:26,468
Thanks, Boubacar

1384
01:16:27,312 --> 01:16:29,621
I think that rectification
was indeed...

1385
01:16:30,713 --> 01:16:32,270
...indispensable

1386
01:16:34,353 --> 01:16:36,070
Who wants to speak now?

1387
01:16:36,591 --> 01:16:37,946
Carl, go on

1388
01:16:44,632 --> 01:16:46,224
Actually, I'd like to say

1389
01:16:46,511 --> 01:16:48,470
they're starting to piss us off...

1390
01:16:48,713 --> 01:16:50,942
...with the Africa Cup

1391
01:16:51,191 --> 01:16:54,182
At recess you're there
pissing us off with your cup

1392
01:16:54,431 --> 01:16:56,502
It hasn't even started yet...

1393
01:16:56,752 --> 01:16:59,140
Carl, I'll be polite with you

1394
01:16:59,432 --> 01:17:03,028
Sorry to interrupt, but tell me,
what's your national team?

1395
01:17:03,312 --> 01:17:04,107
France

1396
01:17:05,712 --> 01:17:07,985
Why do you say you're Caribbean...

1397
01:17:08,270 --> 01:17:09,590
...rather than French?

1398
01:17:09,832 --> 01:17:12,584
We're French. It's a French region

1399
01:17:13,911 --> 01:17:15,904
Why don't you ever say
you're French?

1400
01:17:16,152 --> 01:17:17,982
- It's the same
- I don't think so

1401
01:17:18,231 --> 01:17:20,983
Look at the players.
Thierry Henri, Wiltord…

1402
01:17:21,230 --> 01:17:22,904
...Abidal, Thuram...

1403
01:17:23,312 --> 01:17:25,142
Where does Diarra play?

1404
01:17:25,431 --> 01:17:28,466
He won't play in Mali, bro,
he's not crazy enough.

1405
01:17:28,749 --> 01:17:31,901
Shut your mouth, pal,
I'm not your bro!

1406
01:17:32,190 --> 01:17:34,102
An ape like this jerk

1407
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:37,628
No need to loose your cool.

1408
01:17:40,229 --> 01:17:42,139
We can talk calmly!

1409
01:17:44,150 --> 01:17:47,186
That isn’t a slanging match.
It’s a debate.

1410
01:17:47,429 --> 01:17:49,989
Souleymane,
watch your language

1411
01:17:50,271 --> 01:17:51,260
He's fuming!

1412
01:17:51,550 --> 01:17:53,779
Clam up. Go get fucked!

1413
01:17:54,069 --> 01:17:55,819
No vulgarity

1414
01:17:56,188 --> 01:17:58,420
- I ain’t talking to you, man
- I’m talking to you

1415
01:17:58,990 --> 01:18:00,944
Is that any way
to talk to a teacher?

1416
01:18:03,787 --> 01:18:07,388
That's enough now
You're coming with me

1417
01:18:07,629 --> 01:18:10,586
- I'm talking to you
- Don't start yelling at me, ok

1418
01:18:13,228 --> 01:18:14,866
I'll get you, faggot

1419
01:18:15,108 --> 01:18:16,938
You just can’t talk normally?

1420
01:18:17,467 --> 01:18:18,981
Shut up, ape

1421
01:18:19,228 --> 01:18:20,456
Nobody else moves

1422
01:18:36,946 --> 01:18:38,461
Hurry it up

1423
01:18:41,747 --> 01:18:43,976
- Move it
- Hands off!

1424
01:18:57,906 --> 01:19:00,375
Aren’t you sick
of assing around?

1425
01:19:10,146 --> 01:19:11,260
Sorry to bother you

1426
01:19:11,544 --> 01:19:15,744
I have a troublemaker who's
been disrespectful in class.

1427
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:22,418
I didn’t ask you to sit down,
Souleymane.

1428
01:19:27,546 --> 01:19:30,059
My class is waiting

1429
01:19:39,624 --> 01:19:41,025
Sit down now.

1430
01:19:47,425 --> 01:19:49,063
I'm listening

1431
01:19:53,464 --> 01:19:55,660
Will you tell me what happened?

1432
01:19:56,584 --> 01:20:00,655
A teacher should have to leave
his class to bring you here?

1433
01:20:08,625 --> 01:20:10,341
"Results

1434
01:20:10,904 --> 01:20:12,542
..."too uneven

1435
01:20:13,382 --> 01:20:15,261
"Too much talking in class

1436
01:20:20,661 --> 01:20:22,939
Now let's move on to Louise,

1437
01:20:23,263 --> 01:20:24,741
present here today

1438
01:20:26,263 --> 01:20:28,140
A total disaster.
What can we do with you?

1439
01:20:28,945 --> 01:20:29,854
No, good work

1440
01:20:30,104 --> 01:20:31,694
Always good, I'd say

1441
01:20:31,942 --> 01:20:35,931
It's a joy having a student
like her. We need to say it.

1442
01:20:37,143 --> 01:20:40,737
Shall we offer this young lady
a commendation?

1443
01:20:41,302 --> 01:20:42,257
I'm sorry, but I don't

1444
01:20:42,544 --> 01:20:44,340
...totally agree with you.

1445
01:20:44,662 --> 01:20:47,573
She's relatively well-placed
in the class

1446
01:20:47,821 --> 01:20:49,733
from a numerical angle

1447
01:20:50,663 --> 01:20:52,937
But a commendation?
There's room for progress,

1448
01:20:53,221 --> 01:20:55,780
huge room for progress

1449
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:58,621
and I don’t think
her general attitude

1450
01:20:58,902 --> 01:21:01,018
...really merits a commendation

1451
01:21:01,262 --> 01:21:02,137
That's the problem

1452
01:21:02,421 --> 01:21:04,175
with commendations

1453
01:21:04,422 --> 01:21:07,936
...Are they purely numerical
and mathematical

1454
01:21:08,221 --> 01:21:09,414
or are they also to do

1455
01:21:09,659 --> 01:21:12,778
...with her attitude and behavior
as top of the class?

1456
01:21:13,541 --> 01:21:16,100
That means, to get commendation,

1457
01:21:16,381 --> 01:21:19,178
...you have to be an excellent student

1458
01:21:19,461 --> 01:21:22,178
...and, at the same time,
be a class leader?

1459
01:21:26,661 --> 01:21:28,890
So a commendation this term

1460
01:21:29,179 --> 01:21:32,536
Louise is intelligent

1461
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:34,458
...and will realize she can do better
to satisfy you

1462
01:21:40,539 --> 01:21:42,848
Now, Cherif

1463
01:21:43,418 --> 01:21:44,852
...Our friend Cherif

1464
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:47,659
I have a problem with Cherif

1465
01:21:47,939 --> 01:21:49,816
...He's a kid with abilities
he could do well

1466
01:21:50,059 --> 01:21:52,416
could easily give him 17/20

1467
01:21:52,660 --> 01:21:54,729
...but he spends so much time talking

1468
01:21:54,979 --> 01:21:57,855
...and disturbing the class,

1469
01:21:58,137 --> 01:22:00,255
...his average grade is poor
And that's a pity

1470
01:22:00,499 --> 01:22:02,649
His behavior's irregular.
He can be a disaster

1471
01:22:02,938 --> 01:22:06,648
and you cant do a thing with him

1472
01:22:07,099 --> 01:22:09,054
or he can be really good

1473
01:22:09,619 --> 01:22:12,692
- What does Cherif get?
A warning about his work

1474
01:22:12,980 --> 01:22:14,172
or his behavior?

1475
01:22:14,458 --> 01:22:15,573
For me, behavior,

1476
01:22:15,858 --> 01:22:16,449
...not work

1477
01:22:16,698 --> 01:22:19,213
- In my class, it's more his work
- That’s a problem.

1478
01:22:20,099 --> 01:22:22,612
It's more like a work problem
looking at his grades.

1479
01:22:22,857 --> 01:22:24,529
Mathematics: 6

1480
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:27,128
French: 8

1481
01:22:29,498 --> 01:22:31,487
History and geography: 9

1482
01:22:32,096 --> 01:22:34,514
English: 9,5

1483
01:22:35,218 --> 01:22:36,172
Excuse me!

1484
01:22:39,578 --> 01:22:42,011
Science 12. Music 11

1485
01:22:42,257 --> 01:22:44,817
His grades are pretty low but…

1486
01:22:45,097 --> 01:22:48,169
...it seems to be a behavior problem

1487
01:22:48,417 --> 01:22:51,214
Why don't we put that for now
and say he can work harder?

1488
01:22:51,456 --> 01:22:53,207
So I'll put Cherif

1489
01:22:53,857 --> 01:22:56,894
..." can succeed as long as

1490
01:22:57,177 --> 01:22:59,690
..." his attitude changes

1491
01:22:59,976 --> 01:23:01,377
..." in relation to his work. "

1492
01:23:05,775 --> 01:23:07,768
Let's move on to Souleymane

1493
01:23:08,178 --> 01:23:11,293
Someone else can start.

1494
01:23:12,455 --> 01:23:13,490
What do we say?

1495
01:23:13,734 --> 01:23:15,010
Nothing good.

1496
01:23:15,296 --> 01:23:18,845
- What else?
- We already discussed him

1497
01:23:19,335 --> 01:23:23,089
in the first term. We said it all
He has huge weakness,

1498
01:23:23,375 --> 01:23:25,013
notably in written French

1499
01:23:25,255 --> 01:23:29,566
I don’t think there’s anything
particularly new

1500
01:23:30,535 --> 01:23:31,729
this term

1501
01:23:31,975 --> 01:23:32,690
Feeling better, Esmeralda?

1502
01:23:34,254 --> 01:23:37,292
I didn’t know being class rep
was such fun

1503
01:23:38,135 --> 01:23:40,170
We were talking about Souleymane

1504
01:23:40,413 --> 01:23:41,209
In relation

1505
01:23:41,493 --> 01:23:43,690
to what Francois just said,

1506
01:23:43,934 --> 01:23:48,050
he forgot his things
most of the time this term

1507
01:23:48,815 --> 01:23:50,328
...and didn’t do much

1508
01:23:51,134 --> 01:23:52,726
It’s not just that,
It’s way beyond that

1509
01:23:53,455 --> 01:23:54,603
Sir!

1510
01:23:54,894 --> 01:23:59,570
He’s more and more unruly
He prevents the others from working.

1511
01:24:00,093 --> 01:24:01,081
Can I say something?

1512
01:24:01,372 --> 01:24:02,807
If you put the biscuit away.

1513
01:24:03,094 --> 01:24:07,245
Remember, you aren’t allowed
to eat in classroom

1514
01:24:08,013 --> 01:24:12,689
Well, his overall grade
has gone from 6,75 to 7,25.

1515
01:24:15,651 --> 01:24:18,725
We're not discussing his grades

1516
01:24:19,014 --> 01:24:20,731
...but his behavior for now

1517
01:24:20,972 --> 01:24:22,087
I have the impression

1518
01:24:23,013 --> 01:24:25,573
...we need to consider
disciplinary action

1519
01:24:25,932 --> 01:24:27,685
His attitude's wrong

1520
01:24:27,933 --> 01:24:31,130
It's simple. Every other class
I throw him out

1521
01:24:31,653 --> 01:24:34,769
I don’t even throw
him out anymore,

1522
01:24:35,051 --> 01:24:38,044
...He’s only too happy when I do.

1523
01:24:38,292 --> 01:24:41,409
I don’t think disciplinary action
will help...

1524
01:24:41,652 --> 01:24:42,767
...because things will get

1525
01:24:43,052 --> 01:24:44,566
...really bad then

1526
01:24:44,814 --> 01:24:48,360
They’re already really bad
It’s gone too far.

1527
01:24:48,611 --> 01:24:52,128
It’s like he’s mad at the others
for being normal

1528
01:24:52,972 --> 01:24:54,291
I'll remind you Mr. Marin

1529
01:24:54,571 --> 01:24:57,609
...you brought him to me yesterday.

1530
01:24:58,372 --> 01:25:01,125
Yes, but it was this year's
first incident.

1531
01:25:01,371 --> 01:25:04,649
He was disrespectful, I set a limit

1532
01:25:04,892 --> 01:25:06,927
I did what I did but I don’t think

1533
01:25:07,331 --> 01:25:09,968
it will go any further than that

1534
01:25:11,291 --> 01:25:13,646
I don’t have any real complaints,

1535
01:25:13,891 --> 01:25:15,404
...apart from yesterday

1536
01:25:15,651 --> 01:25:17,402
Our job isn't to make sure

1537
01:25:17,690 --> 01:25:21,399
students sit quietly at the back
and don’t cause any trouble.

1538
01:25:21,651 --> 01:25:23,401
We have to bring them out!

1539
01:25:24,169 --> 01:25:27,242
I won’t do that
with threats or punishment,

1540
01:25:27,490 --> 01:25:31,198
...I'd rather stress his good work.
Some things interest him.

1541
01:25:31,448 --> 01:25:34,044
He can come out
with some pretty good stuff

1542
01:25:34,290 --> 01:25:35,245
Simply because he does

1543
01:25:35,530 --> 01:25:37,679
...something positive now and then,

1544
01:25:38,971 --> 01:25:41,847
...we let him sink
and wallow in his hole...

1545
01:25:42,089 --> 01:25:45,125
...and we do nothing. You
just want to buy social harmony.

1546
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:50,478
That said,

1547
01:25:50,769 --> 01:25:54,001
what do we say? What do we do?
A warning?

1548
01:25:55,129 --> 01:25:57,881
I don’t think a warnings
what he needs.

1549
01:25:58,127 --> 01:26:02,042
Maybe we should say
he has reached his limit,

1550
01:26:02,289 --> 01:26:04,882
...because he’s
limited scholastically.

1551
01:26:11,448 --> 01:26:14,646
That’s all well and good
but I’m dim and have a line to fill.

1552
01:26:14,928 --> 01:26:16,361
What do we put?

1553
01:26:17,728 --> 01:26:18,795
It’s not right

1554
01:26:19,087 --> 01:26:20,363
...saying that

1555
01:26:28,569 --> 01:26:32,115
Three rhymes per verse.
What do you call that?

1556
01:26:32,646 --> 01:26:33,795
- Verses of three lines... Wey?
- A tercet

1557
01:26:34,049 --> 01:26:35,686
Very good

1558
01:26:36,367 --> 01:26:38,358
And four rhymes would be?

1559
01:26:39,286 --> 01:26:40,434
A quatrain

1560
01:26:41,367 --> 01:26:42,721
From quatre, four

1561
01:26:42,967 --> 01:26:45,117
Tercet, three rhymes.
Quatrain, four

1562
01:26:45,448 --> 01:26:47,917
How many syllabes per line?

1563
01:26:48,208 --> 01:26:49,435
Can you tell me that?
Khoumba.

1564
01:26:49,687 --> 01:26:50,755
I know here are 10

1565
01:26:51,287 --> 01:26:52,276
You know that?

1566
01:26:52,566 --> 01:26:53,964
- Want me to show you?
- Yes.

1567
01:26:54,205 --> 01:26:55,924
"Noir-dans-la-nei-ge...

1568
01:26:56,167 --> 01:26:57,997
..."et-dans-la-bru-me. "

1569
01:26:58,247 --> 01:26:59,645
Thats 10

1570
01:26:59,926 --> 01:27:02,077
You say that and...

1571
01:27:02,328 --> 01:27:04,237
...You have two

1572
01:27:04,526 --> 01:27:07,722
...extra syllables
by counting the mute Es.

1573
01:27:08,568 --> 01:27:11,080
Don’t count them, they’re mute

1574
01:27:12,846 --> 01:27:14,960
That makes 8

1575
01:27:15,567 --> 01:27:17,476
...We can underline each syllable

1576
01:27:18,405 --> 01:27:20,158
I'll come back to that one

1577
01:27:20,405 --> 01:27:21,963
Two octosyllables
and one four-syllable line

1578
01:27:22,247 --> 01:27:24,043
- What is it?
- A problem,

1579
01:27:24,325 --> 01:27:26,395
11.47 that makes

1580
01:27:26,645 --> 01:27:27,792
11,5.

1581
01:27:28,284 --> 01:27:29,638
Is 11.47 the number of syllables here?

1582
01:27:29,966 --> 01:27:32,604
No, my grade. It's down!
They lowered my grade!

1583
01:27:32,924 --> 01:27:34,835
What's that to do with poetry?

1584
01:27:35,125 --> 01:27:37,321
11.47 is 11.5

1585
01:27:37,765 --> 01:27:39,357
Who gave you your grade?

1586
01:27:39,645 --> 01:27:41,441
You shouldn't have it yet

1587
01:27:41,723 --> 01:27:43,921
Esmeralda told me

1588
01:27:44,406 --> 01:27:45,962
So the class reps

1589
01:27:46,244 --> 01:27:47,597
...did do something after all

1590
01:27:48,043 --> 01:27:49,956
I took a load of notes!

1591
01:27:50,565 --> 01:27:52,556
I got the impression you weren't

1592
01:27:52,844 --> 01:27:55,039
...really following the meeting
- I noted all!

1593
01:27:55,283 --> 01:27:56,924
Louise, I'm delighted
you've done

1594
01:27:57,205 --> 01:27:58,762
a good job passing on information...

1595
01:27:59,044 --> 01:28:01,398
Let's get back to this poem

1596
01:28:02,242 --> 01:28:05,758
The rule is to count
in front of a consonant...

1597
01:28:06,044 --> 01:28:06,793
A question

1598
01:28:07,603 --> 01:28:08,638
What?

1599
01:28:08,923 --> 01:28:11,234
I heard you really wiped me out

1600
01:28:11,525 --> 01:28:13,242
...at the meeting yesterday

1601
01:28:13,603 --> 01:28:15,321
Another remark about poetry, I see.

1602
01:28:15,602 --> 01:28:17,674
No, it isn’t

1603
01:28:17,964 --> 01:28:21,000
Yes, I know it isn’t about poetry

1604
01:28:21,803 --> 01:28:22,791
What do you mean?

1605
01:28:23,201 --> 01:28:25,956
I dunno. You wiped me out

1606
01:28:27,683 --> 01:28:31,313
Some teachers, not me,

1607
01:28:31,564 --> 01:28:32,599
...said if you carry on like this

1608
01:28:32,883 --> 01:28:36,237
you'll be in trouble,

1609
01:28:36,521 --> 01:28:38,717
...not wiped out.

1610
01:28:39,442 --> 01:28:42,991
That's revenge. I don't get it
Why do for revenge?

1611
01:28:43,282 --> 01:28:45,115
How come it's revenge?

1612
01:28:45,403 --> 01:28:49,838
If you say stuff about me
getting in trouble, that's revenge

1613
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:53,082
It's not revenge at all

1614
01:28:54,602 --> 01:28:56,159
We're not on the streets

1615
01:28:56,441 --> 01:28:59,354
It's a warning
Our goal here isn't revenge,

1616
01:28:59,642 --> 01:29:02,713
...it's discipline

1617
01:29:02,961 --> 01:29:04,872
- Get the difference?
- I don't get it.

1618
01:29:05,643 --> 01:29:08,792
When a judge sends someone to jail,

1619
01:29:09,041 --> 01:29:11,473
...he doesn't do it to get revenge

1620
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:13,916
...It helps society run smoothly

1621
01:29:14,599 --> 01:29:17,672
You just want revenge.
You're riffed with me.

1622
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:19,713
All I care about is revenge?

1623
01:29:20,002 --> 01:29:23,151
I wake up and say
I'll get Souleymane today?

1624
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:25,474
You insulted him yesterday anyhow.

1625
01:29:25,581 --> 01:29:28,037
He really laid into you!

1626
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:29,030
I did not.

1627
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:30,833
What did he say, Louise?

1628
01:29:31,599 --> 01:29:33,353
That you we’re limited.

1629
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,033
...I underlined it, I was so shocked

1630
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:37,959
Me? Limited?

1631
01:29:40,841 --> 01:29:42,637
Brilliant...

1632
01:29:53,761 --> 01:29:55,477
Esmeralda, Louise,

1633
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:59,591
...What's your role as class reps?
You represent the students

1634
01:29:59,837 --> 01:30:02,115
to help this class work
or you stir up trouble for me?

1635
01:30:02,359 --> 01:30:03,711
We just do our job.

1636
01:30:03,999 --> 01:30:04,988
Wicked!

1637
01:30:05,239 --> 01:30:06,716
We report on the meeting.

1638
01:30:07,117 --> 01:30:07,710
Of course.

1639
01:30:07,998 --> 01:30:09,512
I didn't realize

1640
01:30:09,878 --> 01:30:11,789
When I saw you snigger

1641
01:30:12,038 --> 01:30:14,792
...at the meeting, I felt bad for you

1642
01:30:15,079 --> 01:30:17,273
It wasn't the place or time

1643
01:30:17,558 --> 01:30:18,388
It didn't look very serious

1644
01:30:20,477 --> 01:30:21,672
Nobody minded in any case

1645
01:30:21,998 --> 01:30:22,986
- They did!
- Only you

1646
01:30:23,237 --> 01:30:26,434
No, it bothered me and I think

1647
01:30:26,718 --> 01:30:28,277
it bothered the others too

1648
01:30:28,919 --> 01:30:30,589
No. It only bothered you

1649
01:30:32,597 --> 01:30:35,796
Sorry, but laughing like that
made you look like two skanks.

1650
01:30:37,197 --> 01:30:39,347
What?
Have you just lost it?

1651
01:30:39,637 --> 01:30:40,670
That's a bad thing!

1652
01:30:43,597 --> 01:30:44,666
You can't dump on us

1653
01:30:45,077 --> 01:30:46,511
The word is insult.

1654
01:30:46,797 --> 01:30:48,627
You're crazy insulting on us.

1655
01:30:48,918 --> 01:30:51,351
You say "dump on" or "insult"

1656
01:30:51,597 --> 01:30:53,791
It's either one or the other, ok.

1657
01:30:54,075 --> 01:30:56,033
Yeah keep on talking!

1658
01:30:56,316 --> 01:30:58,626
In fact I never said
you we’re skanks,

1659
01:30:58,876 --> 01:30:59,945
...I said that at one point

1660
01:31:00,236 --> 01:31:02,191
...in the meeting

1661
01:31:02,475 --> 01:31:04,672
...you acted like skanks.
Understand?

1662
01:31:04,956 --> 01:31:07,675
Don't try to con us,
you said skanks

1663
01:31:07,955 --> 01:31:10,266
I'm just explaining the difference.

1664
01:31:10,557 --> 01:31:12,467
Sir, you don't talk to girls like that!

1665
01:31:12,715 --> 01:31:15,148
Look who's talking!

1666
01:31:15,434 --> 01:31:16,664
...You always insult everybody!

1667
01:31:16,956 --> 01:31:18,547
He wants revenge on the girls

1668
01:31:18,835 --> 01:31:22,510
No way. The noble knight
riding to rescue act,

1669
01:31:22,795 --> 01:31:23,673
...won’t wash!

1670
01:31:23,916 --> 01:31:25,712
You don’t talk to me, man!

1671
01:31:26,075 --> 01:31:27,986
Show some respect!

1672
01:31:28,275 --> 01:31:29,673
I will if I want!

1673
01:31:29,953 --> 01:31:31,627
You're heading for trouble!

1674
01:31:31,914 --> 01:31:32,984
Think you're tough?

1675
01:31:33,234 --> 01:31:35,794
It's a question of discipline!

1676
01:31:36,794 --> 01:31:37,546
I'll take you anytime!

1677
01:31:37,836 --> 01:31:39,109
Stop playing the big short

1678
01:31:39,394 --> 01:31:42,067
- Calm down
- Stay outta this

1679
01:31:42,353 --> 01:31:43,103
Cut it out!

1680
01:31:43,393 --> 01:31:44,715
Don't touch me!

1681
01:31:44,996 --> 01:31:47,383
Don’t touch me.

1682
01:31:47,634 --> 01:31:49,464
You're crazy!

1683
01:31:49,753 --> 01:31:51,551
Cut it out

1684
01:31:53,833 --> 01:31:55,267
What are you doing?

1685
01:31:55,555 --> 01:31:56,270
I'm outta here

1686
01:31:56,553 --> 01:31:58,671
You can't just walk out of my class.

1687
01:31:58,955 --> 01:32:00,228
Are you nuts?

1688
01:32:00,514 --> 01:32:02,266
- Calm down
- Let go of me

1689
01:32:02,553 --> 01:32:03,428
Stop it

1690
01:32:03,912 --> 01:32:05,472
- Let me go
- Ah!

1691
01:32:06,872 --> 01:32:08,909
- Where are you going?
- Let go, fucker

1692
01:32:09,193 --> 01:32:09,830
Pathetic

1693
01:32:21,713 --> 01:32:22,462
Fuck

1694
01:32:35,153 --> 01:32:37,381
What do we do?

1695
01:32:39,031 --> 01:32:43,184
I think we need to convene
the disciplinary committee

1696
01:32:43,672 --> 01:32:45,344
This is starting to add up
it begins

1697
01:32:45,591 --> 01:32:48,185
with disrespect, then the fight,

1698
01:32:48,432 --> 01:32:51,900
...with a student injured,

1699
01:32:52,913 --> 01:32:56,142
...and finally he leaves the class
without permission.

1700
01:32:56,391 --> 01:33:00,101
There was only one incident
and it all spread out from there.

1701
01:33:00,351 --> 01:33:02,069
One thing led to another,

1702
01:33:02,311 --> 01:33:03,869
...a chain reaction.

1703
01:33:04,311 --> 01:33:05,266
Well

1704
01:33:05,550 --> 01:33:08,702
...what I can do is take
a protective measure

1705
01:33:08,951 --> 01:33:10,827
...since this is so serious

1706
01:33:11,071 --> 01:33:14,268
...by suspending Souleymane
for 48 hours.

1707
01:33:14,830 --> 01:33:16,786
That'll give us a little time

1708
01:33:17,031 --> 01:33:19,180
...to reach a decision

1709
01:33:19,430 --> 01:33:20,581
OK.

1710
01:33:21,272 --> 01:33:22,828
Shall we do that?

1711
01:33:23,231 --> 01:33:26,140
However, I need to see you tomorrow.

1712
01:33:26,389 --> 01:33:28,666
Could you come to my office?

1713
01:33:28,911 --> 01:33:31,184
- Good bye.
- Good bye

1714
01:33:32,829 --> 01:33:34,022
Francois!

1715
01:33:35,750 --> 01:33:37,741
I need a word with you

1716
01:33:38,429 --> 01:33:41,104
There's a rumor going around...

1717
01:33:41,351 --> 01:33:43,147
A rumor?

1718
01:33:43,469 --> 01:33:46,983
Some students came to see me
and told me...

1719
01:33:49,949 --> 01:33:51,462
...you insulted them

1720
01:33:54,269 --> 01:33:55,942
Who? Louise and Esmeralda?

1721
01:33:56,190 --> 01:33:57,463
They told me

1722
01:33:57,749 --> 01:33:59,387
...you called them skanks

1723
01:33:59,628 --> 01:34:01,140
...and that led to the incident

1724
01:34:01,427 --> 01:34:02,863
...with Souleymane

1725
01:34:03,109 --> 01:34:05,224
And you believe them?

1726
01:34:05,469 --> 01:34:07,503
That's why I needed to see you.

1727
01:34:07,747 --> 01:34:10,979
You didn't mention it
in your incident report...

1728
01:34:11,228 --> 01:34:14,538
I didn't mention it.
What can I say?

1729
01:34:14,828 --> 01:34:16,786
- Did you do it or not?
- What?

1730
01:34:17,029 --> 01:34:18,461
- Did you...
- Hi!

1731
01:34:18,788 --> 01:34:19,903
Hi.

1732
01:34:20,387 --> 01:34:22,024
Did you call them skanks?

1733
01:34:22,306 --> 01:34:24,377
But Souleymane's another matter!

1734
01:34:24,626 --> 01:34:27,221
I know it had nothing to do with him

1735
01:34:27,467 --> 01:34:29,744
But word's getting around.

1736
01:34:30,109 --> 01:34:32,019
People are talking.
I wanted

1737
01:34:32,308 --> 01:34:34,944
...to let you know
- Thanks for letting me know.

1738
01:34:46,427 --> 01:34:48,860
Hey, you two
You complained about me.

1739
01:34:49,146 --> 01:34:51,139
- Thanks a lot!
- You’re welcome

1740
01:34:51,787 --> 01:34:53,584
You could have talked to me

1741
01:34:53,866 --> 01:34:57,098
Teachers can complain about us
and vice versa, right?

1742
01:34:57,386 --> 01:34:58,819
No, it doesn't work both ways.

1743
01:35:01,346 --> 01:35:02,778
What are you after?

1744
01:35:03,066 --> 01:35:04,137
To see you punished

1745
01:35:04,427 --> 01:35:05,700
- Punished?
- Yes!

1746
01:35:05,986 --> 01:35:09,261
- You, punish me?
- You insulted us, you get punished.

1747
01:35:09,544 --> 01:35:11,027
Where will that get you?

1748
01:35:11,347 --> 01:35:12,665
I'll have spoken out.

1749
01:35:12,945 --> 01:35:15,380
Great, that's a lot of use.

1750
01:35:15,665 --> 01:35:17,495
Do you know what 'skank' means?

1751
01:35:17,746 --> 01:35:19,861
I never called you skanks!

1752
01:35:20,585 --> 01:35:22,542
Yes, you did. For me
skank means prostitute.

1753
01:35:24,627 --> 01:35:26,139
It's not that at all

1754
01:35:26,385 --> 01:35:27,738
For me, it doesn't mean that.

1755
01:35:27,985 --> 01:35:30,372
It's nothing important at all,

1756
01:35:30,664 --> 01:35:33,975
just a girl laughing stupidly

1757
01:35:34,265 --> 01:35:36,779
Hey, skank means prostitute, right?

1758
01:35:37,424 --> 01:35:39,098
You bet!

1759
01:35:39,386 --> 01:35:41,103
- Will Souleymane get expelled?
- No.

1760
01:35:41,384 --> 01:35:43,613
- A disciplinary hearing?
- We don't know yet.

1761
01:35:43,903 --> 01:35:45,816
It's a possibility

1762
01:35:46,106 --> 01:35:48,857
Stop yelling
before anything is decided

1763
01:35:49,144 --> 01:35:51,576
It's all settled anyway

1764
01:35:51,862 --> 01:35:55,174
- Why say that?
- Because it's always the same!

1765
01:35:55,824 --> 01:35:56,859
You're in no position to talk.

1766
01:35:57,104 --> 01:36:00,504
You're the one who got hurt

1767
01:36:01,063 --> 01:36:02,736
He didn't mean it

1768
01:36:02,983 --> 01:36:04,540
There was a metal thing in his bag

1769
01:36:04,822 --> 01:36:07,860
In any case he blew a fuse
and that's bad

1770
01:36:08,103 --> 01:36:08,853
Sir,

1771
01:36:09,143 --> 01:36:10,417
...anyone can blow a fuse

1772
01:36:10,703 --> 01:36:12,340
And then calm down after

1773
01:36:12,623 --> 01:36:13,534
That's not sure

1774
01:36:13,825 --> 01:36:15,336
- You did
- No!

1775
01:36:15,623 --> 01:36:16,577
You're calmer now

1776
01:36:17,023 --> 01:36:18,693
I'm not. You don’t know me!

1777
01:36:18,982 --> 01:36:21,179
All the teachers say
your attitude is perfect now...

1778
01:36:21,463 --> 01:36:24,534
You think you've tamed me?

1779
01:36:25,301 --> 01:36:26,370
No, being sent here helped

1780
01:36:26,623 --> 01:36:29,614
...you understand things, see?

1781
01:36:32,981 --> 01:36:36,019
Teachers helped you

1782
01:36:36,303 --> 01:36:38,452
and we'll do the same
for Souleymane.

1783
01:36:38,741 --> 01:36:42,416
I say teachers who
expel students are fuckers

1784
01:36:45,301 --> 01:36:47,132
Right on.
You want to repeat that?

1785
01:36:47,463 --> 01:36:49,976
- Yeah, fuckers
- Everyone goes wild

1786
01:36:50,261 --> 01:36:52,330
...over some word I said. You
say fucker and I shouldn't react?

1787
01:36:52,580 --> 01:36:53,535
They're fuckers!

1788
01:36:53,820 --> 01:36:55,733
Cut it out!

1789
01:36:56,261 --> 01:37:00,458
You say skanks, we say fucker.
It's the same thing

1790
01:37:00,699 --> 01:37:02,259
They're nothing alike

1791
01:37:02,501 --> 01:37:05,698
A teacher can say certain things
that students can't say.

1792
01:37:05,941 --> 01:37:08,138
Try to understand that!

1793
01:37:08,382 --> 01:37:09,655
We have no right to speak?

1794
01:37:09,901 --> 01:37:13,175
You keep talking all the time!
You never stop speaking

1795
01:37:13,419 --> 01:37:15,457
Whenever we talk, you yell.
What is this?

1796
01:37:15,701 --> 01:37:17,339
Enough...

1797
01:37:25,180 --> 01:37:26,693
Sir!

1798
01:37:28,822 --> 01:37:30,890
- Sir?
- What?

1799
01:37:33,299 --> 01:37:35,860
Will Souleymane get a hearing?

1800
01:37:36,580 --> 01:37:38,218
Give it a rest

1801
01:37:39,180 --> 01:37:41,613
You sound like you want
him to. It fires you up.

1802
01:37:41,858 --> 01:37:44,817
You know what'll happen
if he's expelled?

1803
01:37:45,579 --> 01:37:47,137
He'll change schools.

1804
01:37:47,379 --> 01:37:48,969
No, he won’t change schools.

1805
01:37:49,220 --> 01:37:51,892
It's automatic. It's obligatory.

1806
01:37:52,139 --> 01:37:53,777
That goes for Souleymane too.

1807
01:37:55,098 --> 01:37:57,056
Do you know his father?

1808
01:37:57,300 --> 01:37:58,971
I've seen him once or twice.

1809
01:37:59,378 --> 01:38:00,573
No, you don’t know him!

1810
01:38:00,818 --> 01:38:03,413
If he's expelled, his dad'll
send him back to their village

1811
01:38:04,580 --> 01:38:06,091
Don't get overdramatic

1812
01:38:06,978 --> 01:38:08,614
He'll go back to Mali

1813
01:38:09,177 --> 01:38:11,977
I think we all need
to keep our heads.

1814
01:38:13,098 --> 01:38:13,974
Don’t worry

1815
01:38:27,097 --> 01:38:28,928
You can’t smoke here sir

1816
01:38:30,899 --> 01:38:32,853
I know, but since I was alone

1817
01:38:55,656 --> 01:38:58,568
Ok, you went too far
with those girls.

1818
01:38:58,816 --> 01:39:00,135
We all screw up.

1819
01:39:00,376 --> 01:39:02,128
Souleymane overreacted.

1820
01:39:02,376 --> 01:39:03,411
He's right.

1821
01:39:03,656 --> 01:39:06,410
I saw Khoumba.
Her face was all bloody

1822
01:39:06,657 --> 01:39:08,692
What he did is unacceptable.

1823
01:39:08,975 --> 01:39:10,044
That's for sure.

1824
01:39:10,535 --> 01:39:12,129
I know that.

1825
01:39:12,377 --> 01:39:15,173
His bag hit her by accident.

1826
01:39:15,416 --> 01:39:18,450
A split eybrow bleeds a lot.
That's all.

1827
01:39:19,415 --> 01:39:21,451
You can't ignore it.

1828
01:39:21,736 --> 01:39:25,776
Don't take it to heart.
Seen how they talk to us?

1829
01:39:26,697 --> 01:39:29,892
How's that relevant?
Souleymane is going to get expelled

1830
01:39:30,135 --> 01:39:32,089
...That’s it!

1831
01:39:33,295 --> 01:39:35,525
- No.
- That's kind of logical.

1832
01:39:39,416 --> 01:39:42,168
How many hearings last year?

1833
01:39:44,933 --> 01:39:46,574
12 at least.

1834
01:39:47,215 --> 01:39:48,613
Not that many.

1835
01:39:48,854 --> 01:39:49,650
He could be right.

1836
01:39:49,894 --> 01:39:53,444
I know, I'm on the committee
so I saw them all

1837
01:39:53,694 --> 01:39:57,528
An average of two per month,
12 in all with an expulsion each time

1838
01:39:58,734 --> 01:40:01,772
The hearing is where
we talk things over

1839
01:40:02,054 --> 01:40:04,773
Ok, 12 students were expelled

1840
01:40:05,053 --> 01:40:07,329
but maybe there was no other solution.

1841
01:40:07,934 --> 01:40:10,970
12 out of 12

1842
01:40:11,253 --> 01:40:13,686
...talk about debate!

1843
01:40:14,055 --> 01:40:16,647
But 12 out of 12 just means

1844
01:40:16,892 --> 01:40:20,566
...when a student has a hearing,
it's too late.

1845
01:40:21,135 --> 01:40:22,328
Or it was justified.

1846
01:40:22,573 --> 01:40:25,485
Ok, things happen
that lead to a hearing

1847
01:40:25,732 --> 01:40:27,483
But then what happens?

1848
01:40:27,853 --> 01:40:30,161
What do we expect from a hearing?

1849
01:40:30,413 --> 01:40:31,845
There are prior stages:

1850
01:40:32,132 --> 01:40:34,887
Pre-disciplinary committees,

1851
01:40:35,133 --> 01:40:38,090
...we inform the parents,
the students are warned...

1852
01:40:39,052 --> 01:40:42,044
- Not in this case.
- We've no time.

1853
01:40:42,292 --> 01:40:44,123
It's pretty rare.

1854
01:40:44,451 --> 01:40:48,332
It's rare because we have
this final punishment

1855
01:40:48,573 --> 01:40:51,291
...that allows us to ignore
the prior steps.

1856
01:40:51,531 --> 01:40:54,124
And even if we did use them,

1857
01:40:54,770 --> 01:40:57,524
...the simple fact
of expelling a student...

1858
01:40:58,291 --> 01:41:02,251
...is a disavowal
of everything we have tried.

1859
01:41:02,492 --> 01:41:06,085
Ok, but it's Souleymane's chance
to justify himself

1860
01:41:06,331 --> 01:41:08,844
At a hearing, you don't speak.

1861
01:41:09,092 --> 01:41:11,525
You're scared. You're paralyzed.

1862
01:41:12,010 --> 01:41:13,125
Exactly.

1863
01:41:13,370 --> 01:41:15,325
Let me sum up.

1864
01:41:15,569 --> 01:41:19,119
He'll get a disciplinary hearing,
he'll be expelled

1865
01:41:19,370 --> 01:41:21,804
and maybe even sent back to Mali

1866
01:41:22,090 --> 01:41:24,003
You're being overdramatic.

1867
01:41:24,251 --> 01:41:25,807
No, I'm not

1868
01:41:26,090 --> 01:41:29,319
Students who know him better
than any of us here,

1869
01:41:29,568 --> 01:41:33,687
...who know his father,
say that he is likely Mali...

1870
01:41:33,929 --> 01:41:35,646
to send him back to Mali after this

1871
01:41:37,009 --> 01:41:39,285
Some are threatened

1872
01:41:40,009 --> 01:41:42,569
...with boarding school
but in never happens

1873
01:41:43,048 --> 01:41:44,768
It can happen.

1874
01:41:45,209 --> 01:41:48,803
A lot of parents spend their time

1875
01:41:49,087 --> 01:41:52,718
...threatening their kids with that.
You can't take it into account

1876
01:41:53,448 --> 01:41:58,365
- Even if there was just a slight risk
that a hearing could lead

1877
01:41:58,649 --> 01:42:02,118
to him being sent back,
I don't think I can take that risk.

1878
01:42:04,609 --> 01:42:06,439
It's like when you hesitate

1879
01:42:06,728 --> 01:42:09,321
...over punishing a kid
because when he goes home,

1880
01:42:09,567 --> 01:42:11,718
once that door closes,

1881
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:14,004
...he'll get a beating
from his parents

1882
01:42:14,248 --> 01:42:16,681
We've all seen that

1883
01:42:16,927 --> 01:42:17,964
...But we still have to punish

1884
01:42:18,210 --> 01:42:20,358
them when they go too far

1885
01:42:20,648 --> 01:42:22,604
Whatever the consequences

1886
01:42:22,887 --> 01:42:24,524
which don't

1887
01:42:24,766 --> 01:42:26,440
...concern you!

1888
01:42:26,687 --> 01:42:28,200
So I ignore that?

1889
01:42:28,447 --> 01:42:31,086
I know punishment
can have such a consequence,

1890
01:42:31,326 --> 01:42:33,557
...but I turn a blind eye, is that it?

1891
01:42:35,087 --> 01:42:37,519
You can't take it into account
in every case

1892
01:42:37,766 --> 01:42:40,361
The violence…

1893
01:42:40,607 --> 01:42:43,678
him being sent back...

1894
01:42:43,926 --> 01:42:46,441
- No more Christmas presents...
- True, you have to consider it

1895
01:42:46,687 --> 01:42:47,483
but after a while...

1896
01:42:48,207 --> 01:42:50,119
It's a question of principle

1897
01:42:50,407 --> 01:42:52,558
...We each have a role to play

1898
01:42:52,807 --> 01:42:55,445
We can't substitute
ourselves for the parents

1899
01:42:57,206 --> 01:42:59,277
Sorry, but if I rewind the movie,

1900
01:42:59,527 --> 01:43:02,723
...it's a weird chain of events.
It starts with reprimands,

1901
01:43:03,006 --> 01:43:06,204
...when Souleymane forget
his things, talks back.

1902
01:43:06,447 --> 01:43:09,756
We punish him. Again and again,

1903
01:43:10,006 --> 01:43:12,074
until a disciplinary hearing

1904
01:43:12,324 --> 01:43:15,681
leading to who knows what
Everything gets out of hand

1905
01:43:15,926 --> 01:43:18,075
Sure, looking at it that way

1906
01:43:18,364 --> 01:43:20,515
it's really shocking

1907
01:43:20,765 --> 01:43:25,122
But the school won't
expelling Souleymane

1908
01:43:25,365 --> 01:43:28,005
He's been gone for a while

1909
01:44:04,284 --> 01:44:07,751
Francois, I didn't
expect you so soon.

1910
01:44:08,244 --> 01:44:10,962
Have you reached a decision?

1911
01:44:11,683 --> 01:44:14,561
I don't think I have much choice.

1912
01:44:20,042 --> 01:44:21,759
By the way, Julie told me…

1913
01:44:22,004 --> 01:44:24,881
you had a heated exchange

1914
01:44:25,162 --> 01:44:27,117
...with two girls in your class.

1915
01:44:27,361 --> 01:44:30,799
Yes, the two class reps
but it happened first so

1916
01:44:31,042 --> 01:44:33,921
You apparently
called them "skanks"

1917
01:44:34,162 --> 01:44:35,836
Let's say that, yes

1918
01:44:36,084 --> 01:44:39,995
That complicates things,
but the problem remains.

1919
01:44:40,282 --> 01:44:43,036
I'd like you to mention it
in your report

1920
01:44:43,282 --> 01:44:47,321
I don't want it used against us
at the disciplinary hearing.

1921
01:44:47,681 --> 01:44:50,675
Don't bother hiding it,
just write it down.

1922
01:44:50,922 --> 01:44:52,321
I understand.

1923
01:44:54,201 --> 01:44:56,395
I'll let you reread this

1924
01:44:56,643 --> 01:44:59,314
before we launch the procedure.

1925
01:44:59,561 --> 01:45:01,994
So I… I just need to add...

1926
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:05,035
Yes, without going into detail.

1927
01:45:06,281 --> 01:45:07,634
Does that suit you?

1928
01:45:07,881 --> 01:45:09,074
OK.

1929
01:45:36,878 --> 01:45:39,951
Can you take the minute.

1930
01:45:53,278 --> 01:45:54,597
- Hello
- Hello.

1931
01:45:55,518 --> 01:45:56,746
Hello, sir.

1932
01:45:56,999 --> 01:45:58,876
- Please sit down.
- Thanks.

1933
01:46:32,836 --> 01:46:36,466
"Carl tried to reason with him,
but Souleyman broke free,

1934
01:46:36,717 --> 01:46:39,513
"winging his bag that hit Khoumba
in the face.

1935
01:46:39,755 --> 01:46:42,873
"He left, insulting everyone
and slamming the door.

1936
01:46:43,116 --> 01:46:46,027
"I didn't go after him
because I needed...

1937
01:46:46,275 --> 01:46:49,428
"to help Khoumba
whose eybrow was bleeding. "

1938
01:46:49,836 --> 01:46:53,350
Those are the facts
that led to today's hearing

1939
01:46:53,638 --> 01:46:57,390
Madame, it doesn't mean
Souleyman is a bad boy.

1940
01:46:57,676 --> 01:46:59,711
That's not we're saying

1941
01:46:59,955 --> 01:47:02,423
But, sometimes,
a student in a class

1942
01:47:02,715 --> 01:47:06,185
through voluntary or
involuntary behavior,

1943
01:47:06,435 --> 01:47:08,507
can create an atmosphere that...

1944
01:47:08,756 --> 01:47:11,223
...prevents the class from working.

1945
01:47:25,555 --> 01:47:28,275
Do you understand
what we're saying?

1946
01:47:29,875 --> 01:47:31,102
If I may say something, it's true

1947
01:47:31,395 --> 01:47:33,589
there had been number of signs

1948
01:47:33,833 --> 01:47:36,507
that should have warned us.

1949
01:47:36,754 --> 01:47:39,063
We could have reacted sooner

1950
01:47:40,154 --> 01:47:43,544
But how we have to deal
with an incident

1951
01:47:43,795 --> 01:47:45,830
that is fairy violent

1952
01:47:46,074 --> 01:47:48,064
and that's simply unacceptable.

1953
01:47:48,352 --> 01:47:52,063
I'd like to know
if you realize that, Souleymane?

1954
01:47:55,754 --> 01:47:59,303
We're not saying you're
deliberately violent.

1955
01:47:59,553 --> 01:48:02,672
The problem is you can't control
what you say,

1956
01:48:02,954 --> 01:48:04,592
...and what you do

1957
01:48:06,193 --> 01:48:08,501
You're here to express
your point of view.

1958
01:48:08,752 --> 01:48:11,984
Go ahead

1959
01:48:12,753 --> 01:48:15,391
I don't give a damn.
I've got nothing to say

1960
01:48:15,872 --> 01:48:17,626
Do whatever you want to do

1961
01:48:27,792 --> 01:48:29,270
Excuse me...

1962
01:48:38,912 --> 01:48:40,345
Can you translate?

1963
01:48:41,432 --> 01:48:43,466
She says I'm a good boy

1964
01:48:46,070 --> 01:48:47,299
I do my homework.

1965
01:48:53,751 --> 01:48:57,951
I help my brothers and sisters
with their work when I can

1966
01:49:03,229 --> 01:49:07,508
I always wash the dishes
and help her when I can

1967
01:49:10,350 --> 01:49:13,945
We don't doubt he's a good son.
That's not the problem.

1968
01:49:14,191 --> 01:49:15,543
Let's consider

1969
01:49:15,790 --> 01:49:17,381
...his school record

1970
01:49:17,629 --> 01:49:20,427
Excuse me, but could we focus
on the facts here?

1971
01:49:20,870 --> 01:49:23,384
Firstly, I'd like to say

1972
01:49:23,630 --> 01:49:27,862
...that we're surprised to see
the teacher involved in the incident

1973
01:49:28,110 --> 01:49:29,623
...on this committee

1974
01:49:29,909 --> 01:49:31,978
We find it highly irregular

1975
01:49:33,990 --> 01:49:36,549
It's true. It's odd
to be both judge and litigant.

1976
01:49:37,348 --> 01:49:38,541
First of all,

1977
01:49:38,788 --> 01:49:41,986
...Mr. Marin was elected
to the administrative board.

1978
01:49:42,269 --> 01:49:44,385
as the teachers' representative

1979
01:49:44,628 --> 01:49:48,463
Moreover, I think
that the incident...

1980
01:49:48,709 --> 01:49:50,778
...that occurred in
Mr. Marin's class

1981
01:49:51,027 --> 01:49:53,543
...doesn't involve the teacher
directly.

1982
01:49:53,789 --> 01:49:55,666
I'm sorry, you mention

1983
01:49:55,908 --> 01:49:58,661
...some harsh words

1984
01:49:58,908 --> 01:50:00,137
...spoken by the teacher...

1985
01:50:00,390 --> 01:50:02,948
Apparently, you used
the word "skanks"

1986
01:50:03,228 --> 01:50:05,741
...to describe the class reps.
And that's a problem

1987
01:50:05,987 --> 01:50:07,263
I did say that

1988
01:50:07,550 --> 01:50:10,459
...but it wasn’t something
that concerned Souleymane.

1989
01:50:10,708 --> 01:50:14,383
I think he used the excuse
of a rather heated exchange

1990
01:50:14,628 --> 01:50:16,346
...to express the bad mood

1991
01:50:16,587 --> 01:50:19,863
that he was in that day.

1992
01:50:20,107 --> 01:50:21,587
He tried to defend them

1993
01:50:21,828 --> 01:50:23,897
So I feel that it's relevant

1994
01:50:24,148 --> 01:50:26,864
Sorry, but absolutely
nothing justifies

1995
01:50:27,106 --> 01:50:29,860
...being disrespectful to a teacher,

1996
01:50:30,108 --> 01:50:34,019
...insulting everyone and leaving
a class without permission.

1997
01:50:36,427 --> 01:50:38,894
Souleymane, do you
have anything to say?

1998
01:50:40,466 --> 01:50:42,584
I don't know. What can I say?

1999
01:50:52,667 --> 01:50:53,940
Souleymane?

2000
01:50:56,466 --> 01:50:59,458
- What did she say?
- The same thing again

2001
01:51:10,346 --> 01:51:11,698
Souleymane?

2002
01:51:12,545 --> 01:51:14,739
She apologizes on my behalf.

2003
01:52:17,664 --> 01:52:19,698
You can come back in now.

2004
01:52:42,141 --> 01:52:44,529
Madame, the committee
has conferred

2005
01:52:44,780 --> 01:52:48,456
and has decided to expel Souleymane
from the school for good.

2006
01:52:48,702 --> 01:52:52,013
You will receive the ruling
by registered mail

2007
01:52:52,263 --> 01:52:54,616
...and have eight days to appeal,

2008
01:53:02,381 --> 01:53:06,374
We shall do our best to find
Souleymane another school

2009
01:53:10,020 --> 01:53:11,897
Goodbye, Messieurs, Mesdames

2010
01:53:15,300 --> 01:53:19,738
Souleymane, come to see me
before the end of the week, please.

2011
01:53:51,419 --> 01:53:52,975
Mathematical proportionality.

2012
01:53:54,499 --> 01:53:58,969
This year, you learned
mathematical proportionality?

2013
01:53:59,458 --> 01:54:03,246
- I liked science
- What you learned, not liked.

2014
01:54:03,498 --> 01:54:05,965
If you liked it, you learned.

2015
01:54:06,257 --> 01:54:07,898
So what did you learn?

2016
01:54:08,619 --> 01:54:12,133
All about volcanoes, earthquakes,

2017
01:54:12,418 --> 01:54:13,895
...plates...

2018
01:54:14,137 --> 01:54:16,413
Convergence and divergence,

2019
01:54:16,658 --> 01:54:19,377
...movement of the Earth's plates,

2020
01:54:20,577 --> 01:54:22,570
- It was fascinating.
- It interested you?

2021
01:54:22,818 --> 01:54:23,932
- Yeah.
- Good.

2022
01:54:24,857 --> 01:54:28,086
Well, in mathematics,

2023
01:54:28,738 --> 01:54:30,807
.. trigonometry Pythagoras
theorem, Thales theorem.

2024
01:54:31,097 --> 01:54:32,610
I'll stop you there.

2025
01:54:32,857 --> 01:54:35,895
You can't sit there and brag...

2026
01:54:36,138 --> 01:54:38,253
...you learned Pythagoras theorem.
Recite it for us

2027
01:54:42,015 --> 01:54:43,689
If, in a triangle

2028
01:54:43,937 --> 01:54:47,644
...two sides are equal to

2029
01:54:48,015 --> 01:54:50,053
...If the square rot

2030
01:54:50,297 --> 01:54:51,649
If the square of two sides

2031
01:54:51,896 --> 01:54:54,932
is equal to the square

2032
01:54:55,775 --> 01:54:58,165
...the square of the hypotenuse

2033
01:54:58,416 --> 01:55:00,133
then the triangle's a rectangle.

2034
01:55:01,134 --> 01:55:02,772
More or less, yes

2035
01:55:03,016 --> 01:55:04,244
It's spot on

2036
01:55:04,496 --> 01:55:07,168
All right. I believe you.

2037
01:55:07,615 --> 01:55:10,335
In history, I learned
about triangular trade.

2038
01:55:10,577 --> 01:55:14,773
The fact that ships left Europe...

2039
01:55:16,173 --> 01:55:19,963
...with manufactured goods that
they took to Africa to trade for men,

2040
01:55:20,215 --> 01:55:22,728
...who’d became slaves
that they took to America to work.

2041
01:55:22,974 --> 01:55:26,206
Then they took the money
they made back to Europe.

2042
01:55:26,455 --> 01:55:28,411
That's triangular trade

2043
01:55:29,534 --> 01:55:30,764
Chemistry

2044
01:55:31,056 --> 01:55:32,726
What in chemistry?

2045
01:55:33,175 --> 01:55:34,607
Combustion

2046
01:55:35,134 --> 01:55:36,248
What's that?

2047
01:55:36,493 --> 01:55:40,487
Blending Fehling's solution
and glucose.

2048
01:55:40,774 --> 01:55:41,729
What do you get?

2049
01:55:42,494 --> 01:55:44,884
Heat up test-tube,

2050
01:55:45,135 --> 01:55:46,852
...and it changes color.

2051
01:55:48,574 --> 01:55:51,294
- What's the interest?
- The interest?

2052
01:55:51,535 --> 01:55:55,811
I dunno. Why teach it to us
if there's no interest?

2053
01:55:57,012 --> 01:55:58,367
Reproduction

2054
01:56:00,213 --> 01:56:03,410
What did you learn
about human reproduction?

2055
01:56:03,772 --> 01:56:05,287
Human reproduction...

2056
01:56:05,654 --> 01:56:07,644
Well, the sperm

2057
01:56:08,293 --> 01:56:09,691
...gets into the ovum

2058
01:56:10,052 --> 01:56:11,609
then you wait 9 months,

2059
01:56:11,853 --> 01:56:15,163
then you do a sonogram
and then it comes out

2060
01:56:16,012 --> 01:56:17,081
The sperm does?

2061
01:56:17,452 --> 01:56:18,362
No, the baby

2062
01:56:19,334 --> 01:56:21,369
The human being that's inside.

2063
01:56:21,972 --> 01:56:23,690
- Khoumba?
- Me?

2064
01:56:24,290 --> 01:56:26,011
Yes. That is your name?

2065
01:56:26,333 --> 01:56:27,401
Yes.

2066
01:56:29,572 --> 01:56:33,360
In music, I learned to play
the alto recorder...

2067
01:56:34,372 --> 01:56:35,885
and in Spanish

2068
01:56:36,692 --> 01:56:38,010
The recorder in Spanish?

2069
01:56:38,291 --> 01:56:40,568
No, in music, I learned

2070
01:56:40,813 --> 01:56:43,371
to play the alto recorder.
- Right

2071
01:56:43,611 --> 01:56:45,487
- And other stuff in Spanish
- Good.

2072
01:56:45,730 --> 01:56:48,245
Can you say something
to us in Spanish?

2073
01:56:56,371 --> 01:56:59,839
- And that means?
- "It's the vacation soon".

2074
01:57:03,691 --> 01:57:05,361
I didn't learn anything

2075
01:57:06,729 --> 01:57:10,769
You cant spend 9 months at
school and not learn anything.

2076
01:57:11,210 --> 01:57:13,772
I'm the living proof

2077
01:57:14,052 --> 01:57:16,439
You got something
from the books we read.

2078
01:57:16,690 --> 01:57:18,566
- Your books are shite.
- They're what?

2079
01:57:18,850 --> 01:57:20,327
They're useless.

2080
01:57:21,210 --> 01:57:24,168
What about a book
you read by yourself?

2081
01:57:26,050 --> 01:57:27,803
The books I read?

2082
01:57:28,051 --> 01:57:30,518
Well, there's The Republic

2083
01:57:34,451 --> 01:57:35,520
Platon’s "Republic"?

2084
01:57:36,090 --> 01:57:38,728
You read that?

2085
01:57:39,848 --> 01:57:41,075
How come?

2086
01:57:41,929 --> 01:57:44,602
My big sister had it

2087
01:57:45,009 --> 01:57:47,363
- She does philosophy?
- No, law

2088
01:57:48,530 --> 01:57:49,804
So what's it about?

2089
01:57:50,448 --> 01:57:52,804
Well, there's this guy...

2090
01:57:53,487 --> 01:57:54,602
His name's Socrates

2091
01:57:54,887 --> 01:57:56,208
Yeah, Socrates.

2092
01:57:57,809 --> 01:58:01,164
He stops people in the street
and asks them:

2093
01:58:02,370 --> 01:58:04,928
"Are you sure of thinking
what you think?"

2094
01:58:05,168 --> 01:58:07,839
"Are you sure of doing
what you do? and so on?"

2095
01:58:08,087 --> 01:58:10,966
After that, people
start getting confused.

2096
01:58:11,208 --> 01:58:12,845
They ask questions.

2097
01:58:13,087 --> 01:58:14,644
The guy's too much

2098
01:58:15,206 --> 01:58:17,198
What does he ask people about?

2099
01:58:17,488 --> 01:58:18,682
Everything.

2100
01:58:18,927 --> 01:58:23,559
Love, religion, God
people, everything

2101
01:58:25,047 --> 01:58:26,639
- It's good you read it
- I know

2102
01:58:27,287 --> 01:58:29,241
It's not a skank's book!

2103
01:58:35,087 --> 01:58:39,046
Wait a second. Before you leave,
here are your self-portraits

2104
01:58:39,327 --> 01:58:42,601
One by one. When you have
yours, you can go.

2105
01:58:43,205 --> 01:58:44,686
What is it?

2106
01:58:49,084 --> 01:58:50,236
What is it?

2107
01:58:50,487 --> 01:58:53,398
These are the self-portraits
that you wrote

2108
01:58:53,646 --> 01:58:56,113
...and that we made up
with the class photo and so on

2109
01:58:56,366 --> 01:58:57,561
You too, Eva.

2110
01:59:00,125 --> 01:59:01,479
You don't have one?

2111
01:59:04,086 --> 01:59:06,884
- You look good in it
- Cut it out

2112
01:59:07,125 --> 01:59:09,764
You're like a leader

2113
01:59:10,005 --> 01:59:11,485
Very good.

2114
01:59:12,645 --> 01:59:14,317
- Good bye, Sir.
- Good bye.

2115
01:59:15,724 --> 01:59:18,036
- Have a good vacation.
- You too

2116
01:59:24,643 --> 01:59:26,363
- Sir?
- Yes…

2117
01:59:28,124 --> 01:59:29,763
What is it?

2118
01:59:31,044 --> 01:59:32,684
I didn't learn anything

2119
01:59:34,124 --> 01:59:36,194
What? That doesn't mean anything

2120
01:59:37,883 --> 01:59:40,956
Earlier, all the others...

2121
01:59:41,204 --> 01:59:43,559
...said they'd learned something

2122
01:59:44,644 --> 01:59:46,795
Compared to them, I learned nothing

2123
01:59:48,124 --> 01:59:49,955
You learned as much as them

2124
01:59:50,203 --> 01:59:52,321
They had to think hard too.

2125
01:59:52,565 --> 01:59:54,282
It's not easy

2126
01:59:54,523 --> 01:59:58,831
to remember what you learned...

2127
01:59:59,763 --> 02:00:01,321
But I don't understand

2128
02:00:02,363 --> 02:00:03,432
What do you mean?

2129
02:00:04,244 --> 02:00:06,315
I don't understand what we do.

2130
02:00:06,764 --> 02:00:08,116
In French?

2131
02:00:08,883 --> 02:00:10,201
In school

2132
02:00:11,841 --> 02:00:15,882
You can’t say you don’t
understand everything.

2133
02:00:16,723 --> 02:00:18,440
That’s not true...

2134
02:00:21,403 --> 02:00:23,870
I don’t want to go
to vocational school.

2135
02:00:25,001 --> 02:00:27,392
There’s no question of that yet

2136
02:00:28,163 --> 02:00:30,039
You’re moving on to the next year.

2137
02:00:30,962 --> 02:00:34,921
You’ll have plenty of time
to think about your future

2138
02:00:35,202 --> 02:00:38,160
Vocational school isn’t
an absolute certainty

2139
02:00:38,442 --> 02:00:40,798
It all depends on how you do next year

2140
02:00:42,602 --> 02:00:43,920
But I don’t want to.

2141
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:49,000
