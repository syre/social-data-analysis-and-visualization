2
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:02,181
I wish you wouldn't
do that around me.
It's so filthy!

3
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,818
Don't give me a problem
about the cigarettes.
It's such a filthy habit.

4
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,309
Oh, my God!

5
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:08,944
Look at this.

6
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:14,488
Oh, Jesus.
This is so appalling.

7
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,696
I can't believe it.

8
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,166
I can't believe
they gave it to him.

9
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,441
Ah, this is pathetic.

10
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:30,743
Now he's a loser
with a Jaguar.

11
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:33,679
Seriously,
who did he have to blow
to get that thing?

12
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:37,850
Good morning, sir.
Mr. Willis.

13
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:39,285
It's really a...

14
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:40,617
Mr. Trask!

15
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:42,688
Quite a piece
of machinery.

16
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:45,291
Good morning, Havemeyer.
Morning to you, sir.

17
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:46,452
Bene!

18
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,594
Bene?
Bene! Fabulous!

19
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:49,962
What's fabulous?

20
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:52,264
That fine piece of steel
you have back there.

21
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:54,325
Ah, you don't think
I deserve it.

22
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,669
No, sir.
On the contrary.

23
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,704
I think
it's great.

24
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:01,407
Why should the
headmaster of Baird
be seen putt-putting

25
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,242
around in some junker?

26
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,811
In fact, I think the
board of trustees have had

27
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:09,181
their first true stroke
of inspiration in some time.

28
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,684
Well, thank you,
Havemeyer.

29
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:13,853
I'll take that at face value.

30
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:15,947
I'd expect
nothing less, sir.

31
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,350
Have a good day.

32
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,661
Morning,
Mrs. Hunsaker.
Good morning.

33
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:25,325
What have we here,
Murderer's Row?

34
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:33,305
What was that about?

35
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,840
Nothing. Just saying hello.

36
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:37,037
I like to say hello
to Headmaster Trask.

37
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:41,180
Sugarbush. Lift tickets
and condo vouchers.

38
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:43,048
I thought we were
going to Stowe.

39
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:45,084
Sugarbush
is Stowe, Jimmy.

40
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:46,852
This year we're
doing it right.

41
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:49,688
Thanksgiving in Vermont,
Christmas in Switzerland...

42
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,924
Christmas in Gstaad
is gonna cost us...
"Staad."

43
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:53,292
The "G" is silent.

44
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,818
"Staad." George?

45
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:56,495
"Staad."
Trent?

46
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,798
"Staad," man.
So what about Staad?

47
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,666
Fine. The "G" may
be silent,

48
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,402
but it's gonna take at least
three grand to get there.

49
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,104
I'll have to talk
to my father.

50
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:07,873
Better yet,
have my father
talk to your father.

51
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,843
Or my father
talk to your father.

52
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,280
You going home
this weekend, Chas?

53
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:17,283
I don't know.

54
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:20,019
You going home
to fuckin' Idaho
for Thanksgiving?

55
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,544
I'm from Oregon.

56
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:24,356
I meant
fuckin' Oregon.

57
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,392
Charlie, how do you
feel about skiing?

58
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:30,459
You in the mood for
the white-bosomed
slopes of Vermont?

59
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,832
Got a deal going.

60
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,301
20% off for
my friends.

61
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:36,835
My father set it up.

62
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,337
Christmas
in Switzerland.

63
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,673
Staad.
Gstaad.
Dropping the "G" is phony.

64
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,308
You said
everybody
says "Staad."

65
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:43,808
Not if you've
been there.

66
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:47,213
Easter in Bermuda,
then Kentucky Derby
weekend.

67
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:49,415
We could fit
you in, kid.

68
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:53,352
Well, how much are
these white-bosomed
slopes of Vermont?

69
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,354
1,200.

70
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:59,625
Includes a nine-course,
champagne
Thanksgiving dinner.

71
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:03,362
$1,200 is a little rich
for my blood, Harry.

72
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,497
Well, how short
are you?

73
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,666
How short, Harry?

74
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:11,297
So short it wouldn't be
worth the trouble
of you and George to measure.

75
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:12,972
But thanks for askin',
all right?

76
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:14,440
Mmm-hmm.

77
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:16,175
If you change
your mind...

78
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:18,611
What'd you do that for?
You know he's on aid.

79
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:20,112
On major
holidays, Willis,

80
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,880
it's customary
for the lord of the manor

81
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,182
to offer drippings
to the poor.

82
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:24,582
You're so
full of shit!

83
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:52,907
Hi. Mrs. Rossi?

84
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:54,407
Yes?

85
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:56,376
I'm here about
the weekend job.

86
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,219
Come on in.

87
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,960
Does he got pimples?
He hates pimples.

88
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:09,561
Francine, be quiet.

89
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:12,157
Pimples.
Pimples. Yeah.

90
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,732
Shush!

91
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,702
I'm sorry. The school
gave me your name,
but I've forgotten it.

92
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,270
It's Charlie Simms.

93
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,306
How are you,
Charlie?
Fine, thanks.

94
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:21,467
Right this way.

95
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,680
You're available
the whole weekend?

96
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:28,981
Yeah.

97
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:30,916
Not going home
for Thanksgiving?
No.

98
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,180
Good.

99
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:37,389
They put him in
a veteran's home,
but he hated it,

100
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,518
so I told my dad
that we'd take him.

101
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:44,997
Before you go in,
do you mind my
telling you a few things?

102
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:48,935
Don't "sir" him
and don't ask him
too many questions.

103
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:51,670
And if he
staggers a little
when he gets up,

104
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,139
don't pay
any attention.

105
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:58,433
Charlie,
I can tell you're
the right person for the job.

106
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,209
And Uncle Frank's
gonna like you a lot, too.

107
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,851
Where you gonna be
this weekend?

108
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,014
We're driving to Albany.

109
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:12,182
Donny, my husband,
has family there.

110
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:19,331
Do you want
Tommy in or out?

111
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,899
Leave him out!

112
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,530
He's chasing that
Calico ginch from
the track houses again!

113
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,543
Down deep, the man
is a lump of sugar.

114
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,267
Sir?

115
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,236
Don't call me sir.

116
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:58,804
I'm sorry.

117
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,506
I mean mister, sir.

118
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:04,676
Uh-oh, we got a moron here,
is that it?

119
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:06,245
No, mister...

120
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:07,736
That is...

121
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,717
Lieutenant.
Yes, sir...

122
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,618
Lieutenant Colonel.

123
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:17,855
Twenty-six years on the line,
nobody ever busted me
four grades before.

124
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,452
Get in here,
you idiot!

125
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:30,631
Come a little closer.
I wanna get a
better look at you.

126
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:41,846
How's your skin, son?

127
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,216
My skin, sir?

128
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:45,951
Oh, for
Christ's sake.

129
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:48,921
I'm sorry, I don...
Just call me Frank.

130
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,756
Call me Mr. Slade.

131
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:54,591
Call me Colonel,
if you must. Just don't
call me sir.

132
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,727
All right, Colonel.

133
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,033
Simms, Charles.

134
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:02,401
A senior.

135
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:04,269
You on
student aid, Simms?

136
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,931
Yes, I am.

137
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,341
For "student aid"
read "crook."

138
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:13,111
Your father
peddles car telephones
at a 300% markup.

139
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,948
Your mother works
on heavy commission
in a camera store.

140
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,917
Graduated to it
from espresso machines.

141
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:29,151
What are you, dying of
some wasting disease?

142
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,288
No, I'm right...
I'm right here.

143
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,731
I know exactly where
your body is.

144
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:40,073
What I'm lookin' for
is some
indication of a brain.

145
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,599
Too much football
without a helmet?

146
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,477
Hah! Lyndon's line
on Gerry Ford.

147
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:52,651
Deputy Debriefer, Paris,
Peace Talks, '66.

148
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:56,714
Snagged the Silver Star
and a silver bar.
Threw me into G-2.

149
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:58,824
G-2?

150
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,988
Intelligence,
of which you have none.

151
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:07,598
Where you from?

152
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:09,792
Gresham, Oregon,

153
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,071
Colonel.

154
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:15,632
What does your daddy do
in Gresham, Oregon?

155
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:18,076
Hmm?
Count wood chips?

156
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:23,081
My stepfather and my mom
run a convenience store.

157
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:26,143
How convenient.
What time they open?

158
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,187
5:00 a.m.

159
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,246
Close?

160
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:30,756
1:00 a.m.

161
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:32,658
Hard workers.

162
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,559
You got me all
misty-eyed!

163
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,698
So, what are you doing here
in this sparrow-fart town?

164
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,930
I attend Baird.

165
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:47,896
Attend Baird!

166
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:52,010
I know you go
to the Baird school.

167
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:55,047
Point is,
how do you afford it,

168
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:59,747
even with the student aid
and the folks back home
hustlin' corn nuts?

169
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:04,990
I won a Young American
merit scholarship.

170
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,823
Hoo-ah!

171
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:12,120
Glory, glory
Hallelujah

172
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:16,124
Glory, glory
Hallelujah

173
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,532
Who's there?

174
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,938
That little
piece of tail?

175
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,081
Get her outta here!

176
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:39,022
Yeah.

177
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:42,818
Can't believe
they're my blood.

178
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:52,204
IQ of sloths and
the manners of banshees.

179
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:54,806
He's a mechanic,
she's a homemaker.

180
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:57,276
He knows as much about cars
as a beauty queen,

181
00:12:57,277 --> 00:13:00,337
and she bakes cookies,
taste like wing nuts.

182
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,845
As for the tots,
they're twits.

183
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,484
How's your skin, son?
I like my aides
to be presentable.

184
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,324
Well, I...

185
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,020
I've had a few zits.

186
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,663
But my roommate,
he lent me his Clinique

187
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:20,032
because he's from
Chestnut Hill
and he's got...

188
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:22,695
"The History of My Skin,"
by Charles Simms.

189
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,597
You patronizing me,
peewee? Hmm?

190
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:30,104
You givin' me
that old prep school
palaver?

191
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:32,673
Baird School!

192
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:37,649
A bunch of runny-nosed
snots in tweed jackets

193
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,176
all studyin'
to be George Bush.

194
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:44,356
Well...

195
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:47,053
I believe President Bush
went to Andover, Colonel.

196
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,795
You sharpshootin'
me, punk?

197
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,259
Is that what
you're doin'?

198
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,571
Don't you
sharpshoot me.

199
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:02,107
You'll give me 40.

200
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:04,743
Then you're gonna give me
40 more.

201
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:08,480
Then you're gonna
pull K.P.,
the grease pit!

202
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:12,317
I'll rub your nose
in enlisted men's crud

203
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,252
till you don't
know which end is up!

204
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,117
You understand?

205
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:18,657
Yeah.

206
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:19,989
What do you want?

207
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,160
What do you mean,
what do I want?

208
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:23,595
What do you want here?

209
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,030
I want a job.

210
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,769
A job!

211
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,004
Yeah, I want a job
so I can make, you know,

212
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:35,770
my plane fare home
for Christmas.

213
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:39,803
Oh, God,
you're touching!

214
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:55,327
They used to waltz on the banks

215
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:58,764
Of the mighty Mississippi

216
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:02,565
Loving the whole
night through

217
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:07,639
Till the riverboat gambler

218
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,709
Went off to make a killin'

219
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,645
And bring it on back to you

220
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,648
Still here, poormouth?

221
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:17,946
Hmm?

222
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,353
Convenience store,

223
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:22,617
my ass!

224
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:27,918
Hustlin' jalapeno dips
to the appleseeds.

225
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,621
Go on.

226
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,921
Dismissed.

227
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,526
Dismissed!

228
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:48,180
Evangeline

229
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:50,945
Evangeline

230
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,985
Mrs. Rossi?

231
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:56,512
Charlie, we're up here!
Come on up.

232
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:01,416
This is Donny.
Hey, Charlie.

233
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:03,090
Hi.

234
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:06,465
Mrs. Rossi, I got
the feelin' I screwed up.

235
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,900
Oh, you couldn't have.

236
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,502
It was a
bad interview.

237
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:12,471
That was no interview,
Charlie. You're it.

238
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:15,874
You're the only
one that showed up.
You have to take the job.

239
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:20,506
He sleeps a lot. You can
watch television,
call your girlfriend.

240
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,114
I promise you,
an easy 300 bucks.

241
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,709
I don't get
an easy feeling.

242
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,324
His bark is worse
than his bite.

243
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:36,827
He was a great soldier,
a real hero.

244
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:40,465
The man grows on you.

245
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,560
By Sunday night,
you'll be best friends.

246
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,566
Charlie, please.

247
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:49,774
I want to get
away with my husband
for a few days,

248
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,710
and Uncle Frank
won't come with us.

249
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:55,580
Six months ago,
he could sometimes tell
light from dark,

250
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:57,549
but now there's nothing.

251
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,576
I just feel better
having someone else
around just in case.

252
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:08,523
Please?

253
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:12,992
Okay, Mrs. Rossi.

254
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:14,559
Sure.

255
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:17,002
Thank you, Charlie.

256
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:18,436
Come here, you.

257
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,546
There you go.

258
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,914
Chas. Chas, hold up.

259
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,686
How you doin'?
I'm good.

260
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:35,984
That's great.

261
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,615
This can't go out.
This is on reserve.

262
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:43,956
Here's the thing.

263
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:46,822
I need the book tonight

264
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:50,535
for a Thanksgiving quiz
with big-shit Preston
in the morning.

265
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,971
Yeah, I know.
That's why he
put it on reserve.

266
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:54,339
This is our only copy.

267
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,775
Chas, I'm pullin'
an all-nighter.

268
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:59,438
Without that book
I'm dead, okay?

269
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:04,916
If it's not back
by 7:30, it's gonna
be my ass.

270
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,011
Oh, I promise.
I promise.

271
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,919
Got it?
Yeah.

272
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,876
Just a second.
I gotta lock up.

273
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:40,884
Okay.

274
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:45,117
God, can you wait
to get out of this
dump or what?

275
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:53,631
Where you guys
going skiing again?
Sugarloaf or...

276
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,567
It's bush, Chas,
Sugarbush.

277
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:07,445
That's my boys.

278
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:09,481
What are you doin'?

279
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:12,450
Keep your voice down!

280
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:14,786
I'll tell you about it
in the morning.

281
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:18,788
What...

282
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:21,359
Mrs. Hunsaker,
have a nice day?

283
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,128
George, why
all the noise?

284
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:27,632
It's Hunsaker! Go! Go!

285
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,801
I was just
messin' around with Chas.

286
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:31,069
Good evening, Charles.

287
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,435
Hi, Mrs. Hunsaker.

288
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,372
What was that?
I don't know, ma'am.

289
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,147
Who were
those boys?

290
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:43,945
Oh, who knows?
What were they doing?

291
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,878
Charles?

292
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:47,619
Um...

293
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,687
Did you make this
scarf yourself?

294
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,289
No, George,
I bought it.

295
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,092
'Cause it's a beauty.
It really is.
Thank you, George.

296
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:56,824
In case I don't
see you before
the Thanksgiving holidays,

297
00:19:57,263 --> 00:19:58,930
why don't you give me
one of your big hugs?

298
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,432
Oh, George!
Please?

299
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:01,933
Good evening, boys.
Come on.

300
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,334
Goodbye,
Mrs. Hunsaker.

301
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:28,059
Mr. Trask is our
fearless leader,

302
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:32,422
a man of learning,
a voracious reader.

303
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,865
He could recite the lliad
in ancient Greek

304
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:41,371
while fishing for trout
in a rippling creek.

305
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:46,702
Endowed with wisdom,
of judgment sound,

306
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:51,216
nevertheless about him
the questions abound.

307
00:20:57,056 --> 00:21:00,617
How does Mr. Trask
make such wonderful deals?

308
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:04,789
Why did the trustees
buy him Jaguar wheels?

309
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:07,561
He wasn't conniving.

310
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:10,235
He wasn't crass.

311
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:12,602
He merely
puckered his lips

312
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,809
and kissed their ass!

313
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,562
Come on.

314
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:39,130
Come on.

315
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:44,736
One more.

316
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:46,034
One more, come on!

317
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,224
Fuck you!

318
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:17,434
Mr. Simms, Mr. Willis.

319
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:19,196
Hmm.

320
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,941
Mrs. Hunsaker says
that you gentlemen

321
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:24,909
were at a vantage
point last night

322
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,346
to observe who was
responsible for this

323
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:30,678
stunt.

324
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:37,953
Who was it?

325
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:41,116
I really couldn't
tell you, sir.

326
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:45,897
I thought I saw
someone fooling
with the lamppost,

327
00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:50,335
but by the time
I pulled focus,
they were gone.

328
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,701
Mr. Simms?

329
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:55,997
I couldn't say.

330
00:22:58,244 --> 00:23:02,313
That automobile
is not just a
possession of mine.

331
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:07,252
That automobile was
presented to me by
the board of trustees.

332
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:10,321
It is a symbol of
the standard of
excellence

333
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:12,557
for which this
school is known,

334
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:15,288
and I will not
have it tarnished.

335
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:17,728
The automobile?

336
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:21,826
The standard,
Mr. Willis.

337
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:27,396
What's your position,
Mr. Simms?

338
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,641
On what, sir?

339
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:31,906
On preserving the
reputation of Baird.

340
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:33,907
I'm for Baird.

341
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:35,914
Then, who did it?

342
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,377
I really
couldn't say for sure.

343
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:46,582
Very well.

344
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,768
First thing Monday,
I'm convening
a special session

345
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:59,103
of the student-faculty
disciplinary committee.

346
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,873
As this is a matter
which concerns
the whole school,

347
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:04,776
the entire student body
will be present.

348
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:07,412
There will be
no classes,
no activities.

349
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:09,981
Nothing will
transpire at
this institution

350
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:12,917
until that proceeding
is concluded.

351
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:18,419
And if, at that time,
we are no further
along than we are now,

352
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:22,323
I will expel you both.

353
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:30,294
Mr. Willis,
would you excuse us?

354
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:36,366
Have a nice Thanksgiving.

355
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,877
Thank you.
You, too, Mr. Willis.

356
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:41,175
I will.

357
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,584
Mr. Simms,

358
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:54,887
I'm not quite through
with you yet.

359
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:06,504
One of the few perks
of this office is that

360
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:11,636
I am empowered to handle
certain matters on
my own as I see fit.

361
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:15,213
Do you understand?

362
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:16,772
Yes, sir.
Good.

363
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:20,451
The Dean of
Admissions at Harvard
and I have an arrangement.

364
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:23,821
Along with the usual
sheaf of applicants
submitted by Baird,

365
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,890
of which virtually

366
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:28,861
two-thirds are
guaranteed admittance,

367
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:31,653
I add one name,

368
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:36,860
somebody who's a standout
and yet underprivileged.

369
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,338
A student who
cannot afford to pay

370
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:42,205
the board and
tuition in Cambridge.

371
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:48,371
Do you know on whose behalf
I drafted a memo this year?

372
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:50,648
No, sir.

373
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:51,878
You.

374
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,410
You, Mr. Simms.

375
00:25:57,656 --> 00:25:59,886
Now can you tell me
who did it?

376
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:03,918
No, sir, I can't.

377
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:08,164
You take the weekend
to think about it, Mr. Simms.

378
00:26:10,636 --> 00:26:12,468
Good afternoon.

379
00:26:15,474 --> 00:26:16,964
What'd he say?

380
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:19,644
Nothin'.
What do you
mean, nothing?

381
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:21,179
He said the
same thing.

382
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,447
He just said
it over.

383
00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:24,182
You know what
he's doing?

384
00:26:24,183 --> 00:26:26,913
He's good-cop,
bad-coppin' us.

385
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:29,754
He knows I'm old guard.
You're fringe.

386
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:32,349
He's gonna bear down on me
and soft-soap you.

387
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:36,594
Did he try to
soft-soap you?

388
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:37,756
Did he?

389
00:26:38,564 --> 00:26:39,656
No.

390
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,035
Chas, I detect a slight
panic pulse from you.
Are you panicking?

391
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:45,536
Yeah, a little.

392
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:47,699
Come on.
You're on
scholarship, right?

393
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:50,074
Yeah.

394
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:53,170
You're on scholarship
from Oregon at Baird.

395
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:56,709
You're a long way
from home, Chas.

396
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:59,510
What's that got
to do with anything?

397
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:02,420
I don't know how
it works out there.

398
00:27:02,421 --> 00:27:04,088
But how it
works here?

399
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:05,819
We stick together.

400
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:08,459
It's us against them,
no matter what.

401
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,361
We don't cover our ass.

402
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:12,463
We don't tell our parents.

403
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,159
Stonewall everybody!

404
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,168
And above all,

405
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:19,971
never, ever

406
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:23,101
leave any of us
twisting in the wind.

407
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:26,611
And that's it.

408
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:29,380
What does that have
to do with me being
on scholarship?

409
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:31,315
Hey, hey.

410
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:34,081
I'm just tryin' to
bring you up to speed,
kid, that's it.

411
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:36,618
Thanks.

412
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:43,353
I'll tell you what.
Give me a few hours
to figure out the moves,

413
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:45,690
and call me tonight
in Vermont.

414
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:50,768
I'll be at
the Sugarbush lodge,
all right?

415
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:51,930
All right.

416
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:54,873
You all right?

417
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:57,633
Yeah, I guess so.

418
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:00,441
Okay.

419
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:05,383
Try to keep him down
to four drinks a day.

420
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:08,319
If you can keep
him down to 40,
you're doin' good.

421
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,955
We try to water
them down a little.
Do you know how to do that?

422
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:12,924
It's a long ride,
honey.

423
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,560
Get the bags in the car.
I'll be right out.

424
00:28:15,561 --> 00:28:19,190
Mommy, Mommy,
don't forget
Uncle Frank's walk.

425
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,959
Oh, yeah.

426
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:28,035
You have to air him
out a little every day.

427
00:28:29,942 --> 00:28:32,610
Why don't you
go on back there,
get yourself oriented?

428
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:35,672
I'll come out in a minute,
give you telephone
numbers and stuff.

429
00:28:37,616 --> 00:28:39,951
Well, I wouldn't
try a thing like that

430
00:28:39,952 --> 00:28:42,119
unless I knew, would I?

431
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,816
Just let me
speak to her.

432
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:46,257
Hello, beautiful.
Is that you?

433
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:48,317
Yeah,
we spoke yesterday.

434
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:52,763
You have a glass
of wine with lunch?

435
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:54,699
You sound
a little dusky. Hmm.

436
00:28:57,336 --> 00:28:59,236
Just a minute,
sweetheart.

437
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:02,363
You're back, huh?

438
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:05,009
Tenacious!

439
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:08,079
Get out my dress blues.
They're in a garment bag
in the closet.

440
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,714
Check the
top dresser drawer.

441
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:11,315
Take out
the shoulder boards

442
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:13,184
and affix them,
shoulders
right and left,

443
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:15,654
ASAP. That means now.

444
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:18,456
Hello.

445
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:21,392
Sorry to keep you
waiting, sweetheart.

446
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:24,095
I'm not the kind of guy
who likes to rush things,

447
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:27,064
but I'm catchin'
a 4:00 at Logan,
I'm lookin' out my window,

448
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:28,829
and there's
not a taxi in sight.

449
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:31,535
What happened
to Chet?

450
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:33,334
He didn't invest
in a radio yet?

451
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:36,875
Hah! Well,
get your driver on it.

452
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:40,711
Tell him to get
a move on.

453
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:43,238
Yes. Mmm.

454
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:47,918
Some kind of body
has got to go with
that bedroom voice.

455
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,411
One day I'm gonna swing by,
get a better look at it.

456
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:52,216
You bet.

457
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,422
Bye.

458
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:00,298
My Valpak's
underneath the bed.

459
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,799
Get it out.

460
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,360
Put the boards
on the blues
and fold 'em in.

461
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:08,105
Are we going
someplace, Colonel?

462
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:09,767
What business is
that of yours?

463
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:12,710
Don't shrug, imbecile.
I'm blind.

464
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:15,112
Save your body language
for the bimbi.

465
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:17,449
Now, get my gear out.

466
00:30:18,717 --> 00:30:21,083
Francine, get in the car.

467
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,286
It's almost 3:00.
The goddamn Flintstones
haven't left yet.

468
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:28,951
Willie Rossi
must go in the car.

469
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:32,263
Here comes
Mrs. Rossi now.

470
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:33,493
Damn it!

471
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:36,428
She said goodbye to me
three times today.

472
00:30:37,803 --> 00:30:40,137
What has she got,
separation anxiety?

473
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:41,970
Cut her off
at the door.

474
00:30:44,743 --> 00:30:46,472
Hi, honey.
Bye, honey.

475
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:52,676
I wish you were
coming with us.

476
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:54,618
Me, too.

477
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:55,985
Maybe next time.

478
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,193
Drive carefully now.

479
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:03,388
Yeah.

480
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,264
Charlie, this is
where we'll be.

481
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,636
Good luck, Charlie.
Don't let him
drink too much.

482
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:17,365
See you, Charlie.

483
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:20,974
And no 000 numbers.
He loves to talk dirty.

484
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:31,514
All right,
let's get to work.

485
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,699
L- buckles
givin' you trouble?

486
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,004
Never in the
Boy Scouts, sluggo?

487
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:48,773
I made Tenderfoot.

488
00:31:48,774 --> 00:31:50,708
Tenderfoot,
my foot!

489
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:53,007
Convenience store
mama's boy.

490
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:55,045
Here. Let me
take a look
at that.

491
00:31:55,981 --> 00:31:59,383
Touch me again,
I'll kill you,
you little son of a bitch!

492
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:02,143
I touch you.

493
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,553
Understand?

494
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:12,021
My shoulder boards are
in the top dresser drawer.
Get them, son.

495
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,588
The epaulets with
the silver oak leaf.

496
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:34,785
Are these the...

497
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,584
Good.
Taxi come yet?

498
00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:40,491
Colonel,
where are we going?

499
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:42,526
Where are we going?

500
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:44,795
Freak show central.

501
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,765
Where's that?
New York City.

502
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:51,168
That's in New York, son.

503
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:53,160
New York State.

504
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:56,207
Mrs. Rossi didn't say
anything to me
about going anywhere.

505
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:57,436
She forgot.

506
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,344
Should we call her,
'cause I...

507
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:02,012
You kidding me?

508
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:04,148
Call her? By the time
they get to Albany

509
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,816
in that Hupmobile
he drives

510
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,047
it'll be opening day
at Saratoga.

511
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,454
Colonel, I can't go
to New York City.

512
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:11,582
Why not?

513
00:33:12,891 --> 00:33:14,290
New York...

514
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,694
New York's too
much responsibility.

515
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:18,596
Ah, responsibility!

516
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:21,398
I had a lot
of 17-year-olds
in my first platoon.

517
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:23,629
I took care of them.
All set!

518
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:27,334
How do I look?

519
00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:30,969
Tickets. Money.

520
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:32,838
Speech.

521
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:37,012
Old Washington joke
from my days with Lyndon.

522
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:41,385
I knew I could
count on transportation.

523
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:42,717
Are you ready?

524
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:47,817
This is not Panmunjom.
A simple yes will do.

525
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:50,622
Um...
Good! Here you go.

526
00:33:50,996 --> 00:33:52,554
Come on!
Hop to, son!

527
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,695
You're in front of me.
Let's go.

528
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:59,400
Tomster,
come here, boy.

529
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:02,606
Come on.

530
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:04,642
Here, Tomster, come on.

531
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:06,941
Tomster, Tomster. Yeah.

532
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:11,274
Remember, when in doubt,

533
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:13,110
fuck.

534
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:18,889
Good afternoon, sir.
Where's our destination?

535
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:22,126
Our destination
New York City,
home of the brave!

536
00:34:22,127 --> 00:34:24,194
We got two for
the shuttle
to New York.

537
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:27,231
I'm not shuttling anywhere.
Look at those tickets.
First class.

538
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:29,033
Yes, sir,
first class.

539
00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:31,101
Colonel,
you bought me
a ticket?

540
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:32,870
I never said I'd
go to New York.

541
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:34,905
What are you,
some kind of
chicken-shit,

542
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,907
sticks to job
description only?

543
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,842
Gate 46, sir.

544
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:40,444
As you were, son.

545
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:42,046
Thank you, sir.

546
00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:43,480
Which way's the door?

547
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:47,751
Are you blind?
Are you blind?

548
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,086
Of course not.

549
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,556
Then why do you keep grabbin'
my goddamn arm?

550
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:54,220
I take your arm.

551
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,831
I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry.

552
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:03,467
How would you know,
watchin' MTV all your life?

553
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:05,562
Gentlemen?
Yeah!

554
00:35:08,173 --> 00:35:10,266
Jack Daniels.
You bet.

555
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:14,144
And Diet Slice.

556
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:15,479
The old Diet Slice.

557
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,947
And a water.

558
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,144
Thank you,
Daphne.
Certainly, sir.

559
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,651
Mmm!
How did you
know her name?

560
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,625
Well, she's
wearin' Floris.

561
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:36,432
That's an
English cologne.

562
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:40,935
But her voice is
California chickie.

563
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,868
Now, California chickie
bucking for English lady.

564
00:35:45,677 --> 00:35:47,110
I call her Daphne.

565
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:53,011
Oh, big things may
happen to that
little thing of yours.

566
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:56,516
Look, Colonel,

567
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:00,657
I'll get you to New York,
all right?
Uh-huh.

568
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:03,423
Then I'm gonna have
to turn around and come back.

569
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,293
Well, Chuck,
you gotta do
what you gotta do.

570
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:08,789
Charlie, all right?

571
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:10,667
Or Charles.

572
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:13,037
Sorry.
I can't blame you, though.

573
00:36:13,038 --> 00:36:14,300
Chuck is a...

574
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:20,411
So, why are we
going to New York?

575
00:36:20,412 --> 00:36:23,973
All information will be given
on a need-to-know basis.

576
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:26,509
Hoo-ah!

577
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:29,514
Where's Daphne?
Let's get her down here.

578
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,049
She's in the back.

579
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:36,193
A tail's in the tail.

580
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:38,756
Hah!

581
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,131
Oh, but I still smell her.

582
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,230
Women.

583
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:49,300
What can you say?

584
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:52,266
Who made 'em?

585
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:55,970
God must have been
a fuckin' genius.

586
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:01,717
The hair...

587
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,250
They say the hair
is everything, you know.

588
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:11,057
Have you ever
buried your nose
in a mountain of curis

589
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:14,625
and just wanted
to go to sleep forever?

590
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:17,835
Or lips,

591
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,206
and when they touched,
yours were like

592
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:25,370
that first swallow of wine

593
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,901
after you just crossed
the desert.

594
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,484
Tits!

595
00:37:33,485 --> 00:37:34,679
Hoo-ah.

596
00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:38,179
Big ones, little ones,

597
00:37:39,124 --> 00:37:41,525
nipples staring
right out at you

598
00:37:41,526 --> 00:37:43,654
like secret searchlights.

599
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:45,925
Mmm.

600
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,728
And legs...

601
00:37:51,236 --> 00:37:54,228
I don't care if
they're Greek columns

602
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,472
or secondhand Steinways.

603
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,409
What's between 'em,

604
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,171
passport to heaven.

605
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:06,642
I need a drink.

606
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:11,987
Yes, Mr. Simms,

607
00:38:13,992 --> 00:38:18,292
there's only two syllables
in this whole wide
world worth hearing.

608
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:25,097
Pussy.

609
00:38:26,171 --> 00:38:27,468
Hah!

610
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:30,908
Are you listening to me, son?
I'm givin' you pearis here.

611
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:34,711
I guess you
really like women.

612
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:37,238
Oh, above all things!

613
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:46,556
A very, very
distant second

614
00:38:48,593 --> 00:38:49,890
is a Ferrari.

615
00:38:57,769 --> 00:38:58,895
Charlie?

616
00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:03,170
Give me your hand.

617
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:08,277
This is just the start
of your education, son.

618
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,390
Hoo-ah.

619
00:39:25,964 --> 00:39:27,431
Where are we?

620
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:28,899
Where are we, eh?

621
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:32,528
The cynosure of
all things civilized.

622
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:34,637
The Waldorf-Astoria.

623
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:39,443
The last time I
was here, Charlie,
was with a G-2 from Brussels.

624
00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:40,944
Had a Ferrari.

625
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:44,314
Every day I
held the door open
for the fucker.

626
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:46,583
Never even
offered me a ride.

627
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:48,585
Well, fuck him.

628
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:50,680
He's dead and I'm blind.

629
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:56,093
Spread the word.

630
00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:57,327
Thank you, sir.

631
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:59,363
And the intelligence
will be forthcoming?

632
00:39:59,364 --> 00:40:00,597
Sir?

633
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:01,998
On the
escort scene.

634
00:40:02,667 --> 00:40:04,533
Yes, sir.

635
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:07,070
And welcome to
the Waldorf.

636
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,403
Gracias, amigo.

637
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,775
Puerto Ricans.

638
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,608
Always made
the best infantrymen.

639
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,245
Oh!

640
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,521
I'm home again.

641
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:33,724
Give me an inventory
on this, will you?

642
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:42,039
All right, where am I,
in Asia?

643
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,242
He told me the phone
was on the other side
of the room, didn't he?

644
00:40:45,243 --> 00:40:46,608
By the windows?

645
00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:49,443
It's right here.

646
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:52,547
Okay.

647
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:54,614
We're in business.

648
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,922
Get me the Oak Room.

649
00:41:02,527 --> 00:41:04,689
How's that inventory
comin'?

650
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:08,665
There's Jim Beam

651
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:11,234
and Early Times.

652
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:13,067
Quartermaster's
on the take again.

653
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:16,235
Hello. Is Sheldon
or Mack there?

654
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:20,477
This is Lieutenant
Colonel Frank Slade.

655
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,846
I used to be a regular.
I used to come in
with a General Garbisch.

656
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:29,219
Yes, that's
probably because he's at
Arlington, six feet under.

657
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,713
Listen up.
I want a table for two,
and I don't mean Siberia,

658
00:41:33,191 --> 00:41:34,283
15.

659
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:37,494
Clear them little
bottles off.

660
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:41,331
And when I get
off the phone,
call up Hyman.

661
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:44,268
Tell him I want it
wall to wall
with John Daniels.

662
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:47,738
Don't you mean
Jack Daniels?

663
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:51,608
He may be Jack to you, son.
But when you've known him
as long as I have...

664
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:53,076
That's a joke. Hello!

665
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:56,179
This is Lieutenant
Colonel Frank Slade.
I would like a limo,

666
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,512
00.

667
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,490
What are you drinkin'?

668
00:42:06,491 --> 00:42:09,726
Nothing, thanks.
I don't use it.

669
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:11,559
What's useful about it?

670
00:42:13,131 --> 00:42:16,430
I don't know.
Listen, Colonel,
I have to get going.

671
00:42:17,335 --> 00:42:18,935
Where you goin'?

672
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:20,871
Back to school.
I've got some real

673
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:22,999
important stuff I
have to take care of.

674
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:25,399
Very well.

675
00:42:26,411 --> 00:42:29,679
But I never let
my aides leave
on an empty stomach.

676
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,216
You'll dine with me
and then my driver
will transport you

677
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:36,278
to the airport for
the Boston shuttle
departing at 2200 hours.

678
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:41,257
Meanwhile,
unpack my bag.

679
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:43,386
I'm gonna christen
the latrine.

680
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:47,898
What's your name,
driver?

681
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:49,099
Manny, sir.

682
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,968
Manny. The bellhops
at the Waldorf,

683
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:54,137
are they any good
at getting escorts?

684
00:42:54,138 --> 00:42:56,206
I wouldn't know, sir.

685
00:42:56,207 --> 00:42:57,741
What would you know?

686
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:59,643
About what?

687
00:42:59,644 --> 00:43:01,339
About you-know-what?

688
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,582
Maybe I could
manage something.

689
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,018
I'm talkin'
top of the line, now.

690
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:09,748
Let me think
about this, sir.

691
00:43:18,463 --> 00:43:20,997
What's the matter
with you?

692
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:22,299
With me?

693
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:25,001
Yeah. Car feels heavy.
You know why?

694
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:27,870
You got the fuckin'
weight of the world
on your shoulders.

695
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:34,678
I got a little problem
at school, that's all.

696
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:36,046
Spit it out!

697
00:43:36,047 --> 00:43:37,714
It's not a big deal,
all right?

698
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:39,783
Where we going,
the Oak Room
or somethin'?

699
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:42,586
If it's not a big deal,
why did you say
real important stuff?

700
00:43:42,587 --> 00:43:44,754
What are you doin',
banging the dean's daughter?

701
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:45,882
Hah!

702
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:49,960
I'm just in
a little trouble.

703
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:51,394
What kind of trouble?

704
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:54,064
I saw some guys
doing something.

705
00:43:56,934 --> 00:44:00,336
To tell or not to tell,
or it's your ass.

706
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:02,201
Hmm?

707
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:05,408
How'd you know that?

708
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:08,038
I'm a wizard.
Give me the details,
come on.

709
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,319
There's this guy
at school named Harry.

710
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,787
He's this
real rich kid,

711
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:20,155
and he like,
runs the show.

712
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:22,255
Who else?

713
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:28,064
There's another guy, George,
but George didn't do anything.

714
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:32,035
George and I saw
Harry and his buddies
doin' somethin'.

715
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:34,170
Now, the folks at Baird,

716
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:37,300
they know you and George
can identify
the guilty parties?

717
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:42,379
Yeah, they think we can.

718
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,348
George is
a friend of yours.

719
00:44:45,483 --> 00:44:47,317
He's not a friend,
but he's all right.

720
00:44:47,318 --> 00:44:48,717
You trust him?

721
00:44:49,587 --> 00:44:50,816
Yeah, I guess so.

722
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:53,422
He's on
scholarship, too?

723
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:55,856
No, why?

724
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:59,329
We got George,
we got Harry,
we got trouble.

725
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:02,232
They're rich, you're poor.
You wanna get rich.

726
00:45:02,233 --> 00:45:05,702
You wanna graduate Baird,
become a rich
big shot like them.

727
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,203
Am I right?
No.

728
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:09,002
It's not that
way at all.

729
00:45:09,607 --> 00:45:11,132
Okay, Charlie!

730
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:15,502
Here we are, gentlemen,
the Oak Room.

731
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:17,572
The Oak Room!

732
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:21,184
Bring us a menu and
double Jack Daniels
on the rocks.

733
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:23,186
Charlie, sit down here.

734
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:25,952
Perhaps you'll feel more
comfortable in this, sir.

735
00:45:30,995 --> 00:45:34,329
You look great!

736
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:40,597
Thank you.

737
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:44,902
Here we are, Charlie,
the Oak Room.

738
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:48,145
Now, read me
the bill of fare.

739
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:50,437
Let's see.

740
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:53,950
You got the Oak Room
burger and fries for $24.

741
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:55,652
Where's the booze?

742
00:45:55,653 --> 00:45:57,287
Flowin' like
mud around here.

743
00:45:57,288 --> 00:45:58,756
A $24 hamburger?

744
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:01,554
What's the story?

745
00:46:01,726 --> 00:46:03,193
What story?

746
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,495
Are you a rich
miser or something?

747
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:08,264
Hah!

748
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,800
No, I'm just
your average blind man.

749
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:12,531
Your average
blind man.

750
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:16,268
How do you plan on paying
for all this stuff?

751
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:18,774
Crisp, clean dollars.

752
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:20,377
American.

753
00:46:20,378 --> 00:46:22,346
I saved up my
disability checks.

754
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:25,749
How much did you save?
I mean, we flew first class,

755
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:29,152
we're at the Waldorf-Astoria,
a $24 hamburger restaurant.

756
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:31,087
All part of
a plan, Charlie.

757
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:32,856
You want to let
me in on it?

758
00:46:32,857 --> 00:46:35,692
Why should I?
You're not interested.
You don't give a shit!

759
00:46:35,693 --> 00:46:40,130
You're leavin' on that
last shuttle
out of LaGuardia.

760
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:41,894
Hmm? Ooh!

761
00:46:43,701 --> 00:46:46,534
You got 15 minutes, son.
I don't think
you're gonna make it.

762
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:49,372
Unless the Oak Room
keeps some

763
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:52,108
complimentary
helicopter on the roof.

764
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:53,873
No, sir. No!

765
00:46:54,912 --> 00:46:56,846
You're here till tomorrow.

766
00:46:58,249 --> 00:47:00,650
You said the last shuttle
leaves at 2200 hours.

767
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,585
That's 10:00, right?

768
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:05,117
Last I heard, yeah.

769
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,416
It's only ·:30.

770
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:09,952
I lied. Leaves at 0:00.

771
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,061
It leaves at 0:00?

772
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:13,891
Calm down. Calm down.

773
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:19,235
Ahh! The truth is,
Charlie,

774
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:24,800
I need a guide dog
to help me execute my plan.

775
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:26,567
What plan?

776
00:47:27,978 --> 00:47:29,674
You have a right to know.

777
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:34,113
It's not really a plan,
Charlie. It's sort of a...

778
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:36,654
More like a tour,

779
00:47:37,254 --> 00:47:39,689
a little tour
of pleasures.

780
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:44,089
Stay in a first-class hotel,
eat an agreeable meal,

781
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:47,125
drink a nice
glass of wine,

782
00:47:48,733 --> 00:47:50,433
see my big brother.

783
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:53,203
Nothing like family,
you know.

784
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:57,163
And then, make love
to a terrific woman.

785
00:47:59,477 --> 00:48:00,910
After that...

786
00:48:06,851 --> 00:48:08,114
Yeah?

787
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:15,014
I'm gonna lie down on
my big, beautiful bed
at the Waldorf

788
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:16,920
and blow my brains out.

789
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:22,665
May I tell you
our specials?

790
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:24,157
You may, sir.

791
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,703
Tonight we have
charred venison with

792
00:48:26,704 --> 00:48:29,139
buckwheat spaetzle
and green peppercorn.

793
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:32,876
Grilled veal paillards,
tomato tapenade,
and roasted eggplants.

794
00:48:32,877 --> 00:48:34,811
Get me a napkin.
My mouth's watering.

795
00:48:34,812 --> 00:48:37,113
If you would like our
cr·me souffl· for dessert,

796
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:39,115
it would be a good
idea to order now.

797
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:43,076
Yes, on the souffl·.
Give us a half a minute
on the rest.

798
00:48:43,454 --> 00:48:44,922
Very good, sir.

799
00:48:49,193 --> 00:48:51,127
I'm leaning
towards the spaetzle.

800
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:54,531
Colonel Slade...
Charlie, rolls on the table?

801
00:48:54,532 --> 00:48:55,799
Give 'em to me.

802
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,101
You should
try these rolls, Charlie.

803
00:48:58,102 --> 00:49:01,704
I used to dream about them
when I was at Fort Huachuca.

804
00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:04,474
Colonel Slade...
Bread's no good
west of the Colorado.

805
00:49:04,475 --> 00:49:06,342
Water's too alkaline.

806
00:49:06,343 --> 00:49:09,108
Colonel Slade,
did you say...

807
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:11,311
Did I hear you right?

808
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:14,482
You said you're gonna
kill yourself?

809
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:16,453
No.

810
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:18,422
I said I was gonna
blow my brains out.

811
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:21,791
Try one of these
rolls, Charlie.

812
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,761
I buttered it for you.

813
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:25,995
I don't want a roll,
all right?

814
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:27,760
Okay. Have a radish!

815
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:29,963
Hah!

816
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:35,538
Hello! Bring me
a double Jack Daniels
on the rocks.

817
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:36,836
Yes, sir.
Right away.

818
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,345
Please, don't do that.

819
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:46,107
Don't do that.

820
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:53,883
Hmm.

821
00:49:57,228 --> 00:49:59,025
What a marvelous place.

822
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,131
Okay.

823
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:10,073
Yeah.

824
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:13,434
Your billet is here.

825
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:17,003
You'll find bedding
in the closet on the shelf.

826
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:20,250
In the morning,
the area will be

827
00:50:20,251 --> 00:50:22,151
returned to
sitting-room mode

828
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:24,451
no later than
0700 hours.

829
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:29,924
What was that?

830
00:50:32,596 --> 00:50:33,825
Nothing.

831
00:50:34,899 --> 00:50:37,891
Next time
snap it out!

832
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:44,437
Thumb to palm, index finger
through little digit,
smartly aligned,

833
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:48,370
sharp to the hairline,
down!

834
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:55,418
Too many men,
far better than you,

835
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:57,387
have executed
that courtesy.

836
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:01,150
And if you're smart,
you won't try it again.

837
00:51:05,296 --> 00:51:09,665
This bat has
got sharper radar
than the Nautilus.

838
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:12,636
Don't fuck with me,
Charlie.

839
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:26,239
See you get
a good night's
sleep, son.

840
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:41,130
It's a lovely day today

841
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:44,067
So, whatever you gotta do

842
00:51:44,068 --> 00:51:47,299
You got a lovely day
to do it in, that's true

843
00:51:53,811 --> 00:51:55,802
Good morning, Charlie.

844
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,844
Good morning.

845
00:52:00,184 --> 00:52:02,051
This is Sofia, Charlie.

846
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:04,420
She's a magician
with a needle.

847
00:52:04,421 --> 00:52:07,523
Sofia's workin' me up
a little Glen Plaid number,

848
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:10,187
and I've asked her if
she'd put something
together for you.

849
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:13,096
I don't need
any clothes, Colonel.

850
00:52:13,097 --> 00:52:16,157
Standard issue
for an upscale
urban assignment.

851
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:19,135
You don't like the clothes,
Charlie,
on completion of duty,

852
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,161
you can give 'em away.

853
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:24,907
Juice, coffee,
and other assorted goodies
on the trolley over there.

854
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:27,138
Get yourself up,
get yourself together.

855
00:52:28,245 --> 00:52:31,414
It's a great day
for singin' a song

856
00:52:31,415 --> 00:52:34,851
And it's a great day
for movin' along

857
00:52:34,852 --> 00:52:37,520
And it's a great day
from morning to night

858
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:39,512
And it's a great day

859
00:52:40,958 --> 00:52:42,687
For everybody's plight

860
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:51,167
How are you feeling
today, Colonel?

861
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:52,535
Super!

862
00:52:52,536 --> 00:52:54,170
Superior!

863
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:55,764
Superfluous!

864
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:59,506
Young Sofie here
is working Thanksgiving

865
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,178
because she's trying to
put herself through college.

866
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:05,314
I told her, "My young friend
Charlie's headed for college."

867
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:06,916
Excuse me.

868
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:08,217
Where you goin'?

869
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:09,919
I need to use
the phone.

870
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,150
What's wrong with
the phones in here?

871
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,390
I don't want
to disturb you.

872
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:16,951
You're not disturbing me.
Make your call.

873
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:18,795
I'd kind of like
to be private.

874
00:53:18,796 --> 00:53:20,457
Stay out of my room!

875
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:23,758
This is as private
as you're gonna get.

876
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:30,898
But if
you've got somethin'
that must be done

877
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:35,145
And it can only
be done by one

878
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:38,209
Sofia,

879
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:42,275
what are the chances
of suitin' you
up sometime?

880
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:46,981
Sugarbush Lodge.
George Willis, please.

881
00:53:49,793 --> 00:53:50,993
Hello.

882
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:52,587
George! Hey, it's Charlie.

883
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:56,293
Hey, Chas.
Next year you gotta
come up with us.

884
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:59,669
White powder on
a base of snow bunnies.

885
00:54:01,305 --> 00:54:03,398
Chas, are you there?

886
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:05,842
Yeah, I'm here.

887
00:54:05,843 --> 00:54:08,277
You told me to call
you for the moves.

888
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:09,612
All right.

889
00:54:09,613 --> 00:54:13,015
For now, the move's
no move, status quo.

890
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:14,817
Everything's
the way we left it.

891
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:16,286
How did we leave it?

892
00:54:17,121 --> 00:54:20,113
See no evil,
hear no eviI.

893
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:23,326
You know
what I mean, Chas?

894
00:54:24,695 --> 00:54:27,562
Yeah. See no evil,
hear no evil.

895
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:32,101
Okay, then,
walk like you talk.

896
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,332
All right, bye.

897
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:37,070
George Willis, huh?

898
00:54:38,075 --> 00:54:39,235
Yeah.

899
00:54:39,977 --> 00:54:41,544
George Willis.

900
00:54:41,545 --> 00:54:44,810
That makes his
father probably
George Willis, Senior.

901
00:54:45,883 --> 00:54:47,884
Charlie, I ask you,

902
00:54:47,885 --> 00:54:51,888
what do you think
big George is gonna feel
about little George

903
00:54:51,889 --> 00:54:54,949
seeing no evil,
hearing no evil?

904
00:54:57,494 --> 00:54:59,622
Well, we're not gonna
tell our parents.

905
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:02,731
We're just gonna keep it
between ourselves.

906
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,267
Oh, George isn't gonna tell
his father about this thing!

907
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:08,271
Damn decent of him.

908
00:55:10,007 --> 00:55:12,141
Scusi, Colonnello.
Prego.

909
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,906
I love it
when you hurt me.

910
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:17,346
Tell me now,
Charlie.

911
00:55:17,347 --> 00:55:21,307
This George Willis, Jr.,
what's his father do?

912
00:55:22,286 --> 00:55:23,853
I don't really know.

913
00:55:23,854 --> 00:55:25,686
Well, I'm gonna tell you.

914
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:27,924
When George Willis, Senior,

915
00:55:27,925 --> 00:55:30,726
isn't busy as
a million-dollar man
for Aetna Casualty...

916
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:32,962
Or is it
New England distributor

917
00:55:32,963 --> 00:55:34,597
for the Chrysler
Corporation?

918
00:55:34,598 --> 00:55:38,592
He concerns himself
with his young son,
George Willis, Jr.

919
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:42,038
George isn't going
to say anything
to his father.

920
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:43,802
Oh, Charlie.

921
00:55:44,241 --> 00:55:46,576
Big George is gonna
wind up little George,

922
00:55:46,577 --> 00:55:49,679
and little George
is gonna sing
like a canary.

923
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,171
And if you're hip, kid,
you're gonna hop to, too.

924
00:55:52,583 --> 00:55:54,784
You've got this
all figured out,
don't you?

925
00:55:54,785 --> 00:55:57,086
It don't take no
Young American merit

926
00:55:57,087 --> 00:55:58,988
scholarship to
figure this one out.

927
00:55:58,989 --> 00:56:01,090
Charlie,
you had a little life,

928
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:03,192
so you decided
to go to the
Baird school

929
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,560
to put yourself
in the market
for a big one.

930
00:56:05,963 --> 00:56:07,930
Now, in order to stay
in the running,

931
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:10,992
you're gonna have
to tell these people
what they want to know.

932
00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:13,636
You think so?

933
00:56:13,637 --> 00:56:15,104
Are we finished, Sofia?

934
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:16,766
Yes.
Grazie. Grazie.
Andate.

935
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:21,434
Charlie,

936
00:56:22,613 --> 00:56:24,843
if you don't sing now,

937
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:28,951
you're gonna end up,
not only shelving biscuits

938
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:31,988
in some convenience store
in the Oregon 'burbs,

939
00:56:31,989 --> 00:56:34,924
but probably the last
word you'll ever hear
yourself say

940
00:56:34,925 --> 00:56:37,226
just before you croak,
gonna be,

941
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:41,097
"Have a nice day
and come back soon."

942
00:56:41,098 --> 00:56:42,999
Sofia!

943
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,867
Measure up
Charlie, here, pronto.

944
00:56:44,868 --> 00:56:46,802
We got a date
for Thanksgiving.

945
00:56:47,471 --> 00:56:48,734
We got a date?

946
00:56:49,006 --> 00:56:50,837
My brother's place.

947
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:54,137
W.R. Slade,
White Plains, New York.

948
00:56:54,811 --> 00:56:57,212
Colonel, I can't go with you
to your brother's place.

949
00:56:57,347 --> 00:57:00,340
I mean, I should be
getting back to school.

950
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:07,023
Well, you gotta have
Thanksgiving somewhere.

951
00:57:07,024 --> 00:57:09,191
I mean, eats and treats.

952
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:11,024
I can use
the company, Charlie.

953
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:15,998
All right.

954
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:17,566
Does he know
I'm comin'?

955
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:19,035
He doesn't know
I'm comin'.

956
00:57:19,036 --> 00:57:21,137
But wait till you see
the look on his face

957
00:57:21,138 --> 00:57:22,538
when I walk
through the door.

958
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:24,098
Oh, he loves me!

959
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:30,346
Oh, Charlie,
about your
little problem,

960
00:57:30,347 --> 00:57:33,015
there are two kinds
of people in this world:

961
00:57:33,016 --> 00:57:35,418
Those who stand up
and face the music,

962
00:57:35,419 --> 00:57:37,320
and those who
run for cover.

963
00:57:37,321 --> 00:57:38,955
Cover's better.

964
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:41,157
Okay, Sofia, suit him up!

965
00:57:41,158 --> 00:57:42,785
Make him pretty.

966
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:00,835
Careful.

967
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:03,511
Should I ring it?
Yeah.

968
00:58:12,923 --> 00:58:15,187
Yes?
Yes!

969
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:16,758
Who is this?

970
00:58:17,127 --> 00:58:18,617
It's Randy.

971
00:58:18,795 --> 00:58:20,627
Randy? You new?

972
00:58:21,698 --> 00:58:23,165
I'm your nephew.

973
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,601
Hah! Here I am!

974
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:27,737
Your sister's been
hoarding me
long enough.

975
00:58:27,738 --> 00:58:30,707
Thought it's time
to spread the
riches around.

976
00:58:31,141 --> 00:58:33,476
Uncle Frank.
Gloria!

977
00:58:33,477 --> 00:58:35,445
Gail.
Of course.

978
00:58:36,246 --> 00:58:39,148
Say hello to the potluck
party from New York City.

979
00:58:39,149 --> 00:58:42,618
Good old Uncle
Frank and this here
with him is Charlie Simms,

980
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:45,521
star halfback of the
Baird football team.

981
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:49,390
They not only beat
Exeter and Groton,
but Aquinas High School, too.

982
00:58:50,327 --> 00:58:52,161
Where's your
miserable father?

983
00:58:52,162 --> 00:58:54,497
Wait! No, no.
Let's surprise him.

984
00:58:54,498 --> 00:58:58,093
Give that fat
heart of his
an attack. Willie!

985
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:01,571
Ho, Willie!

986
00:59:14,785 --> 00:59:16,275
Hello, Frank.

987
00:59:16,853 --> 00:59:19,155
How you doin'?
Okay.

988
00:59:19,156 --> 00:59:20,555
Here's my hand.

989
00:59:22,192 --> 00:59:24,422
Charlie, meet
W.R. Slade.

990
00:59:24,594 --> 00:59:25,961
Nice to meet you, sir.

991
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:28,798
The original
bulging briefcase man.

992
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:31,667
Gretchen, I smell
those prunes!

993
00:59:31,668 --> 00:59:33,803
We talkin'
turkey Marbella?
Yes, we are.

994
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,707
Let's have a whiff.
Come on.

995
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:40,676
You know, I always
had a sneaker for you.
Come here.

996
00:59:44,948 --> 00:59:47,349
Where are you, Garry?
I heard you cough.
Right here.

997
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:48,943
Who are you again?

998
00:59:49,219 --> 00:59:54,023
I'm here at
the Waldorf with...
Is it your brother?

999
00:59:54,024 --> 00:59:56,592
W.R.'s final issue.
How ya doin', son?

1000
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:59,085
Yeah, sure,
Frank's my brother.
Who the hell are you?

1001
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:01,931
I'm takin' care of him
for the weekend.

1002
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:03,092
Charlie.

1003
01:00:05,135 --> 01:00:06,125
Sorry.

1004
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:08,329
Where's the booze?

1005
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:10,039
Flowin' like mud here.

1006
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:13,669
To tell the truth,
the Colonel's not well,
I don't think.

1007
01:00:14,144 --> 01:00:15,373
Not well?

1008
01:00:15,745 --> 01:00:17,737
I think he's
a little lonely.

1009
01:00:18,315 --> 01:00:20,549
Why didn't you
take him to your
family's for dinner?

1010
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:22,041
I heard that!

1011
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:25,454
I heard that.

1012
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:28,691
Pay no attention
to him, Charlie.
That's just big-brother talk.

1013
01:00:28,692 --> 01:00:31,393
He's been watching out
for me since day one.

1014
01:00:31,394 --> 01:00:35,195
Bailed me out of more trouble
than he'd like to remember.

1015
01:00:36,399 --> 01:00:38,265
Here, let me
take your coat.

1016
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:42,605
I meant to pick up
some vino on my way up,
but I blew it.

1017
01:00:42,606 --> 01:00:45,207
I'll send you the
Rothschild again
for Christmas,

1018
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:47,676
only let's see how
Thanksgiving goes.

1019
01:00:47,677 --> 01:00:49,178
I'll set two
more places.

1020
01:00:49,179 --> 01:00:50,646
Here's
your drink, Frank.

1021
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,515
Thank you, Randy.

1022
01:00:52,516 --> 01:00:54,711
Still with
Snow Queen Sugar?

1023
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:58,880
Snow Flake.
Why do you always
get that wrong?

1024
01:00:59,256 --> 01:01:01,357
Because it's not
important for me
to get it right.

1025
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:02,985
What are you doing
there now?

1026
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,560
I'm vice president
for marketing.

1027
01:01:05,762 --> 01:01:07,730
Hoo-ah!
Congratulations!

1028
01:01:08,632 --> 01:01:10,132
Sugar is shit, though.

1029
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:13,402
I told General Abrams,
install honey in
the commissaries.

1030
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:15,404
If K-50s didn't
blow your brains out,

1031
01:01:15,405 --> 01:01:17,206
sugar, sure as shit,
was gonna.

1032
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,709
Why don't we
all sit down?
Ooh.

1033
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:24,580
Mitsouki. Rhymes
with nookie.
Be careful.

1034
01:01:24,581 --> 01:01:27,416
When the wife
gets restless,
the wife gets racy.

1035
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:29,084
Well, let's
go and eat,
shall we?

1036
01:01:29,085 --> 01:01:30,519
By all means.

1037
01:01:32,088 --> 01:01:33,822
Thank you, Charlie.

1038
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:37,993
Where you
wanna sit, Frank?
At the head again?

1039
01:01:37,994 --> 01:01:41,760
Any old card table
will do. This is fine.

1040
01:01:43,667 --> 01:01:45,134
Where was I?

1041
01:01:45,135 --> 01:01:48,437
So, I wake up.
It's 4:00 in the morning.
I don't know who I'm with

1042
01:01:48,438 --> 01:01:50,805
or why I'm there,
or where I am.

1043
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:54,242
What am I gonna do?
I got this Asian flower

1044
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:58,648
on one hand,
all giggly and dewy-like,

1045
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:03,118
and this hard-boiled
Navy nurse outta Omaha,
on the other.

1046
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:06,885
We're three across
the bed, not a stitch
of clothes on.

1047
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:08,756
It comes to me.

1048
01:02:09,826 --> 01:02:14,161
Let east meet west.
We'll build a
golden bridge.

1049
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:19,225
I felt like I'd just joined
the corps of engineers!

1050
01:02:25,342 --> 01:02:27,003
We all still here?

1051
01:02:27,944 --> 01:02:29,935
It's a
beautiful story.

1052
01:02:32,349 --> 01:02:36,151
Do you always enjoy
shocking people,
Uncle Frank?

1053
01:02:36,152 --> 01:02:37,319
Honey...

1054
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,822
I didn't know
you were so
easily shocked, Randy.

1055
01:02:39,823 --> 01:02:42,124
I admire your
sensibilities,
I'm touched.

1056
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:45,194
Dad, remember the time
you persuaded Frank

1057
01:02:45,195 --> 01:02:47,363
to go to the kennel?

1058
01:02:47,364 --> 01:02:48,497
What about it?

1059
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:50,833
He almost put
the seeing eye dog business
outta business.

1060
01:02:50,834 --> 01:02:52,101
Cool it, Randy.

1061
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:53,968
It's over and done with.

1062
01:02:54,404 --> 01:02:56,338
Indeed it is, Garry.

1063
01:02:56,339 --> 01:02:58,540
Indeed it is.
So is dinner.

1064
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:00,209
Charlie, what time
you have?

1065
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:01,777
I think we better
be gettin' back.

1066
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:04,947
You ever given
any thought to
a Braille watch, Frank?

1067
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:06,048
Randy...

1068
01:03:06,049 --> 01:03:09,652
Stevie Wonder wears one,
or do you rank on him, too?

1069
01:03:09,653 --> 01:03:10,853
Honey, please.

1070
01:03:10,854 --> 01:03:13,255
It's all right, Gloria.
I enjoy Randy's
observations.

1071
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:15,384
My wife's name
is Gail, Frank.

1072
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:17,426
Can you hear that?
Gail.

1073
01:03:17,427 --> 01:03:19,725
Excuse me.
Gail.

1074
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:23,432
Gail strikes me as
a very beautiful woman,

1075
01:03:23,433 --> 01:03:26,268
but, you know,
there's a little
tension in her voice.

1076
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:29,104
I don't know what it is.
It could be one
of two things,

1077
01:03:29,105 --> 01:03:31,734
either Gail is nervous
or unsatisfied.

1078
01:03:33,977 --> 01:03:35,644
What's your point,
Uncle Frank?

1079
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:37,179
You ought to
go down on her.

1080
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:39,515
Cut it out, Frank,
will ya?

1081
01:03:39,516 --> 01:03:41,550
You've gotten
so wrapped up
in sugar,

1082
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:43,752
you forgotten
the taste of
real honey!

1083
01:03:43,753 --> 01:03:45,287
Frank, for
God's sake!

1084
01:03:45,288 --> 01:03:46,455
Hear that voice?

1085
01:03:46,456 --> 01:03:48,090
There's fire
under that dress.

1086
01:03:48,091 --> 01:03:50,292
Will you cut it out?
Just get the fuck
outta here.

1087
01:03:50,293 --> 01:03:52,328
Hoo-ah!
Get in your limousine.

1088
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:56,465
Go down to the Bowery.
Get with the other fucking
drunks, where you belong!

1089
01:03:56,466 --> 01:03:57,633
Wait a minute.

1090
01:03:57,634 --> 01:03:59,501
What?
Can you take it easy?

1091
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:00,669
What for?

1092
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:04,163
You want me to lay off him,
Chucky, 'cause he's blind?

1093
01:04:04,708 --> 01:04:05,774
No, but...

1094
01:04:05,775 --> 01:04:07,843
My friend's name is Charles.

1095
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:09,845
He doesn't like to
be called Chucky.

1096
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:12,314
This is supposed to be
a family get-together.

1097
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:13,716
Just a warning.

1098
01:04:13,717 --> 01:04:17,586
Jesus Christ,
another sucker who thinks
this shit-heel's a war hero.

1099
01:04:17,587 --> 01:04:18,748
Hoo-ah!

1100
01:04:21,224 --> 01:04:23,852
Well, once, maybe.

1101
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:28,364
I suppose he told
you about his days on
Lyndon Johnson's staff?

1102
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:30,629
I was gonna go.
Now I'm not leaving.

1103
01:04:31,668 --> 01:04:33,898
Frank was earmarked
for general.

1104
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:36,068
Earmarked, good word.

1105
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:38,607
Frank likes to spit
in everybody's eye!

1106
01:04:38,608 --> 01:04:39,942
Randy, that's enough.

1107
01:04:39,943 --> 01:04:44,380
So they, what do they call it,
when they give you the
shaft in the military?

1108
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:45,748
Passed over!

1109
01:04:45,749 --> 01:04:48,684
Right, Frank was
passed over
for promotion.

1110
01:04:49,452 --> 01:04:50,886
Couple times.

1111
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:56,258
You wanna know
what happened then?

1112
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:57,793
Will you shut
your mouth?

1113
01:04:57,794 --> 01:04:59,228
He blew himself up.

1114
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:00,729
Stop it, Randy.

1115
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:03,966
Our Colonel here had
a grenade juggling act

1116
01:05:03,967 --> 01:05:06,502
at Fort Bragg, or wherever
it was they dumped him.

1117
01:05:06,503 --> 01:05:07,569
Fort Benning.

1118
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:10,472
He was teaching
hand-to-hand combat
to second lieutenants...

1119
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:13,041
Randy, look at me when
you're talking to me,
now, son.

1120
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:17,379
I'm lookin', Frank.
His partner in the act
was some captain.

1121
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:18,981
Major Vincent Squires.

1122
01:05:18,982 --> 01:05:20,249
Whoever he was.

1123
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:23,018
Before going on, they'd
have a lo-cal breakfast,

1124
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:25,888
a screwdriver for Frank,
bloody mary for his partner.

1125
01:05:25,889 --> 01:05:27,723
No, Vincent drank
Sea Breezes.

1126
01:05:27,724 --> 01:05:29,558
The Judge Advocate
at Benning said

1127
01:05:29,559 --> 01:05:33,629
Colonel Slade had four
to his partner's one.

1128
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:36,632
He's really
flying in class.
He gets all excited.

1129
01:05:36,633 --> 01:05:38,965
He starts pulling
the pins out.

1130
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:43,702
One grenade got
away from him.

1131
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,132
Boom.

1132
01:05:47,977 --> 01:05:49,778
The one that got away.

1133
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:52,407
The pin was in,
Frank claims.

1134
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:56,084
In or out, what
difference does it make?

1135
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:58,953
What kind of
fucking lunatic
juggles grenades?

1136
01:05:59,656 --> 01:06:00,989
Vinnie came out okay.

1137
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:03,220
All Frank lost
was his eyesight.

1138
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:08,797
You wanna know
the truth?

1139
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:10,399
Got a handle
on that, do you?

1140
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,867
He was
an asshole before.

1141
01:06:11,868 --> 01:06:13,063
Hoo-ah!

1142
01:06:14,838 --> 01:06:17,406
Now all he is,
is a blind asshole.

1143
01:06:17,407 --> 01:06:18,636
Hoo-ah.

1144
01:06:25,014 --> 01:06:27,574
Hey, God's a funny guy.

1145
01:06:29,886 --> 01:06:32,014
God doth have
a sense of humor.

1146
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:38,124
Maybe God thinks
some people don't
deserve to see.

1147
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:40,626
Hoo-ah.

1148
01:06:45,168 --> 01:06:47,500
You get
the point, Chucky?

1149
01:06:52,475 --> 01:06:54,239
His name is Charles.

1150
01:06:54,911 --> 01:06:57,079
You can say that,
can't you? Charles.

1151
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:59,615
Know what this is, Randy?
It's a Ranger choke hold.

1152
01:06:59,616 --> 01:07:02,050
From teaching
those lieutenants.
Colonel, let go.

1153
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:04,519
Little pressure,
I bust your windpipe.

1154
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,355
I don't care
what he said to me.
After me.

1155
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:07,589
Charles.

1156
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:09,358
Just let go, please!

1157
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:30,535
Gretchen?

1158
01:07:31,948 --> 01:07:33,848
You outdid yourself.

1159
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:38,120
If you twist my
arm hard enough,

1160
01:07:38,121 --> 01:07:40,647
we're talking
turkey Marbella
next year.

1161
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:42,547
Who knows?

1162
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,260
Frank?

1163
01:07:51,467 --> 01:07:53,231
Goodbye, Willie.

1164
01:07:57,874 --> 01:07:59,603
I'm no fucking good.

1165
01:08:02,045 --> 01:08:03,945
And I never have been.

1166
01:08:09,986 --> 01:08:12,318
Come on, Charlie,
get the coats.

1167
01:08:18,695 --> 01:08:21,095
Colonel.
Watch your step.

1168
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:25,098
Hold it.

1169
01:08:39,082 --> 01:08:42,779
Nueva York,
compadre. Vamos!

1170
01:09:27,697 --> 01:09:29,324
You got a watch?

1171
01:09:33,136 --> 01:09:34,467
It's 7:20.

1172
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:38,734
I didn't ask you the time.
I asked if you had a watch.

1173
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:41,243
Yeah, in the other room.

1174
01:09:41,244 --> 01:09:42,438
Get it.

1175
01:09:46,783 --> 01:09:49,809
Colonel, there's a clock
right next to your bed.

1176
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,111
Does it have
a second hand?

1177
01:09:59,429 --> 01:10:01,226
Yeah.
Time me!

1178
01:10:29,025 --> 01:10:30,424
How long?

1179
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:35,994
About 30 seconds.

1180
01:10:36,299 --> 01:10:37,664
I'm rusty.

1181
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:40,569
Where did you get
a gun, Colonel?

1182
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:43,198
Piece or weapon,
Charlie,
never gun.

1183
01:10:46,109 --> 01:10:48,270
Where did you
get the piece?

1184
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:51,246
I'm an officer
in the US Army.

1185
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,011
This is my sidearm.

1186
01:10:54,183 --> 01:10:55,817
But you're not
an officer anymore.

1187
01:10:55,818 --> 01:10:57,684
So I'm retired,
so what?

1188
01:10:58,121 --> 01:11:00,919
An officer never
relinquishes his.45.

1189
01:11:01,657 --> 01:11:05,393
You better relinquish
it to me or I'm gonna
have to call Mrs. Rossi.

1190
01:11:05,394 --> 01:11:06,953
Good idea.

1191
01:11:08,297 --> 01:11:10,198
Then I'm going
back to school.

1192
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:12,801
Even better.
Blue skies, green lights.

1193
01:11:12,802 --> 01:11:14,603
I hope you have
a wonderful trip.

1194
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:17,839
That felt like 25.
Gotta be able to
do a.45 in 25.

1195
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,040
Did you time me?

1196
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:21,169
I did not and
I'm calling Albany.

1197
01:11:30,987 --> 01:11:32,420
That was stupid.

1198
01:11:33,923 --> 01:11:35,186
Was it?

1199
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,791
You're stuck with me,
Charlie.

1200
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:41,930
No, I'm not.
I'm outta here!

1201
01:11:41,931 --> 01:11:43,598
Where you going,
New Hampshire?

1202
01:11:43,599 --> 01:11:46,262
You got no money.
How you gonna do that?

1203
01:11:50,339 --> 01:11:52,672
Karen's number
tastes like Albany.

1204
01:11:55,878 --> 01:11:57,512
Fine.
I'm leaving.

1205
01:11:57,513 --> 01:11:59,914
Charlie. Charlie!

1206
01:12:12,595 --> 01:12:16,224
All I want from you
is another day.

1207
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:19,165
For what?

1208
01:12:21,737 --> 01:12:24,707
One last tour
of the battlefield.

1209
01:12:28,444 --> 01:12:31,072
I can get around
a city like New York,

1210
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:33,882
but I

1211
01:12:33,883 --> 01:12:36,875
sometimes need a point
in the right direction.

1212
01:12:40,056 --> 01:12:41,923
What do you say,
Charles?

1213
01:12:41,924 --> 01:12:44,894
What's one day
between friends?

1214
01:12:49,065 --> 01:12:51,761
All right. Say I stay
for another day.

1215
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:54,869
Will you give me
your weapon?

1216
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:56,171
Oh, Charlie,

1217
01:12:56,172 --> 01:12:58,573
I'm a lieutenant colonel,
United States Army.

1218
01:12:58,574 --> 01:13:01,176
I'm not giving
my fucking gun
to anyone.

1219
01:13:01,177 --> 01:13:03,645
Now, what are
you drinkin'?

1220
01:13:03,646 --> 01:13:06,081
Colonel, this
is unacceptable.

1221
01:13:06,082 --> 01:13:09,184
Unacceptable?
What are you givin' me
that prep school crap for?

1222
01:13:09,185 --> 01:13:10,652
Unacceptable?

1223
01:13:10,653 --> 01:13:14,356
What have they done,
taken the Oregon
out of the boy?

1224
01:13:14,357 --> 01:13:16,723
Put in Harvard
Business School?

1225
01:13:17,693 --> 01:13:19,286
Then give me
your bullets.

1226
01:13:25,501 --> 01:13:28,698
You do see the sense of it,
Charlie, don't you?

1227
01:13:31,674 --> 01:13:34,006
I can't chew
the leather anymore.

1228
01:13:35,011 --> 01:13:39,414
So, why should I share
the tribe's provisions?

1229
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:43,950
I mean, there's no one

1230
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:47,351
wants to tear a herring
with me anymore.

1231
01:13:50,059 --> 01:13:51,618
The bullets, Colonel.

1232
01:13:51,794 --> 01:13:53,228
"The bullets, Colonel."

1233
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:56,660
You sound like a guy in
Lives of a Bengal Lancer.

1234
01:14:15,885 --> 01:14:18,047
What do you
give a shit for?

1235
01:14:19,388 --> 01:14:20,955
About what?

1236
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:22,322
About what?

1237
01:14:22,858 --> 01:14:25,657
About whether
I blow my brains
out or not.

1238
01:14:31,834 --> 01:14:33,668
Because I have
a conscience.

1239
01:14:33,669 --> 01:14:35,364
You have
a conscience.

1240
01:14:36,605 --> 01:14:37,971
I forgot.

1241
01:14:39,375 --> 01:14:41,343
The Charlie Conscience.

1242
01:14:43,346 --> 01:14:45,815
Do we tell?
Do we not tell?

1243
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:50,248
Do we follow
the rich boy's code
or not?

1244
01:14:51,253 --> 01:14:53,381
Do we let this
blind asshole

1245
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:56,417
die or not?

1246
01:14:56,959 --> 01:14:58,256
Yeah.

1247
01:14:58,728 --> 01:15:00,491
Conscience, Charlie.

1248
01:15:01,731 --> 01:15:03,358
When were
you born, son?

1249
01:15:03,699 --> 01:15:05,800
Around the time
of the Round Table?

1250
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:08,997
Haven't you heard?

1251
01:15:09,472 --> 01:15:12,305
Conscience is dead.

1252
01:15:13,409 --> 01:15:15,010
No, I haven't heard.

1253
01:15:15,011 --> 01:15:18,708
Then take the fucking wax
outta your ears!

1254
01:15:21,784 --> 01:15:23,047
Grow up!

1255
01:15:34,230 --> 01:15:35,959
It's fuck your buddy.

1256
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:39,093
Cheat on your wife.

1257
01:15:42,471 --> 01:15:44,940
Call your mother
on Mother's Day.

1258
01:15:47,143 --> 01:15:48,406
Charlie,

1259
01:15:49,578 --> 01:15:51,478
it's all shit.

1260
01:16:03,025 --> 01:16:04,584
Where you goin'?

1261
01:16:05,494 --> 01:16:07,190
I got piss call.

1262
01:16:08,864 --> 01:16:11,966
I know I said I need ya
forjust one day

1263
01:16:11,967 --> 01:16:14,459
but even I can't
hold it that long.

1264
01:16:16,972 --> 01:16:18,406
Oh, and Charlie,

1265
01:16:20,009 --> 01:16:22,500
you forgot the one
in the chamber.

1266
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:32,054
There you go, sir.

1267
01:16:32,788 --> 01:16:34,051
Thank you.

1268
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:39,391
Twenty-six years
in the service,

1269
01:16:40,062 --> 01:16:42,326
never let an aide
shine my shoes.

1270
01:16:43,032 --> 01:16:45,797
Where you gonna be
in 26 years, Charlie?

1271
01:16:46,402 --> 01:16:50,168
Playing golf with
your friends from
the Baird School, I bet.

1272
01:16:53,209 --> 01:16:55,610
I don't even
like those guys.

1273
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:58,444
Of course you don't.
They're all assholes.

1274
01:16:59,648 --> 01:17:02,379
Be a pleasure to
squeal on 'em,
wouldn't it?

1275
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:04,886
Yeah, well,
I'm not a squealer.

1276
01:17:04,887 --> 01:17:06,421
"I'm not a squealer."

1277
01:17:06,422 --> 01:17:08,618
What is this,
the Dreyfus case?

1278
01:17:12,828 --> 01:17:14,956
Ooh. Ooh, mama!

1279
01:17:15,898 --> 01:17:17,198
There you go.

1280
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:18,700
Thank you.

1281
01:17:18,701 --> 01:17:20,396
Thank you.

1282
01:17:21,203 --> 01:17:22,762
Watch your step.

1283
01:17:25,274 --> 01:17:28,335
I'm gettin' that heavy
feelin' again, Charlie.

1284
01:17:31,747 --> 01:17:33,909
There's more to this,
isn't there?

1285
01:17:35,217 --> 01:17:36,708
Isn't there?

1286
01:17:40,022 --> 01:17:41,922
I was offered
a bribe.

1287
01:17:42,424 --> 01:17:44,120
Now we're cookin'.

1288
01:17:45,427 --> 01:17:47,760
Mr. Trask,
the headmaster,

1289
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:52,066
he promised to get
me into Harvard.

1290
01:17:52,067 --> 01:17:53,592
If you squeal.

1291
01:17:54,270 --> 01:17:55,370
Yeah.

1292
01:17:55,371 --> 01:17:57,272
What a dilemma.

1293
01:17:57,273 --> 01:18:01,107
Should Charlie Simms
accept a free ride
into Harvard, or not?

1294
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:07,282
What do you think your
friend George would do
if he were in your shoes?

1295
01:18:07,283 --> 01:18:08,750
He is,
practically.

1296
01:18:08,751 --> 01:18:10,218
How?

1297
01:18:10,219 --> 01:18:14,556
It's just that Mr. Trask
hasn't promised to get
him into Harvard.

1298
01:18:14,557 --> 01:18:16,391
Mr. Trask
doesn't have to.

1299
01:18:16,392 --> 01:18:18,792
George's father's
gonna take care
of that.

1300
01:18:20,796 --> 01:18:23,060
Do the deal,
Charlie. Take it!

1301
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:25,133
Go to Harvard.

1302
01:18:26,101 --> 01:18:27,435
I can't do that.

1303
01:18:27,436 --> 01:18:28,631
Why not?

1304
01:18:30,973 --> 01:18:33,772
There are just
some things
you can't do.

1305
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:36,273
Explain 'em to me.

1306
01:18:37,947 --> 01:18:39,280
Louder, please.

1307
01:18:39,281 --> 01:18:40,647
I can't...

1308
01:18:42,818 --> 01:18:46,220
You're gonna
have a tough time
in this world, Charlie.

1309
01:18:47,323 --> 01:18:50,816
To ease the blow,
let me buy you
a drink. Come on.

1310
01:18:52,361 --> 01:18:54,762
Double
Jack Daniels on the rocks.

1311
01:18:54,763 --> 01:18:57,995
And bring my
young friend here
a Shirley Temple.

1312
01:18:58,634 --> 01:19:00,796
Hold on.
Do you have beer?

1313
01:19:01,103 --> 01:19:03,605
Certainly. May I
see some ID?

1314
01:19:03,606 --> 01:19:06,908
Are you interested
in walkin' the rest
of your life, chappy?

1315
01:19:06,909 --> 01:19:08,142
I'm sorry, sir, but...

1316
01:19:08,143 --> 01:19:11,238
I'm a regular here.
My boy's going on 23.

1317
01:19:11,614 --> 01:19:14,449
Why don't you
call up front,
the office?

1318
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:17,249
Mr. Gilbert,
he's a friend of mine.

1319
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:21,389
Any particular beer?

1320
01:19:21,390 --> 01:19:24,155
Schlitz. No Schlitz?

1321
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:27,026
Blatz. No Blatz?

1322
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:29,393
Lmprovise.

1323
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:32,066
I'll do my best, sir.

1324
01:19:32,067 --> 01:19:33,034
Thank you, sir.

1325
01:19:33,035 --> 01:19:33,934
Thank you, sir.

1326
01:19:34,737 --> 01:19:37,399
You're human, Charlie.
Beer?

1327
01:19:40,909 --> 01:19:42,901
Who are we
drinking with?

1328
01:19:43,078 --> 01:19:46,640
I'm getting
a nice soap-and-water
feeling from down there.

1329
01:19:54,757 --> 01:19:56,554
A female.

1330
01:19:56,825 --> 01:19:58,384
"Female"?

1331
01:19:58,994 --> 01:20:02,658
You callin' her female
must mean you like her
or you wouldn't be so casual.

1332
01:20:06,268 --> 01:20:07,635
Is she alone?

1333
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:09,001
Yeah, she's alone.

1334
01:20:11,106 --> 01:20:12,767
Things are heatin' up.

1335
01:20:13,342 --> 01:20:14,935
Chestnut hair?

1336
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:17,736
Brown, light brown.

1337
01:20:19,915 --> 01:20:21,315
Twenty-two?

1338
01:20:23,752 --> 01:20:26,051
What am I,
a guy at a carnival?

1339
01:20:26,588 --> 01:20:29,490
The day we stop lookin',
Charlie, is the day we die.

1340
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:31,619
Move.

1341
01:20:31,894 --> 01:20:33,928
Where?
You know where, son.

1342
01:20:33,929 --> 01:20:35,761
Don't be coy, Charlie.

1343
01:20:37,866 --> 01:20:40,699
This woman is
made for you.
I can feel it.

1344
01:20:41,270 --> 01:20:43,466
Goddamn beautiful,
isn't she?

1345
01:20:43,706 --> 01:20:46,607
She's not bad.
Bingo! The boy's alive.

1346
01:20:47,810 --> 01:20:50,609
Come on, son,
perambulate.

1347
01:20:51,613 --> 01:20:53,138
Perambulate.

1348
01:21:02,725 --> 01:21:06,161
Excuse me, se·orita,
do you mind if
we join you?

1349
01:21:08,130 --> 01:21:10,656
I'm feelin' you're
being neglected.

1350
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:13,634
I'm expecting somebody.

1351
01:21:15,671 --> 01:21:17,036
Instantly?

1352
01:21:18,407 --> 01:21:20,308
No, but any minute now.

1353
01:21:20,309 --> 01:21:21,609
Any minute?

1354
01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:24,409
Some people live
a lifetime
in a minute.

1355
01:21:25,581 --> 01:21:27,674
What are you doin'
right now?

1356
01:21:27,950 --> 01:21:30,043
I'm waiting for him.

1357
01:21:30,652 --> 01:21:33,247
Would you mind if
we waited with you,

1358
01:21:34,523 --> 01:21:37,515
just to keep
the womanizers
from bothering you?

1359
01:21:41,296 --> 01:21:42,958
No, I don't mind.

1360
01:21:43,332 --> 01:21:44,799
Thank you.

1361
01:21:48,303 --> 01:21:49,498
Charlie.

1362
01:21:53,142 --> 01:21:56,477
You know, I detect
a fragrance
in the air.

1363
01:21:56,478 --> 01:21:58,503
Don't tell me
what it is.

1364
01:21:59,481 --> 01:22:01,381
Ogilvie Sisters
soap.

1365
01:22:03,318 --> 01:22:04,819
That's amazing.

1366
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:07,021
I'm in the
amazing business.

1367
01:22:07,022 --> 01:22:09,013
It is
Ogilvie Sisters
soap.

1368
01:22:09,691 --> 01:22:11,959
My grandmother gave me
three bars for Christmas.

1369
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:14,195
I'm crazy about
your grandmother.

1370
01:22:14,196 --> 01:22:16,756
I think she'd have
liked Charlie, too.

1371
01:22:17,332 --> 01:22:19,066
Don't pay any
attention to him.

1372
01:22:19,067 --> 01:22:20,568
What's your name?

1373
01:22:20,569 --> 01:22:21,869
Donna.

1374
01:22:21,870 --> 01:22:25,006
Donna? I'm Frank.
This here is...

1375
01:22:25,007 --> 01:22:26,340
Charlie.

1376
01:22:26,341 --> 01:22:28,173
Yes.
She likes you.

1377
01:22:29,278 --> 01:22:31,279
Charlie's having
a difficult weekend.

1378
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:32,814
He's going
through a crisis.

1379
01:22:32,815 --> 01:22:35,683
How does he look like
he's holding up?

1380
01:22:35,684 --> 01:22:37,618
He looks fine to me.

1381
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:39,610
She does like you,
Charlie.

1382
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:46,959
So, Donna,

1383
01:22:49,898 --> 01:22:51,389
do you tango?

1384
01:22:52,034 --> 01:22:54,662
No. I wanted to
learn once, but...

1385
01:22:55,237 --> 01:22:56,329
But?

1386
01:22:58,006 --> 01:22:59,841
But Michael
didn't want to.

1387
01:22:59,842 --> 01:23:01,676
Michael.

1388
01:23:01,677 --> 01:23:03,873
The one you're
waiting for.

1389
01:23:04,546 --> 01:23:07,209
Michael thinks
the tango's hysterical.

1390
01:23:07,616 --> 01:23:09,675
I think Michael's
hysterical.

1391
01:23:10,486 --> 01:23:12,353
Don't pay any
attention to him.

1392
01:23:12,354 --> 01:23:13,947
Did I already
say that?

1393
01:23:16,491 --> 01:23:18,289
What a beautiful laugh.

1394
01:23:20,028 --> 01:23:21,655
Thank you, Frank.

1395
01:23:27,369 --> 01:23:30,066
Would you like
to learn to tango,
Donna?

1396
01:23:32,875 --> 01:23:34,240
Right now?

1397
01:23:35,644 --> 01:23:39,313
I'm offering you
my services,
free of charge.

1398
01:23:39,314 --> 01:23:40,839
What do you say?

1399
01:23:44,319 --> 01:23:46,310
I think I'd be
a little afraid.

1400
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:48,952
Of what?

1401
01:23:49,825 --> 01:23:51,987
Afraid of making
a mistake.

1402
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:57,298
No mistakes
in the tango, Donna.
Not like life.

1403
01:23:57,299 --> 01:24:00,167
It's simple.
That's what makes
the tango so great.

1404
01:24:00,168 --> 01:24:03,627
If you make a mistake,
get all tangled up,
just tango on.

1405
01:24:06,842 --> 01:24:08,571
Why don't you try?

1406
01:24:12,948 --> 01:24:14,541
Will you try it?

1407
01:24:16,518 --> 01:24:18,646
All right.
I'll give it a try.

1408
01:24:19,988 --> 01:24:21,615
Hold me down, son.

1409
01:24:28,196 --> 01:24:29,528
Your arm?

1410
01:24:32,534 --> 01:24:33,797
Charlie,

1411
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:37,805
I'm gonna need some
coordinates here, son.

1412
01:24:37,806 --> 01:24:40,808
The floor's about
20 by 30,

1413
01:24:40,809 --> 01:24:42,971
and you're at
the long end.

1414
01:24:43,879 --> 01:24:46,080
There's some tables
on the outside and

1415
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:48,015
the band's
on the right.

1416
01:27:28,176 --> 01:27:31,942
Frank, you are
one incredible
dancer.

1417
01:27:34,783 --> 01:27:37,081
Wait'll you see
Charlie dance.

1418
01:27:37,686 --> 01:27:39,720
He's a liar.
I don't dance.

1419
01:27:39,721 --> 01:27:41,255
Isn't he a charmer,
though?

1420
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:43,457
Truth is,
not only can he dance,

1421
01:27:43,458 --> 01:27:45,326
but he'll sing you
a hell of a tune.

1422
01:27:45,327 --> 01:27:48,095
He can do bird calls
and imitate Bela Lugosi.

1423
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:49,230
Hi, honey.

1424
01:27:49,231 --> 01:27:50,289
Hi.
Hey.

1425
01:27:50,866 --> 01:27:53,634
Michael, this is Frank
and this is Charlie.

1426
01:27:53,635 --> 01:27:55,870
Hi, Frank, Charlie.
Sorry I'm late.

1427
01:27:55,871 --> 01:27:57,270
That's okay.

1428
01:27:57,706 --> 01:28:00,307
These two gentlemen
entertained me,

1429
01:28:00,308 --> 01:28:01,901
and time flew.

1430
01:28:02,077 --> 01:28:04,842
Your girl is a hell
of a tango dancer.

1431
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:08,382
At last,
you found someone
to tango with.

1432
01:28:08,383 --> 01:28:09,817
That's terrific!

1433
01:28:09,818 --> 01:28:11,452
Let me shake your hand.

1434
01:28:11,453 --> 01:28:13,287
No, it was Frank.

1435
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:15,416
Hell, I'll shake
both your hands!

1436
01:28:16,591 --> 01:28:19,627
This looks like
the place, but
we gotta go.

1437
01:28:19,628 --> 01:28:23,430
We got a date with
Darryl and Carol
in the Village.

1438
01:28:23,431 --> 01:28:25,933
Do you have a check?
Michael, please.

1439
01:28:25,934 --> 01:28:27,601
My pleasure.

1440
01:28:27,602 --> 01:28:28,903
No, no. I got this.

1441
01:28:28,904 --> 01:28:30,838
Michael, get your hand
outta your pocket.

1442
01:28:30,839 --> 01:28:32,534
I'll take it. Really.

1443
01:28:33,175 --> 01:28:34,574
Allow me.

1444
01:28:36,978 --> 01:28:38,512
Why, thank you.

1445
01:28:38,513 --> 01:28:40,004
Bye, guys.

1446
01:28:40,515 --> 01:28:41,539
Bye.

1447
01:28:49,791 --> 01:28:52,761
Darryl and Carol.
Yeah.

1448
01:29:01,536 --> 01:29:03,404
It's apartment 17E,
Colonel.

1449
01:29:03,405 --> 01:29:05,039
She's expecting you.

1450
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:08,976
Don't worry about a thing.
She's the cr·me de la cr·me.

1451
01:29:08,977 --> 01:29:11,545
My buddy took
the Vice Chancellor
of Germany to her.

1452
01:29:11,546 --> 01:29:13,845
Now he wants to
immigrate to this country.

1453
01:29:14,082 --> 01:29:16,210
You did good, hombre.

1454
01:29:18,453 --> 01:29:20,251
My hair, how is it?

1455
01:29:21,389 --> 01:29:22,823
It's perfect.

1456
01:29:26,228 --> 01:29:28,196
I got the red
foulard okay,
didn't I?

1457
01:29:28,763 --> 01:29:30,464
Yeah,
real dark red.

1458
01:29:30,465 --> 01:29:33,492
Burgundy, Charlie.
Burgundy. They love it.

1459
01:29:35,937 --> 01:29:37,166
Bay rum.

1460
01:29:39,441 --> 01:29:40,908
Windsor knot.

1461
01:29:43,778 --> 01:29:45,906
That's my heart
I'm feelin'.

1462
01:29:55,857 --> 01:29:57,052
I'm off.

1463
01:30:15,477 --> 01:30:16,977
Can you get long
distance on this?

1464
01:30:16,978 --> 01:30:18,878
And how. Be my guest.

1465
01:30:29,924 --> 01:30:31,358
Sugarbush Lodge.

1466
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:32,927
Hi. George Willis, please?

1467
01:30:32,928 --> 01:30:34,725
One moment, please.

1468
01:30:36,398 --> 01:30:38,465
Hello?
Harry?

1469
01:30:38,466 --> 01:30:40,701
Chas, how are you?

1470
01:30:40,702 --> 01:30:43,971
You just caught us.
We're about to shoot
George over to the airport.

1471
01:30:43,972 --> 01:30:46,373
Why is George going
to the airport?

1472
01:30:46,875 --> 01:30:50,072
Hold on. Maybe
you should talk
to the man himself.

1473
01:30:51,346 --> 01:30:52,479
Chas.

1474
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:53,614
Yeah. Hi, George.

1475
01:30:53,615 --> 01:30:54,982
You just caught me.

1476
01:30:54,983 --> 01:30:57,685
That's what Harry said.
Where you goin'?

1477
01:30:57,686 --> 01:30:58,986
Home.

1478
01:30:58,987 --> 01:31:00,254
To Boston?

1479
01:31:00,255 --> 01:31:03,123
Catching the puddle·umper.
Keep your fingers crossed.

1480
01:31:03,124 --> 01:31:05,354
What are you
going home for?

1481
01:31:08,263 --> 01:31:12,222
I was thinking.
This asshole, Trask?
He's making no sense at all.

1482
01:31:13,535 --> 01:31:17,237
Somebody's gotta talk to him.
My father was class of '59.

1483
01:31:17,238 --> 01:31:21,107
Your father?
I thought we were gonna
keep our parents outta this.

1484
01:31:21,409 --> 01:31:24,140
This guy Trask
is out of control, Chas.

1485
01:31:24,746 --> 01:31:27,815
Out of control!
Somebody's gotta
talk to him.

1486
01:31:27,816 --> 01:31:29,841
My father's
a major fundraiser,
you know.

1487
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:31,885
No, I didn't.

1488
01:31:31,886 --> 01:31:33,053
Right.

1489
01:31:33,054 --> 01:31:35,421
Relax. He'll get us
off the hook.

1490
01:31:35,623 --> 01:31:37,424
I gotta go.
Everything all right?

1491
01:31:37,425 --> 01:31:38,586
Sure.

1492
01:31:38,793 --> 01:31:40,853
I'll see you Monday.
Goodbye.

1493
01:31:41,162 --> 01:31:42,255
Bye.

1494
01:32:06,988 --> 01:32:09,013
Good night, sir.
Good night.

1495
01:32:21,403 --> 01:32:22,392
Hiya, Charlie.

1496
01:32:24,739 --> 01:32:26,230
Watch the door.

1497
01:32:44,859 --> 01:32:46,987
What a beautiful woman.

1498
01:33:01,009 --> 01:33:02,910
Hello, there.

1499
01:33:02,911 --> 01:33:04,845
Do you
see what I see?

1500
01:33:04,846 --> 01:33:07,681
Yeah.
Either there's
something wrong,

1501
01:33:07,682 --> 01:33:10,084
or we got the world's
worst hangover.

1502
01:33:10,085 --> 01:33:12,186
Won't you come in?

1503
01:33:12,187 --> 01:33:15,054
We hear
you got a picture of
the bank robbery.

1504
01:33:32,607 --> 01:33:33,904
Colonel?

1505
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:50,189
Colonel,
you all right?

1506
01:33:51,926 --> 01:33:53,360
What is it?

1507
01:33:57,232 --> 01:33:58,999
It's after noon.

1508
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,298
You've been sleeping
all morning.

1509
01:34:02,370 --> 01:34:03,770
So what?

1510
01:34:06,274 --> 01:34:08,106
I don't know.
I thought...

1511
01:34:13,014 --> 01:34:15,005
I talked to George
last night.

1512
01:34:17,352 --> 01:34:21,345
His father's a big-deal
alumnus at school.
He's got a lot of pull.

1513
01:34:22,991 --> 01:34:24,322
Really?

1514
01:34:26,794 --> 01:34:30,253
Yeah, he's gonna talk
to the headmaster.

1515
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:35,302
George thinks he might
be able to get us
off the hook.

1516
01:34:35,303 --> 01:34:37,203
"Get us off the hook."

1517
01:34:37,972 --> 01:34:39,963
Yeah, that's what he said.

1518
01:34:41,743 --> 01:34:43,643
Watch the "us" part.

1519
01:34:46,781 --> 01:34:50,012
Colonel, don't you wanna
get up and do something?

1520
01:34:54,155 --> 01:34:55,384
Colonel?

1521
01:34:56,324 --> 01:34:58,349
Charlie, what do
you want?

1522
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:01,461
I don't know,

1523
01:35:01,462 --> 01:35:03,624
but you're making
me nervous.

1524
01:35:06,501 --> 01:35:08,731
My wallet is
on the dresser.

1525
01:35:10,405 --> 01:35:12,464
Take out your plane ticket

1526
01:35:13,341 --> 01:35:17,573
and $400
mustering-out pay, plus

1527
01:35:19,180 --> 01:35:22,480
airport-to-school taxi.

1528
01:35:25,453 --> 01:35:28,115
Colonel, it's no rush.
I mean, I can...

1529
01:35:29,190 --> 01:35:30,757
I could stay for a while.

1530
01:35:30,758 --> 01:35:33,057
Charlie, you already
gave me a day.

1531
01:35:34,596 --> 01:35:37,622
And for that day,
I am eternally grateful.

1532
01:35:40,301 --> 01:35:44,204
But right now
I have other plans.

1533
01:35:45,807 --> 01:35:48,071
What other plans
do you have?

1534
01:35:50,245 --> 01:35:51,735
To die, son.

1535
01:35:53,615 --> 01:35:55,344
Colonel, you're...

1536
01:35:55,984 --> 01:35:59,010
Come on, Colonel,
you're not gonna die today.

1537
01:35:59,554 --> 01:36:01,784
Charlie,
give me your hand.

1538
01:36:06,461 --> 01:36:08,327
You go now, boy.
Okay?

1539
01:36:10,932 --> 01:36:12,764
You go. Just...

1540
01:36:16,537 --> 01:36:18,631
Just leave me
sleep here.

1541
01:36:20,141 --> 01:36:23,076
Look...
Can we start
over, please?

1542
01:36:24,379 --> 01:36:26,745
What do you feel
like doin' today, huh?

1543
01:36:27,515 --> 01:36:30,017
Look at this.
The sun is shining!

1544
01:36:30,018 --> 01:36:32,179
It's a beautiful day.
Let's...

1545
01:36:36,391 --> 01:36:39,559
Colonel, I know you don't
want to be a party poop,

1546
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:41,428
so let's go out
and do something.

1547
01:36:41,429 --> 01:36:43,193
Let's go for a ride.

1548
01:36:48,703 --> 01:36:50,193
Yeah, a ride.

1549
01:36:52,607 --> 01:36:54,404
A ride?

1550
01:36:55,710 --> 01:36:58,045
Yeah, Colonel Slade,
what do you say?

1551
01:36:58,046 --> 01:36:59,877
Let's go
for a ride, huh?

1552
01:37:07,822 --> 01:37:09,517
What kind of ride?

1553
01:37:11,659 --> 01:37:14,561
Yeah, this is a valid
Oregon driver's license,

1554
01:37:14,562 --> 01:37:18,365
and we let appropriate
customers test-drive
the Testarossa.

1555
01:37:18,366 --> 01:37:22,336
But you're 17, with
a blind companion.
That we don't do.

1556
01:37:22,337 --> 01:37:24,604
This is a $100,000
piece of machinery.

1557
01:37:24,605 --> 01:37:27,074
I'm not letting it
out this door.

1558
01:37:27,075 --> 01:37:28,642
How about this one
over here?

1559
01:37:28,643 --> 01:37:31,278
That's a Cabriolet T.
The same deal.

1560
01:37:31,279 --> 01:37:35,716
You think I'll let
an unaccompanied kid
get in a $110,000 car?

1561
01:37:35,717 --> 01:37:37,947
He will not be
unaccompanied.

1562
01:37:38,820 --> 01:37:41,448
I'll be with him.
I'm his father.

1563
01:37:42,223 --> 01:37:43,824
You're his father?

1564
01:37:43,825 --> 01:37:45,019
Yes.

1565
01:37:45,460 --> 01:37:48,528
I have an idea. Why don't
I take your father
for a test drive?

1566
01:37:48,529 --> 01:37:50,497
What's your quota, Freddie?

1567
01:37:50,498 --> 01:37:52,499
Don't worry
about my quota.
I do well.

1568
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:54,534
How many Ferraris
you sold this month?

1569
01:37:54,535 --> 01:37:57,170
That's not relevant
to this discussion.

1570
01:37:57,171 --> 01:37:58,901
Freddie,
the '·0s are over.

1571
01:37:59,373 --> 01:38:02,209
Are you tryin' to tell me
these things are walkin'
outta the store?

1572
01:38:02,210 --> 01:38:06,413
This is a Ferrari, sir,
the finest machinery made
in the automobile industry.

1573
01:38:06,414 --> 01:38:09,750
If you like it that much,
why don't you sleep with it?
Why are you sellin' it?

1574
01:38:09,751 --> 01:38:11,251
I'd love to
accommodate you...

1575
01:38:11,252 --> 01:38:14,354
If this car performs
the way I expect it to,

1576
01:38:14,355 --> 01:38:18,058
you will get
a check of $101,000,
and change,

1577
01:38:18,059 --> 01:38:20,160
when you come in
here tomorrow morning.

1578
01:38:20,161 --> 01:38:24,164
It's $100,000,
plus $050,
plus tax.

1579
01:38:24,165 --> 01:38:26,967
Freddie, for you

1580
01:38:26,968 --> 01:38:29,736
107 all in,

1581
01:38:29,737 --> 01:38:33,298
plus a case of champagne
to go with your
leftover turkey.

1582
01:38:34,575 --> 01:38:37,377
What do you say?
Don't worry about
the boy.

1583
01:38:37,378 --> 01:38:41,114
He drives so smooth,
you can boil an egg
on the engine.

1584
01:38:41,115 --> 01:38:44,312
When we bring
the car back, I'll peel
the egg for ya.

1585
01:38:45,353 --> 01:38:48,948
Listen, you made me laugh,
but I can't let
the car go out.

1586
01:38:50,925 --> 01:38:52,726
Want a deposit?

1587
01:38:52,727 --> 01:38:55,162
This is not an
installment item, sir.

1588
01:38:58,533 --> 01:39:02,128
Freddie, you're
no spring chicken.

1589
01:39:04,305 --> 01:39:08,508
You know what they call me
at the home office?
"The Grey Ghost."

1590
01:39:08,509 --> 01:39:10,911
You know why they
still keep me around?

1591
01:39:10,912 --> 01:39:14,381
There's no kid here
that can move a Ferrari
like I can.

1592
01:39:14,382 --> 01:39:17,083
I'm known from
coast to coast
like butter and toast.

1593
01:39:17,084 --> 01:39:19,553
Ask anybody about
Freddie Bisco.

1594
01:39:19,554 --> 01:39:21,054
When I get a Ferrari...

1595
01:39:21,055 --> 01:39:22,689
Out the door!

1596
01:39:24,125 --> 01:39:25,859
You just made
me laugh, Freddie.

1597
01:39:25,860 --> 01:39:27,055
Yeah?

1598
01:39:27,795 --> 01:39:29,058
2,000.

1599
01:39:30,364 --> 01:39:33,266
Unless you take it,
you're gonna make me cry.

1600
01:39:36,537 --> 01:39:38,403
I'm a grey ghost, too.

1601
01:39:49,817 --> 01:39:52,878
See? This is fun,
isn't it?

1602
01:40:07,468 --> 01:40:10,870
Drop her into neutral.
Slide her into second.

1603
01:40:11,405 --> 01:40:12,839
Pop the clutch.

1604
01:40:50,478 --> 01:40:53,280
Straight.
Hold it right
like that.

1605
01:40:53,281 --> 01:40:55,515
Feel it?
That's straight.

1606
01:40:55,516 --> 01:40:57,746
It's a straight street,
so keep it straight.

1607
01:41:00,554 --> 01:41:02,022
Keep it straight.

1608
01:41:02,023 --> 01:41:03,690
No fun just
to keep it straight.

1609
01:41:03,691 --> 01:41:06,626
You've got to move
a little bit,
feel the road.

1610
01:41:07,028 --> 01:41:10,020
Please? Just like this.
All right? There you go.

1611
01:41:10,565 --> 01:41:12,465
Take it nice and easy.

1612
01:41:13,301 --> 01:41:15,001
Do you like this?

1613
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:21,700
Slow it down
a little, Colonel.
You're goin' a little fast.

1614
01:41:22,677 --> 01:41:24,941
Colonel, slow it down.

1615
01:41:25,780 --> 01:41:27,805
Something's happened
to my foot!

1616
01:41:29,584 --> 01:41:30,817
Slow it down, please.

1617
01:41:30,818 --> 01:41:33,480
Hold on. I think
I've got another gear.

1618
01:41:34,388 --> 01:41:35,913
Colonel Slade?

1619
01:41:37,458 --> 01:41:38,653
Hoo-ah!

1620
01:41:39,694 --> 01:41:40,922
Watch out!

1621
01:41:44,865 --> 01:41:46,166
You'll get us killed!

1622
01:41:46,167 --> 01:41:48,533
Don't blame me,
Charlie, I can't see!

1623
01:41:51,172 --> 01:41:52,572
Colonel,
slow it down!

1624
01:42:03,150 --> 01:42:04,379
Oh, Jesus!

1625
01:42:04,885 --> 01:42:07,687
Now let's see how
this baby corners.

1626
01:42:07,688 --> 01:42:08,755
Corners?

1627
01:42:08,756 --> 01:42:10,224
Yeah. Say when.

1628
01:42:10,858 --> 01:42:12,125
Say when what?

1629
01:42:12,126 --> 01:42:13,426
Say when to turn.

1630
01:42:13,427 --> 01:42:15,362
Colonel,
you can't turn the car.

1631
01:42:15,363 --> 01:42:17,058
Where's
the turn, Charlie?

1632
01:42:17,598 --> 01:42:21,067
3 o'clock? 2 o'clock?
Right oblique? Right face?

1633
01:42:21,068 --> 01:42:22,764
Come on! Talk to me!

1634
01:42:23,804 --> 01:42:25,438
It's left, I guess.

1635
01:42:25,439 --> 01:42:28,102
Left. I knew it. Okay. Now?

1636
01:42:29,710 --> 01:42:31,838
No, no! Not now! Not now!

1637
01:42:33,114 --> 01:42:34,274
Now?

1638
01:42:34,582 --> 01:42:35,882
Colonel, please!

1639
01:42:35,883 --> 01:42:38,184
I'm gonna do it anyway,
all right?

1640
01:42:38,185 --> 01:42:40,286
Whether you say so
or not, here we go!

1641
01:42:40,287 --> 01:42:42,722
Okay! Wait, wait, wait!
Just wait!

1642
01:42:42,723 --> 01:42:44,991
Here I go.

1643
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:46,926
Wait... Now!

1644
01:42:53,401 --> 01:42:56,268
I did it! Charlie!

1645
01:42:57,872 --> 01:43:00,705
You're ridin' with
one very happy man!

1646
01:43:02,443 --> 01:43:03,810
Turn again!

1647
01:43:03,811 --> 01:43:05,040
Be specific, son.

1648
01:43:05,780 --> 01:43:06,880
Left now!

1649
01:43:06,881 --> 01:43:07,973
Okay.

1650
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:15,749
I love this! I love it!

1651
01:43:17,324 --> 01:43:19,190
Shall we take it to the max?

1652
01:43:19,460 --> 01:43:20,950
Let me out.

1653
01:43:23,330 --> 01:43:25,128
Shit!
The yellow flag.

1654
01:43:26,067 --> 01:43:29,169
I haven't even
opened her up yet.
Which way's the curb?

1655
01:43:29,170 --> 01:43:31,705
Pull over. Slow down!
Slow down.

1656
01:43:31,706 --> 01:43:32,906
I'm doin' it.

1657
01:43:32,907 --> 01:43:34,908
Pull over to
the curb, here.
Slow down.

1658
01:43:34,909 --> 01:43:36,035
Yep. Got it.

1659
01:43:49,557 --> 01:43:51,992
Haven't had
a ticket in years.

1660
01:43:55,296 --> 01:43:57,025
I'll do the talking.

1661
01:44:02,703 --> 01:44:04,694
License
and registration.

1662
01:44:16,917 --> 01:44:18,985
Are you test-driving
this baby?

1663
01:44:18,986 --> 01:44:20,886
Don't she purr, though?

1664
01:44:21,455 --> 01:44:23,289
At 70 miles an hour?

1665
01:44:23,290 --> 01:44:25,758
You should hear
her at 125.

1666
01:44:27,561 --> 01:44:29,393
Where's your license?

1667
01:44:30,965 --> 01:44:32,632
At the dealer's.

1668
01:44:32,633 --> 01:44:35,295
They give it back
when you return the car.

1669
01:44:36,303 --> 01:44:37,804
You got ID?

1670
01:44:37,805 --> 01:44:39,364
You bet.

1671
01:44:40,608 --> 01:44:41,973
Indeed.

1672
01:44:45,913 --> 01:44:47,847
Lieutenant Colonel Slade.

1673
01:44:48,482 --> 01:44:50,143
And you, soldier?

1674
01:44:50,951 --> 01:44:53,477
The name is
Police Officer Gore.

1675
01:44:55,322 --> 01:44:57,423
Doin' a hell
of a job, Gore.

1676
01:44:57,424 --> 01:44:59,450
And so are you,
Colonel.

1677
01:45:00,594 --> 01:45:02,085
Who's the kid?

1678
01:45:03,164 --> 01:45:05,031
My boy Charlie.

1679
01:45:05,032 --> 01:45:07,100
He kept tellin' me
to "let her out."

1680
01:45:07,101 --> 01:45:09,331
What was I gonna do,
disappoint him?

1681
01:45:09,870 --> 01:45:11,031
Yes.

1682
01:45:14,942 --> 01:45:17,010
Tell you what
I'm gonna do,
Colonel.

1683
01:45:17,011 --> 01:45:19,913
I'm gonna let you go,
on one condition.

1684
01:45:19,914 --> 01:45:21,347
What's that?

1685
01:45:21,649 --> 01:45:24,413
That you take this rig
straight back to the dealer.

1686
01:45:26,687 --> 01:45:28,121
You got it.

1687
01:45:28,122 --> 01:45:29,419
Shut up.

1688
01:45:30,191 --> 01:45:31,590
You want this?

1689
01:45:31,926 --> 01:45:33,223
Sure.

1690
01:45:34,228 --> 01:45:35,787
Gore?

1691
01:45:36,263 --> 01:45:39,098
Your face and
your voice
are familiar.

1692
01:45:39,099 --> 01:45:41,830
You ever been
in the officer's
club at Da Nang?

1693
01:45:42,736 --> 01:45:44,070
No.

1694
01:45:44,071 --> 01:45:45,766
Never in the Army?

1695
01:45:46,907 --> 01:45:48,534
No. Coast Guard.

1696
01:45:49,176 --> 01:45:50,777
Good Lord.

1697
01:45:56,116 --> 01:45:58,518
Your dad
is looking good,
Charlie.

1698
01:45:58,519 --> 01:46:02,046
He's got a heavy foot, though.
Tell him to take it light,
all right?

1699
01:46:03,424 --> 01:46:05,358
I hear ya!
All right.

1700
01:46:05,359 --> 01:46:06,554
Thanks.

1701
01:46:19,540 --> 01:46:22,709
Get out of the car,
because you are not
driving anymore.

1702
01:46:22,710 --> 01:46:25,543
Just keeping this baby
warm, that's all.

1703
01:46:27,381 --> 01:46:29,475
I'm not drivin' anymore.

1704
01:46:33,921 --> 01:46:35,116
Yes.

1705
01:46:40,461 --> 01:46:42,293
Take my arm.
I'm okay.

1706
01:46:42,763 --> 01:46:45,130
Colonel,
it's really
bumpy here.

1707
01:46:59,146 --> 01:47:00,739
You all right?

1708
01:47:04,151 --> 01:47:05,209
Yeah.

1709
01:47:13,394 --> 01:47:15,362
Red light. Hold it.

1710
01:47:21,769 --> 01:47:23,362
Taking too long.

1711
01:47:26,974 --> 01:47:29,943
Shit! Colonel! Colonel!

1712
01:47:40,487 --> 01:47:41,750
Colonel!

1713
01:47:42,423 --> 01:47:44,186
Shit! You all right?

1714
01:47:45,259 --> 01:47:47,427
What the hell
are you doing?

1715
01:47:47,428 --> 01:47:48,628
Take the cane.

1716
01:47:48,629 --> 01:47:49,729
I gotta take a piss.

1717
01:47:49,730 --> 01:47:50,963
Take the cane.

1718
01:47:50,964 --> 01:47:52,398
Happens to
the best of us.

1719
01:47:52,399 --> 01:47:54,434
We're on
Park Avenue.
You can't.

1720
01:47:54,435 --> 01:47:55,925
Perfect place.

1721
01:47:56,437 --> 01:47:58,171
You'll get arrested.

1722
01:47:58,172 --> 01:48:00,106
Never been
housebroken.

1723
01:48:01,208 --> 01:48:02,437
Colonel!
Shit!

1724
01:48:02,743 --> 01:48:05,303
What's the matter
with you, Colonel?

1725
01:48:11,518 --> 01:48:14,954
What are you doing?
Stand up.

1726
01:48:16,390 --> 01:48:17,690
Come on.

1727
01:48:17,691 --> 01:48:20,354
I'm tired, Charlie.
I'm tired.

1728
01:48:22,463 --> 01:48:24,124
Give me your arm.

1729
01:48:24,765 --> 01:48:26,392
Here's your cane.

1730
01:48:27,735 --> 01:48:29,760
Take me back
to the hotel, son.

1731
01:48:35,976 --> 01:48:37,808
Home at last.

1732
01:48:59,133 --> 01:49:00,896
You all right now?

1733
01:49:02,803 --> 01:49:03,895
Yeah.

1734
01:49:07,875 --> 01:49:10,042
Do you want to
use the bathroom?

1735
01:49:10,043 --> 01:49:11,136
No.

1736
01:49:20,287 --> 01:49:21,754
Can I get you
something?

1737
01:49:21,755 --> 01:49:22,882
No.

1738
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:28,561
You sure you're
all right?

1739
01:49:28,562 --> 01:49:30,223
I'm fine, Charlie.

1740
01:49:48,782 --> 01:49:51,250
Do you mind if
I use the phone?

1741
01:49:51,251 --> 01:49:52,514
Go ahead.

1742
01:50:11,672 --> 01:50:13,005
Hello?

1743
01:50:13,006 --> 01:50:14,907
Hi, is George there,
please?

1744
01:50:14,908 --> 01:50:16,569
Senior or Junior?

1745
01:50:18,078 --> 01:50:19,445
Junior.

1746
01:50:19,446 --> 01:50:21,013
Who's this?

1747
01:50:21,014 --> 01:50:22,582
A friend of his
from school.

1748
01:50:22,583 --> 01:50:26,679
Sorry, but George isn't going
to be talking to any friends
from school right now.

1749
01:50:28,989 --> 01:50:29,979
Oh.

1750
01:50:30,324 --> 01:50:31,553
Goodbye.

1751
01:50:48,976 --> 01:50:51,342
Colonel, are you
looking at me?

1752
01:50:54,081 --> 01:50:55,810
I'm blind, Charlie.

1753
01:51:02,122 --> 01:51:03,954
I'm gonna take a nap.

1754
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:08,558
Too much fresh air.

1755
01:51:10,397 --> 01:51:12,559
It's probably a good idea.

1756
01:51:13,133 --> 01:51:15,534
Want me to help you
to your room?

1757
01:51:16,136 --> 01:51:17,194
No.

1758
01:51:18,539 --> 01:51:19,733
Couch.

1759
01:51:20,908 --> 01:51:22,808
I like this couch here.

1760
01:51:26,079 --> 01:51:28,514
You sure you're
all right, Colonel?

1761
01:51:28,515 --> 01:51:30,142
I got a headache.

1762
01:51:36,456 --> 01:51:39,725
Why don't you go
downstairs, get me
some aspirin?

1763
01:51:39,726 --> 01:51:42,696
Some aspirin.
Yeah. Also...

1764
01:51:45,532 --> 01:51:47,296
I feel like a cigar.

1765
01:51:48,835 --> 01:51:52,101
Get me a couple of
Montecristos Number One.

1766
01:51:53,307 --> 01:51:54,774
Montecristos
Number One.

1767
01:51:54,775 --> 01:51:55,942
Yeah.

1768
01:51:55,943 --> 01:51:58,844
You won't be able
to get 'em at
the newsstand downstairs.

1769
01:51:58,845 --> 01:52:00,871
So why don't you
go over to

1770
01:52:01,615 --> 01:52:04,175
50th and Fifth,
Dunhill's.

1771
01:52:04,985 --> 01:52:07,750
Fella named Arnold there,
in the humidor.

1772
01:52:08,689 --> 01:52:11,317
Tell him
they're for me.

1773
01:52:12,693 --> 01:52:13,887
He'll know.

1774
01:53:02,943 --> 01:53:05,070
You're back
too fast.

1775
01:53:07,881 --> 01:53:10,214
You didn't get
my cigars, did you?

1776
01:53:15,555 --> 01:53:17,456
Get out of
here, Charlie.

1777
01:53:21,795 --> 01:53:23,695
I thought we had a deal.

1778
01:53:24,464 --> 01:53:28,424
I welched.
I'm a welcher.
Didn't I tell you?

1779
01:53:29,970 --> 01:53:33,429
No, what you told me
was that you gave me
all the bullets.

1780
01:53:33,807 --> 01:53:35,070
I lied.

1781
01:53:36,977 --> 01:53:38,744
You could have fooled me.

1782
01:53:38,745 --> 01:53:40,111
And I did.

1783
01:53:43,016 --> 01:53:46,350
How you ever
gonna survive in this
world without me?

1784
01:53:51,224 --> 01:53:54,251
Why don't you just
give me the gun,
all right?

1785
01:54:03,170 --> 01:54:05,400
What are you doing?

1786
01:54:06,740 --> 01:54:08,799
I'm gonna
shoot you, too.

1787
01:54:11,912 --> 01:54:13,880
Your life's
finished anyway.

1788
01:54:15,115 --> 01:54:18,050
Your friend George
is going to sing
like a canary.

1789
01:54:18,051 --> 01:54:19,819
And so are you.

1790
01:54:19,820 --> 01:54:22,380
And once you've sung,
Charlie, my boy,

1791
01:54:22,656 --> 01:54:26,892
you're gonna take
your place on that
long, gray line

1792
01:54:26,893 --> 01:54:28,725
of American manhood.

1793
01:54:30,330 --> 01:54:32,526
And you will
be through.

1794
01:54:34,201 --> 01:54:36,202
I'd like to disagree
with you, Colonel.

1795
01:54:36,203 --> 01:54:38,571
You're in no
position to disagree
with me, boy.

1796
01:54:38,572 --> 01:54:41,803
I got a loaded.45 here.
You got pimples.

1797
01:54:42,809 --> 01:54:44,539
I'm gonna
kill ya, Charlie,

1798
01:54:45,278 --> 01:54:47,313
because I can't
bear the thought

1799
01:54:47,314 --> 01:54:49,009
of you sellin' out!

1800
01:54:50,984 --> 01:54:53,552
Put the gun down,
all right, Colonel?

1801
01:54:53,553 --> 01:54:56,682
What? You givin' me
an ultimatum?

1802
01:54:57,057 --> 01:54:58,422
No, I'm...

1803
01:54:59,860 --> 01:55:01,794
I give the ultimatums!

1804
01:55:03,563 --> 01:55:04,895
I'm sorry.

1805
01:55:06,833 --> 01:55:08,665
All right? I'm sorry.

1806
01:55:11,938 --> 01:55:13,497
It's all right,

1807
01:55:14,775 --> 01:55:16,208
Charlie.

1808
01:55:21,181 --> 01:55:23,081
You break
my heart, son.

1809
01:55:24,718 --> 01:55:26,550
All my life
I stood up

1810
01:55:27,554 --> 01:55:29,545
to everyone
and everything,

1811
01:55:31,024 --> 01:55:34,893
because it made me
feel important.

1812
01:55:37,097 --> 01:55:39,532
You do it
'cause you mean it.

1813
01:55:42,702 --> 01:55:44,432
You got
integrity, Charlie.

1814
01:55:48,675 --> 01:55:52,009
I don't know whether to
shoot you or adopt you.

1815
01:55:54,848 --> 01:55:57,316
Not much of a choice,
is it, sir?

1816
01:55:57,317 --> 01:55:59,115
Don't get cute now.

1817
01:55:59,886 --> 01:56:01,887
Could you please
put the gun away?

1818
01:56:01,888 --> 01:56:03,686
I asked you
a question.

1819
01:56:04,191 --> 01:56:07,092
Do you want me
to adopt you,
or don't you?

1820
01:56:08,261 --> 01:56:09,888
Please? I mean...

1821
01:56:11,498 --> 01:56:13,796
You're just in a slump
right now.

1822
01:56:14,034 --> 01:56:15,160
Slump?

1823
01:56:17,904 --> 01:56:19,668
No slump, Charlie.

1824
01:56:22,008 --> 01:56:23,271
I'm bad.

1825
01:56:26,179 --> 01:56:28,079
I'm not bad. No.

1826
01:56:30,750 --> 01:56:32,241
I'm rotten.

1827
01:56:35,589 --> 01:56:37,181
You're not bad.

1828
01:56:40,494 --> 01:56:42,291
You're just in pain.

1829
01:56:47,968 --> 01:56:50,232
What do you know
about pain?

1830
01:56:54,007 --> 01:56:58,308
You little snail darter
from the Pacific Northwest.

1831
01:56:59,479 --> 01:57:01,447
Fuck you know
about pain?

1832
01:57:05,151 --> 01:57:07,416
Let me have the gun,
Colonel.

1833
01:57:07,854 --> 01:57:09,982
No time to grow
a dick, son.

1834
01:57:11,224 --> 01:57:13,921
Just give me the gun,
all right, Colonel?

1835
01:57:15,862 --> 01:57:17,956
I'm talkin' a
parade ground.

1836
01:57:18,164 --> 01:57:19,462
Ten-hut!

1837
01:57:22,335 --> 01:57:25,567
Soldier, that was
a direct order.

1838
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:29,067
Give me the gun.

1839
01:57:32,846 --> 01:57:35,542
You can stay or
you can leave.

1840
01:57:36,716 --> 01:57:38,517
You understand?

1841
01:57:38,518 --> 01:57:41,510
Either way, I'm gonna
do this thing.

1842
01:57:44,157 --> 01:57:47,855
Now why don't
you leave and
spare yourself?

1843
01:57:50,730 --> 01:57:52,721
I want your gun,
Colonel.

1844
01:58:01,675 --> 01:58:03,905
I'm gonna give
myself a count.

1845
01:58:09,215 --> 01:58:11,878
You need a count
for balance.

1846
01:58:15,188 --> 01:58:16,588
Five...

1847
01:58:17,757 --> 01:58:18,747
Four...

1848
01:58:20,794 --> 01:58:22,227
Three...

1849
01:58:24,230 --> 01:58:25,459
Two...

1850
01:58:28,101 --> 01:58:29,227
One...

1851
01:58:31,371 --> 01:58:32,497
Fuck it.

1852
01:58:40,213 --> 01:58:41,943
Give me! Fuck!

1853
01:58:45,251 --> 01:58:46,418
Get out of here!

1854
01:58:46,419 --> 01:58:47,820
I'm stayin' right here!

1855
01:58:47,821 --> 01:58:49,121
Get outta here!

1856
01:58:49,122 --> 01:58:50,522
I'm stayin' right here.

1857
01:58:50,523 --> 01:58:52,257
I'll blow your
fuckin' head off!

1858
01:58:52,258 --> 01:58:53,892
Then do it!

1859
01:58:53,893 --> 01:58:56,419
You want to do it?
Do it! Let's go.

1860
01:59:02,502 --> 01:59:04,561
Get outta here!

1861
01:59:05,939 --> 01:59:08,374
You fucked up,
all right? So what?

1862
01:59:08,375 --> 01:59:10,241
So everybody does it.

1863
01:59:10,877 --> 01:59:12,645
Get on with your life,
would ya?

1864
01:59:12,646 --> 01:59:13,977
What life?

1865
01:59:15,048 --> 01:59:17,073
I got no life!

1866
01:59:19,219 --> 01:59:21,312
I'm in the dark here!

1867
01:59:23,023 --> 01:59:24,547
You understand?

1868
01:59:25,892 --> 01:59:27,451
I'm in the dark!

1869
01:59:33,133 --> 01:59:34,566
So give up.

1870
01:59:35,402 --> 01:59:38,971
You want to give up, give up.
Because I'm givin' up, too.

1871
01:59:38,972 --> 01:59:41,407
You said I'm through.
You're right,
I am through.

1872
01:59:41,408 --> 01:59:43,501
We're both through.
It's all over.

1873
01:59:44,110 --> 01:59:46,445
So let's get on with it.
Let's fuckin' do it.

1874
01:59:46,446 --> 01:59:48,676
Let's fuckin'
pull the trigger,

1875
01:59:49,315 --> 01:59:51,580
you miserable
blind motherfucker.

1876
01:59:59,926 --> 02:00:01,587
Pull the trigger.

1877
02:00:03,630 --> 02:00:05,427
Here we go, Charlie.

1878
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:08,131
I'm ready.

1879
02:00:16,076 --> 02:00:17,941
You don't want to die.

1880
02:00:20,413 --> 02:00:22,211
And neither do you.

1881
02:00:25,652 --> 02:00:28,314
Give me one
reason not to.

1882
02:00:32,792 --> 02:00:34,021
I'll give you two.

1883
02:00:34,461 --> 02:00:38,022
You can dance the tango
and drive a Ferrari better
than anyone I've ever seen.

1884
02:00:44,404 --> 02:00:46,839
You never seen
anyone do either.

1885
02:00:51,010 --> 02:00:53,138
Give me the gun,
Colonel.

1886
02:01:04,057 --> 02:01:06,787
Where do I go
from here, Charlie?

1887
02:01:08,294 --> 02:01:10,991
If you're tangled up,
just tango on.

1888
02:01:13,700 --> 02:01:15,998
You askin' me
to dance, Charlie?

1889
02:01:23,309 --> 02:01:26,111
Did you ever
have the feelin'

1890
02:01:26,112 --> 02:01:27,978
That you wanted to go

1891
02:01:29,682 --> 02:01:34,120
And still had the feelin'
that you wanted to stay?

1892
02:01:50,637 --> 02:01:52,696
You like my blues,
Charlie?

1893
02:01:56,075 --> 02:01:58,101
Yeah, they're beautiful.

1894
02:01:59,445 --> 02:02:01,072
I wore these

1895
02:02:02,916 --> 02:02:04,816
for Lyndon's
inauguration.

1896
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:11,450
Of course, we weren't
the number one ball.

1897
02:02:15,028 --> 02:02:17,019
But he dropped by
anyway.

1898
02:02:19,699 --> 02:02:21,963
Will you please
give me the gun?

1899
02:02:25,972 --> 02:02:27,906
You're askin' an officer

1900
02:02:29,042 --> 02:02:31,602
to surrender his sidearm.

1901
02:02:33,012 --> 02:02:35,047
You don't have
to surrender it.

1902
02:02:35,048 --> 02:02:37,414
Just put it down
for a little while.

1903
02:02:38,284 --> 02:02:40,446
All right?
Just put it down.

1904
02:02:52,198 --> 02:02:54,667
Boy, I could use
a drink, Charlie.

1905
02:02:58,204 --> 02:03:00,298
How about a cup of coffee?

1906
02:03:02,909 --> 02:03:06,178
Too big a leap for me
right now, Charlie.

1907
02:03:06,179 --> 02:03:07,679
Maybe tomorrow.

1908
02:03:10,550 --> 02:03:14,816
No, a Mr. John Daniels
would be preferred.

1909
02:03:17,557 --> 02:03:19,218
No water,
Charlie.

1910
02:03:21,861 --> 02:03:23,158
No water.

1911
02:03:23,930 --> 02:03:25,193
Please.

1912
02:03:33,239 --> 02:03:35,230
Here's your drink,
Colonel.

1913
02:03:41,881 --> 02:03:43,872
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1914
02:03:44,684 --> 02:03:47,352
What time do you want me
to turn down the bed?

1915
02:03:47,353 --> 02:03:49,388
Maybe later,
all right?

1916
02:03:49,389 --> 02:03:51,357
What he means,
se·orita,

1917
02:03:52,525 --> 02:03:54,425
is come right in.

1918
02:03:57,964 --> 02:03:59,432
Later, please?

1919
02:04:00,500 --> 02:04:02,832
Yes, sir.
Good afternoon.

1920
02:04:07,507 --> 02:04:08,997
Nice voice.

1921
02:04:13,313 --> 02:04:15,713
Boy, you have
a one-track mind.

1922
02:04:17,684 --> 02:04:20,710
Is there anything else
in this world, Charlie?

1923
02:04:21,921 --> 02:04:23,446
Not for you.

1924
02:04:24,524 --> 02:04:27,618
You know what's
kept me goin'
all these years?

1925
02:04:28,328 --> 02:04:29,989
The thought

1926
02:04:31,297 --> 02:04:33,732
that one day...

1927
02:04:42,642 --> 02:04:43,939
Never mind.

1928
02:04:45,178 --> 02:04:46,475
The what?

1929
02:04:48,314 --> 02:04:49,679
Silly.

1930
02:04:52,552 --> 02:04:55,351
Just the thought that
maybe one day, I'd...

1931
02:04:59,359 --> 02:05:02,260
I could have a woman's arms
wrapped around me,

1932
02:05:04,097 --> 02:05:06,361
and her legs
wrapped around me.

1933
02:05:09,135 --> 02:05:10,432
And what?

1934
02:05:15,274 --> 02:05:19,735
That I could wake up
in the morning and
she'd still be there.

1935
02:05:21,147 --> 02:05:22,672
Smell of her.

1936
02:05:24,150 --> 02:05:25,879
All funky and warm.

1937
02:05:30,590 --> 02:05:32,490
I finally gave up on it.

1938
02:05:35,762 --> 02:05:38,287
I don't know why
you can't have that.

1939
02:05:41,334 --> 02:05:43,902
When we get back
to New Hampshire,

1940
02:05:43,903 --> 02:05:46,463
I don't know why you
can't find someone.

1941
02:05:46,773 --> 02:05:49,799
You're a good-lookin' guy

1942
02:05:50,376 --> 02:05:52,401
and you're fun to be with

1943
02:05:53,212 --> 02:05:56,148
and you're a great
travel companion,

1944
02:05:56,716 --> 02:05:59,310
sensitive, compassionate.

1945
02:06:03,389 --> 02:06:04,550
Charlie,

1946
02:06:05,925 --> 02:06:07,984
are you fuckin' with me?

1947
02:06:12,065 --> 02:06:13,191
Yes.

1948
02:06:17,637 --> 02:06:18,866
Yeah?

1949
02:06:19,672 --> 02:06:21,106
Hey, Manny.

1950
02:06:26,345 --> 02:06:27,679
We missed our plane.

1951
02:06:27,680 --> 02:06:29,815
Your plane, Charlie.

1952
02:06:29,816 --> 02:06:31,613
My ticket was one-way.

1953
02:06:33,619 --> 02:06:35,887
New England thruway
all the way, Colonel?

1954
02:06:35,888 --> 02:06:37,720
All the way,
Manolo.

1955
02:06:49,902 --> 02:06:52,895
I'm gettin' that heavy
feelin' again, Charlie.

1956
02:06:54,707 --> 02:06:55,834
Uh...

1957
02:06:56,742 --> 02:06:57,937
"Uh..."

1958
02:06:58,978 --> 02:07:02,141
I think you were
right about George
and his father.

1959
02:07:02,548 --> 02:07:04,583
I'm sorry
to hear that.

1960
02:07:04,584 --> 02:07:09,421
When we get back Mr. Trask
is bringing us up
in front of the whole school.

1961
02:07:09,422 --> 02:07:11,790
Puttin' your feet
to the fire?

1962
02:07:11,791 --> 02:07:14,624
Special meeting of the
disciplinary committee.

1963
02:07:16,229 --> 02:07:18,595
And what are you
gonna tell 'em?

1964
02:07:21,467 --> 02:07:23,993
I don't know.
I'll think of somethin'.

1965
02:07:25,905 --> 02:07:29,534
Charlie, why are you
all alone in this thing?

1966
02:07:31,611 --> 02:07:33,374
Where's your father?

1967
02:07:34,947 --> 02:07:36,438
He left.

1968
02:07:37,884 --> 02:07:42,116
I thought it was a
mom-and-pop store.
Who's the pop?

1969
02:07:42,655 --> 02:07:44,350
It's my stepfather.

1970
02:07:45,358 --> 02:07:47,224
Oh, yeah.

1971
02:07:49,328 --> 02:07:52,992
But why isn't
he in on this?
Somethin' wrong with him?

1972
02:07:54,333 --> 02:07:56,859
No, he's okay. We just...

1973
02:07:57,303 --> 02:07:58,970
We don't get along
very well.

1974
02:07:58,971 --> 02:08:00,268
Why not?

1975
02:08:02,008 --> 02:08:03,542
Because he's
an asshole.

1976
02:08:08,214 --> 02:08:11,479
Well, that's
all right, Charlie.

1977
02:08:13,686 --> 02:08:16,553
Every family's
got one nowadays.

1978
02:08:46,452 --> 02:08:47,783
That's it?

1979
02:08:48,120 --> 02:08:49,254
That's it.

1980
02:08:49,255 --> 02:08:50,722
Take care of
yourself, kid.

1981
02:08:50,723 --> 02:08:52,589
All right, Manny.
Thanks.

1982
02:08:58,431 --> 02:09:00,422
No,
I'm not opening.

1983
02:09:02,034 --> 02:09:03,593
I hate goodbyes.

1984
02:09:06,205 --> 02:09:07,764
So...

1985
02:09:08,541 --> 02:09:10,168
You'll be
all right, huh?

1986
02:09:11,544 --> 02:09:13,034
I'll be fine.

1987
02:09:14,547 --> 02:09:15,844
All right.

1988
02:09:19,151 --> 02:09:20,710
What's that?

1989
02:09:21,654 --> 02:09:23,383
That's first bell.

1990
02:09:25,057 --> 02:09:27,492
Just got time
to get cleaned up.

1991
02:09:30,863 --> 02:09:32,593
I almost forgot.

1992
02:09:36,869 --> 02:09:38,837
I owe you
some money.

1993
02:09:41,173 --> 02:09:44,336
$300.
Job well done.

1994
02:09:48,547 --> 02:09:51,346
You ever need
any references, Charlie,
I'm your man.

1995
02:09:53,486 --> 02:09:55,113
Thanks, Colonel.

1996
02:10:01,894 --> 02:10:04,963
16 Water Street.
Over the bridge.

1997
02:10:04,964 --> 02:10:06,454
We'll find it.

1998
02:10:07,500 --> 02:10:09,229
Goodbye, Charlie.

1999
02:10:10,936 --> 02:10:12,666
Goodbye, Colonel.

2000
02:10:15,775 --> 02:10:17,402
Come here, son.

2001
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:35,525
Okay, Manny.

2002
02:11:49,735 --> 02:11:51,704
George. George!

2003
02:12:30,876 --> 02:12:33,711
I called an open meeting
of this institution
this morning

2004
02:12:33,712 --> 02:12:37,015
because the incident
that occurred this
Tuesday last

2005
02:12:37,016 --> 02:12:41,112
describes an issue
that concerns all of us.

2006
02:12:42,555 --> 02:12:44,789
Not an isolated case
of vandalism.

2007
02:12:44,790 --> 02:12:46,391
What happened

2008
02:12:46,392 --> 02:12:50,021
is a symptom
of the sickness
of a society.

2009
02:12:50,996 --> 02:12:56,230
A sickness which runs
counter to the principles
this school was founded on.

2010
02:12:58,437 --> 02:13:00,839
A school among
whose graduates

2011
02:13:00,840 --> 02:13:05,607
two have sat behind the
desk in the Oval O·ce,
in the White House.

2012
02:13:06,712 --> 02:13:10,046
Baird men have
run State Departments
and investment houses,

2013
02:13:10,816 --> 02:13:13,985
founded department stores
and coached football teams.

2014
02:13:13,986 --> 02:13:17,422
Our alumni receive
their bulletins in
ashrams in India

2015
02:13:17,890 --> 02:13:19,791
and in palaces in Jordan.

2016
02:13:19,792 --> 02:13:22,293
We are, in fact,
known around the world

2017
02:13:22,294 --> 02:13:25,463
as the cradle of this
country's leadership.

2018
02:13:25,464 --> 02:13:27,499
A beacon in the...
What are you doing here?

2019
02:13:27,500 --> 02:13:29,367
Got room for me
up there, Charlie?

2020
02:13:29,368 --> 02:13:32,470
But today we are bleeding
from disrespect.

2021
02:13:32,471 --> 02:13:33,738
Yeah, I guess so.

2022
02:13:33,739 --> 02:13:35,607
Blatant disrespect.
Give us a hand.

2023
02:13:35,608 --> 02:13:37,842
A disrespect
for our values,

2024
02:13:37,843 --> 02:13:41,713
and a disrespect
for our standards.

2025
02:13:41,714 --> 02:13:45,183
A disrespect for
the Baird tradition.

2026
02:13:45,184 --> 02:13:47,949
And, as the custodians
of that tradition,

2027
02:13:49,088 --> 02:13:53,286
we are here today
to protect each other

2028
02:13:53,859 --> 02:13:56,351
from those who threaten it.

2029
02:13:57,530 --> 02:13:59,464
Who is this, Mr. Simms?

2030
02:14:01,667 --> 02:14:03,601
This is Mr. Frank Slade,

2031
02:14:04,403 --> 02:14:07,634
Lieutenant Colonel,
United States Army,
retired.

2032
02:14:08,941 --> 02:14:11,273
I'm here in place
of Charlie's parents.

2033
02:14:11,543 --> 02:14:12,875
Excuse me?

2034
02:14:13,145 --> 02:14:14,772
In loco parentis.

2035
02:14:17,116 --> 02:14:20,385
They could not make
the trip from
Oregon today.

2036
02:14:20,386 --> 02:14:23,421
And what is your
relationship to Mr. Simms?

2037
02:14:23,422 --> 02:14:25,186
Is this a
courtroom?

2038
02:14:26,125 --> 02:14:28,159
Closest thing
we could manage to it.

2039
02:14:28,160 --> 02:14:31,824
Then if we're taking oaths,
there's a few people
I'd like to swear in.

2040
02:14:34,166 --> 02:14:36,362
There are no oaths
at Baird.

2041
02:14:37,436 --> 02:14:39,427
We are all on our honor.

2042
02:14:41,407 --> 02:14:43,807
Larry and Franny Simms

2043
02:14:44,176 --> 02:14:46,668
are very dear,
close friends of mine.

2044
02:14:47,146 --> 02:14:50,343
They've asked me
to appear here on
Charlie's behalf.

2045
02:14:51,283 --> 02:14:52,478
Okay?

2046
02:14:55,020 --> 02:14:57,455
Happy to have you
with us, Colonel.

2047
02:15:01,694 --> 02:15:03,025
Mr. Willis.

2048
02:15:05,431 --> 02:15:07,165
Which Mr. Willis?

2049
02:15:07,166 --> 02:15:08,599
George, Junior, sir.

2050
02:15:13,639 --> 02:15:15,239
Yes.

2051
02:15:15,240 --> 02:15:17,342
You were in a position
last Tuesday night

2052
02:15:17,343 --> 02:15:20,836
to see who committed
this act of vandalism.
Who was it?

2053
02:15:23,549 --> 02:15:26,884
Well, I have an idea
who it was.

2054
02:15:26,885 --> 02:15:28,519
No, not an idea,
Mr. Willis.

2055
02:15:28,520 --> 02:15:30,352
Did you see or
did you not see?

2056
02:15:33,359 --> 02:15:34,690
Well...

2057
02:15:36,462 --> 02:15:38,794
I didn't have
my contacts in.

2058
02:15:42,868 --> 02:15:44,097
Come on.

2059
02:15:47,973 --> 02:15:51,109
I was in the library.
I'd taken my glasses off,

2060
02:15:51,110 --> 02:15:53,704
and I was gonna put
my contacts back in.

2061
02:15:59,118 --> 02:16:00,918
Then I helped
Simms close up

2062
02:16:00,919 --> 02:16:03,921
and the next thing
I know, we're outside,

2063
02:16:03,922 --> 02:16:05,982
and I hear
this sound and I

2064
02:16:08,127 --> 02:16:10,994
didn't have any time
to put my contacts in.

2065
02:16:11,597 --> 02:16:14,293
Whom, with your
limited vision,
did you see?

2066
02:16:31,884 --> 02:16:34,011
Like I say,
it was blurry.

2067
02:16:39,892 --> 02:16:42,527
I can't see
without my contacts.

2068
02:16:42,528 --> 02:16:44,928
What did you see,
Mr. Willis?

2069
02:16:45,264 --> 02:16:46,458
What?

2070
02:16:47,533 --> 02:16:48,933
You mean definitively?

2071
02:16:48,934 --> 02:16:50,768
Stop fencing with me,
Mr. Willis!

2072
02:16:50,769 --> 02:16:52,669
Tell me what you saw!

2073
02:16:57,810 --> 02:17:02,042
Now, don't hold me to this,
but no contacts, it's dark...

2074
02:17:04,550 --> 02:17:06,084
And everything, I mean...

2075
02:17:06,085 --> 02:17:07,484
Mr. Willis!

2076
02:17:10,656 --> 02:17:11,748
Maybe...

2077
02:17:14,226 --> 02:17:16,126
Harry Havemeyer,

2078
02:17:16,929 --> 02:17:19,921
Trent Potter and
Jimmy Jameson.

2079
02:17:24,103 --> 02:17:25,303
Maybe?

2080
02:17:25,304 --> 02:17:26,999
Ballpark, best guess.

2081
02:17:29,208 --> 02:17:31,972
Could you provide us
with some detaiI?

2082
02:17:34,580 --> 02:17:38,073
Why don't you ask Charlie?
I really think he was closer.

2083
02:17:47,025 --> 02:17:48,357
Mr. Simms.

2084
02:17:49,928 --> 02:17:51,429
Yes.

2085
02:17:51,430 --> 02:17:54,198
You don't wear contact lenses,
do you?

2086
02:17:54,199 --> 02:17:55,496
No, sir.

2087
02:17:57,269 --> 02:18:00,104
With your
untrammeled sight,

2088
02:18:00,105 --> 02:18:01,505
w£om did you see?

2089
02:18:05,644 --> 02:18:07,442
Well, I saw something,

2090
02:18:09,414 --> 02:18:11,883
but I couldn't say who.

2091
02:18:12,618 --> 02:18:15,519
All right. What was
the something you saw?

2092
02:18:19,424 --> 02:18:20,525
I couldn't say.

2093
02:18:20,526 --> 02:18:22,255
You couldn't or wouldn't say?

2094
02:18:25,030 --> 02:18:26,555
Well, I just...

2095
02:18:30,536 --> 02:18:31,903
I just couldn't say.

2096
02:18:31,904 --> 02:18:33,571
Couldn't, wouldn't, shouldn't.

2097
02:18:33,572 --> 02:18:37,041
You're exhausting my patience
and making a mockery
of these proceedings.

2098
02:18:37,042 --> 02:18:38,810
I will give you
one last chance.

2099
02:18:38,811 --> 02:18:41,379
The consequences
of your response
will be dire.

2100
02:18:41,380 --> 02:18:45,715
By dire, I mean
your future will be
jeopardized permanently.

2101
02:18:47,352 --> 02:18:49,253
Now for the last time,

2102
02:18:49,254 --> 02:18:53,623
w£at did you see
last Tuesday night
outside my office?

2103
02:18:57,796 --> 02:18:59,630
I saw somebody.

2104
02:18:59,631 --> 02:19:01,793
"I saw somebody." Good.

2105
02:19:03,001 --> 02:19:05,368
Did you see their
size and shape?

2106
02:19:06,839 --> 02:19:08,136
Yeah.

2107
02:19:08,907 --> 02:19:11,570
And they were the size
and shape of whom?

2108
02:19:17,049 --> 02:19:19,108
They were the size and shape

2109
02:19:34,199 --> 02:19:36,361
of most any
Baird student, sir.

2110
02:19:51,483 --> 02:19:53,747
I am left with
no real witness.

2111
02:19:55,520 --> 02:19:59,523
Mr. Willis' testimony
is not only vague,
it is unsubstantiated.

2112
02:19:59,524 --> 02:20:02,426
The substance I was
looking for, Mr. Simms,

2113
02:20:02,427 --> 02:20:04,225
was to come from you.

2114
02:20:07,899 --> 02:20:09,265
I'm sorry.

2115
02:20:10,836 --> 02:20:12,895
I'm sorry, too, Mr. Simms,

2116
02:20:13,772 --> 02:20:15,740
because you know
what I'm going to do

2117
02:20:15,741 --> 02:20:18,409
inasmuch as I can't
punish Mr. Havemeyer

2118
02:20:18,410 --> 02:20:20,678
Mr. Potter or Mr. Jameson?

2119
02:20:20,679 --> 02:20:22,738
And I won't punish
Mr. Willis.

2120
02:20:23,315 --> 02:20:25,316
He's the only party
to this incident

2121
02:20:25,317 --> 02:20:28,287
w£o is still worthy
of calling himself
a Baird man.

2122
02:20:29,554 --> 02:20:32,717
I'm going to recommend to
the disciplinary committee

2123
02:20:34,559 --> 02:20:36,560
that you be expelled.

2124
02:20:36,561 --> 02:20:40,798
Mr. Simms, you are
a cover-up artist
and you are a liar.

2125
02:20:40,799 --> 02:20:42,733
But not a snitch!

2126
02:20:44,236 --> 02:20:45,803
Excuse me?

2127
02:20:45,804 --> 02:20:47,471
No, I don't think
I will.

2128
02:20:47,472 --> 02:20:48,906
Mr. Slade.

2129
02:20:48,907 --> 02:20:51,376
This is such
a crock of shit!

2130
02:20:52,778 --> 02:20:55,012
Please watch
your language, Mr. Slade.

2131
02:20:55,013 --> 02:20:57,915
You are in the Baird school,
not a barracks.

2132
02:20:58,350 --> 02:21:01,319
Mr. Simms, I will
give you one final
opportunity to speak up.

2133
02:21:01,320 --> 02:21:03,413
Mr. Simms
doesn't want it.

2134
02:21:04,156 --> 02:21:05,756
He doesn't need
to be labeled

2135
02:21:05,757 --> 02:21:08,124
"still worthy of
being a Baird man."

2136
02:21:08,660 --> 02:21:10,661
What the hell is that?

2137
02:21:10,662 --> 02:21:12,797
What is your motto here?

2138
02:21:12,798 --> 02:21:16,968
"Boys, inform on
your classmates,
save your hide,

2139
02:21:16,969 --> 02:21:20,404
"anything short of that,
we're gonna burn you
at the stake?"

2140
02:21:20,405 --> 02:21:22,673
Well, gentlemen,

2141
02:21:22,674 --> 02:21:26,110
when the shit hits the fan,
some guys run,

2142
02:21:26,111 --> 02:21:27,845
and some guys stay.

2143
02:21:27,846 --> 02:21:31,382
Here's Charlie,
facin' the fire,
and there's George,

2144
02:21:31,383 --> 02:21:33,951
hidin' in big daddy's pocket.

2145
02:21:33,952 --> 02:21:35,686
And what are you doin'?

2146
02:21:35,687 --> 02:21:39,624
You're gonna reward George
and destroy Charlie.

2147
02:21:41,393 --> 02:21:42,960
Are you finished,
Mr. Slade?

2148
02:21:42,961 --> 02:21:45,089
No, I'm just gettin'
warmed up.

2149
02:21:46,164 --> 02:21:48,265
I don't know
who went to
this place.

2150
02:21:48,266 --> 02:21:53,037
William Howard Taft,
William Jennings Bryan,
William Tell, whoever.

2151
02:21:53,038 --> 02:21:56,407
Their spirit is dead,
if they ever had one.

2152
02:21:56,408 --> 02:21:57,808
It's gone.

2153
02:21:57,809 --> 02:22:00,778
You're buildin'
a rat ship here,

2154
02:22:00,779 --> 02:22:03,781
a vessel for
seagoin' snitches.

2155
02:22:03,782 --> 02:22:07,618
And if you think
you're preparin' these
minnows for manhood,

2156
02:22:07,619 --> 02:22:09,253
you better think again,

2157
02:22:09,254 --> 02:22:12,156
because I say you are
killin' the very spirit

2158
02:22:12,157 --> 02:22:15,422
this institution
proclaims it instills.

2159
02:22:16,261 --> 02:22:17,962
What a sham.

2160
02:22:17,963 --> 02:22:20,965
What kind of a show
are you guys puttin'
on here today?

2161
02:22:20,966 --> 02:22:24,535
The only class
in this act is
sittin' next to me.

2162
02:22:24,536 --> 02:22:28,305
And I'm here
to tell you this boy's
soul is intact.

2163
02:22:28,306 --> 02:22:31,142
It's non-negotiable.
You know how I know?

2164
02:22:31,143 --> 02:22:34,806
Someone here,
and I won't say who,
offered to buy it.

2165
02:22:35,247 --> 02:22:37,348
Only Charlie
here wasn't sellin'.

2166
02:22:37,349 --> 02:22:38,883
Sir, you're
out of order.

2167
02:22:38,884 --> 02:22:41,218
I'd show you
out of order.

2168
02:22:41,219 --> 02:22:44,288
You don't know what
out of order is,
Mr. Trask.

2169
02:22:44,289 --> 02:22:46,524
I'd show you,
but I'm too old,

2170
02:22:46,525 --> 02:22:49,126
I'm too tired,
I'm too fuckin' blind.

2171
02:22:49,127 --> 02:22:54,566
If I were the man I was
five years ago, I'd take
a flamethrower to this place!

2172
02:22:57,669 --> 02:23:00,798
Out of order? Who the hell
you think you're talkin' to?

2173
02:23:02,407 --> 02:23:04,535
I've been around, you know?

2174
02:23:05,210 --> 02:23:07,406
There was a time
I could see.

2175
02:23:07,879 --> 02:23:09,472
And I have seen.

2176
02:23:10,048 --> 02:23:12,450
Boys like these,
younger than these,

2177
02:23:12,451 --> 02:23:15,784
their arms torn out,
their legs ripped off.

2178
02:23:16,354 --> 02:23:19,523
But there is nothin'
like the sight

2179
02:23:19,524 --> 02:23:21,425
of an amputated spirit.

2180
02:23:21,426 --> 02:23:24,293
There is no prosthetic
for that.

2181
02:23:26,031 --> 02:23:29,600
You think you're merely
sendin' this splendid
foot soldier

2182
02:23:29,601 --> 02:23:32,870
back home to Oregon with
his tail between his legs,

2183
02:23:32,871 --> 02:23:36,808
but I say you are
executin' his soul!

2184
02:23:38,076 --> 02:23:39,407
And why?

2185
02:23:40,345 --> 02:23:42,712
Because he's not
a Baird man.

2186
02:23:43,381 --> 02:23:46,317
Baird men.
You hurt this boy,

2187
02:23:46,318 --> 02:23:49,083
you're gonna be Baird bums,
the lot of you.

2188
02:23:49,254 --> 02:23:51,518
And, Harry, Jimmy,

2189
02:23:52,357 --> 02:23:55,126
Trent, wherever you are
out there,

2190
02:23:55,127 --> 02:23:56,685
fuck you, too!

2191
02:23:59,297 --> 02:24:01,265
Stand down, Mr. Slade!

2192
02:24:01,266 --> 02:24:02,756
I'm not finished.

2193
02:24:03,969 --> 02:24:08,272
As I came in here,
I heard those words,

2194
02:24:08,273 --> 02:24:10,241
"cradle of leadership."

2195
02:24:11,476 --> 02:24:16,947
Well, "when the bough breaks,
the cradle will fall,"
and it has fallen here.

2196
02:24:16,948 --> 02:24:18,649
It has fallen.

2197
02:24:18,650 --> 02:24:21,752
Makers of men,
creators of leaders.

2198
02:24:21,753 --> 02:24:25,121
Be careful what
kind of leaders
you're producin' here.

2199
02:24:26,091 --> 02:24:30,294
I don't know if Charlie's
silence here today
is right or wrong.

2200
02:24:30,295 --> 02:24:31,896
I'm not a judge orjury.

2201
02:24:31,897 --> 02:24:33,764
But I can tell you this,

2202
02:24:33,765 --> 02:24:37,531
he won't sell anybody out
to buy his future!

2203
02:24:38,803 --> 02:24:42,001
And that, my friends,
is called integrity.

2204
02:24:42,941 --> 02:24:44,942
That's called courage.

2205
02:24:44,943 --> 02:24:48,106
Now that's the stuff
leaders should be made of.

2206
02:24:53,652 --> 02:24:57,179
Now I have come to
the crossroads in my life.

2207
02:24:58,323 --> 02:25:01,657
I always knew what
the right path was.

2208
02:25:02,661 --> 02:25:06,028
Without exception, I knew,
but I never took it.

2209
02:25:06,498 --> 02:25:07,988
You know why?

2210
02:25:08,633 --> 02:25:11,603
It was too damn hard.

2211
02:25:13,238 --> 02:25:16,407
Now here's Charlie.
He's come to
the crossroads.

2212
02:25:16,408 --> 02:25:19,867
He has chosen a path.
It's the right path.

2213
02:25:20,879 --> 02:25:24,542
It's a path made of principle
that leads to character.

2214
02:25:27,552 --> 02:25:29,953
Let him continue
on his journey.

2215
02:25:32,057 --> 02:25:35,516
You hold this boy's future
in your hands, committee.

2216
02:25:36,761 --> 02:25:39,430
It's a valuable future,

2217
02:25:39,431 --> 02:25:40,762
believe me.

2218
02:25:41,533 --> 02:25:44,229
Don't destroy it.
Protect it.

2219
02:25:45,904 --> 02:25:47,303
Embrace it.

2220
02:25:48,039 --> 02:25:51,202
It's gonna make you
proud one day,
I promise you.

2221
02:26:08,793 --> 02:26:10,728
How's that
for cornball?

2222
02:26:32,283 --> 02:26:34,343
Nothing can
shut them up, sir.

2223
02:26:38,857 --> 02:26:42,092
The disciplinary
committee will take
this matter under advisement

2224
02:26:42,093 --> 02:26:44,289
in closed session.

2225
02:26:52,304 --> 02:26:54,499
What are they doin',
Charlie?

2226
02:26:55,306 --> 02:26:58,470
I think they're
going to come to
a decision now.

2227
02:27:01,780 --> 02:27:03,111
Very well.

2228
02:27:08,620 --> 02:27:11,487
Apparently, that meeting
will be unnecessary.

2229
02:27:12,290 --> 02:27:13,781
Mrs. Hunsaker.

2230
02:27:17,996 --> 02:27:23,300
The joint student-faculty
disciplinary committee
needs no further sessions.

2231
02:27:23,301 --> 02:27:26,003
They have come to a decision.

2232
02:27:26,004 --> 02:27:28,639
Messrs. Havemeyer,
Potter and Jameson

2233
02:27:28,640 --> 02:27:30,540
are placed on probation

2234
02:27:31,076 --> 02:27:34,045
for suspicion of
ungentlemanly conduct.

2235
02:27:34,312 --> 02:27:37,681
It is further recommended
that Mr. George Willis, Jr.

2236
02:27:37,682 --> 02:27:40,951
Receive neither recognition
nor commendation

2237
02:27:40,952 --> 02:27:42,750
for his cooperation.

2238
02:27:44,189 --> 02:27:46,457
Mr. Charles Simms is excused

2239
02:27:46,458 --> 02:27:49,226
from any further response
to this incident.

2240
02:27:49,227 --> 02:27:50,327
Hoo-ah!

2241
02:28:28,400 --> 02:28:29,992
Charlie!

2242
02:28:49,988 --> 02:28:51,288
Last step.

2243
02:28:51,289 --> 02:28:53,553
I can always count
on you, Charlie.

2244
02:28:56,761 --> 02:28:58,229
Colonel!

2245
02:29:01,800 --> 02:29:03,700
I'm Christine Downes,
Colonel Slade.

2246
02:29:03,701 --> 02:29:05,435
I teach
political science.

2247
02:29:05,436 --> 02:29:08,906
I wanted to tell you
how much I appreciate
you speaking your mind.

2248
02:29:08,907 --> 02:29:10,773
Why, thank you.
Are you married?

2249
02:29:11,409 --> 02:29:12,843
I...

2250
02:29:15,747 --> 02:29:19,383
Went to an artillery school
at Fort Sill with
a Mickey Downes.

2251
02:29:19,384 --> 02:29:21,151
Thought he might've
snagged you.

2252
02:29:21,152 --> 02:29:23,314
No, I'm afraid not.

2253
02:29:24,989 --> 02:29:28,892
Colonel Slade was on
Lyndon Johnson's staff,
Miss Downes.

2254
02:29:28,893 --> 02:29:31,261
Were you? Fascinating.

2255
02:29:31,262 --> 02:29:33,959
We should get together,
talk politics sometime.

2256
02:29:37,869 --> 02:29:39,701
Fleurs de Rocaille.

2257
02:29:41,406 --> 02:29:42,532
Yes.

2258
02:29:44,142 --> 02:29:46,235
"Flowers from a brook."

2259
02:29:47,812 --> 02:29:49,246
That's right.

2260
02:29:53,051 --> 02:29:56,885
Well, Miss Downes,
I'll know where to find you.

2261
02:29:59,057 --> 02:30:00,557
Charlie.

2262
02:30:00,558 --> 02:30:01,992
Bye, Miss Downes.

2263
02:30:01,993 --> 02:30:03,222
Bye.

2264
02:30:06,498 --> 02:30:09,023
You don't have to
tell me, Charlie.

2265
02:30:09,601 --> 02:30:10,727
5'7",

2266
02:30:12,337 --> 02:30:14,100
auburn hair,

2267
02:30:15,073 --> 02:30:17,564
beautiful brown eyes.

2268
02:30:36,160 --> 02:30:37,822
Yabba-dabba-doo.

2269
02:30:42,634 --> 02:30:43,794
Manny.

2270
02:30:46,504 --> 02:30:48,071
Colonel, this
is too much.

2271
02:30:48,072 --> 02:30:49,606
Never mind,
you earned it.

2272
02:30:49,607 --> 02:30:51,208
Next time Charlie and I

2273
02:30:51,209 --> 02:30:54,278
want to take a
breather to New York,
we're gonna call you.

2274
02:30:54,279 --> 02:30:56,046
You can drive us
both ways.

2275
02:30:56,047 --> 02:30:57,481
You're on,
Colonel.

2276
02:30:57,482 --> 02:30:59,249
Not only will it
be an honor,

2277
02:30:59,250 --> 02:31:00,584
I'll give you
a rate.

2278
02:31:00,585 --> 02:31:03,287
I'll see your rate
and raise you.

2279
02:31:03,288 --> 02:31:05,122
Stay outta
harm's way, Manny.

2280
02:31:05,123 --> 02:31:06,323
Take care,
Colonel.

2281
02:31:06,324 --> 02:31:07,621
You, too.

2282
02:31:08,393 --> 02:31:10,862
Ready?
No. I'll take it
from here.

2283
02:31:11,963 --> 02:31:13,397
You go on ahead.

2284
02:31:13,398 --> 02:31:15,662
Manny'll drive you
to your dorm.

2285
02:31:17,101 --> 02:31:19,803
Come by before you
go home for Christmas.

2286
02:31:19,804 --> 02:31:22,072
We'll have a little cheer.

2287
02:31:22,073 --> 02:31:24,641
And if you like,
stay for dinner.

2288
02:31:24,642 --> 02:31:27,678
Sometimes she cooks
a pot roast.

2289
02:31:27,679 --> 02:31:29,340
It's almost edible.

2290
02:31:30,815 --> 02:31:33,450
All right, Colonel.
That'd be really...

2291
02:31:33,451 --> 02:31:34,919
Bye, Charlie.

2292
02:31:54,839 --> 02:31:58,575
Who's there?
That you, Francine?

2293
02:31:58,576 --> 02:31:59,643
Yes.

2294
02:31:59,644 --> 02:32:00,944
What are you doing?

2295
02:32:00,945 --> 02:32:02,980
Taking a ride.

2296
02:32:02,981 --> 02:32:04,715
Taking a ride?

2297
02:32:04,716 --> 02:32:07,150
What about you
giving me a lift?

2298
02:32:07,151 --> 02:32:08,352
No.

2299
02:32:08,353 --> 02:32:09,479
No?

2300
02:32:09,988 --> 02:32:11,751
Come on, Francine.

2301
02:32:12,290 --> 02:32:15,282
We should make up.
Don't you think
it's time we made up?

2302
02:32:15,793 --> 02:32:17,160
No.

2303
02:32:17,161 --> 02:32:18,895
Francine?
What?

2304
02:32:18,896 --> 02:32:20,263
Uncle Frank's had

2305
02:32:20,264 --> 02:32:24,201
a really hard
Thanksgiving weekend.

2306
02:32:25,870 --> 02:32:28,464
What's that?
I hear a chipmunk.

2307
02:32:29,073 --> 02:32:30,973
Is it a walrus?

2308
02:32:31,242 --> 02:32:32,835
No, it's Willie.

2309
02:32:33,244 --> 02:32:35,979
Willie, why don't you
help me with my bag?

2310
02:32:35,980 --> 02:32:38,449
Come on, son.
Help me with my bag.

2311
02:32:38,750 --> 02:32:40,980
Come on. Come on.

2312
02:32:41,419 --> 02:32:45,014
You got it. Hold onto it.
You're strong. Come on.

2313
02:32:47,358 --> 02:32:48,792
Here we are.

2314
02:32:50,028 --> 02:32:52,588
Francine, come on
with me and Willie.

2315
02:32:52,830 --> 02:32:55,599
I'll let you make me
some marshmallow
chocolate.

2316
02:32:55,600 --> 02:32:57,295
What do you say?

2317
02:32:57,602 --> 02:32:58,592
Good!
