1
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:38,329
Pick a color.

2
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:42,667
- Blue.
- B-L-U-E. Pick a number.

3
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:47,296
- Eight.
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

4
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:49,966
Pick one more number.

5
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:52,510
- Fifteen.
- 1, 2, 3, 4...

6
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,806
...5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
13, 14, 15.

7
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,975
Pick another number.

8
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,769
- Six.
- Okay.

9
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,818
"Dream is destiny."

10
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,881
Rock out.

11
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,300
Rock 'n' roll.

12
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:02,056
Low strings. Begin!

13
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,966
Sara, try that thing
you asked me about.

14
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:41,137
- Will you try it more subdued?
- Okay.

15
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,890
- Try it, see what you think.
- That one?

16
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:48,477
But I want it to sound rich
and almost a little wavy...

17
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:51,063
...due to being a bit out of tune.

18
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:53,566
- You want it...
- Slightly detached.

19
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,776
That's what I was wondering.

20
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:57,278
We're going:

21
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,782
- Yeah. You got it.
- Okay.

22
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,243
Snazzy, people!

23
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:07,413
Okay, pickup to 20, please.

24
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:09,665
- This is the pickup to 20.
- Okay.

25
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,500
One, two, three.

26
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:12,311
Hey, it's me.
I just got back into town.

27
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,648
I thought I'd bum a ride,
but that's cool.

28
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:19,527
I can just take a cab,
something like that.

29
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:25,741
I guess I'll hang out with you later
or something.

30
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,589
Ahoy there, matey!
You in for the long haul?

31
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,968
Do you need a lift on down the line?

32
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:48,472
I was waiting for a cab, but...

33
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,767
All right. Don't miss the boat.

34
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,730
- Hey, thanks.
- Not a problem.

35
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,399
Anchors aweigh!

36
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,655
What do you think of my vessel?

37
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:08,492
She's "see-worthy." S-E-E.
See with your eyes.

38
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:12,997
My transport should be an extension
of my personality. VoilÃ !

39
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:18,044
And this is my window to the world.
Every minute's a different show.

40
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:21,380
I may not understand it
or agree with it...

41
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:25,217
...but I accept it
and just sort of glide along.

42
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,054
Keep things on an even keel, I say.

43
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:31,766
Go with the flow.
The sea refuses no river.

44
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:37,063
The idea is to remain in a state
of departure, while always arriving.

45
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:40,107
It saves on introductions
and goodbyes.

46
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:43,569
The ride requires no explanation,
just occupants.

47
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,696
That's where you come in.

48
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:50,034
It's like you come onto this planet
with a crayon box.

49
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:54,080
You may get the eight-pack
or the 16-pack...

50
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:59,335
...but it's all in what you do with
the crayons, the colors you're given.

51
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,755
Don't worry about coloring
within the lines.

52
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:07,176
Color outside the lines
and off the page! Don't box me in!

53
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:11,931
We're in motion to the ocean.
We are not landlocked!

54
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,266
So where do you want out?

55
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:19,146
Who, me? Am I first? I don't know.
Really, anywhere is fine.

56
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:23,150
- Just give me an address, okay?
- Uh...

57
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:26,445
Tell you what.
Go up three more streets.

58
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:31,867
Take a right. Go two more blocks.
Drop him off on the next corner.

59
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:34,995
Where's that?

60
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,957
I don't know, but it's somewhere.

61
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:42,461
And it'll determine the course
of the rest of your life.

62
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:45,798
All ashore that's going ashore!

63
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,049
Toot, toot.

64
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:19,266
I refuse to take existentialism
as just another fashion...

65
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,435
...or historical curiosity...

66
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:26,565
...because it has something important
to offer for the new century.

67
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:31,445
I'm afraid we're losing the real
virtues of living life passionately...

68
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:34,698
...taking responsibility
for who you are...

69
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:38,911
...making something of yourself
and feeling good about life.

70
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:43,707
Existentialism is often discussed
as a philosophy of despair...

71
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,126
...but I think it's the opposite.

72
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:51,257
Sartre once said he never really
felt a day of despair in his life.

73
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,551
One thing that comes
from these guys...

74
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:58,180
...is not a sense of anguish
so much as...

75
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,849
...an exuberance of feeling
on top of it.

76
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:04,770
It's like your life
is yours to create.

77
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:09,525
I've read
the postmodernists with interest.

78
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:14,238
But I always have this awful,
nagging feeling...

79
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,199
...that something essential
is left out.

80
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,744
The more you talk about a person...

81
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:25,457
...as a social construction
or a confluence of forces...

82
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,752
...or as fragmented or marginalized...

83
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:32,631
...then you open up
a whole new world of excuses.

84
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:37,344
When Sartre talks about
responsibility, it's not abstract.

85
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:41,849
It's not the kind of self or soul
that theologians argue about.

86
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,352
It's something concrete.
It's us talking...

87
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:49,231
...making decisions
and taking the consequences.

88
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:53,152
There are six billion
people in the world.

89
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,613
Nevertheless, what you do
makes a difference.

90
00:10:56,823 --> 00:11:01,618
It makes a difference
in material terms and to other people.

91
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,787
It sets an example.

92
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:07,875
The message is, we should
never write ourselves off...

93
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:12,004
...and see ourselves as victims
of various forces.

94
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,591
It's always our decision who we are.

95
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,811
Creation comes out of imperfection.

96
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:33,442
It seems to come out of a striving
and a frustration.

97
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,737
This is where, I think,
language came from.

98
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:42,326
I mean, it came from our desire
to transcend our isolation...

99
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:46,288
...and have some connection
with one another.

100
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:50,417
It had to be easy when
it was just simple survival.

101
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,712
"Water." We came up
with a sound for that.

102
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:57,049
"Tiger behind you!"
We made a sound for that.

103
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,178
But when it gets really
interesting, I think...

104
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:06,183
...is when we use
that same system of symbols...

105
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:11,855
...to communicate all the abstract and
intangible things we're experiencing.

106
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:17,027
What is "frustration"?
Or what is "anger" or "love"?

107
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,613
When I say "love"...

108
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:24,326
...the sound comes out of my mouth
and hits the other person's ear...

109
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:28,956
...travels through this byzantine
conduit in their brain...

110
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:33,085
...through their memories of love
or lack of love.

111
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:39,258
They say they understand, but how
do I know? Because words are inert.

112
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,803
They're just symbols. They're dead.
You know?

113
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:47,516
And so much of our experience
is intangible.

114
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:52,688
So much of what we perceive cannot
be expressed. It's unspeakable.

115
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:57,609
And yet, you know, when we
communicate with one another...

116
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:04,408
...and we feel we have connected
and think we're understood...

117
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:09,329
...I think we have a feeling
of almost spiritual communion.

118
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:13,625
That feeling may be transient,
but it's what we live for.

119
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:28,849
To look at human development,
look at the organism's evolution...

120
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,810
...and his environmental interaction.

121
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:37,149
Evolution of the organism begins
with evolution through the hominid...

122
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,570
...coming to the evolution of man.
Neanderthal, Cro-Magnon.

123
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:45,616
Now, what you're looking at here
are three strings:

124
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,578
Biological, anthropological,
development of cultures...

125
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:53,332
...and cultural,
which is human expression.

126
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:58,128
What you've seen is the evolution
of populations, not individuals.

127
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:01,131
Then look at the time scale involved.

128
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:06,136
Two billion years for life,
six million for the hominid...

129
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:09,515
...100,000 years for mankind
as we know it.

130
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:12,726
You see how the evolutionary
paradigm telescopes.

131
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:18,899
Then when you get to agriculture,
scientific and industrial revolution...

132
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,778
...you're looking at 10,000 years,
400 years, 150 years.

133
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:26,406
You see a further telescoping
of evolutionary time.

134
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:29,284
As we go through the new evolution...

135
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:35,499
...it will telescope to the point
where we see it within our lifetime.

136
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,878
The new evolution stems
from two types of information:

137
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:43,507
Digital and analog.
Digital is artificial intelligence.

138
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:47,177
Analog results from molecular biology
and cloning.

139
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,846
You knit the two with neurobiology.

140
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:54,768
Under the old paradigm, one would
die, the other would dominate.

141
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:58,981
Under the new paradigm, they exist
as a supportive...

142
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:03,443
...non-competitive grouping,
independent from the external.

143
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:07,906
So evolution now becomes an
individually centered process...

144
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:11,076
...emanating from the individual...

145
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:16,456
...not a passive process with the
individual at the collective's whim.

146
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,459
So you produce a neo-human...

147
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:22,838
...with a new individuality,
a new consciousness.

148
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:26,174
That's only the beginning
of the cycle.

149
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:30,137
As it proceeds,
the input is this new intelligence.

150
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:34,266
As intelligence piles on intelligence,
ability on ability...

151
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,644
...the speed changes until you reach
a crescendo.

152
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:43,900
Imagine it as an instant fulfillment
of human and neo-human potential.

153
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,696
It could be the amplification
of the individual...

154
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:51,742
...the multiplication of individual,
parallel existences...

155
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:56,204
...with the individual no longer
restricted by time and space.

156
00:15:56,414 --> 00:16:00,500
And the manifestations of this
neo-human evolution...

157
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,879
...could be dramatically
counterintuitive.

158
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:08,550
The old evolution is cold,
it's sterile. It's efficient.

159
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,720
Its manifestations are
those of social adaption.

160
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:16,600
You're talking about parasitism,
dominance, morality...

161
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,435
...war, predation.

162
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:22,898
These will be subject to de-emphasis
and de-evolution.

163
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:26,610
The new paradigm would give us
the traits...

164
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:30,864
...of truth, loyalty,
justice and freedom.

165
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:36,536
These would be manifestations of
this evolution. That's what we hope.

166
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:31,693
Self-destructive man feels completely
alienated. Utterly alone.

167
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:34,362
He's an outsider to the community.

168
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:37,866
He thinks to himself,
"I must be insane."

169
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:42,162
What he fails to realize
is that society has, as he does...

170
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:46,458
...an interest in considerable
losses, in catastrophes.

171
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:50,879
Wars, famines, floods and quakes
meet well-defined needs.

172
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:59,387
Man wants chaos.
In fact, he's gotta have it.

173
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:04,226
Depression, strife, riots, murder.
All this dread.

174
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:10,106
We're drawn to that almost orgiastic
state created out of destruction.

175
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:13,568
It's in all of us. We revel in it.

176
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:20,742
The media puts a sad face on things,
painting them as human tragedies.

177
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:26,289
But the media's function is not
to eliminate the evils of the world.

178
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:31,461
They persuade us to accept those evils
and get used to living with them.

179
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:35,423
The powers that be
want us to be passive observers.

180
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,134
Have you got a match?

181
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:44,099
They haven't given us any other
options, outside the occasional...

182
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:48,395
...purely symbolic,
participatory act of "voting."

183
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:53,316
Do you want the puppet on the right
or the puppet on the left?

184
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:58,071
The time has come to project my
inadequacies and dissatisfactions...

185
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:02,242
...into the sociopolitical
and scientific schemes.

186
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:05,996
Let my own lack of a voice be heard.

187
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,355
I keep thinking about
something you said.

188
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,815
- Something I said?
- Yeah.

189
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,152
About feeling like you
observe your life...

190
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,490
...from the perspective of
an old woman about to die. Remember?

191
00:21:23,658 --> 00:21:27,077
Yeah. I still feel that way sometimes.

192
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:29,704
Like I'm looking back on my life.

193
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:32,499
Like my waking life is her memories.

194
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,668
Exactly.

195
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:39,506
I heard that Tim Leary said
as he was dying...

196
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:44,135
...he looked forward to when his
body was dead but his brain was alive.

197
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:49,766
Those six to 12 minutes of brain
activity after everything shuts down.

198
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:55,814
And a second of dream consciousness
is infinitely longer than a waking one.

199
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,607
- Know what I mean?
- Yeah.

200
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:01,528
Like, I wake up at 10:12.
Then I go back to sleep...

201
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:07,367
...and have long, intricate dreams that
seem hours long. Then I wake up and...

202
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:08,618
...it's 10:13.

203
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:14,082
Exactly. So in that six to 12 minutes
of brain activity...

204
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,126
...that could be your life.

205
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:20,755
You are that woman,
looking back over everything.

206
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:23,800
If I am? What would you be in that?

207
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:25,468
Whatever I am now.

208
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:29,014
I mean, maybe I only exist
in your mind.

209
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,892
I'm still just as real
as anything else.

210
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:35,311
Yeah.

211
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:38,565
I've been thinking about
something you said.

212
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:39,733
What's that?

213
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:44,904
About reincarnation, and where
all the new souls come from over time.

214
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,865
Everybody always...

215
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:52,579
...says they're the reincarnation
of Cleopatra or Alexander the Great.

216
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,915
You know they were a dumb fuck
like everyone else.

217
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:58,001
I mean, it's impossible.

218
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:02,922
The world population has doubled
in the past 40 years.

219
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:08,011
- So if you believe in one eternal soul...
- Uh-huh.

220
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:11,931
...you have a 50% chance of your soul
being over 40.

221
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:17,729
For it to be over 150 years old,
it's only one out of six.

222
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:23,068
Are you saying reincarnation doesn't
exist? Or we're all young souls?

223
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:27,030
- Half of us are first-round humans?
- No, no.

224
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,657
- What I'm saying...
- What's your point?

225
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:34,412
I believe reincarnation
is a poetic expression...

226
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,831
...of what collective memory is.

227
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:41,127
- I read an article by a biochemist.
- Right.

228
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:44,756
He said when a member
of a species is born...

229
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:48,718
...it has a billion years
of memory to draw on.

230
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:52,555
This is where we inherit
our instincts.

231
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:55,141
I like that. Like there's...

232
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:59,270
...this telepathic thing going on
that we're a part of...

233
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:04,234
...whether we're conscious of it
or not. That would explain these...

234
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:10,031
...seemingly spontaneous, worldwide,
innovative leaps in science and art.

235
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:15,453
Like the same results popping up
everywhere, independent of each other.

236
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:19,666
A guy on a computer figures something
out and simultaneously...

237
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:23,169
...a bunch of people
figure out the same thing.

238
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:27,465
They did this study.
They isolated a group over time...

239
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:31,845
...and they monitored their abilities
at crossword puzzles...

240
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:34,514
- Uh-huh.
...in relation to the population.

241
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:40,687
Then they secretly gave them a day-old
crossword. One already done by people.

242
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:43,857
Their scores went up dramatically.
Like 20%.

243
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:49,404
It's like once the answers are out
there, people can pick up on them.

244
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:53,867
It's like we're all telepathically
sharing our experiences.

245
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:19,809
I'll get you fuckers
if it's the last thing I do.

246
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,396
You're gonna pay
for what you did to me.

247
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:28,651
For every second I spend
in this hellhole...

248
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:32,780
...I'll see you spend a year
in living hell!

249
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:38,494
You fucks will beg me to let you die.
But no, not yet.

250
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:41,164
I want you cocksuckers to suffer.

251
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:46,252
I'll fix your asses.
Maybe a long needle in your eardrum.

252
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:49,714
Or a hot cigar in your eye.

253
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:51,549
Nothing fancy.

254
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:55,720
Some molten lead up the ass?

255
00:25:57,723 --> 00:26:02,602
Or, better still,
some of that old Apache shit.

256
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:05,605
Cut your eyelids off.

257
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:10,235
I'll just listen to you fucks
screaming.

258
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:12,946
What sweet music that'll be.

259
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:15,907
We'll do it in the hospital...

260
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:20,536
...with doctors and nurses,
so you pricks don't die too quick.

261
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,747
You know the best part?

262
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:27,210
The best part is you faggots
will have your eyelids cut off...

263
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:31,756
...so you'll have to watch me
do it to you.

264
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:39,222
You'll see me bring that cigar closer
and closer to your wide-open eye...

265
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:45,687
...till you're almost
out of your mind. But not quite.

266
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:51,150
I want it to last a long, long time.

267
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:57,573
I want you to know it's me.
I'm the one doing it to you. Me!

268
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:03,746
That sissy psychiatrist,
what unmitigated ignorance!

269
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:08,293
And that old drunken fart of a judge.
What a pompous ass!

270
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,921
Judge not, lest ye be judged!

271
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:17,510
All of you pukes are gonna die
the day I get out of this shithole!

272
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:26,644
I guarantee you'll regret
the day you met me!

273
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:31,733
In today's world-view,
science has taken the place of God...

274
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:35,528
...but some philosophical
problems are still troubling.

275
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:37,280
Take free will.

276
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:41,409
This problem has been around
since Aristotle, in 350 B.C.

277
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:46,122
St. Augustine and Thomas Aquinas
worried how we can be free...

278
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:48,708
...if God already knows
what we're gonna do.

279
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:53,838
Nowadays, we know the world works
by fundamental physical laws.

280
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:58,676
These laws govern the behavior
of every object in the world.

281
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:04,599
Since these laws are trustworthy, they
enable technological achievements.

282
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:10,021
We're physical systems too. Complex
arrangements of carbon, mostly water.

283
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,274
Our behavior isn't an
exception to these laws.

284
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:18,488
So whether it's God setting things up
in advance and knowing everything...

285
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:23,242
...or physical laws governing us,
there's not much room for freedom.

286
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:27,205
You might want to ignore
the mystery of free will.

287
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:31,000
To say, "It's a historical
anecdote, it's sophomoric.

288
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:34,545
It's a question with no answer.
Forget about it."

289
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:39,884
But the question remains. If you think
about individuality, who you are...

290
00:28:40,094 --> 00:28:44,972
...is based on the free choices
you make. Or take responsibility.

291
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:48,935
You're only held responsible
or admired or respected...

292
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,938
...for things you do
of your own free will.

293
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:55,650
The question keeps coming
and we have no solution.

294
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,985
Decisions can seem like charades.

295
00:28:58,195 --> 00:29:02,490
Imagine it. There's electrical
activity in the brain. Neurons fire...

296
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:08,204
...sending a signal through the nerves
into the muscle fibers. They twitch.

297
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:12,083
You reach out your arm.
It looks like a free action...

298
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:15,378
...but every part of that process...

299
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:20,466
...is governed by physical laws.
Chemical, electrical, and so on.

300
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:24,095
It looks like the big bang
set the initial conditions...

301
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:27,306
...and the whole
rest of human history...

302
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:32,520
...is the reaction of subatomic
particles to basic physical laws.

303
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:36,065
We think we're special,
we have dignity.

304
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:40,236
That now is threatened.
It's challenged by this picture.

305
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:45,408
You might say, "What about quantum
mechanics? I know enough...

306
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,369
...to know it's a
probabilistic theory.

307
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:52,665
It's loose, not deterministic.
It lets us understand free will."

308
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:56,002
But if you look at details
it won't really help...

309
00:29:56,211 --> 00:30:00,756
...because you have quantum particles,
and their behavior is random.

310
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:04,510
They sort of swerve.
Their behavior is absurd...

311
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:09,724
...and unpredictable. We can't
study it based on what came before.

312
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,726
It has a probabilistic framework.

313
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:15,354
Is freedom just
a matter of probabilities?

314
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:17,732
Randomness in a chaotic system?

315
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:22,570
I'd rather be a gear in
a deterministic, physical machine...

316
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:24,947
...than some random swerving.

317
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:31,037
We can't ignore the problem. We must
find room in our world-view for persons.

318
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:35,374
Not just bodies, but persons.
There's the freedom problem...

319
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:41,255
...find room for choice and responsibility
and understanding individuality.

320
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:43,674
"You can't fight city hall."

321
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:47,803
"Death and taxes." "Don't talk about
politics or religion."

322
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:51,974
This is all the equivalent
of enemy propaganda.

323
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:54,352
Lay down, G.I! Lay down, G.I!

324
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:59,732
We saw it in the 20th century. Now, in
the 21st century, we must realize...

325
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:03,069
...that we cannot be crammed
into this rat maze.

326
00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:05,655
We should not submit
to dehumanization!

327
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:09,116
I'm concerned with what's
happening in this world.

328
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:13,162
I'm concerned with structure,
the systems of control.

329
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:17,959
Those who control my life and those
who seek to control it more!

330
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:21,504
I want freedom!
And that's what you should want!

331
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:26,759
It's up to each of us to turn loose
the greed, hatred, envy...

332
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:32,390
...and insecurities, their mode of
control. We feel pathetic, small...

333
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:37,395
...so we'll willingly give up our
sovereignty, liberty and destiny.

334
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:41,524
We must realize we're being
conditioned on a mass scale.

335
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:44,318
Challenge the corporate slave state!

336
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:49,323
The 21st century is a new century.
Not the century of slavery...

337
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:51,826
...lies and issues
of no significance...

338
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:55,955
...and classism, statism
and other modes of control.

339
00:31:56,164 --> 00:32:00,960
It'll be an age of humankind standing
up for something pure and right.

340
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:05,881
What a bunch of garbage. Liberal
Democrat, conservative Republican.

341
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:08,092
Two sides of the same coin!

342
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,636
Two management teams...

343
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:14,098
...bidding for the CEO job
of Slavery, Inc!

344
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:18,436
The truth is out there,
but they lay out a buffet of lies!

345
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:21,856
I'm sick of it! And I'm not
gonna take a bite out of it!

346
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:25,318
Resistance is not futile!
We will win this!

347
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:28,571
Humankind is too good!
We're not underachievers!

348
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:34,744
We'll stand up and be human beings!
We'll get fired up about real things!

349
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:39,498
Creativity and the dynamic human
spirit that refuses to submit!

350
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:44,003
Well, that's all I got to say.
It's in your court.

351
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:50,009
The quest is to be
liberated from the negative...

352
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:54,472
...which is really our
own will to nothingness.

353
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:59,560
Once having said yes to the instant,
the affirmation is contagious.

354
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:04,732
It bursts into a chain of affirmations
that knows no limit.

355
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:08,611
To say yes to one instant...

356
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,490
...is to say yes to all of existence.

357
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,369
The main character is
what I call "the mind."

358
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:19,830
Its mastery, its capacity
to represent.

359
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:22,458
In history, attempts have been made...

360
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:27,672
...to contain experiences which
happen at the edge of the limit...

361
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:30,883
...where the mind is vulnerable.

362
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:35,471
But I think we are in a very
significant moment in history.

363
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:40,393
Those moments, those what we
might call liminal, limit, frontier...

364
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:43,813
...X- zone experiences are
now becoming the norm.

365
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:48,359
These multiplicities and distinctions
send differences, giving...

366
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:52,738
...great difficulty to the old mind.

367
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:56,117
And through entering into their
very essence...

368
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:59,120
...tasting and feeling their
uniqueness...

369
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:02,456
...one makes a breakthrough
to that common...

370
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:06,168
...something that holds
them together.

371
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:11,757
And so the main character
is to this new mind...

372
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:14,677
...greater, greater mind.

373
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,096
A mind that yet is to be.

374
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,891
And when we enter into that mode...

375
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:24,311
...you can see a radical subjectivity.

376
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:28,649
Radical attunement to individuality,
uniqueness, to the mind.

377
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,110
It opens itself to a vast objectivity.

378
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:34,029
So the story is of the cosmos now.

379
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:39,076
The moment is not just
a passing empty, nothing, yet...

380
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:43,456
...this is the way in which
these secret passages happen.

381
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:47,168
Yes, it's empty with such fullness...

382
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:52,089
...that the great moment,
the great life...

383
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,509
...of the universe is pulsating in it.

384
00:34:56,344 --> 00:35:00,264
And each one, each object,
each place...

385
00:35:00,474 --> 00:35:03,726
...each act, leaves mark.

386
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:09,815
And that story is singular.
But, in fact, it's story after story.

387
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:18,949
It dissolves into
quick-moving particles that swirl.

388
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:23,454
Either I'm moving fast, or time is.
Never both simultaneously.

389
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:26,207
It's such a strange paradox.

390
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:30,294
I'm closer to the end of my life
than I've ever been...

391
00:35:30,504 --> 00:35:34,089
...but I feel more than ever that
I have all the time in the world.

392
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:37,009
When I was younger,
there was a need for...

393
00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:40,387
...certainty. I had to get
to the end of the path.

394
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:45,184
I know what you mean.
I remember thinking:

395
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:49,063
Someday, in my mid-30s maybe...

396
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:52,066
...everything's going to somehow
gel and settle.

397
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,275
- Mm-hm.
- Just end.

398
00:35:53,527 --> 00:35:55,820
It was like there was a plateau...

399
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:59,990
...waiting for me. I was climbing up.
When I got to the top...

400
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,077
...all growth and change would stop.

401
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:04,662
- Even exhilaration.
- Oh.

402
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,623
But it hasn't happened,
thank goodness.

403
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:11,836
In our youth, we don't take into
account our curiosity.

404
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:13,629
That's what's great about being human.

405
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:17,049
Yeah. You know what Benedict Anderson
says about identity?

406
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:21,095
- No.
- He talks about, say, a baby picture.

407
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:25,349
You pick up this two-dimensional image
and say, "That's me."

408
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:30,354
To connect this baby in this weird
image with yourself in the present...

409
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,481
...you have to make up a story.

410
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:36,610
"This is me when I was a year old.
Later, I had long hair...

411
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:40,155
...and then we moved to Riverdale,
and here I am."

412
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:43,784
So it takes a story
that's actually a fiction...

413
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,829
...to make you and the baby identical.

414
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,957
- To create your identity.
- The funny thing is...

415
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:53,752
...our cells completely
regenerate every seven years.

416
00:36:54,004 --> 00:36:56,714
We've been several different people.

417
00:36:57,132 --> 00:37:01,302
And yet, we always remain
quintessentially ourselves.

418
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:25,826
Our critique began as all critiques
begin, with doubt.

419
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:28,120
Doubt became our narrative.

420
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:31,749
Ours was a quest for
a new story, our own.

421
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:35,210
We grasped for this new history,
driven by suspicion...

422
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:38,213
...that ordinary language
couldn't tell it.

423
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:43,302
Our past appeared frozen in the
distance, and our every gesture...

424
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:47,806
...signified negation of the old
world and the reach for a new one.

425
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:52,478
How we lived created a new situation
of exuberance and friendship.

426
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:57,024
A subversive micro-society
in the heart of an ignoring society.

427
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:02,613
Art was not the goal, but the occasion
and method for locating our rhythm...

428
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:05,115
...and buried possibilities
of our time.

429
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:10,829
It was about the true discovery of
communication. Or the quest for such.

430
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:13,082
Finding and losing it.

431
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,085
We, the unappeased,
continued looking...

432
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:19,421
...filling silences with
wishes, fears, fantasies.

433
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:24,134
Driven on by the fact that no matter
how empty the world seemed...

434
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:27,513
...no matter how
degraded and used-up...

435
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:31,308
...anything was possible.
Given the right circumstances...

436
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,979
...a new world was just
as likely as an old one.

437
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:53,247
There are two kinds of sufferers:

438
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,958
Those who suffer
from a lack of life...

439
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:59,962
...and those who suffer from
an overabundance of life.

440
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:04,008
I've always found myself
in the second category.

441
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:08,762
When you think of it, almost all
human behavior and activity...

442
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:12,391
...is essentially no different
from animal behavior.

443
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:17,104
The most advanced technologies
and craftsmanship bring us at best...

444
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:19,857
...up to the super-chimpanzee level.

445
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:25,988
Actually, the gap between, say, Plato
or Nietzsche and the average human...

446
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:30,451
...is greater than between that
chimpanzee and the average human.

447
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,786
The realm of the real spirit...

448
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:38,333
...the true artist, the saint, the
philosopher, is rarely achieved.

449
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:40,377
Why so few?

450
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:46,091
Why is world history and evolution
not stories of progress...

451
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:49,595
...but an endless and futile
addition of zeros?

452
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:53,182
No greater values have developed.

453
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:57,895
Hell, the Greeks 3000 years
ago were just as advanced as we are.

454
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:01,106
What are the barriers
that keep people...

455
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:04,401
...from reaching anywhere near
their real potential?

456
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:09,281
The answer to that can be found in
another question, and that's this:

457
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:13,077
Which is the most universal
human characteristic?

458
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:15,037
Fear...

459
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,414
...or laziness?

460
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:30,677
What are you writing?

461
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,432
A novel.

462
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:39,311
What's the story?

463
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:42,689
There's no story. It's just...

464
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:45,776
...people, gestures, moments.

465
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:49,988
Bits of rapture. Fleeting emotions.

466
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,241
In short...

467
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:56,036
...the greatest stories ever told.

468
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,707
Are you in the story?

469
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,712
I don't think so.

470
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:10,968
But then I'm kind of reading it
and then writing it.

471
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:20,018
It was in the desert, the middle of
nowhere, on the way to Vegas.

472
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:24,314
So you know, every once
in a while a car would stop for gas.

473
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:27,734
It was the last gas stop before Vegas.

474
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:33,198
There was a chair and a cash register.
That was all the room there was.

475
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:37,369
I was asleep and I heard a noise.

476
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:43,750
You know, just like in my mind.
So I got up...

477
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:48,130
...and I walked out
and stood on the curb...

478
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:51,758
...where the gas station ends.
You know, the driveway.

479
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:55,679
I'm rubbing my eyes,
trying to see what's going on.

480
00:41:55,889 --> 00:42:02,060
And way down, at the very end of the
gas station, they had tire racks...

481
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:04,104
...with chains around them.

482
00:42:04,314 --> 00:42:07,649
And I see there's
an Econoline van down there.

483
00:42:07,901 --> 00:42:10,444
And a guy with his T-shirt off.

484
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:14,990
And he's packing this Econoline van...

485
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,659
...with all these tires.

486
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:21,538
He's got the last two tires
in his hands.

487
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:28,503
Pushes them into the thing.
And I, of course, I go, "Hey, you!"

488
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:33,926
This guy turns around.
He's got no shirt on. He's sweating.

489
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:39,431
Built like a brick shithouse.
Pulls out a knife, 12 inches long...

490
00:42:39,641 --> 00:42:43,477
...and starts running at me
as fast as he can, going:

491
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:46,730
Haaaa!

492
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:49,566
I'm still:

493
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:53,195
"This is wrong."

494
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,073
I walked in...

495
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:03,080
...stuck my hand behind the register
where the owner kept a.41 revolver.

496
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,539
I pull it out...

497
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:06,166
...cock the trigger...

498
00:43:06,376 --> 00:43:11,880
...and as I turn around, he's coming
through the door. I saw his eyes.

499
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,925
I'll never forget this guy's eyes.

500
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:20,430
He just had bad thoughts
about me in his eyes.

501
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,559
I fired a round and it hit him,
boom, right in the chest.

502
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:29,731
Bang! As fast as he came in the door,
he went out the door.

503
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:34,486
He went right up between
the two pumps, ethyl and regular.

504
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:41,076
He must have been on drugs, on speed
or something, because he stood up.

505
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:46,415
He still had the knife, and blood
was just all over his chest.

506
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:51,670
He stood up and went like that,
just moved a little. I'm in shock.

507
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:57,509
So I held the trigger back and fanned the
hammer, it was one of those old-time:

508
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,597
I blew him out of the gas station.

509
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:06,226
Ever since then, I always carry this.

510
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:13,358
A well-armed populace
is the best defense against tyranny.

511
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,319
I'll drink to that.

512
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:26,204
You know, I haven't fired this in
a long time, I don't know if it works.

513
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:29,249
Pull the trigger and find out.

514
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:29,935
Hey, man, I guess you already
took off or something.

515
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:36,733
Remind me to tell you about this dream
I had. There was some funny stuff.

516
00:45:36,943 --> 00:45:41,029
All right, man.
I guess I'll catch you later. Okay.

517
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:52,791
...in the bareback riding.
Copenhagen William from Mike sankey...

518
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:56,962
Then, for a hatband,
sew it into the inside...

519
00:45:57,505 --> 00:45:59,464
I do not await the future...

520
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:03,677
...anticipating salvation, absolution
or even enlightenment.

521
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:09,266
I believe that this flawed perfection
is sufficient and complete...

522
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:13,395
...in every single, ineffable moment.

523
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,981
- The Blond Bee, Firefly, snake...

524
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:20,193
- lunatic macaroni munchkin
with my goo-gat...

525
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:28,368
- venerable tradition of sorcerers,
shamans and visionaries...

526
00:46:28,578 --> 00:46:32,247
...who have perfected
the art of dream travel...

527
00:46:32,457 --> 00:46:37,961
...the so-called lucid dream state,
where, by controlling your dreams...

528
00:46:38,171 --> 00:46:44,092
...you can discover things beyond your
apprehension in your awake state.

529
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:50,765
- Winning back-to...

530
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:53,518
she tells him what Felix is doing.

531
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:56,938
A single ego
is an absurdly narrow vantage...

532
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:59,399
...from which to view this experience.

533
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:03,570
Where most consider their
relationship to the universe...

534
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:08,450
...I contemplate relationships
of my various selves to one another.

535
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:13,121
While most with mobility
problems can barely get around...

536
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:16,708
...at age 92, Joy Cullison's
out seeing the world.

537
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:43,485
Hey, how's it going?

538
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:48,615
They say dreams are real
only as long as they last.

539
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:50,825
Can't we say that about life?

540
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:55,580
A lot of us are mapping the
mind-body relationship of dreams.

541
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,709
We're called oneironauts,
explorers of the dream world.

542
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:04,130
There are two opposing states
of consciousness...

543
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,424
...that don't oppose at all.

544
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:11,513
In the waking world, the neuro system
inhibits the vividness of memories.

545
00:48:11,764 --> 00:48:13,515
It makes evolutionary sense.

546
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,351
It'd be maladapted if a predator...

547
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:19,521
...could be mistaken
for the memory of one...

548
00:48:19,689 --> 00:48:22,649
...and vice versa.
If the memory of a predator...

549
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:24,693
...conjured up a perceptual image...

550
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:27,988
...we'd run whenever we
had a scary thought.

551
00:48:28,197 --> 00:48:31,408
Your serotonic neurons
inhibit hallucinations.

552
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:35,120
They themselves are inhibited
during REM sleep.

553
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:39,499
This allows dreams to appear real
but prevents competition...

554
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:41,293
...from other perceptions.

555
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:44,629
This is why dreams
are mistaken for reality.

556
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:49,551
To the functional system of neural
activity that creates our world...

557
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:55,265
...there is no difference between
dreaming a perception and an action...

558
00:48:55,474 --> 00:49:01,229
...and actually the waking
perception and action.

559
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:17,912
A friend once told me the worst
mistake you can make...

560
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:21,958
...is to think that you are alive...

561
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:27,464
...when really you're asleep
in life's waiting room.

562
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:42,479
The trick is to combine your waking
rational abilities...

563
00:49:42,772 --> 00:49:46,358
...with the infinite possibilities
of your dreams.

564
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:49,944
Because if you can do that,
you can do anything.

565
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:54,574
Ever have a job you hated
and worked real hard at?

566
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:59,871
A long, hard day of work, finally you
go home, get in bed, close your eyes.

567
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:06,461
Then you wake up and realize the whole
day at work had been a dream.

568
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:16,304
It's bad enough you sell
your waking life for...

569
00:50:16,472 --> 00:50:21,142
...minimum wage, but now
they get your dreams for free.

570
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:25,563
Hey, man, what are you doing here?

571
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:29,359
I fancy myself a social lubricator
of the dream world...

572
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:32,028
...helping people get lucid easier.

573
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:36,116
Cut out the fear and anxiety
and just rock 'n' roll.

574
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:39,577
Becoming lucid, you mean knowing
you're dreaming?

575
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:45,500
Then you can control it. They're more
realistic than non-lucid dreams.

576
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:47,752
I just woke from a dream.

577
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:52,048
It wasn't typical, more like
I was in an alternate universe.

578
00:50:52,258 --> 00:50:56,720
Yep, it's real. Technically,
it's a phenomenon of sleep...

579
00:50:56,929 --> 00:50:59,472
...but you can have so much
fun in dreams.

580
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:04,144
- And everyone knows, fun rules.
- Yeah.

581
00:51:04,353 --> 00:51:08,440
- What was going on in your dream?
- A lot of people talking.

582
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:11,860
Some was absurdist,
like from a strange movie.

583
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:15,905
Mostly people went off about
whatever, really intensely.

584
00:51:16,157 --> 00:51:17,574
I woke up wondering...

585
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:21,286
...where did this stuff come from?
- You can control that.

586
00:51:21,537 --> 00:51:25,707
- You have these dreams a lot?
- I always make the best of it.

587
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:29,836
You have to realize you're
dreaming in the first place.

588
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,421
To recognize it.

589
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:35,675
You have to be able to ask yourself,
"Is this a dream?"

590
00:51:35,885 --> 00:51:40,054
Most people never ask themselves that,
awake or asleep.

591
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:45,101
People sleepwalk in the waking
state and wakewalk through dreams.

592
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:47,061
They don't get much out of it.

593
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:52,066
What snapped me into realizing
I was dreaming was my clock.

594
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:56,905
I couldn't read it,
like the circuitry was screwed up.

595
00:51:57,114 --> 00:52:02,160
That's common. Small printed material
is pretty tough too. Very unstable.

596
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:06,623
Another tip-off is trying
to adjust light levels. You can't.

597
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:10,752
If you see a light switch nearby,
see if it works.

598
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,505
You can't do that in a lucid dream.

599
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:19,135
What the hell? I can fly around, have
a conversation with Albert Schweitzer.

600
00:52:19,345 --> 00:52:22,180
I can explore new
dimensions of reality.

601
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:27,352
Not to mention, I can have any kind
of sex I want. Which is way cool.

602
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,354
So I can't adjust lights!

603
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:33,316
So that's what you do to test
if you're dreaming?

604
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:36,528
You can train yourself to recognize it.

605
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:38,571
Hit a switch now and then.

606
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:43,284
If the lights are on and you can't
turn them off, you're dreaming.

607
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:47,831
Then you can get down to business.
And it's unlimited.

608
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,708
- Know what I've been working on?
- What?

609
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:54,420
It's way ambitious.
But I'm getting better at it.

610
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:55,797
You'll dig this.

611
00:52:56,006 --> 00:53:00,176
Three-sixty vision, man. I can see
in all directions. Cool, huh?

612
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:04,973
Yeah! Man...
Well, I gotta go, man.

613
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:08,476
Later. Super perfundo
on the early eve of your day.

614
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:09,853
What's that mean?

615
00:53:10,062 --> 00:53:12,856
I've never figured it out.
Maybe you can.

616
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:15,608
This guy always whispers it in my ear.

617
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:18,778
Louis.
He's a recurring dream character.

618
00:54:46,742 --> 00:54:48,952
Cinema, in its essence...

619
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:55,625
...is about reproduction of reality,
which is, reality is reproduced.

620
00:54:55,876 --> 00:54:58,419
For him,
it's not a storytelling medium.

621
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:00,088
He feels like...

622
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:04,842
...like film... Like literature
is better for telling a story.

623
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:06,052
Mm-hm. Yeah.

624
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:09,681
Like if you tell a joke.
"A guy walks into a bar...

625
00:55:09,974 --> 00:55:12,016
...and sees a dwarf."

626
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:18,106
That works. You imagine a guy and a
dwarf in a bar, and it's imaginative.

627
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:21,359
But in film,
you film a specific guy...

628
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:26,447
...in a specific bar with a specific
dwarf who looks a certain way.

629
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:32,328
Like, for Bazin, what
the ontology of film has to do with...

630
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:34,497
...is what photography has...
- Right.

631
00:55:34,707 --> 00:55:38,835
...except it adds time
and greater realism.

632
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:45,508
So it's about that guy,
at that moment, in that space.

633
00:55:45,718 --> 00:55:49,303
And Bazin is, like, a Christian,
so he believes...

634
00:55:49,555 --> 00:55:53,224
...in God, obviously,
and that everything...

635
00:55:53,434 --> 00:55:55,810
For him, reality and God are the same.

636
00:55:56,061 --> 00:56:01,024
So what film is actually capturing is,
like, God incarnate, creating...

637
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:05,903
...and, like this very moment,
God is manifesting as this.

638
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,740
What film would capture
here right now...

639
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:13,745
...would be God as this table, as you,
as me. God looking how we look...

640
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:18,166
...saying and thinking what we think,
because we're all God manifest.

641
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:19,333
Mm-hm.

642
00:56:19,543 --> 00:56:24,088
So film is a record of God,
or the ever-changing face of God.

643
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:26,424
You have a mosquito. Want me to?

644
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:27,759
- You got it.
- I got it?

645
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:29,594
- Yeah, you got it.
- Okay.

646
00:56:29,762 --> 00:56:35,183
Hollywood has taken film and made it
a storytelling medium. You take...

647
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:40,605
...books or stories, get a script
and find someone who fits it.

648
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:44,067
It's ridiculous.
It shouldn't be based on the script.

649
00:56:44,276 --> 00:56:48,029
It should be based on the person
or the thing.

650
00:56:48,489 --> 00:56:52,658
They're right to have the star system.
Then it's about that person...

651
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:55,495
- Right, yeah.
...instead of the story.

652
00:56:55,704 --> 00:56:59,373
Truffaut said the best films
aren't made...

653
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:03,127
The best scripts
don't make the best films.

654
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:06,089
They have a narrative
you're a slave to.

655
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:11,844
The best films are the ones
that aren't tied to that, slavishly.

656
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:14,597
So the narrative thing seems to me...

657
00:57:14,807 --> 00:57:18,559
There's narrativity to film
because it's in time, like music.

658
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:24,315
But you don't think of the story of
the song. It comes out of the moment.

659
00:57:24,525 --> 00:57:28,277
That's what film has.
It's that moment, which is holy.

660
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:31,614
This moment is holy.
We walk around like it's not.

661
00:57:31,824 --> 00:57:35,076
Like there are some holy moments
and others are not.

662
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,285
Right.

663
00:57:36,495 --> 00:57:41,958
Like, this moment is holy. Film lets us
see that, can frame it so we see it.

664
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:47,672
"Holy, holy, holy" moment by moment.
But who can live that way?

665
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:53,678
Because if I were to look at you and
let you be holy, I would stop talking.

666
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:58,057
You'd be in the moment.
The moment is holy, right?

667
00:57:58,267 --> 00:58:01,269
Yeah, I'd be open.
I'd look in your eyes...

668
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:05,940
...I'd cry and I'd feel this stuff,
and that's not polite.

669
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:08,025
It'd make you uncomfortable.

670
00:58:08,277 --> 00:58:12,113
You could laugh too.
Why would you cry?

671
00:58:12,364 --> 00:58:15,783
Well, I don't know.
For me, I just tend to cry.

672
00:58:15,951 --> 00:58:19,453
Uh-huh. Well, is the?

673
00:58:19,705 --> 00:58:21,998
Let's do it right now.
Let's have a holy moment.

674
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:24,208
Okay.

675
00:58:47,733 --> 00:58:49,150
- Everything is layers.
- Yeah.

676
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,652
There's the holy moment, then...

677
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:57,491
...the awareness of it. Like in film,
the actual moment happens...

678
00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:04,248
...then the character pretends to be
in a different reality. It's layers.

679
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:09,128
I was in and out of the holy moment,
looking at you.

680
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:12,423
You can't...
You're unique that way, Caveh.

681
00:59:12,633 --> 00:59:18,221
That's one of the reasons I enjoy you.
You can bring me into that.

682
00:59:37,616 --> 00:59:43,621
If the world is false and nothing
is true, then everything is possible.

683
00:59:43,872 --> 00:59:48,626
On the way to finding what we love, we
find what blocks us from our desire.

684
00:59:48,877 --> 00:59:51,337
Comfort will never be comfortable.

685
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:54,382
A systematic questioning of happiness.

686
00:59:54,591 --> 01:00:00,471
Cut the vocal cords of every empowered
speaker and devalue currency.

687
01:00:00,681 --> 01:00:04,725
To confront the familiar.
Society is a fraud so complete...

688
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:09,563
...and venal, it demands
to be destroyed beyond memory.

689
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:11,941
If there's fire, we'll carry gas.

690
01:00:12,192 --> 01:00:16,654
Interrupt everyday experience
and the expectations that go with it.

691
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:19,407
Live as if things depend
on your actions.

692
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:23,119
Rupture the spell
of the consumer society...

693
01:00:23,412 --> 01:00:26,580
...so our repressed desires
can come forward.

694
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:30,167
Demonstrate what life is
and what it could be.

695
01:00:30,377 --> 01:00:33,713
To immerse ourselves
in the oblivion of actions.

696
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:38,134
There'll be an intensity never known.
To exchange love and hate...

697
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:40,636
...terror and redemption.

698
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:47,143
Affirmation of freedom so reckless
it amounts to a denial of limitation.

699
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:01,532
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I'm not sure.

700
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:04,994
You need any help getting down, sir?

701
01:01:05,954 --> 01:01:08,622
No, I don't think so.

702
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:11,584
Stupid bastard.

703
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:14,879
No worse than us.
He's all action, no theory.

704
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:18,257
We're all theory and no action.

705
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:29,643
Why so glum, Mr. Deborg?

706
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:34,398
What was missing
was felt irretrievable.

707
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:40,863
The extreme uncertainties
of subsisting without working...

708
01:01:41,073 --> 01:01:44,075
...made excesses necessary...

709
01:01:44,284 --> 01:01:46,410
...and breaks definitive.

710
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:48,454
To quote Stevenson:

711
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:52,416
"Suicide carried off many.

712
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:56,087
Drink and the devil...

713
01:01:56,296 --> 01:01:58,839
...took care of the rest."

714
01:02:09,101 --> 01:02:10,726
- Hey!
- Hey.

715
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:13,771
Are you a dreamer?

716
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:16,690
Yeah.

717
01:02:19,027 --> 01:02:22,363
I haven't seen too many around lately.

718
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:25,324
Things have been tough for dreamers.

719
01:02:26,201 --> 01:02:29,495
They say dreaming's dead.
No one does it anymore.

720
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,832
It's not dead.
It's just been forgotten.

721
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:35,084
Removed from our language.

722
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:38,796
Nobody teaches it,
so no one knows it exists.

723
01:02:41,133 --> 01:02:44,093
The dreamer's banished to obscurity.

724
01:02:44,803 --> 01:02:48,139
I'm trying to change that.
I hope you are too...

725
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:51,809
...by dreaming every day.

726
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:55,729
Dreaming with our hands and minds.

727
01:02:56,398 --> 01:03:01,026
Our planet is facing the greatest
problems it's ever faced. Ever.

728
01:03:01,236 --> 01:03:03,070
So don't be bored.

729
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:07,658
This is the most exciting time
we could have hoped to be alive.

730
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:10,286
And things are just starting.

731
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:30,264
A thousand years is
an instant. There's nothing new.

732
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:36,228
The same pattern over and over.
The same insights felt long ago.

733
01:03:36,438 --> 01:03:39,231
There's nothing here for me now.

734
01:03:39,441 --> 01:03:44,737
Now I remember. This happened
to me before. This is why I left.

735
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:48,532
You have begun to find answers.

736
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:51,494
Though difficult,
the rewards will be great.

737
01:03:51,745 --> 01:03:56,457
Exercise your mind fully,
knowing it is only an exercise.

738
01:03:56,708 --> 01:04:01,504
Build artifacts, solve problems,
explore the secrets of the universe.

739
01:04:01,713 --> 01:04:04,089
Savor input from all the senses.

740
01:04:04,341 --> 01:04:10,262
Feel joy, sorrow, laughter, empathy.
Tuck the memory in your travel bag.

741
01:04:10,597 --> 01:04:13,933
I remember where I'm from
and how I became human.

742
01:04:14,142 --> 01:04:17,394
Why I hung around.
Now my departure is scheduled.

743
01:04:17,938 --> 01:04:23,150
This way out. Escaping velocity.
Not just eternity, but infinity.

744
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:52,846
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

745
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,602
Hey.

746
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:02,106
Could we do that again?
I know we haven't met...

747
01:05:02,357 --> 01:05:04,858
...but I don't want to be an ant.

748
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:09,446
We go through life
bouncing off one another...

749
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:12,408
...continuously on ant autopilot...

750
01:05:12,617 --> 01:05:16,537
...with nothing really human
required of us.

751
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:19,915
Stop. Go. Walk here. Drive there.

752
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:22,585
All action basically for survival.

753
01:05:22,794 --> 01:05:26,714
All communication to keep
the ant colony buzzing along...

754
01:05:26,965 --> 01:05:29,425
...in an efficient, polite manner.

755
01:05:29,676 --> 01:05:34,388
"Here's your change."
"Paper or plastic?" "Credit or debit?"

756
01:05:34,598 --> 01:05:36,557
"Want ketchup with that?"

757
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:40,894
I don't want a straw,
I want real human moments.

758
01:05:41,146 --> 01:05:44,398
I want to see you.
I want you to see me.

759
01:05:44,608 --> 01:05:48,986
I don't want to give that up.
I don't want to be an ant, you know?

760
01:05:50,030 --> 01:05:52,323
Yeah, no...

761
01:05:52,616 --> 01:05:55,326
...I don't want to be an ant, either.

762
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:59,204
Thanks for kind ofjostling me there.
I've been...

763
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:05,294
...on zombie autopilot. I don't feel
like an ant, but I look like one.

764
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:10,049
D.H. Lawrence had this idea
of two people meeting...

765
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:12,593
...and instead ofjust passing...

766
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:16,805
...they accept "the confrontation
between their souls."

767
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:21,602
It's like freeing the brave,
reckless gods within us all.

768
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:24,355
Then it's like we have met.

769
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:29,693
I'm doing a
soap opera, you might be interested.

770
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:36,241
The characters are the fantasy
lives of the performers in it.

771
01:06:36,451 --> 01:06:41,914
So figure out something you've always
wanted to do, or a life you want...

772
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:45,042
...something like that.
We write that in...

773
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:51,757
...then you intersect with others
in some typical soap-opera fashion.

774
01:06:51,966 --> 01:06:56,762
Then I also want to show it live,
with the actors present.

775
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:59,848
So once the episode's screened...

776
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:06,146
...the audience can direct the actors
for subsequent episodes with menus.

777
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:08,107
It has to do with choices...

778
01:07:08,316 --> 01:07:13,112
...and honoring people's ability
to say what it is they want to see...

779
01:07:13,363 --> 01:07:17,032
...and consumerism and art
and commodity...

780
01:07:17,242 --> 01:07:22,579
...and if you don't like it, send it
back, and you get what you pay for...

781
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:26,542
...or just participating, you know,
making choices.

782
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:28,877
So do you want to do it?

783
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:34,216
Yeah, that sounds really cool.
I'd love to be in it, but...

784
01:07:35,427 --> 01:07:40,723
...I gotta ask you a question first.
I don't know how to say it, but...

785
01:07:41,683 --> 01:07:45,519
What's it like to be a character
in a dream? Because...

786
01:07:45,729 --> 01:07:50,357
...I'm not awake right now. I haven't
worn a watch since 4th grade.

787
01:07:50,567 --> 01:07:53,777
I think this is the same watch too.

788
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:58,699
I don't know if you're able
to answer that question.

789
01:07:58,950 --> 01:08:04,163
I'm just trying to get a sense
of where I am and what's going on.

790
01:08:04,372 --> 01:08:07,040
What about you? What's your name?

791
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:11,003
What's your address?
What are you doing?

792
01:08:13,006 --> 01:08:17,718
I can't really remember right now.
I can't really recall.

793
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:23,432
But that's beside the point, whether
I can dredge up information about...

794
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:29,021
...my address, or my mom's
maiden name or whatnot.

795
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:33,650
I've got the benefit in this reality,
if you call it that...

796
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:36,153
...of a consistent perspective.

797
01:08:36,404 --> 01:08:38,947
What is your consistent perspective?

798
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:42,868
It's mostly just me
dealing with a lot of people...

799
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:49,374
...who are exposing me
to information and ideas...

800
01:08:49,626 --> 01:08:52,294
...that seem vaguely familiar.

801
01:08:52,504 --> 01:08:56,715
But at the same time,
it's all very alien to me.

802
01:08:56,925 --> 01:09:01,512
I'm not in an objective,
rational world.

803
01:09:01,721 --> 01:09:05,224
Like, I've been flying around...

804
01:09:06,768 --> 01:09:09,728
It's weird,
because it's not a fixed state.

805
01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:13,357
It's more like a whole spectrum
of awareness.

806
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:16,985
The lucidity wavers.
Right now I know I'm dreaming.

807
01:09:17,195 --> 01:09:19,988
We're even talking about it. This is...

808
01:09:20,198 --> 01:09:24,451
...the most in myself
and in my thoughts I've been so far.

809
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:28,163
I'm talking about being in a dream.

810
01:09:28,373 --> 01:09:31,458
But I'm beginning to think...

811
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:35,170
...it's something I don't have
any precedent for.

812
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:38,048
It's totally unique.

813
01:09:38,258 --> 01:09:41,844
The quality of the environment...

814
01:09:42,053 --> 01:09:47,099
...and the information I'm receiving.
Like your soap opera, for example.

815
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:50,018
That's a really cool idea!

816
01:09:50,228 --> 01:09:53,480
I didn't come up with that.
It's outside myself...

817
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:57,484
...like something transmitted
to me externally.

818
01:09:57,735 --> 01:09:59,778
I don't know what this is.

819
01:09:59,946 --> 01:10:04,616
We think we're so limited
by the world and the confines...

820
01:10:04,826 --> 01:10:07,244
...but we're really
just creating them.

821
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:13,375
You keep trying to figure it out,
but now you know you're dreaming...

822
01:10:13,585 --> 01:10:18,130
...you can do anything.
You're dreaming, but you're awake.

823
01:10:18,339 --> 01:10:20,257
You have...

824
01:10:20,633 --> 01:10:24,678
...so many options,
and that's what life is about.

825
01:10:24,888 --> 01:10:29,433
I understand what you're saying.
It's up to me, I'm the dreamer.

826
01:10:29,684 --> 01:10:30,934
It's weird.

827
01:10:31,144 --> 01:10:33,186
So much of the information...

828
01:10:33,396 --> 01:10:36,064
...these people have been imparting...

829
01:10:36,274 --> 01:10:40,027
...has got this
really heavy connotation to it.

830
01:10:40,612 --> 01:10:42,905
Well, how do you feel?

831
01:10:43,615 --> 01:10:46,450
Sometimes I feel kind of isolated.

832
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:51,622
Most of the time, I feel connected,
engaged in this active process.

833
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:57,544
Which is weird. Most of the time
I've been passive, not responding...

834
01:10:57,795 --> 01:10:59,212
...except for now.

835
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:02,090
I've let information wash over me.

836
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:06,511
It's not necessarily passive
to not respond verbally.

837
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:11,892
We're communicating
on so many levels simultaneously.

838
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:15,395
Perhaps you're perceiving directly.

839
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:21,443
Most of the people I've encountered
and the things I want to say...

840
01:11:21,653 --> 01:11:25,447
...it's like they say it for me,
almost at my cue.

841
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:29,785
It's complete unto itself.

842
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:33,622
It's not a bad dream.
It's a great dream.

843
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:35,415
But...

844
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:40,253
...it's so unlike any other dream
I've ever had before.

845
01:11:40,505 --> 01:11:43,548
It's like "the" dream.

846
01:11:44,592 --> 01:11:47,052
It's like I'm being prepared
for something.

847
01:12:16,499 --> 01:12:20,085
"On this bridge," Lorca warns...

848
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:22,379
..."life is not a dream.

849
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:24,423
Beware and...

850
01:12:24,632 --> 01:12:28,635
...beware and beware."

851
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:34,141
So many think because "then"
happened, "now" isn't.

852
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:39,771
But didn't I mention? The ongoing
"wow" is happening right now.

853
01:12:39,981 --> 01:12:43,233
We are all coauthors
of this dancing exuberance...

854
01:12:43,484 --> 01:12:46,528
...where even our inabilities
are having a roast.

855
01:12:46,738 --> 01:12:51,324
We are the authors of ourselves,
coauthoring a Dostoyevsky novel...

856
01:12:51,534 --> 01:12:53,326
...starring clowns.

857
01:12:53,536 --> 01:12:56,079
This thing we're involved with,
the world...

858
01:12:56,330 --> 01:13:00,959
...is an opportunity to exhibit
how exciting alienation can be.

859
01:13:01,169 --> 01:13:03,920
Life is a matter of a miracle...

860
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:09,176
...collected by moments flabbergasted
to be in each other's presence.

861
01:13:09,427 --> 01:13:10,969
The world is an exam...

862
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:14,890
...to see if we can rise
into the direct experiences.

863
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:18,685
Eyesight is a test
to see if we can see beyond it.

864
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:21,813
Matter is a test for our curiosity.

865
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:25,108
Doubt is an exam for our vitality.

866
01:13:25,485 --> 01:13:31,156
Thomas Mann wrote that he would rather
participate in life than write.

867
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:35,535
Giacometti was once run down by a car.

868
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:38,914
He recalled falling
into a lucid faint...

869
01:13:39,207 --> 01:13:40,957
...a sudden exhilaration...

870
01:13:41,209 --> 01:13:44,795
...as he realized
something was happening to him.

871
01:13:45,129 --> 01:13:49,883
One assumes you can't understand
life and live simultaneously.

872
01:13:50,093 --> 01:13:54,638
I don't agree entirely. Which is
to say, I don't exactly disagree.

873
01:13:55,014 --> 01:13:59,726
I would say that life understood
is life lived.

874
01:14:00,019 --> 01:14:02,312
But the paradoxes bug me.

875
01:14:02,522 --> 01:14:07,150
I can learn to love, and make love,
to the paradoxes that bug me.

876
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,820
And on romantic evenings of self...

877
01:14:10,071 --> 01:14:13,115
...I go salsa dancing
with my confusion.

878
01:14:13,324 --> 01:14:16,535
Before you drift off, don't forget...

879
01:14:16,786 --> 01:14:18,537
...which is to say, remember.

880
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:23,834
Because remembering is so much more
a psychotic activity than forgetting.

881
01:14:24,085 --> 01:14:26,545
Lorca, in that same poem, said...

882
01:14:26,754 --> 01:14:31,049
...that the iguana will bite
those who do not dream.

883
01:14:32,093 --> 01:14:35,220
And, as one realizes...

884
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:40,851
...that one is a dream figure
in another person's dream...

885
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:45,021
...that is self-awareness.

886
01:15:09,589 --> 01:15:12,591
You haven't met yourself yet.

887
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:18,430
But the advantage to meeting others
in the meantime...

888
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:23,268
...is that one of them
may present you to yourself.

889
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:30,025
Examine the nature of everything
you observe.

890
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:33,528
For instance,
you might find yourself...

891
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:38,116
...walking through
a dream parking lot.

892
01:15:38,326 --> 01:15:42,370
And, yes, those are dream feet
inside your dream shoes.

893
01:15:42,663 --> 01:15:44,581
Part of your dream self.

894
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:48,460
And so, the person you appear to be
in the dream...

895
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:51,463
...cannot be who you really are.

896
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:53,673
This is an image...

897
01:15:53,883 --> 01:15:56,509
...a mental model.

898
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:22,285
- Do you remember me?
- No, I don't think so.

899
01:16:22,787 --> 01:16:27,749
At the station? You were on the
pay phone and you looked at me...

900
01:16:27,959 --> 01:16:29,918
...a few times.

901
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:34,256
I remember that,
but I don't remember that being you.

902
01:16:35,132 --> 01:16:37,092
Are you sure?

903
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:41,680
Maybe not.

904
01:16:41,973 --> 01:16:44,182
I was sitting down...

905
01:16:44,392 --> 01:16:47,394
...and you were looking at me.

906
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:45,827
My little friend,
dream no more. It's really here.

907
01:17:46,037 --> 01:17:48,330
It's called Efferdent Plus.

908
01:17:48,539 --> 01:17:53,752
In hell, you sink. In heaven, you rise
to your fullness of love.

909
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:58,548
Hurry up! Come on,
get in the car. Let's go.

910
01:17:59,050 --> 01:18:03,261
The story goes like this:
Billy Wilder runs into Louis Malle.

911
01:18:03,471 --> 01:18:05,764
This was the late '50s, early '60s.

912
01:18:06,015 --> 01:18:10,643
Malle had just made his most expensive
film, which cost $ 21/2 million.

913
01:18:10,895 --> 01:18:13,605
Wilder asks him what the film's about.

914
01:18:13,814 --> 01:18:16,649
Malle says, "It's a dream
within a dream."

915
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:20,028
Wilder says,
"You just lost $ 21/2 million."

916
01:18:21,197 --> 01:18:23,740
I feel a little apprehensive.

917
01:18:31,082 --> 01:18:34,000
For years, the notion
that life is a dream...

918
01:18:34,251 --> 01:18:38,380
...has been a pervasive theme
of philosophers and poets.

919
01:18:38,589 --> 01:18:42,717
Doesn't it make sense that death
would be wrapped in a dream?

920
01:18:42,927 --> 01:18:48,932
That, after death, your conscious life
would continue in a dream body?

921
01:18:49,141 --> 01:18:53,520
It would be the same dream body
as in your everyday dream life...

922
01:18:53,771 --> 01:18:58,983
...except that in the post-mortal
state, you could never again wake up.

923
01:18:59,193 --> 01:19:02,237
Never again return
to your physical body.

924
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:18,586
As the pattern gets more intricate,
being swept along isn't enough.

925
01:19:41,318 --> 01:19:43,027
What's the word, turd?

926
01:19:44,488 --> 01:19:48,658
- Hey, do you also drive a boat-car?
- A what?

927
01:19:49,076 --> 01:19:52,662
You gave me a ride in a car
that was also a boat.

928
01:19:52,872 --> 01:19:57,417
No, I don't have a "boat-car."
I don't know what you mean.

929
01:19:57,626 --> 01:20:03,256
This must be parallel universe night.
That cat who just ran out the door?

930
01:20:03,507 --> 01:20:06,050
He comes up and I say,
"What's the word?"

931
01:20:06,302 --> 01:20:10,054
He lays down a burrito,
looks at me and says:

932
01:20:10,264 --> 01:20:13,057
"I've returned
from the valley of death.

933
01:20:13,267 --> 01:20:16,311
I rapturously breathe in
the odors of life.

934
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:22,609
I've been to oblivion. I ferment
the desire to remember everything."

935
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,863
So, what did you say to that?

936
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:29,574
Well, I mean, what could I say?

937
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:33,495
I said, "If you microwave that,
poke holes in the plastic...

938
01:20:33,787 --> 01:20:38,917
...because they explode,
and I'm tired of cleaning up burrito."

939
01:20:43,964 --> 01:20:45,882
The jalapeÃ±os dry up.

940
01:20:46,759 --> 01:20:49,052
They're like little wheels.

941
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:56,017
When it was over,
all I could think about was how...

942
01:20:56,227 --> 01:20:59,812
...this entire notion of oneself...

943
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:01,022
...what we are...

944
01:21:01,273 --> 01:21:05,026
...is just this logical structure.

945
01:21:05,277 --> 01:21:10,323
A place to momentarily house
all the abstractions.

946
01:21:10,783 --> 01:21:13,409
It was a time to become conscious...

947
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:17,872
...to give form and coherence
to the mystery.

948
01:21:18,082 --> 01:21:21,501
And I had been a part of that.
It was a gift.

949
01:21:22,753 --> 01:21:28,091
Life was raging all around me,
and every moment was magical.

950
01:21:28,676 --> 01:21:34,931
I loved all the people, dealing with
all the contradictory impulses.

951
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:39,936
That's what I loved the most,
connecting with the people.

952
01:21:40,479 --> 01:21:43,898
Looking back, that's all
that really mattered.

953
01:22:41,248 --> 01:22:45,877
Kierkegaard's last words were,
"Sweep me up."

954
01:25:42,137 --> 01:25:43,888
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

955
01:25:50,854 --> 01:25:56,108
Weren't you in the boat-car?
The guy with the hat gave me a ride...

956
01:25:56,360 --> 01:26:00,112
...in his car-boat thing.
You were in the back seat.

957
01:26:00,364 --> 01:26:04,033
I'm not saying you don't know
what you're talking about...

958
01:26:04,243 --> 01:26:06,702
...but I don't know
what you're talking about.

959
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:12,291
You guys let me off at this specific
spot you gave him directions to.

960
01:26:12,501 --> 01:26:15,044
I get out,
ended up getting hit by a car.

961
01:26:15,254 --> 01:26:17,463
Then I woke up. I was dreaming.

962
01:26:17,673 --> 01:26:23,219
Later I found out I was still
dreaming, dreaming that I'd woken up.

963
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:26,639
False awakenings,
I used to have those a lot.

964
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:30,393
But I'm still in it now.
I can't get out of it.

965
01:26:30,602 --> 01:26:35,731
It's been going on forever.
I keep waking up into another dream.

966
01:26:35,941 --> 01:26:39,902
I'm getting creeped out, like
I'm talking to dead people.

967
01:26:40,153 --> 01:26:43,406
This woman on TV tells me how death...

968
01:26:43,657 --> 01:26:47,577
...is this dream-time
that exists out of life.

969
01:26:48,829 --> 01:26:51,497
I'm starting to think I'm dead.

970
01:26:53,917 --> 01:26:56,210
Let me tell you about a dream I had.

971
01:26:56,420 --> 01:27:01,716
When someone says that, usually
you're in for a very boring few minutes.

972
01:27:02,009 --> 01:27:04,468
But what else are you gonna do?

973
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:09,849
- I read this essay by Philip K. Dick.
- In your dream?

974
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:13,895
No, I read it before the dream.
It was the preamble.

975
01:27:14,146 --> 01:27:17,815
It was about that book,
Flow My Tears, the Policeman said.

976
01:27:18,066 --> 01:27:23,279
- He won an award for that one.
- That's the one he wrote really fast.

977
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:27,867
It just flowed out of him.
He felt he was channeling it.

978
01:27:28,076 --> 01:27:31,495
So four years later,
he was at this party.

979
01:27:31,705 --> 01:27:35,374
He met a woman with the same name
as the woman in the book.

980
01:27:35,667 --> 01:27:39,503
Her boyfriend had the same name
as the boyfriend in the book.

981
01:27:39,713 --> 01:27:42,965
She had an affair
with the chief of police.

982
01:27:43,175 --> 01:27:46,636
He had the same name
as the chief in his book.

983
01:27:46,887 --> 01:27:50,640
Everything she's saying
is right out of his book.

984
01:27:50,807 --> 01:27:54,435
That really freaks him out,
but what can he do?

985
01:27:54,645 --> 01:27:57,813
Shortly after that,
he was mailing a letter...

986
01:27:58,023 --> 01:28:03,319
...and he saw this kind of
shady-Iooking guy standing by his car.

987
01:28:03,528 --> 01:28:08,407
But instead of avoiding him,
he said, "Can I help you?"

988
01:28:08,659 --> 01:28:11,035
The guy said, "I ran out of gas."

989
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:15,373
He hands him some money,
which he never would've done.

990
01:28:15,582 --> 01:28:17,333
He gets home and thinks:

991
01:28:17,542 --> 01:28:21,587
"This guy can't get to a gas station.
He's out of gas."

992
01:28:21,797 --> 01:28:27,134
So he goes back, finds the guy
and takes him to a gas station.

993
01:28:27,427 --> 01:28:31,347
As he pulls up he thinks,
"This is in my book too.

994
01:28:31,682 --> 01:28:35,267
This exact station. This exact guy.
Everything."

995
01:28:35,477 --> 01:28:38,771
So this whole episode
is kind of creepy, right?

996
01:28:39,022 --> 01:28:43,067
He's telling his priest
how he wrote this book...

997
01:28:43,276 --> 01:28:46,696
...and four years later
all these things happened.

998
01:28:46,905 --> 01:28:50,658
And the priest says,
"That's the Book of Acts."

999
01:28:50,867 --> 01:28:53,369
He's like, "I've never read it."

1000
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:57,373
So he reads the Book of Acts,
and it's uncanny.

1001
01:28:57,624 --> 01:29:01,460
Even the characters' names
are the same as in the Bible.

1002
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:05,339
The Book of Acts
takes place in 50 A.D.

1003
01:29:05,549 --> 01:29:09,552
So Dick had this theory
that time was an illusion...

1004
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:11,887
...and that we were all in 50 A.D.

1005
01:29:12,097 --> 01:29:15,850
The reason he wrote this book
was that he somehow...

1006
01:29:16,059 --> 01:29:19,228
...punctured through
this veil of time.

1007
01:29:19,521 --> 01:29:23,607
He'd seen what was going on
in the Book of Acts.

1008
01:29:23,859 --> 01:29:28,279
He was really into Gnosticism
and the idea that this demon...

1009
01:29:28,488 --> 01:29:32,158
...created this illusion of time
to make us forget...

1010
01:29:32,451 --> 01:29:37,747
...that Christ was to return
and the kingdom of God would arrive.

1011
01:29:37,956 --> 01:29:42,585
Someone's trying to make us forget
that God is imminent.

1012
01:29:42,836 --> 01:29:45,212
That's what time and history is.

1013
01:29:45,422 --> 01:29:49,508
This kind of continuous
daydream or distraction.

1014
01:29:49,676 --> 01:29:54,430
I read it and thought, "That's weird."
And that night I had a dream.

1015
01:29:54,681 --> 01:29:58,017
There was this guy who
was supposed to be psychic.

1016
01:29:58,226 --> 01:30:01,228
But I was, like,
"He's not really a psychic."

1017
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:06,358
Then suddenly I start floating,
levitating up to the ceiling.

1018
01:30:06,777 --> 01:30:11,906
As I almost go through the roof,
I'm like, "Okay, I believe you."

1019
01:30:12,115 --> 01:30:15,868
And I float down,
and as my feet touch the ground...

1020
01:30:16,119 --> 01:30:20,706
...the psychic turns into a woman
in a green dress, Lady Gregory.

1021
01:30:20,916 --> 01:30:24,335
Lady Gregory was Yeats' patron,
this Irish person.

1022
01:30:24,586 --> 01:30:26,962
Though I'd never seen her image...

1023
01:30:27,172 --> 01:30:31,467
...I was sure that this was
the face of Lady Gregory.

1024
01:30:31,718 --> 01:30:34,095
So Lady Gregory turns to me and says:

1025
01:30:34,346 --> 01:30:37,556
"Let me explain
the nature of the universe.

1026
01:30:37,766 --> 01:30:41,811
Philip K. Dick is right about time,
but wrong that it's 50 A.D.

1027
01:30:42,062 --> 01:30:47,024
Actually, there's only one instant,
right now. And it's eternity.

1028
01:30:47,234 --> 01:30:52,363
It's an instant in which God
is posing a question, which is:

1029
01:30:52,614 --> 01:30:57,743
'Do you wanna be one with eternity,
do you wanna be in heaven? '

1030
01:30:57,994 --> 01:31:01,914
And we're all saying,
'No, thank you. Not just yet."'

1031
01:31:02,165 --> 01:31:06,710
So time is just this constant
saying no to God's invitation.

1032
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:11,257
That's what time is.
It's no more 50 A.D. Than it's 2001.

1033
01:31:11,466 --> 01:31:15,553
There's just one instant,
and that's what we're always in.

1034
01:31:15,887 --> 01:31:20,683
Then she tells me that this is
the narrative of everyone's life.

1035
01:31:20,892 --> 01:31:24,937
Behind the huge difference,
there is but one story...

1036
01:31:25,147 --> 01:31:27,606
...of moving from the no
to the yes.

1037
01:31:27,858 --> 01:31:30,901
All of life is,
"No, thank you. No, thank you."

1038
01:31:31,111 --> 01:31:33,779
Then ultimately it's, "Yes, I give in.

1039
01:31:34,030 --> 01:31:38,367
Yes, I accept. Yes, I embrace."
That's the journey.

1040
01:31:38,618 --> 01:31:42,454
Everyone gets to the yes
in the end, right?

1041
01:31:42,664 --> 01:31:43,664
Right.

1042
01:31:43,874 --> 01:31:47,626
So we continue walking,
and my dog runs over to me.

1043
01:31:47,878 --> 01:31:50,629
I'm so happy.
He's been dead for years.

1044
01:31:50,839 --> 01:31:54,592
So I'm petting him,
and there's this gross stuff...

1045
01:31:54,801 --> 01:31:57,094
...coming out of his stomach.

1046
01:31:57,345 --> 01:32:00,431
I look over at Lady Gregory,
and she coughs.

1047
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,725
She's like, "Excuse me."

1048
01:32:02,934 --> 01:32:07,313
And vomit dribbles down her chin.
It smells really bad.

1049
01:32:07,606 --> 01:32:12,401
And I think,
"That's not just the smell of vomit.

1050
01:32:12,652 --> 01:32:17,698
That's the smell of dead-person vomit."
So it's, like, doubly foul.

1051
01:32:17,949 --> 01:32:23,329
I realize I'm in the land of the dead.
Everyone around me was dead.

1052
01:32:23,538 --> 01:32:27,458
My dog had been dead 10 years,
Lady Gregory a lot longer.

1053
01:32:27,667 --> 01:32:31,503
When I woke up, I was like,
"That wasn't a dream.

1054
01:32:31,713 --> 01:32:35,925
That was a visitation
to this place, the land of the dead."

1055
01:32:36,134 --> 01:32:38,594
So how did you finally get out of it?

1056
01:32:38,887 --> 01:32:43,015
It was, like, one of those
life-altering experiences.

1057
01:32:43,225 --> 01:32:46,352
I never looked at the world
the same way again.

1058
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:49,772
But how did you finally
get out of the dream?

1059
01:32:49,981 --> 01:32:52,650
That's my problem. I'm trapped.

1060
01:32:52,859 --> 01:32:57,738
I keep thinking I'm waking up,
but I'm still in a dream.

1061
01:32:57,948 --> 01:33:02,159
I wanna wake up for real.
How do you really wake up?

1062
01:33:02,369 --> 01:33:06,038
I don't know.
I'm not very good at that anymore.

1063
01:33:06,289 --> 01:33:11,335
But if that's what you're thinking,
you should, if you can.

1064
01:33:11,544 --> 01:33:14,463
Because someday, you won't be able to.

1065
01:33:14,673 --> 01:33:17,716
But it's easy. You know, just wake up.
