00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,810
I'll never forget that summer.

3
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,900
I spent a week in the old house
where my mother grew up.

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,840

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,050
Yes.

10
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:24,500
Haru... how many times
have I told her?

11
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,960
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

12
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,300
Haru!

13
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,300
You're blocking the driveway again.

14
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,230
Sho?

15
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,400
Where are you?

16
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,470
Don't touch!

17
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,600
These aren't for you.

18
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,000
- Arrietty!
- What?

19
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,000
You went outside again, didn't you?

20
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,590
And you might clean up
this room, young lady.

21
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,510
It's my own little garden.

22
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,300
If you ask me,
it looks like a mess.

23
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,810
Oh! Is that a bay leaf?

24
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:19,980
Oh well, I guess this means
your birthday comes early.

25
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,030
Enough for a whole year.

26
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,540
But the bay tree's
so far away.

27
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,000
If a human bean saw you...

28
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,710
I'm always careful.

29
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,670
The world is full of
dangerous creatures.

30
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,960
Your great uncle...

31
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,720
... was eaten by a frog. Right?

32
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,760
Doesn't that shiso smell lovely?

33
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,680
Yes, it does.

34
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,230
With a bit of sugar
I could make shiso juice.

35
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,900
Wait till tonight.
I'll borrow some for you.

36
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,910
My first borrowing ever!
I've been practicing night and day.

37
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,070
Papa's home.

38
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,160
Welcome back.

39
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:21,710
- Papa, about tonight...
- There's a boy in the house.

40
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,380
I saw him.

41
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,760
- No! Arrietty...
- He didn't see me!

42
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,930
I hid behind the bay leaf.
Papa, we're still going, aren't we?

43
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,810
I won't hear of it.
It's too dangerous.

44
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,020
But he's just a child!

45
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:42,110
Papa, I've been waiting
for such a long time.

46
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,360
The children can be more savage
than the grownups.

47
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,280
I'll be fine!

48
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,580
Youngsters go to bed early.

49
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,120
Thank you Papa!

50
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,620
But Pod...

51
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,130
The boy's sick.
Don't worry, we'll be fine.

52
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,630
But still...

53
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,130
Stop worrying, Mother.
We'll be extra careful.

54
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,760
Arrietty will be 14 soon.

55
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:16,890
Someday she'll have to
survive without our help.

56
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:21,480
Sometimes I think
we're the last Borrowers in the world.

57
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:50,430
Whatever you need,
just ask Haru.

58
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,680
All right.

59
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,850
Haru, I'm depending on you.

60
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,810
Yes ma'am.

61
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:06,150
Let's shut the screen.
Keep the bugs out.

62
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,570
Shouldn't you wear something darker?

63
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,740
I already decided!

64
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,750
I hope you can borrow
some tissue paper.

65
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,170
And a bit of sugar, perhaps?

66
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:09,090
We could have shiso juice
and sugar for the tea.

67
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,090
But anything's just fine.

68
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,930
We'll be back soon.

69
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,810
Please be careful.

70
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,230
We will.

71
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,260
Arrietty!

72
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,320
Sorry!

73
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:58,110
- Hold these for me.
- Yes, Papa.

74
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,070
Hold on tight!

75
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,240
Arrietty?

76
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,570
Ready?

77
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,200
Everything's so huge!

78
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,870
The world of human beans.

79
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,000
The sugar's over there.

80
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,630
Wait for me down there.

81
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,050
Papa, you're great!

82
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,560
Now let's get that tissue.

83
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,000
Papa, look.

84
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,830
Your first borrowing.

85
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,290
Be careful, it's sharp.

86
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,670
I will!

87
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,400
Papa, borrowing is such fun!

88
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,580
Look down there.

89
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,830
Rats. Steer clear of them.
They're trouble.

90
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,630
I'm not afraid.

91
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:32,300
I'm ready for anything.
I've got this!

92
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:36,510
Sometimes it's best not to
go looking for danger.

93
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,480
What is this place?

94
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,440
Human beans made it
for their dolls.

95
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,160
It's just perfect for us!

96
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:43,410
I'm sure Mother would love
that dresser over there.

97
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,330
These things aren't for borrowing.

98
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:48,670
If anything went missing
they'd know right away.

99
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,670
Oh...

100
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,980
Don't be afraid.

101
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,500
I saw you.

102
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,550
In the garden.
It was you, wasn't it?

103
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:47,850
My mother told me about you.

104
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:52,680
She saw little people here
when she was young.

105
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,190
Was it you that she saw?

106
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,980
Was it?

107
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,410
I'm sorry, Papa.

108
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,240
He saw me today,
out in the garden.

109
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,250
I should've been more careful.

110
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,080
I hope he didn't frighten you.

111
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:04,090
Best not tell your mother,
it will only worry her.

112
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:05,590
All right.

113
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:16,600
You don't always have to run.
Observe them first, then decide.

114
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,950
We're home.

115
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:33,870
Safe and sound.

116
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,800
And...?

117
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,140
Things didn't go well this time.

118
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:53,600
This light gave out
before we finished.

119
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,770
Oh dear.

120
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:59,480
We had to give up
on the sugar.

121
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,480
Don't give it a thought.
At least you're safe and sound.

122
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:08,950
Arrietty, you found something.
Show your mother your first borrowing.

123
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,870
What a pretty pin.

124
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,000
Time for bed.

125
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,680
Good night.

126
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:41,190
She looks worn out.

127
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,860
Shall I make some tea?

128
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,510
Sho!

129
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:21,850
Come in the house.
You'll catch cold out there.

130
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,140
A cube of sugar?
But whatever for?

131
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,060
He left it by the grating.

132
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,570
It's probably the same one
I dropped last night.

133
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,240
What?

134
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,070
What do you mean,
you dropped it?

135
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,250
Don't touch it.
Do you understand?

136
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,250
It's a trap.

137
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:35,630
They're trying to catch us!

138
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:39,420
We'll have to stop borrowing
for a while.

139
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,180
Maybe they already
know where we are.

140
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,260
Pod, we'll have to move!

141
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,930
This was such a lovely house.

142
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,440
Now we'll have to
start all over again.

143
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:56,270
Well, let's see how things go.

144
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,610
Now eat, soup's getting cold.

145
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,780
Why did it have to be sugar?

146
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,050
Thank you Arrietty.

147
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:29,310
I wanted to hang everything
while the sun's out.

148
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,980
You know I love doing laundry.

149
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,650
- I'm going to nap for a bit.
- All right.

150
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,320
"You forgot something"

151
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,280
You came back.

152
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,120
Wait, don't go.

153
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,300
Please leave us alone.

154
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:54,130
I wanted to tell you that.

155
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,300
I want to talk to you.

156
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,800
Human beans are dangerous.

157
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:04,140
If we're seen, we have to leave.
My parents said so.

158
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,310
You have a family?
I envy you.

159
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,610
Don't you have one?

160
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,650
Yes, but I practically
never see my father.

161
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:19,660
Mother's so busy at work,
she barely has time for me.

162
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,160
Really...

163
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,830
My name's Sho.
What's your name?

164
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,550
Do you have one?

165
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:36,920
Of course I have a name!

166
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,840
It's Arrietty.

167
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,850
Arrietty... Arrietty...

168
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:45,850
That's pretty.

169
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:05,580
Won't you let me see you?
Just for a moment.

170
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:14,960
Just a peek. Please?

171
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:09,230
What's happening?
Oh my gosh, it's a crow!

172
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,190
You can't come in here!

173
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,130
What got into that bird?
They never behave like that.

174
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,420
Maybe it's nesting season
or something.

175
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:48,220
Now I have to replace this screen.
Where do we keep them?

176
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:50,640
Are you all right?

177
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,810
Maybe you should take
some of your medicine.

178
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:56,650
Thanks, Haru.

179
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,480
I feel fine.

180
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:08,830
The nesting season, eh?

181
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:20,090
Have yourself
a nice long rest now.

182
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,900
Papa...

183
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:26,900
- I told you to stay away.
- I'm sorry.

184
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,990
I wanted to do
something to help.

185
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,700
But he didn't see me.

186
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,040
You put your family in danger.

187
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,090
I won't say it again.
Understand?

188
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,420
Yes.

189
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,720
We'd better start looking.

190
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,650
It's time.

191
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,150
Pod...

192
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,960
"You forgot something"

193
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,190
Afternoon! Package for you.

194
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:46,650
Thanks again ma'am.
It's pretty hot out there.

195
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:50,400
Listen, know any good
pest control companies?

196
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,490
Pest control?

197
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:58,500
Here's one. "Squeaky Klean Service."

198
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:02,330
Squeaky Klean Service?
Let me just write that down.

199
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,500
Haying problems with mice?

200
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:12,680
Maybe it's mice,
or maybe it's something else.

201
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:17,180
Between us, it's little people.

202
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,020
I've seen them myself.

203
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:28,940
A crow tried to
fly into your room?

204
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,070
I hope it didn't scare you.

205
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:34,870
Don't worry, Aunt Sadako.
Haru chased it out.

206
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:38,700
I was so astonished!

207
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,210
I never saw such a huge...

208
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:44,880
Excitement's the worst thing
in the world for his heart.

209
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:48,170
He came here for peace and quiet.

210
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:52,220
If anything were to happen
before the operation...

211
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,550
I know, I know.

212
00:41:56,100 --> 00:42:00,060
I realize his mother's
terribly busy at work.

213
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:03,270
But to go abroad on business
and leave a sick child?

214
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:08,070
It must be terribly hard for you
without your mother.

215
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,780
I don't mind.

216
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:14,070
I suppose the divorce
couldn't be helped.

217
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:18,740
But why can't she be here,
when he needs her so?

218
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,500
Aunt Sadako, who made
that little house in my room?

219
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,210
It's amazing.

220
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:34,420
You mean the doll house?

221
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,760
That doll house
belongs to your mother.

222
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:41,270
She left it here
when she moved out.

223
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,600
It was hers?

224
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:46,900
My father had it
made to order in England.

225
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:49,650
It was for the little people.

226
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:54,070
My father claimed he'd seen them.

227
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,280
He waited for so many years.

228
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:01,450
He always said that house
was a present for them.

229
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:05,460
But I'm afraid they never
showed themselves again.

230
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:09,790
Not in my father's lifetime,
nor in mine.

231
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:14,920
Young Master, did you happen to see
any little people in your room?

232
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:20,470
Unfortunately... no.

233
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,640
It's been in our family
for four generations.

234
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:29,150
If you like it,
it will be yours someday.

235
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:30,810
You mean it?

236
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,360
Yes.

237
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:37,280
Have you looked inside?
It's quite beautiful!

238
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:45,500
- Haru, could you turn off the lights?
- Yes'm.

239
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:59,180
This is the living room.

240
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:04,180
All the furnishings were hand made
by a real furniture maker.

241
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:07,930
Isn't it wonderful?

242
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:13,480
Here's the library on the first floor.
There's even a bathroom.

243
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:18,200
But the next room
is my personal favorite.

244
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:21,030
Haru, could you open that up?

245
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,200
Let's see,
I think it opens this way.

246
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,710
Everything is so detailed!

247
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,210
Detailed and just like
the real thing.

248
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:38,510
That's a real oven.
You could use it for baking.

249
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,720
Beautiful, just beautiful.

250
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:43,720
What a pity Father's dream
never came true.

251
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:45,390
And it's been so Long...

252
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,890
Maybe the little people
are gone now.

253
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:13,330
Mother, we've had
these pictures three years.

254
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,870
Don't you want new ones?

255
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:17,870
I love those pictures.

256
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:22,050
I've always dreamed
I'd see the real ocean someday.

257
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,170
Besides, there's no point
changing them now.

258
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,390
Papa's later than usual.

259
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:36,560
I hope he didn't get caught
in that downpour.

260
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:44,070
- Papa?
- That's the back door.

261
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:49,410
Papa! Welcome back...

262
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:53,240
Twisted my leg.

263
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:55,750
It's lucky Spiller found me.

264
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,090
Pod?

265
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:07,760
Oh dear, you're hurt!
Hurry, bring him in.

266
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:11,260
Does it hurt?

267
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,760
It's not broken.
I'll be fine in no time.

268
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,100
I'll get some cold water.

269
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,610
Here's a towel, better dry off.

270
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:24,770
Who's this?

271
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:33,120
It's not just the
three of us after all.

272
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:42,960
Gotta go.

273
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:46,130
Wait, at least stay
and have some tea.

274
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:58,810
I'll see to your father.
Get Spiller a cup of tea.

275
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,980
Thank you Spiller.
Papa's so lucky you came along.

276
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:09,820
We're so grateful for your help.

277
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:13,160
Listen, have you seen
other Borrowers?

278
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:17,330
You see, we thought
we might be the only ones left.

279
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,120
This many.

280
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:25,750
Then Cousin Lupy must be okay!

281
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:29,510
Can I see your bow?

282
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:37,510
You use this for hunting.

283
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,520
Give that back.
It's not a toy.

284
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:02,870
Gotta go.

285
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:07,670
Won't you stay
and have a bite?

286
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:11,880
Got this.

287
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:17,050
A cricket's leg!

288
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,970
Want some? It's real good.

289
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:22,060
No thanks!

290
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:27,770
Take care.

291
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,900
Thanks again.

292
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:36,240
I'll see him out.

293
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:45,250
You were looking
for a new place.

294
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:50,460
I tripped and fell. Couldn't move.
Then Spiller came.

295
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:52,260
Really...

296
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:55,930
His territory reaches past the river.

297
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,640
And he knows a few
places we could live.

298
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:03,520
That's good I suppose.

299
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,940
I'd hate to camp out.

300
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:12,530
But I doubt we'll find anything
quite as nice as this.

301
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:19,780
I'm glad there are
still others like us.

302
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:22,910
Do you have friends
and family, Spiller?

303
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:26,290
Family? No, just me.

304
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:29,290
Well, I hope you
can come again.

305
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:32,630
My mother's stew
is the best in the world.

306
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:39,360
Haru?

307
00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:01,010
Arrietty, your stitches
need to be closer together.

308
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:02,720
Pull it apart and do it again.

309
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:08,390
Why do we need
such a big sack anyway?

310
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:18,900
I'm going to look in on Papa.

311
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:23,070
Papa, can I come in?

312
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:27,040
How's your leg?

313
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,410
I'll be walking soon.

314
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,750
Papa?

315
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:36,040
Are we going to move?

316
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:40,760
We were seen.
We've no choice but to move.

317
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:48,350
I don't think every
human bean is dangerous.

318
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,100
Arrietty...

319
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:55,940
Before you were born, there were
two other families living in this house.

320
00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:59,110
One family went missing.
They just disappeared.

321
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,440
The other one moved away.

322
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:03,740
They were seen by humans.

323
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:07,620
No matter what happens,
we've got to survive.

324
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:09,790
Papa...

325
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:29,720
What in heaven's name!
Is this an earthquake?

326
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:55,620
Mother!

327
00:54:58,170 --> 00:54:59,630
It won't open.

328
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,760
The frame's buckled.

329
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,870
The... the wall!

330
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,240
Homily!

331
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,570
Homily!

332
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:14,910
I always dreamed
of having a kitchen like this.

333
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:22,810
Gather only the things we need.

334
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:32,950
We can't carry all that.

335
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:36,830
And Homily, take nothing
from the doll house.

336
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
I'll make sure it's safe.

337
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:44,290
- Stay with your mother.
- Yes Papa.

338
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:18,200
You finally came.

339
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:31,010
Do you like your new kitchen?

340
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,010
Our house is a disaster.

341
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:40,390
But it doesn't matter.
I came to say goodbye.

342
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,900
Can I look?

343
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:12,710
You're beautiful.

344
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:18,050
We have to move.

345
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,930
We were seen.

346
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:24,770
Borrowers aren't meant to be seen.

347
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:26,270
Borrowers...?

348
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:28,770
We borrow from human beans.

349
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:31,400
Things we need.
Things they won't miss.

350
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:35,780
Soap and cookies and sugar.
Electricity and gas, too.

351
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:39,530
Even my great-grandfather
was a Borrower.

352
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:43,120
No one ever saw them?

353
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,120
Probably.

354
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,130
It's all my fault.

355
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:55,130
Niya, don't be like that.
Be nice to her.

356
00:59:56,590 --> 01:00:00,640
Are there other little people
like you in the house?

357
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:04,640
No, it's just my father
and mother and me.

358
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:06,980
What about in other houses?

359
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:10,980
I'm sure there are some.
I've only met one so far.

360
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:12,690
Oh.

361
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:17,450
Soon you'll be the only one left.

362
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,620
Every year there's fewer of you, right?

363
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:25,490
You're a doomed species, you know.

364
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:29,330
That's not true!

365
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:32,880
There's lots more of us.
Spiller said so!

366
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:34,500
Spiller?

367
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,670
He's one of us.

368
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:40,180
And he said there's lots more.

369
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:46,270
Do you know how many people
there are in the world?

370
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:50,350
There are 6.7 billion of us.

371
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,400
Six point seven billion...?

372
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:55,480
What about you?

373
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,860
I don't know.

374
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:01,030
There's probably
just a few of you.

375
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:05,370
Until my mom told me,
I didn't know little people existed.

376
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:11,040
Lots of species
are already extinct.

377
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:14,710
I've only seen them
in books, though.

378
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:18,170
So many beautiful species...

379
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:22,010
But the environment changed,
so they died out.

380
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:27,060
It's sad, but that's what fate
has in store for your kind.

381
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:30,180
Fate, you say?

382
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:35,400
You're the one who changed things.
Now we have to move away.

383
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:39,530
We have to survive.
That's what Papa said.

384
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:42,530
So we're leaving,
even though it's dangerous.

385
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:48,910
We'll make do, we always have.
You don't know anything about us!

386
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:52,620
We're not going
to die out that easily!

387
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:58,210
I'm sorry.
You're right.

388
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:01,550
I'm the one
who's going to die.

389
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,560
It's my heart.

390
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:12,770
They're going to operate
next week, but it's probably hopeless.

391
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:14,440
Your heart...?

392
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:20,110
I've always been sick.
I can't play like other kids.

393
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:25,280
From the moment I saw you,
I wanted to protect you.

394
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:27,780
I can't even do that.

395
01:02:28,450 --> 01:02:30,830
I hope you can forgive me.

396
01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:35,330
I didn't know
you were so sick.

397
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,280
What in the world
is this doing here?

398
01:03:29,510 --> 01:03:32,350
It's the kitchen
from the doll house!

399
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:50,530
Found you!

400
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,330
What's wrong?

401
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:01,130
My mother... I heard her voice.

402
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:35,580
This really is a great kitchen.

403
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:39,160
You're not the only
little one here, I bet.

404
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:02,770
I have to go.

405
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:54,030
Let me out! Help me!

406
01:07:02,270 --> 01:07:04,060
The ceiling's tilted.

407
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:33,480
Hello? Squeaky Klean Service?

408
01:08:33,730 --> 01:08:36,110
Can you make
an urgent house call?

409
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:39,400
There's something small
in the house. No, not mice.

410
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:40,860
Not mice?

411
01:08:40,990 --> 01:08:43,160
I don't want them killed.

412
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:44,870
You need trapping services?

413
01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:48,210
Yes, that's it.
I want you to trap them.

414
01:08:59,220 --> 01:09:00,840
Sho! Sho!

415
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:05,680
Arrietty!

416
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:12,900
Mother's gone!

417
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:18,030
Someone took the roof off.
I think a human bean got her!

418
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:25,450
Momma...

419
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:37,090
We'll find her.

420
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:14,040
It's locked.

421
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:20,260
Let's try the room next door.

422
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:41,070
Can't budge it.

423
01:10:41,190 --> 01:10:42,440
Wait!

424
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:53,790
I can fit.

425
01:11:29,330 --> 01:11:30,330
Amazing!

426
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:08,200
No, that's not it.

427
01:12:09,070 --> 01:12:12,370
There's a dirt road.
Turn in there.

428
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:16,040
- Before the bridge?
- No, not that one!

429
01:12:23,710 --> 01:12:26,090
Haru opened this.

430
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:29,550
Then she must've
taken Mother someplace.

431
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:07,710
Are you okay?

432
01:13:17,430 --> 01:13:20,440
What's taking them so long?

433
01:13:54,050 --> 01:13:56,720
Mother! Where are you?

434
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:15,160
But the lock...

435
01:14:15,490 --> 01:14:16,830
Lock?

436
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:21,500
Could I have
some hot milk?

437
01:14:21,830 --> 01:14:24,540
Okay, wait just a minute.

438
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,340
Thanks.

439
01:15:13,010 --> 01:15:16,720
I'm a little hungry.
Are there any cookies?

440
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:24,230
Mother!

441
01:15:25,810 --> 01:15:27,350
Mother!

442
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:37,450
- Mother?
- Arrietty!

443
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:46,870
Here I am, Arrietty!

444
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:48,250
Mother!

445
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:54,090
Arrietty!

446
01:16:20,950 --> 01:16:25,620
There they are.
They finally found the right road.

447
01:16:46,730 --> 01:16:48,810
Another human bean!

448
01:16:52,610 --> 01:16:54,320
It's all right, Mother.

449
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:20,680
We'd like to take a look
around first.

450
01:17:20,930 --> 01:17:22,340
Take your time.

451
01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:49,410
Now who can this be?

452
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:52,710
Haru? Haru!

453
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,710
What's going on here?

454
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:00,720
It's finally happened.
The little people are here!

455
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,340
Little people?

456
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:04,720
That's right.

457
01:18:04,850 --> 01:18:07,390
And what little thieves they are!

458
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,570
It's really true.

459
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:29,870
They steal from
all over the house.

460
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,210
That's why things
were going missing.

461
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:36,250
Haru, what's gotten into you?

462
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:39,460
All these years I thought
it was my imagination.

463
01:18:39,630 --> 01:18:41,590
Well, it wasn't.

464
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:45,890
You certainly didn't need
to call the exterminators.

465
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:50,390
We'd better hurry.
The house is full of them!

466
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:54,390
You'll believe me
when you see this.

467
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:57,310
This is their nest.

468
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:00,780
Nest?

469
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:09,450
It looks like a pile
of old junk to me.

470
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:15,620
What? I swear I saw it.

471
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:19,880
Haru, I'm sending
the exterminators away.

472
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:22,590
Now, wait just a minute.

473
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:26,050
The doll house!

474
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:36,600
Young Master? May we come in
for a minute?

475
01:19:36,850 --> 01:19:37,980
All right.

476
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:52,740
You won't believe this.
They stole the little kitchen too.

477
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:57,120
You'll see, it's gone.

478
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:02,000
It's not gone.

479
01:20:02,210 --> 01:20:04,510
Such a pleasure to look at.

480
01:20:17,690 --> 01:20:21,520
Wait, I can prove it!
I have one of them in a jar.

481
01:20:24,490 --> 01:20:27,530
I wonder what's gotten into Haru.

482
01:20:28,030 --> 01:20:29,030
Hmm?

483
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:33,540
Fresh herbs, how lovely.

484
01:20:48,550 --> 01:20:50,680
Someone was making tea!

485
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:57,060
It's just as my father said.
There are little people living here.

486
01:21:00,270 --> 01:21:01,560
Yes, there are.

487
01:21:02,570 --> 01:21:05,020
So Haru really saw them.

488
01:21:05,150 --> 01:21:07,690
Though she accused them of stealing.

489
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:11,410
They're not thieves at all!
They're Borrowers.

490
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:16,080
I mean, I wish
I could see them.

491
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,580
I bet they're here somewhere.

492
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:27,590
I'm sure they are.

493
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:43,480
Excuse me, ma'am!

494
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:46,270
Where'd you like us to start?

495
01:21:54,830 --> 01:21:56,620
Are you all right?

496
01:21:59,290 --> 01:22:01,290
It got away.

497
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:04,130
I had one and it got away!

498
01:22:04,340 --> 01:22:07,960
It's not just my imagination.
There are little people here!

499
01:22:09,050 --> 01:22:11,760
Next time I swear
I'll get them!

500
01:22:26,570 --> 01:22:30,490
How far is it to where
we're meeting Spiller?

501
01:22:31,650 --> 01:22:35,160
It's just outside the forest.
Then we head down river.

502
01:22:36,490 --> 01:22:41,160
I'm already worn out.
I'll never make it that far.

503
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:58,010
Let's hurry.

504
01:22:59,310 --> 01:23:01,020
I can't do it...

505
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:32,050
Better have something to eat.
We'll be walking till morning.

506
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:33,340
What?

507
01:23:35,380 --> 01:23:36,720
I'm so sorry.

508
01:23:37,890 --> 01:23:42,390
It's my fault we had to leave
such a wonderful house.

509
01:23:46,650 --> 01:23:48,230
That's in the past.

510
01:23:49,570 --> 01:23:53,400
We'll make another wonderful house,
the three of us together.

511
01:23:59,370 --> 01:24:01,410
I'm going outside for a bit.

512
01:24:02,910 --> 01:24:04,750
Don't go too far, now.

513
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:41,450
Niya!

514
01:25:51,690 --> 01:25:52,850
Niya...

515
01:26:11,870 --> 01:26:13,540
Just a little further.

516
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:37,900
Spiller!

517
01:26:52,620 --> 01:26:54,420
That's everything.

518
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:57,750
Now let's get moving.

519
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,250
Okay.

520
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:05,930
Mother, are you all right?

521
01:27:18,070 --> 01:27:19,440
Arrietty!

522
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:50,970
Sho!

523
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:56,310
Arrietty...

524
01:28:15,830 --> 01:28:17,670
We're leaving now.

525
01:28:22,670 --> 01:28:24,510
I'm glad I made it.

526
01:28:28,510 --> 01:28:30,680
Niya showed me the way.

527
01:28:38,310 --> 01:28:41,190
Thanks. Take care of yourself.

528
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:48,990
I brought this.

529
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:58,210
I hope you'll accept it this time.

530
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,380
Thank you.

531
01:29:19,230 --> 01:29:21,400
I have to go.

532
01:29:22,730 --> 01:29:24,570
When is your operation?

533
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:26,900
The day after tomorrow.

534
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:31,570
I'm going to be okay.
You gave me the courage to live.

535
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:41,920
For luck.

536
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,090
Thanks.

537
01:29:55,060 --> 01:29:57,600
You protected me after all.

538
01:29:59,770 --> 01:30:01,440
Arrietty...

539
01:30:03,810 --> 01:30:06,770
I hope you have
the best life ever.

540
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:10,610
Goodbye.

541
01:30:14,530 --> 01:30:19,120
Arrietty, you're a part
of me now.

542
01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:22,790
I'll never forget you, ever.

543
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:47,830
..

544
01:33:51,630 --> 01:33:56,840
A Studio Ghibli Film

545
01:33:59,220 --> 01:34:03,680
THE END
