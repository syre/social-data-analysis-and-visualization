how much trust it takes two people

Because the more they talk about it,
the wetter they get.

The only difference is,
I can fuck someone I've just met.

481
00:38:40,853 --> 00:38:43,846
Hundreds paper-clipped everywhere
Iike leaves.

482
00:38:43,929 --> 00:38:45,890
[ Hissing ]

483
00:38:51,447 --> 00:38:54,857
Then one by one
he ironed all of it.

484
00:38:59,976 --> 00:39:01,895
[ Hissing Continues ]

485
00:39:01,978 --> 00:39:04,689
- Did he sleep?
- No, but neither did I.

486
00:39:10,174 --> 00:39:12,937
All night long
I listened to that sound.

487
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,814
- What sound?
- The sound of money.

488
00:39:16,816 --> 00:39:18,734
[ Fluttering ]

489
00:39:22,102 --> 00:39:23,457
Where is it now?

490
00:39:24,542 --> 00:39:26,179
It's in his office.

491
00:39:26,262 --> 00:39:28,254
I saw it this morning.

492
00:39:33,383 --> 00:39:35,344
I need to go to the store.

493
00:39:39,462 --> 00:39:41,861
It's in a case on his desk.

494
00:39:41,944 --> 00:39:44,019
Does the case lock?

495
00:39:44,103 --> 00:39:45,458
Yes.

496
00:39:46,543 --> 00:39:51,224
- Huh. Tell me about Johnnie.
- Johnnie?

497
00:39:51,307 --> 00:39:53,268
Sounds like he and Caesar
don't like each other.

498
00:39:53,341 --> 00:39:55,301
Like each other?
They hate each other.

499
00:39:55,342 --> 00:39:57,147
- Why?
- I don't know.

500
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,305
Happened long before
I came around.

501
00:39:59,389 --> 00:40:03,028
I think it's basically Caesar
thinks Johnnie's a complete idiot...

502
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:05,707
but, you know,
what can you do?

503
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:08,387
Johnnie runs Chicago
'cause Gino's his father.

504
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:09,586
Who's Gino?

505
00:40:11,463 --> 00:40:12,985
Gino Marzzone.

506
00:40:14,466 --> 00:40:18,511
Marzzone, as in Angelo Marzzone,
head of the Marzzone family?

507
00:40:18,584 --> 00:40:20,628
Yeah, that's his brother.

508
00:40:22,713 --> 00:40:24,193
Shit.

509
00:40:25,309 --> 00:40:27,874
Gino Marzzone's coming to your place
tonight to pick up the money?

510
00:40:27,947 --> 00:40:29,627
Yeah.

511
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:32,233
And Johnnie Marzzone's his son?
That's Johnnie?

512
00:40:32,306 --> 00:40:33,755
Yeah.

513
00:40:36,508 --> 00:40:38,634
Sweet Jesus.

514
00:40:45,433 --> 00:40:46,872
It's perfect.

515
00:40:46,955 --> 00:40:49,791
Gino Marzzone's coming to your place
tonight. This is a big deal.

516
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:52,878
Caesar's gonna want to do it right.
He won't want to look like an idiot.

517
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:55,516
- Has Gino been to your place before?
- Yeah, twice.

518
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,561
- What happened?
- Caesar was really nervous.

519
00:40:58,634 --> 00:41:00,834
He kept cleaning the apartment.

520
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:04,118
The first time he picked out the dress
he wanted me to wear.

521
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,120
Did Johnnie ever hit on you?

522
00:41:06,193 --> 00:41:09,561
Johnnie hits on me all the time.
He hits on anything in high heels.

523
00:41:09,602 --> 00:41:13,722
- Did Caesar ever see this?
- He does it right in front of him.

524
00:41:13,794 --> 00:41:16,442
This is getting better and better.
Go on.

525
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:20,562
Well, Gino doesn't speak much English,
or at least he pretends not to...

526
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,845
so he usually gets
right to the point.

527
00:41:22,876 --> 00:41:25,680
Both times they only talked
for about five minutes.

528
00:41:25,764 --> 00:41:27,922
They had a drink
and then they left.

529
00:41:28,005 --> 00:41:30,122
- What did Gino drink?
- Scotch.

530
00:41:30,206 --> 00:41:34,845
Glenlivet. I remember that 'cause
Caesar made a big deal about it.

531
00:41:37,526 --> 00:41:39,360
All right.

532
00:41:46,326 --> 00:41:48,369
I have an idea
how to make this work.

533
00:41:49,923 --> 00:41:52,728
[ Corky ] Go back and get ready.
Take your time. Make it real.

534
00:41:53,843 --> 00:41:56,367
What time did you say
they'd be there?

535
00:41:56,450 --> 00:42:00,371
[ Violet ] The plane gets in
at 7:00, so I'd say around 8:00.

536
00:42:00,444 --> 00:42:02,810
- [ Yawns ]
- [ Corky ] All right.

537
00:42:02,883 --> 00:42:05,334
Now, at some point,
Caesar's gonna quit.

538
00:42:05,366 --> 00:42:09,734
I guess sometime around 6:00,
making sure he's got time to get ready.

539
00:42:09,765 --> 00:42:14,447
As soon as he's done, you'll be there
to put a big drink in his hand.

540
00:42:14,531 --> 00:42:17,492
[ Caesar ] Unbelievable
what this guy Shelly did.

541
00:42:17,575 --> 00:42:20,171
I'll tell you, Shelly's
one smart-ass motherfucker.

542
00:42:20,254 --> 00:42:24,415
I mean, he was
one smart-ass motherfucker.

543
00:42:24,457 --> 00:42:27,574
Poor boy.
Has to work so hard.

544
00:42:30,817 --> 00:42:32,736
[ Moans ]

545
00:42:32,819 --> 00:42:35,530
[ Corky ]
You want him to relax, unwind.

546
00:42:36,979 --> 00:42:39,096
You look good enough to eat.

547
00:42:40,337 --> 00:42:42,099
[ Violet ]
Where will you be?

548
00:42:42,172 --> 00:42:44,455
[ Corky ] I'll be waiting
in the apartment next door.

549
00:42:44,539 --> 00:42:47,782
- [ Violet ] Waiting for what?
- [ Corky ] For the shower.

550
00:42:47,855 --> 00:42:49,815
That's gonna be our signal.

551
00:42:50,774 --> 00:42:53,693
When he's done with his shower,
you'll go to the bar.

552
00:42:55,143 --> 00:42:57,698
You'll get out the scotch
that Gino drinks.

553
00:42:57,781 --> 00:43:01,024
As you do, the bottle
will slip from your hands.

554
00:43:02,296 --> 00:43:03,620
An accident.

555
00:43:05,903 --> 00:43:08,062
[ Caesar ]
Vi, what the hell was that?

556
00:43:08,823 --> 00:43:10,742
Vi, you can't hear me?

557
00:43:10,825 --> 00:43:12,859
- Ah, fuck!
- Caesar, it slipped.

558
00:43:12,942 --> 00:43:15,945
- I was trying to get ready.
- How the fuck did you do that?

559
00:43:16,028 --> 00:43:18,541
Caesar, it was an accident.
I didn't mean to.

560
00:43:18,624 --> 00:43:21,346
- I'll get some more.
- There's no fuckin' time!

561
00:43:21,429 --> 00:43:23,389
Don't be silly.
There's lots of time.

562
00:43:23,463 --> 00:43:26,267
I'll clean this up and I'll be back
before you're even dressed.

563
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,945
Fuck, Vi!

564
00:43:34,629 --> 00:43:37,184
When you open the door,
I'll be there.

565
00:43:41,949 --> 00:43:43,753
[ Violet ]
What if he sees you?

566
00:43:43,784 --> 00:43:45,474
[ Corky ]
He won't.

567
00:43:45,547 --> 00:43:48,465
You can't know for certain
that he won't see you.

568
00:43:49,946 --> 00:43:52,949
- Trust me.
- I'm just asking. What if?

569
00:43:53,867 --> 00:43:55,546
If he does...

570
00:43:57,235 --> 00:43:59,268
then I won't have a choice,
will I?

571
00:44:02,709 --> 00:44:05,075
When I'm inside,
I'll get the money.

572
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,765
I'm gonna need something
to fill the case.

573
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:51,757
Hide it near the desk.

574
00:44:52,841 --> 00:44:54,207
And at that point...

575
00:44:57,158 --> 00:44:59,086
there's no turning back.

576
00:45:11,202 --> 00:45:12,965
When I get the scotch...

577
00:45:14,122 --> 00:45:16,124
how do I know
you won't just take off?

578
00:45:17,125 --> 00:45:20,566
The same way I'll know that you
went to go get the scotch.

579
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:21,723
Trust.

580
00:45:21,765 --> 00:45:23,923
I still don't see how
I'm gonna get away clean...

581
00:45:24,007 --> 00:45:25,967
with all the money
in the apartment.

582
00:45:26,009 --> 00:45:28,251
Everyone's gonna think
I took it.

583
00:45:28,324 --> 00:45:29,690
- Not Caesar.
- Why?

584
00:45:29,773 --> 00:45:31,973
'Cause of what
you're gonna tell him.

585
00:45:32,046 --> 00:45:34,090
You gotta be as real as you can.

586
00:45:34,934 --> 00:45:37,854
The moment you walk through
that door with the scotch...

587
00:45:37,896 --> 00:45:39,292
you'll be covered.

588
00:45:40,533 --> 00:45:43,776
That moment's the most important
moment of the plan.

589
00:45:43,849 --> 00:45:47,488
'Cause if you're real enough, he's
gonna believe you, 'cause deep down...

590
00:45:47,529 --> 00:45:48,771
he'll want to.

591
00:45:48,854 --> 00:45:52,138
C? Shit, I'm sorry.
They were early.

592
00:45:53,171 --> 00:45:56,299
- What are you talkin' about?
- They just left, didn't they?

593
00:45:56,372 --> 00:45:59,291
- What, are you drunk?
- They weren't just up here?

594
00:45:59,375 --> 00:46:01,814
No, they're still on their way.

595
00:46:01,856 --> 00:46:03,535
That doesn't make any sense.

596
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:08,332
- Why?
- I just saw Johnnie downstairs.

597
00:46:11,094 --> 00:46:12,221
What?

598
00:46:12,294 --> 00:46:15,776
Yeah. I was getting out of my car,
and I saw him in his BMW.

599
00:46:17,903 --> 00:46:20,301
- Nah, it couldn't have been.
- It was him, Caesar.

600
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:21,698
I'm positive.

601
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,098
Vi, that's impossible.

602
00:46:25,181 --> 00:46:28,143
Caesar, I know Johnnie.

603
00:46:28,184 --> 00:46:29,738
It was him.

604
00:46:29,779 --> 00:46:32,501
I screamed when I saw him.
I couldn't believe I missed him.

605
00:46:32,585 --> 00:46:35,827
I knew you were gonna be upset, so I
thought I'd stop and apologize...

606
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,100
and give Gino the scotch, but...

607
00:46:38,183 --> 00:46:41,384
I honked a couple of times, and Johnnie
didn't even hear me. He didn't stop.

608
00:46:44,502 --> 00:46:45,868
But...

609
00:46:46,984 --> 00:46:49,267
Gino's plane doesn't get here
for another half hour.

610
00:46:53,542 --> 00:46:55,669
Actually, I didn't see Gino
in the car.

611
00:47:07,305 --> 00:47:11,226
If Caesar hates Johnnie as much as
you say, when he opens that case...

612
00:47:11,268 --> 00:47:14,906
he's gonna know in his gut
that Johnnie just fucked him.

613
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:18,869
He'll have no choice.
He can't go after Gino or Johnnie.

614
00:47:18,911 --> 00:47:20,912
There's only one way out.

615
00:47:21,831 --> 00:47:23,196
He'll have to run.

616
00:47:25,073 --> 00:47:26,908
And if he runs...

617
00:47:26,991 --> 00:47:29,713
everyone will assume
he took the money.

618
00:47:29,796 --> 00:47:32,758
You'll be clean,
and we'll be rich.

619
00:47:32,789 --> 00:47:35,197
[ Violet ]
Jesus, that's beautiful.

620
00:47:36,792 --> 00:47:40,557
If you're this goddamn smart,
how did you ever get caught?

621
00:47:41,432 --> 00:47:43,674
I had a partner once.

622
00:47:43,757 --> 00:47:45,280
She fucked me.

623
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,158
I won't.

624
00:47:52,318 --> 00:47:54,153
I think we're gonna find out.

625
00:47:58,762 --> 00:48:00,879
- Oh, God!
- Caesar?

626
00:48:03,318 --> 00:48:05,237
No.

627
00:48:05,998 --> 00:48:07,916
[ Violet ]
C?

628
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:10,836
Oh, no.

629
00:48:12,838 --> 00:48:13,839
Oh, God.

630
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:17,926
[ Groans ]

631
00:48:17,999 --> 00:48:20,398
Vi.

632
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:22,118
Vi, I've been set up.

633
00:48:22,201 --> 00:48:23,724
Johnnie?

634
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,288
That fuck!
