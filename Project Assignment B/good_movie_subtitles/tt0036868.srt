1
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,038
Your attention, please.

2
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:24,542
Announcing the departure of
American Airlines westbound Flight 9.

3
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:29,506
Flight 9 now loading at Gate 3
for immediate departure.

4
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,592
-Yes, sir?
-You got anything going to Boone City?

5
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,929
Boone City, three daily flights,
but there's no space available.

6
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,556
-Would you care to make a reservation?
-Yes, I would.

7
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:42,394
-Your name, please?
-Derry. D-E-R-R-Y. Fred.

8
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,728
How long will it be?

9
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:46,815
We can probably get you
on Flight 37 on the 19th.

10
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,651
The 19th?
See, listen, I can't wait that long.

11
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,945
I just got back from oversea.
I wanna get home.

12
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,738
I'm sorry. There's a waiting list.

13
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:56,616
My secretary made arrangements
to have my tickets here.

14
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,535
My name is Gibbons.
George H. Gibbons.

15
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,578
-Yes, they're right here.
-Thank you.

16
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:03,123
-May we weigh your baggage, please?
-Yes, excuse me.

17
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,667
-Put them right there, please.
-Sorry.

18
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,424
You might try the ATC, Captain.

19
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,800
ATC, where are they?

20
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,386
Out the terminal
to your right and across the field.

21
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,054
Thanks.

22
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,765
You have 16 pounds excess baggage,
Mr. Gibbons.

23
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:23,435
Oh, that's all right. How much is it?

24
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,332
Right-o, sir.

25
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,294
At ease, men.

26
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:54,966
Flight 93. Flight 93. For Denver,
San Francisco and Seattle.

27
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:58,970
That flight has been canceled
until further notice.

28
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,099
-Yeah.
-You got anything for Detroit?

29
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:06,603
-Nope, how about Cleveland?
-Cleveland?

30
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,438
Okay.

31
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,649
-Fill this out.
-Guess I'm going to Cleveland.

32
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:15,779
-It's a nice town.
-Yeah, but Detroit's where I live.

33
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,782
Sarge, what's the chances
of a ride to Boone City?

34
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,700
You got orders?

35
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,828
-Sure.
-Okay.

36
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:28,833
I haven't got anything now, but fill this out,
I'll call you if anything comes up.

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,586
Okay, I guess I'll wait.

38
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:38,301
Guys, I need a couple of men
to give me a hand with this out to a plane.

39
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,011
-Okay.
-Hey, come on. Let's go.

40
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,971
Let's go, huh?

41
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,266
I bet this thing weighs a ton.

42
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,811
What's the matter, sailor?
Tired or something?

43
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,230
Okay, let's go. Out this way.

44
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:54,943
Fellas, take it easy down the stairs.

45
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,277
-Got it?
-Yeah.

46
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,238
There you go. Hey, look out, fellas.

47
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:02,033
-Take it easy going down the stairs.
-Oh, my aching back.

48
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,868
Derry.

49
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:08,081
-Derry. Captain Fred Derry.
-Oh, coming.

50
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:11,376
-Parrish. Homer Parrish.
-Here.

51
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:12,794
-You Derry?
-Yeah.

52
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,170
-Parrish?
-Right.

53
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,882
Got a call from Baseops.
There's a B-17 taking off for Boone City.

54
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,468
You'll have a long ride.
She's making a lot of stops.

55
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,554
You'll get there tomorrow. That suit you?

56
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,724
-Sure, that's swell.
-Okay, sign here.

57
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,768
Boy, it sure is great to be going home.

58
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:32,063
-Here you go, sailor.
-Sign on the dotted--

59
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,400
I'll do it for you.

60
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,902
What's the matter?
Think I can't spell my own name?

61
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,238
No, I just thought that....

62
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,033
I know, sarge. Thanks.

63
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:54,169
Hey, Joe. You better hurry up out there,
because she's taking off soon.

64
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,921
Right, thanks. Come on, sailor.

65
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,883
-Where's your stuff?
-Right here.

66
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,718
Excuse us, corporal.

67
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,598
-Boone City your home, sailor?
-Yes, sir, captain.

68
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:09,059
Forget the rank, chum. I'm out.

69
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:12,354
-Whereabouts do you live in Boone?
-Over on West 17th Street.

70
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,356
-You know where Jackson High is?
-Sure.

71
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:17,108
-Go ahead.
-Well, it's just a couple of blocks past it.

72
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,539
-Hi, sarge.
-How are you?

73
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:37,462
-My name's Fred Derry.
-Al Stephenson.

74
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:40,715
-And this is Homer.... What is it, Homer?
-Parrish.

75
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,884
-Glad to know you.
-Glad to know you, sarge.

76
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,844
-You from Boone too?
-Yeah, sure I am.

77
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,973
-How long since you've been home?
-A couple of centuries.

78
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,476
Come on, we'll sit in the radio compartment
until after the takeoff...

79
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:54,979
...then we'll get in the nose
and get a nice view of the good old U.S.A.

80
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,523
Okay.

81
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,868
Boy, oh, boy. Hey, look at that.
Look at those automobiles down there.

82
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,621
You can see them so plain,
you can even see the people.

83
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,499
Yeah, looks like we're flying by road map.

84
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:18,586
-Is this your first ride in one of these?
-Yeah, this is my first plane ride.

85
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,422
I saw plenty of flying, all right.

86
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:24,300
I was on a CV. That's a flattop.

87
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:27,846
But I never knew things
looked so pretty from up here.

88
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:30,932
Sure is beautiful.

89
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:34,227
I never thought so.
This used to be my office.

90
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,062
-Bombardier, weren't you?
-Yeah.

91
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,231
That's where the bombsight was.

92
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,026
I spent a lot of time on my knees
up there.

93
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:44,863
-Praying?
-Yeah, that too.

94
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:51,828
-Cigarette, Homer?
-Thanks. It's all right, I can get it.

95
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,713
Here, I've got a match, captain.

96
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,560
Thank you.

97
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,188
-Thank you.
-Anybody superstitious?

98
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:21,316
-No, no, go ahead.
-Well, I am.

99
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:37,207
Boy, you ought to see
me open a bottle of beer.

100
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:40,251
-Well, then you got nothing to worry about.
-Thanks.

101
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,253
I guess you saw a lot of action.

102
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:46,132
No, I didn't see much of the war.
I mean the way you fellas did.

103
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,759
You trying to kid the Army?

104
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:50,637
No, I was stationed
in the repair shop below decks.

105
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,639
Oh, I was in plenty of battles.

106
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,975
But I never saw a Jap
or heard a shell coming at me.

107
00:07:56,142 --> 00:08:00,355
When we were sunk, all I know
is there was a lot of fire and explosions.

108
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:04,818
And I was ordered topsides and overboard,
and I was burned.

109
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:09,614
When I came to,
I was on a cruiser and my hands were off.

110
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,574
After that, I had it easy.

111
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,660
-Easy?
-That's what I said.

112
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,787
They took care of me fine.

113
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,956
They trained me to use these things.

114
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:23,378
I can dial telephones, I can drive a car,
I can even put nickels in a jukebox.

115
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:26,047
I'm all right. But....

116
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,053
But what, sailor?

117
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,722
Well....

118
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,808
Well, you see, I've got a girl.

119
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,813
She knows what happened to you,
doesn't she?

120
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,315
Sure. They all know.

121
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,235
But they don't know
what these things look like.

122
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,739
-What's your girl's name, Homer?
-Wilma.

123
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,742
She and I went to high school together.

124
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:57,787
-I bet Wilma's a swell girl.
-She is.

125
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,957
And it'll be all right, sailor.
You wait and see.

126
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:04,044
Yeah. Wait and see.

127
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:05,503
Wilma's only a kid.

128
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,590
She's never seen anything
like these hooks.

129
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:18,016
Say, wait till I get home
and tell the folks about this trip.

130
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:22,228
I'm the first one in my family
that ever rode in an aeroplane.

131
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,297
-Hey, Al.
-Yeah?

132
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:52,676
You remember what it felt like
when you went overseas?

133
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,303
As well as I remember my own name.

134
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,056
I feel the same way now.

135
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,725
Only more so.

136
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,812
I know what you mean.

137
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:08,066
Just nervous out of the service, I guess.

138
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:14,030
The thing that scares me most is that
everybody's gonna try to rehabilitate me.

139
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:18,118
All I want's a good job, a mild future...

140
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,578
...and a house big enough for me
and my wife.

141
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:24,499
Give me that much
and I'm rehabilitated like that.

142
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,378
I'd say that's not too much to ask.

143
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:31,256
You married, Al?

144
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,467
-Yep.
-How long?

145
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,262
Twenty years.

146
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:40,682
Twenty years?

147
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:46,396
Holy smoke.

148
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:52,027
We didn't even have 20 days
before I went over.

149
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:56,239
I married a girl I met
when I was in training in Texas.

150
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,617
Well, you and your wife will
have a chance to get acquainted.

151
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,411
Yeah.

152
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,962
I wonder how
Homer will make out with that girl of his.

153
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,839
Wilma.

154
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:18,136
I hope Wilma is a swell girl.

155
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:17,028
-The old hometown hasn't changed much.
-No.

156
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,074
There's the golf course.

157
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,284
People are playing golf.

158
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:26,287
Just as if nothing had ever happened.

159
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:31,376
Hey, there's Jackson High football field.

160
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:36,506
Boy, I sure would like to have a dollar
for every forward pass I threw down there.

161
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,886
Good old Jackson High.

162
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:50,770
-Hey, that must be the new airport.
-Yeah, we're turning into it now.

163
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,982
Holy smoke.

164
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:58,737
I never knew there were so many planes.

165
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,447
And they're junking them.

166
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,323
-What?
-No.

167
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,160
Boy, oh, boy.

168
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,746
What we could have done
with those in '43.

169
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:10,290
Yeah, I'll bet.

170
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:14,753
Some of them look brand new.
From the factory to the scrapheap.

171
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,755
That's all they're good for now.

172
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:21,134
We gotta get out of the nose
while he sets her down.

173
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:34,230
Hey, look there's the ballpark.

174
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,153
Say, how are the Beavers
doing this season?

175
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,697
They're in sixth place.

176
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,784
Still in second division.

177
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,979
-Hey, there's Butch's Place.
-Butch's?

178
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:18,441
-Who's that?
-Gosh, Butch has got himself a neon sign.

179
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,235
-Have you ever been to Butch's?
-No.

180
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:23,113
Oh, Butch Engle that runs it, he's my uncle.
Swell guy.

181
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,658
Only the family don't think
he's respectable because he sells liquor.

182
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:29,911
-That's the best joint in town.
-We'll have to get together there.

183
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:31,496
Swell.

184
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,045
This is my street.

185
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:42,090
Fifteen, 17.

186
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:44,300
It's the fourth house from here.

187
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,763
I wonder if Wilma's home.

188
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:03,403
How about the three of us
going back to Butch's Place?

189
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,364
We'll have a couple of drinks
and then we can go home.

190
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,783
You're home now, kid.

191
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,543
-Well, so long.
-So long, Homer.

192
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,261
-Where next?
-Just a minute, bud.

193
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:36,561
It's Homer! Momma! Momma! Daddy!
It's Homer! Homer's here!

194
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:40,565
Wilma! Wilma! Homer's here!

195
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:43,318
Wilma, come on over!

196
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,832
-My boy.
-Oh, darling.

197
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:00,251
It's good to see you.

198
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,548
-Isn't this wonderful?
-There's Wilma.

199
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:35,745
Okay, let's go.

200
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:54,931
-Well....
-No, don't. I'll carry it.

201
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:58,935
What's the matter, Ma?

202
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:01,396
It's nothing.

203
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:04,691
It's just that your ma's
so glad to see you home.

204
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,651
Yeah, I know.

205
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:24,669
You gotta hand it to the Navy.

206
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:27,922
They sure trained that kid
how to use those hooks.

207
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:33,928
They couldn't train him to put
his arms around his girl, to stroke her hair.

208
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:40,518
-Is it the next turn up here?
-Yeah, the next turn on the left.

209
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:46,191
Hey, Fred, why don't we drop you first?

210
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:49,319
No, you're next.

211
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:54,032
And we're not going back to Butch's
for a drink, either.

212
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:57,452
Feel as if I were going in to hit a beach.

213
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:17,972
Some barracks you got here.
Hey, what are you, a retired bootlegger?

214
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:22,477
Nothing as dignified as that.
I'm a banker.

215
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:24,896
How much do I owe you?

216
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:27,941
Take your hand out of your pocket,
sergeant. You're outranked.

217
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:30,443
Yes, sir, captain, sir.

218
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,655
-Good luck, chum.
-Thanks.

219
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:57,846
Yes, I will. Yes, sir.

220
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:00,306
One moment, please.
One moment, please.

221
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,934
-Just whom do you wish to see?
-Mrs. Stephenson.

222
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,895
Well, just a minute.
I'll have to announce you first.

223
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,606
You put that phone down.
I'm her husband.

224
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:12,152
-You're Mr. Stephenson?
-Sergeant Stephenson.

225
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:15,113
What did you expect?
A four-star general?

226
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:21,119
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.
Yes, sir.

227
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:24,164
-Fourth floor.
-Yes, sir.

228
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,996
I'll get it, Peg.

229
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:11,086
Where's Mom?

230
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:16,758
Who's that at the door, Peggy?

231
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:20,553
Peggy.

232
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,014
Rob, who was--?

233
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:20,405
-I look terrible.
-Who says so?

234
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:24,743
-It isn't fair of you to bust in on us like this.
-I phoned you from Portland.

235
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,911
Yes, but you said
you wouldn't be home for--

236
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:29,497
We were lucky.
We got a plane to Welburn.

237
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:33,877
I thought we were gonna get stuck there,
but we came right through.

238
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:37,088
-Al, are you all right?
-Sure.

239
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:41,009
-Are you all right?
-Of course I am.

240
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:54,022
-Let me look at you.
-Don't look now, I need a bath and a shave.

241
00:21:57,776 --> 00:21:59,986
If you don't mind, Mom.

242
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:04,657
Dad. Darling.

243
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:10,455
I'd better call the Kenworthys and
tell them we won't be over.

244
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:12,957
-The Kenworthys?
-Yes.

245
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:17,671
My son. And my daughter.

246
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:20,215
I don't recognize you. What's happened?

247
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:23,635
Just a few years of normal growth.
Don't you approve?

248
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:25,053
I don't know yet.

249
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,931
I've gotta have more time
to get to know you.

250
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:29,933
Hello?

251
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,477
Oh, Alice, this is Milly.

252
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:36,314
I'm terribly sorry, but we can't be over.

253
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:41,861
I mean, I'm terribly happy.

254
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:45,824
You see, Al....

255
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:49,327
My husband.

256
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:54,666
Yes. He's home. Yes.

257
00:22:58,211 --> 00:22:59,963
Yes.

258
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:31,369
-Freddy.
-Hello, Hortense.

259
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:34,956
Well, say. Pat.

260
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:38,543
Pat, it's Freddy. He's home again.

261
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:40,587
Hello, Pop.

262
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:42,547
Gee, I wish we'd known
you were coming.

263
00:23:42,714 --> 00:23:45,175
We'd have had
the place kind of cleaned up.

264
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:50,055
Well, haven't you got anything to say
to your own son?

265
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:53,767
-Glad to see you, my boy.
-Look at him, Pat.

266
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,643
Look at your hero son.

267
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:58,229
And look at all those
beautiful ribbons on his chest.

268
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:02,400
Go on, Freddy, tell your father how you
got those ribbons and what they mean.

269
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:04,569
-Where's Marie?
-Marie?

270
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:06,237
Yeah, she out?

271
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:08,907
-Oh, Marie isn't here, Freddy.
-Will she be back soon?

272
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:13,370
Well, she's not living with us anymore,
Freddy. She took an apartment downtown.

273
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:15,246
Why didn't anybody write me about it?

274
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:18,708
Well, we were afraid it might worry you,
you being so far away.

275
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:22,837
And it was inconvenient for Marie
living in this place after she took that job.

276
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:26,257
But we forwarded all your letters
and the allotment checks.

277
00:24:26,424 --> 00:24:29,135
She took a job? Where?

278
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:31,930
Some nightclub.
I don't know just which one.

279
00:24:32,097 --> 00:24:34,557
Oh, the poor girl works till all hours.

280
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:36,559
Where does she live?

281
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,105
Grandview Arms on Pine Street.

282
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:43,108
But there's nothing to worry about, Freddy.
Marie's fine.

283
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:47,445
We saw her last Christmas.
She brought us some beautiful presents.

284
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:49,030
Marie's a good-hearted girl.

285
00:24:49,197 --> 00:24:51,116
You know what time
she goes out to work?

286
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:56,121
Well, about suppertime, I imagine.

287
00:24:56,788 --> 00:24:59,249
Do you mind if I leave my stuff here?

288
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:01,042
I'll pick it up later.

289
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:04,129
Sure, but aren't you gonna stay
and have a bite to eat?

290
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:06,506
No, thank you, Hortense.

291
00:25:06,965 --> 00:25:08,425
Well....

292
00:25:08,591 --> 00:25:10,593
So long, Pop. I'll be back.

293
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,513
Well, it's....
I'm glad to have you home, my boy.

294
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,808
It's good to be home, Pop. Bye.

295
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:22,564
Here, a cap.

296
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:27,485
Here's a samurai sword, Rob.

297
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:31,156
Thanks very much, Dad.

298
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:36,536
And here's a flag
I found on a dead Jap soldier.

299
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:40,415
All that writing on it are signatures
and good luck messages from his relatives.

300
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:41,624
Yes, I know.

301
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:45,670
The Japanese attach a lot of importance
to their family relationship.

302
00:25:45,837 --> 00:25:48,923
Yeah. Yeah, entirely different from us.

303
00:25:49,424 --> 00:25:52,093
Say, you were at Hiroshima,
weren't you, Dad?

304
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,553
Did you happen to notice...

305
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,183
...any of the effects of radioactivity
on the people who survived the blast?

306
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,018
No, I didn't. Should I have?

307
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:03,813
Well, we've been having lectures
in atomic energy at school.

308
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,024
And Mr. McLaglen,
he's our physics teacher...

309
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:08,193
...he says that we've reached the point...

310
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,447
...where the whole human race has either
got to find a way to live together...

311
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:15,992
-...or else....
-Or else.

312
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:17,952
That's right. Or else.

313
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:21,247
Because when you combine
atomic energy with jet propulsion...

314
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:26,211
...and radar and guided missiles,
well, just think of the....

315
00:26:26,544 --> 00:26:29,214
Oh, you're just kidding me, Dad.

316
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:32,801
You've been to all these places
and you've seen everything.

317
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:35,178
I've seen nothing.

318
00:26:36,304 --> 00:26:40,392
I should have stayed home
and found out what was really going on.

319
00:26:40,892 --> 00:26:42,852
I finished the dishes.

320
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:46,523
Why do you have to do that?
Is this the maid's night out?

321
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:50,568
Our maid took a night out
three years ago, we haven't seen her since.

322
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:53,988
But everything's all right because
I took a course in domestic science.

323
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:56,449
-Even bought a cook book.
-What's happened?

324
00:26:56,616 --> 00:27:00,078
All this atomic energy
and scientific efficiency.

325
00:27:00,245 --> 00:27:02,747
It was the war. You heard about that.

326
00:27:02,914 --> 00:27:04,124
Yeah.

327
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,126
All those problems on the home front.

328
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:08,545
We used to read about them
in Stars and Stripes.

329
00:27:08,712 --> 00:27:11,089
We felt awfully sorry for the civilians.

330
00:27:11,256 --> 00:27:13,091
You don't have to worry about us, Dad.

331
00:27:13,258 --> 00:27:16,052
We can handle the problems.
We're tough.

332
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,099
Rob, haven't you any homework?

333
00:27:21,766 --> 00:27:24,477
Oh, sure. Good night, Dad.

334
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:26,271
Don't see why you have to go now.

335
00:27:26,438 --> 00:27:30,233
Rob, aren't you going to take
the souvenirs father brought you?

336
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,277
Oh, yes.

337
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:36,406
Gee, thanks an awful lot, Dad,
for these things.

338
00:27:36,573 --> 00:27:38,241
Good night. See you in the morning.

339
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:40,160
Good night, Rob.

340
00:27:40,744 --> 00:27:43,830
-Good night, Mom.
-Good night, darling.

341
00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:48,043
Nice to have you around, Dad.
You'll get us back to normal.

342
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:52,297
Or maybe go nuts myself.

343
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:07,145
What do you think of the children?

344
00:28:07,812 --> 00:28:09,647
The children?

345
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:12,817
I don't recognize them.

346
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:15,070
They've grown so old.

347
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:16,529
I tried to stop them...

348
00:28:16,696 --> 00:28:21,534
...to keep them just as they were
when you left, but they got away from me.

349
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:36,383
-I guess Peggy has a lot of boyfriends.
-She's very popular.

350
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:38,593
Is she concentrating
on anyone particular?

351
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,179
She hasn't told me of anyone.

352
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:43,431
But you've...

353
00:28:44,182 --> 00:28:47,185
...told her all the things
she ought to know?

354
00:28:49,104 --> 00:28:51,272
What, for instance?

355
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,112
Well, have you?

356
00:28:58,655 --> 00:29:00,657
She's worked two years in a hospital.

357
00:29:00,824 --> 00:29:04,327
She knows more than you or I ever will.

358
00:29:06,496 --> 00:29:07,539
Cigarette?

359
00:29:07,706 --> 00:29:10,667
-Have you forgotten, Al? I don't smoke.
-Sorry.

360
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:13,044
It's all right, darling.

361
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:19,801
-It's frightening.
-What is?

362
00:29:21,511 --> 00:29:22,846
Youth.

363
00:29:23,346 --> 00:29:25,765
Didn't you run across any young people
in the Army?

364
00:29:25,932 --> 00:29:31,062
-No, they were all old men like me.
-Yes.

365
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:34,441
It's terrible to be old, isn't it?

366
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:40,780
-Why don't you sit down and relax?
-I'm perfectly relaxed standing up.

367
00:29:42,741 --> 00:29:45,410
Is there such a thing as a drink
in this house?

368
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:47,328
I'll see.

369
00:30:01,426 --> 00:30:03,636
We haven't got enough bacon
for Dad's breakfast.

370
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:06,222
I'll go out first thing in the morning
and get some.

371
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:08,641
Is this all the liquor we have left?

372
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:11,269
Gosh, I'm afraid so.

373
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:15,774
I wish he'd given us some warning
he was going to get here today.

374
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,234
Don't worry, Mom.

375
00:30:18,568 --> 00:30:22,739
I mean so that we could have gotten in
some supplies of things.

376
00:30:24,449 --> 00:30:25,825
Mother.

377
00:30:25,992 --> 00:30:27,952
I know it's a little difficult...

378
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:31,623
...but that's only because Dad's so crazy
about you.

379
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:35,877
He's been away so long
and missed you so terribly.

380
00:30:36,044 --> 00:30:39,172
He can't just walk in
and immediately pick up the old life as if--

381
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:42,634
Hey, I got a wonderful idea.
Let's go out on the town, the three of us.

382
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:44,469
-Tonight?
-Yes, tonight. Right now.

383
00:30:44,636 --> 00:30:46,513
We'll celebrate
the old man's homecoming.

384
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,391
-Not me. I'm going to bed.
-No. You too. The three of us.

385
00:30:49,557 --> 00:30:51,851
I wanna do something, see something.

386
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:54,854
And I've been in jungles
and around savages so long...

387
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:57,357
...I gotta find out
I'm back in civilization again.

388
00:31:24,718 --> 00:31:27,137
Hey, Rupert,
how about another one here?

389
00:31:46,865 --> 00:31:47,866
Well, I'll tell you...

390
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:50,702
...as I see it, we're headed
for bad times in this country.

391
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:53,371
Of course, we're in the backwash
of the war boom now...

392
00:31:53,538 --> 00:31:55,457
...but the tide is running out fast.

393
00:31:55,623 --> 00:31:59,711
Next year, in my opinion, we'll see
widespread depression and unemployment.

394
00:31:59,878 --> 00:32:01,880
Oh, have a cigar?

395
00:32:02,047 --> 00:32:04,716
No, thanks. I've got my pipe.

396
00:32:04,883 --> 00:32:07,802
Homer? Didn't you contract
the tobacco habit in the Navy?

397
00:32:07,969 --> 00:32:10,680
Just cigarettes, Mr. Cameron. Thanks.

398
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:15,894
Wilma tells us
you were in the Philippines, Homer.

399
00:32:16,061 --> 00:32:19,481
Well, I was around there, Mrs. Cameron,
but I never saw anything.

400
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:24,069
-Did you meet General MacArthur?
-No, I didn't get to meet him.

401
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:26,112
I've got a light, Mr. Cameron.

402
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:28,239
No, that's all right.

403
00:32:28,406 --> 00:32:29,824
Got it.

404
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:39,042
-Luella.
-Yes, Dad?

405
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:47,717
You know, I've always thought
he's such a handsome man.

406
00:32:47,884 --> 00:32:50,720
-Who?
-General MacArthur.

407
00:32:53,765 --> 00:32:57,268
-May I help you with that, Mrs. Parrish?
-No, Wilma, you sit right down.

408
00:32:57,435 --> 00:32:59,896
-Lemonade, Mrs. Cameron?
-Thank you very much.

409
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:02,482
Have you thought anything
about getting a job, Homer?

410
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:04,442
-Well, I....
-Oh, Father...

411
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:07,320
...it's much too soon for Homer
to be thinking about a job.

412
00:33:07,487 --> 00:33:09,447
He's just out of the hospital.

413
00:33:09,614 --> 00:33:11,199
Yes, I know...

414
00:33:11,366 --> 00:33:15,286
...but a few months from now, the same
opportunities won't exist that exist today.

415
00:33:15,453 --> 00:33:18,164
You might think about my business, Homer.
Insurance.

416
00:33:18,331 --> 00:33:21,626
We've taken on a number of veterans.
They make good salesmen, you know.

417
00:33:21,793 --> 00:33:25,338
Men who have suffered
from some kind of disability.

418
00:33:25,505 --> 00:33:28,466
Come down to the office one of these days,
we'll talk it over.

419
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:33,471
I'm sorry, Mom.

420
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:36,975
That's quite all right, Homer.
It won't hurt the carpet a bit.

421
00:33:37,142 --> 00:33:39,894
Luella, you skin out to the kitchen
and get me a dishrag.

422
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:42,814
There's another one for you, Homer.

423
00:33:44,482 --> 00:33:46,484
Wilma will hold it for you.

424
00:33:46,651 --> 00:33:47,819
No, thanks.

425
00:33:47,986 --> 00:33:51,656
If you don't mind,
I think I'll go out and walk around a bit.

426
00:34:05,253 --> 00:34:07,047
Where's Homer?

427
00:34:09,507 --> 00:34:11,009
He went out.

428
00:34:25,231 --> 00:34:27,650
Pick Up Cafe. There it is, driver.
Stop right here.

429
00:34:27,817 --> 00:34:29,194
Listen, Al, all kidding aside.

430
00:34:29,361 --> 00:34:31,363
Don't you think it's time
to get some sleep?

431
00:34:31,529 --> 00:34:35,116
Absolutely. Sleep. But first we've gotta
stop and have one last little drink.

432
00:34:35,283 --> 00:34:38,286
And that's all you are gonna get.
No arguments. One drink.

433
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:40,372
Come on in, driver,
and have one with us.

434
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,984
Hey, Homer.

435
00:35:10,151 --> 00:35:11,986
It's good to see you, kid.

436
00:35:12,654 --> 00:35:15,407
Your friend told me you were home,
but I didn't expect you--

437
00:35:15,573 --> 00:35:17,283
Hi, captain!

438
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:20,787
Hey, Homer, my old shipmate.
How are you kid? Sit down.

439
00:35:20,954 --> 00:35:22,414
So you took my advice?

440
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,666
-Yeah.
-Come on, let's have a drink.

441
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:26,418
-Hello, Homer.
-Hi, Steve.

442
00:35:26,584 --> 00:35:28,586
Boy, am I happy
to see you back home again.

443
00:35:28,753 --> 00:35:31,881
Go ahead, shake, pal. It won't bite you.

444
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,217
-What'll you have?
-What'll I have?

445
00:35:34,384 --> 00:35:36,928
How many times have I dreamed
of hearing that question?

446
00:35:37,095 --> 00:35:40,265
Before I went in the Navy,
Butch would never let me drink any liquor.

447
00:35:40,432 --> 00:35:42,726
He used to read me lectures
on the curse of drink.

448
00:35:42,892 --> 00:35:45,145
But it's different now. I'm a veteran.

449
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:47,522
Give me a whiskey, Steve. Straight.

450
00:35:47,689 --> 00:35:48,982
How about it, Butch?

451
00:35:49,149 --> 00:35:50,984
Draw a beer for the Navy.

452
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:53,111
-Butch, I ordered whiskey.
-Beer.

453
00:35:53,278 --> 00:35:54,279
Beer.

454
00:35:54,446 --> 00:35:58,283
I'm gonna take my trade to some other joint
where I don't have relatives.

455
00:35:58,742 --> 00:36:02,120
Say, what are you doing here, anyway?
Why aren't you home with the folks?

456
00:36:02,287 --> 00:36:05,415
Well, they went to bed
and I wasn't sleepy...

457
00:36:05,582 --> 00:36:08,543
...so I thought,
"Why not come down and see Butch?"

458
00:36:08,835 --> 00:36:10,795
Glad you did, Homer.

459
00:36:11,671 --> 00:36:14,132
Well, here's to you, Butch.

460
00:36:17,302 --> 00:36:18,970
How am I doing?

461
00:36:20,555 --> 00:36:23,391
-Kid, you're doing great.
-Thanks.

462
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:25,268
Say, Fred, where did you leave Al?

463
00:36:25,435 --> 00:36:28,646
Oh, Al. He's home in the swankiest
apartment house in town.

464
00:36:28,813 --> 00:36:31,024
We'll never see him again.

465
00:36:31,524 --> 00:36:36,112
-Say, this is the best place we've been yet.
-Hey, that's Al.

466
00:36:37,322 --> 00:36:40,658
Where you been?
We were just talking about you.

467
00:36:42,035 --> 00:36:44,245
Oh, my aching back.

468
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:47,582
Hey, Milly. Peggy.
Step up and meet the gang.

469
00:36:47,749 --> 00:36:49,584
This is Homer, this is Fred.

470
00:36:49,751 --> 00:36:51,086
This is my wife and daughter.

471
00:36:51,252 --> 00:36:55,507
Homer and I were together at the Battle
of Lingayen Gulf, only we didn't know it.

472
00:36:55,674 --> 00:36:57,509
-Hi, bub.
-How do you do?

473
00:36:57,676 --> 00:37:00,804
-Al, this is my Uncle Butch.
-Bu--

474
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:04,099
Oh, I hear you got a new neon sign, huh?
Good for you.

475
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:06,434
Now the party can really get started.

476
00:37:06,601 --> 00:37:08,019
Oh, this better.

477
00:37:08,186 --> 00:37:10,855
Let's sit. Milly, come on.
Here's a good booth.

478
00:37:11,022 --> 00:37:12,148
Fred, come on, sit down.

479
00:37:12,315 --> 00:37:14,442
Hey, Fred, where's your wife?
I wanna meet her.

480
00:37:14,609 --> 00:37:16,986
I haven't been able to find her.
She works in some nightclub.

481
00:37:17,153 --> 00:37:18,863
I've been around places looking--

482
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:21,533
Well, we'll find her, Fred,
before this night is out.

483
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,411
We'll deploy our forces
and comb the town. Won't we, Milly?

484
00:37:24,577 --> 00:37:26,204
Oh, by all means.

485
00:37:26,371 --> 00:37:28,373
Well, we got the Navy to convoy us.

486
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,001
We gotta get one thing straight.
Homer lost his hands.

487
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:33,211
He's got those hooks.
They don't worry him...

488
00:37:33,378 --> 00:37:35,547
...so they don't need to worry anybody.
Right?

489
00:37:35,714 --> 00:37:38,133
-Right.
-Right, now let's get seriously to work.

490
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:41,219
-Telephone, Butch.
-Thank you. Give them anything they want.

491
00:37:41,386 --> 00:37:43,054
Any kind of beer.

492
00:37:43,221 --> 00:37:44,931
-What'll it be?
-How are you, Angus?

493
00:37:45,098 --> 00:37:47,058
-Hi, sergeant. Hello.
-Nice to see you.

494
00:37:47,225 --> 00:37:49,060
-Looking well. A little gray.
-Hi, Angus.

495
00:37:49,227 --> 00:37:50,353
Yeah, yeah.

496
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,896
Well...

497
00:37:52,063 --> 00:37:54,691
-...cheers, cheers.
-Cheers!

498
00:37:54,858 --> 00:37:56,276
Homer.

499
00:37:56,901 --> 00:37:58,903
Okay, Butch.

500
00:37:59,362 --> 00:38:01,281
Aren't you drinking?

501
00:38:04,576 --> 00:38:06,828
-Excuse me, folks.
-Sure, Homer.

502
00:38:14,252 --> 00:38:17,255
Gee, Butch, it's swell
to hear you playing again.

503
00:38:17,672 --> 00:38:20,467
How about ''Lazy River''?
Remember that?

504
00:38:23,345 --> 00:38:25,096
Sit down, Homer.

505
00:38:32,604 --> 00:38:34,356
Wilma phoned.

506
00:38:34,689 --> 00:38:36,107
Wilma?

507
00:38:36,399 --> 00:38:38,610
-What did she want?
-You.

508
00:38:39,652 --> 00:38:42,822
Oh, why can't they leave a guy alone?

509
00:38:43,073 --> 00:38:45,658
Because they're fond of you, that's why.

510
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:48,953
What made you leave the house
and get them all worried?

511
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,622
Oh, they....

512
00:38:51,081 --> 00:38:53,958
-They got me nervous.
-How?

513
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:56,670
Butch, it's nothing.
I don't wanna talk about it.

514
00:38:56,836 --> 00:38:59,130
How'd they get you nervous?

515
00:38:59,673 --> 00:39:01,091
Well, they....

516
00:39:01,633 --> 00:39:03,968
Well, they keep staring at these hooks...

517
00:39:04,135 --> 00:39:07,347
...or else they keep staring
away from them.

518
00:39:07,847 --> 00:39:10,558
You mean whatever they do is wrong.

519
00:39:11,518 --> 00:39:16,106
Why don't they understand that all I want
is to be treated like everybody else?

520
00:39:16,356 --> 00:39:18,358
Take Pop for instance.

521
00:39:18,525 --> 00:39:22,821
He was cleaning his pipe
like I've seen him do a million times.

522
00:39:23,071 --> 00:39:27,659
And all of a sudden he got conscious
that he had hands and I didn't and he....

523
00:39:27,826 --> 00:39:31,454
He stopped cleaning his pipe
and he tried to hide his hands...

524
00:39:31,621 --> 00:39:34,249
...like he was guilty or something.

525
00:39:38,837 --> 00:39:41,464
Give them time, kid. They'll catch on.

526
00:39:41,756 --> 00:39:45,802
You know, your folks will get used to you
and you'll get used to them.

527
00:39:46,052 --> 00:39:48,722
Then everything will settle down nicely.

528
00:39:48,888 --> 00:39:51,182
Unless we have another war.

529
00:39:52,475 --> 00:39:56,938
Then none of us have to worry, because
we'll all be blown to bits the first day.

530
00:40:03,069 --> 00:40:05,196
So cheer up, huh?

531
00:40:06,906 --> 00:40:08,533
Hey, Butch.

532
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:12,996
You know "Among My Souvenirs," huh?

533
00:40:35,727 --> 00:40:37,062
Shall we dance?

534
00:40:37,228 --> 00:40:39,898
Well, that's a charming idea.

535
00:40:43,693 --> 00:40:45,779
Do you remember this tune?

536
00:41:39,249 --> 00:41:42,961
Nice to see the young folks
enjoying themselves, isn't it?

537
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,716
So you're Al's daughter.

538
00:41:48,133 --> 00:41:51,845
Yes. I've been that
as long as I can remember.

539
00:41:53,221 --> 00:41:55,849
You don't seem like Al's daughter.

540
00:41:56,933 --> 00:41:58,476
Actually, I'm not.

541
00:41:58,643 --> 00:42:01,646
He's my son by a previous marriage.

542
00:42:04,816 --> 00:42:06,985
-What did you say your name was?
-Peggy.

543
00:42:07,152 --> 00:42:11,489
-Peggy, my name's Fred. How do you do?
-How do you do?

544
00:42:13,867 --> 00:42:16,369
Oh, no, you don-- Oh, no.

545
00:42:51,446 --> 00:42:54,240
You're a bewitching little creature.

546
00:42:54,699 --> 00:42:57,535
In a way, you remind me of my wife.

547
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:00,914
-But you never told me you're married.
-Oh, yeah.

548
00:43:01,081 --> 00:43:04,709
I've got a little woman and two kiddies
back there in the States.

549
00:43:04,876 --> 00:43:09,089
-But let's not think of them now.
-Oh, you're so right.

550
00:43:09,255 --> 00:43:12,550
This night belongs only to us.

551
00:43:18,848 --> 00:43:22,435
That's the type of thing people ought
to be thinking about these days.

552
00:43:22,602 --> 00:43:25,522
All right, I promise I'll get right to work
on it.

553
00:43:25,689 --> 00:43:28,817
And there's one thing
I've been wanting to ask you.

554
00:43:29,067 --> 00:43:31,152
You ask it, Peggy.

555
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:33,905
You mustn't feel shy with me.

556
00:43:35,073 --> 00:43:37,575
Why don't you call your wife?

557
00:43:38,243 --> 00:43:39,703
I don't know her number.

558
00:43:39,869 --> 00:43:42,914
-I couldn't find it in the phone book.
-Phone book!

559
00:43:43,081 --> 00:43:46,835
We don't need to do any telephoning.
We're all set.

560
00:43:47,002 --> 00:43:49,254
What you need is a drink.

561
00:43:49,921 --> 00:43:51,673
Good night, everybody. I'm going home.

562
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,092
-Why?
-I've gotta. Butch says I've gotta.

563
00:43:54,259 --> 00:43:56,386
-He's gonna drive me.
-Oh, no, no.

564
00:43:56,553 --> 00:43:59,264
-But you can't. No, you can't....
-It's quite all right.

565
00:43:59,431 --> 00:44:01,307
And don't any of you leave. I'll be back.

566
00:44:01,474 --> 00:44:03,101
-Good night, everybody.
-Good night.

567
00:44:03,268 --> 00:44:06,521
Poor kid. Imagine, he's gotta go home.

568
00:44:06,688 --> 00:44:10,358
-Doesn't that put any ideas in your head?
-Yes.

569
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:14,237
I'd love to.

570
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,785
Lights out, Steve.

571
00:44:25,749 --> 00:44:30,628
-Where do we go next, old pal, old pal?
-Just follow me, old pal.

572
00:44:35,633 --> 00:44:37,135
Step.

573
00:44:37,886 --> 00:44:40,430
-Good night, Al.
-Good night, Butch. Been a nice party.

574
00:44:46,394 --> 00:44:48,271
This it, Fred?

575
00:44:48,897 --> 00:44:50,815
It looks like it.

576
00:44:53,985 --> 00:44:55,445
Silly.

577
00:44:55,612 --> 00:44:58,823
Good night, Milly. Many thanks
for a most enjoyable evening.

578
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:01,284
-Good night, Fred.
-Good night, Al.

579
00:45:01,451 --> 00:45:03,495
Best of luck to you.

580
00:45:06,331 --> 00:45:07,832
I'll give him your message.

581
00:45:07,999 --> 00:45:09,626
Hey, you do that.

582
00:45:09,793 --> 00:45:11,920
And good night to you, Peggy.

583
00:45:12,087 --> 00:45:15,840
-It has indeed been a great pleasure.
-Yes, Fred. See you soon.

584
00:45:16,007 --> 00:45:17,842
By all means.

585
00:45:19,177 --> 00:45:20,970
I beg your pardon.

586
00:45:22,347 --> 00:45:23,807
Good night.

587
00:45:26,101 --> 00:45:28,645
We'd better wait and see if he gets in.

588
00:45:38,113 --> 00:45:41,700
I don't think he even knows
if this is the right place.

589
00:46:07,225 --> 00:46:08,226
Come on.

590
00:46:09,894 --> 00:46:11,438
Up.

591
00:46:16,901 --> 00:46:18,319
Where are we all going now?

592
00:46:18,486 --> 00:46:21,239
Don't ask. We want it to be a surprise.

593
00:46:44,429 --> 00:46:47,015
They make a lovely couple, don't they?

594
00:46:48,016 --> 00:46:51,728
Yeah. I think they'll be
very happy together.

595
00:47:18,129 --> 00:47:19,673
Who are you?

596
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:21,424
Don't you remember?

597
00:47:21,591 --> 00:47:23,343
I'm Peggy.

598
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:27,347
Yes. Peggy.

599
00:47:29,641 --> 00:47:32,060
I'm not that Peggy.

600
00:47:33,144 --> 00:47:35,313
That's too bad.

601
00:48:40,295 --> 00:48:45,550
As I remember, when you lie flat
on your back, you snore.

602
00:48:46,176 --> 00:48:48,595
Here. Where's your hand?

603
00:48:51,639 --> 00:48:53,183
Here.

604
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:55,602
Give me your hand.

605
00:49:22,295 --> 00:49:25,924
-Is Fred all right?
-Yes. He's all right.

606
00:49:26,091 --> 00:49:29,094
-You'll be comfortable here.
-Sure, Mom. Night.

607
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:31,096
Night, dear.

608
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,101
Night.

609
00:49:36,267 --> 00:49:38,061
Night.

610
00:50:07,465 --> 00:50:09,592
Get out of there.

611
00:51:17,869 --> 00:51:20,330
Got a turnaround at 4 o'clock.

612
00:51:24,542 --> 00:51:26,586
It's all over.

613
00:51:28,004 --> 00:51:29,673
You got him.

614
00:51:31,424 --> 00:51:33,009
He's hit.

615
00:51:36,388 --> 00:51:37,889
She's on fire.

616
00:51:38,056 --> 00:51:39,891
She's on fire.

617
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,354
The fire's spreading.

618
00:51:44,521 --> 00:51:45,730
It's Gadorsky.

619
00:51:45,897 --> 00:51:47,774
There goes number four.

620
00:51:47,941 --> 00:51:49,192
She's breaking formation.

621
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,152
Watch out for fighters.

622
00:51:51,319 --> 00:51:52,445
It's spread to the wing.

623
00:51:52,612 --> 00:51:54,364
The wing's on fire.

624
00:51:54,531 --> 00:51:55,990
She's out of control.

625
00:51:56,157 --> 00:51:57,492
She's out of control.

626
00:51:59,619 --> 00:52:01,830
She's going down.

627
00:52:01,996 --> 00:52:03,915
Hey, you guys, jump!

628
00:52:04,082 --> 00:52:05,917
Get out of there. Bail out!

629
00:52:06,084 --> 00:52:09,045
Gadorsky.
Gadorsky, get out of that plane!

630
00:52:09,212 --> 00:52:11,256
Two chutes open.

631
00:52:11,756 --> 00:52:13,258
Three.

632
00:52:13,842 --> 00:52:15,260
Come on, the rest of you guys.

633
00:52:15,427 --> 00:52:16,594
-Fred.
-Come on, get out!

634
00:52:16,761 --> 00:52:18,805
-Fred, wake up. Wake up.
-Gadorsky!

635
00:52:18,972 --> 00:52:20,890
-Gadorsky! She's burning up!
-Wake up!

636
00:52:21,057 --> 00:52:23,435
-Get out! Get out!
-Fred! Fred, wake up! Wake up!

637
00:52:23,601 --> 00:52:26,604
She's burning up! She's gonna hit.
Look out!

638
00:52:27,439 --> 00:52:30,650
It's all right, Fred. Go back to sleep.

639
00:52:31,443 --> 00:52:35,613
Go back to sleep.
Go back to sleep, Fred.

640
00:52:40,577 --> 00:52:43,038
There's nothing to be afraid of.

641
00:52:44,289 --> 00:52:46,374
All you have to do is...

642
00:52:46,624 --> 00:52:50,170
...go to sleep and rest.

643
00:52:51,504 --> 00:52:53,590
Go to sleep.

644
00:52:54,507 --> 00:52:56,968
Go to sleep, Fred.

645
00:52:58,261 --> 00:53:00,138
Go to sleep...

646
00:53:00,638 --> 00:53:02,307
...and rest.

647
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:07,145
Go to sleep.

648
00:53:08,146 --> 00:53:10,231
Go to sleep.

649
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:15,403
All you have to do is rest.

650
00:53:17,822 --> 00:53:19,783
Go to sleep.

651
00:54:43,324 --> 00:54:46,161
Oh, I'm terribly sorry I woke you up.

652
00:54:47,245 --> 00:54:48,496
That's all right but....

653
00:54:48,663 --> 00:54:51,541
I know. You're about to say,
"Where am I?"

654
00:54:51,708 --> 00:54:55,837
I'll tell you later, Fred.
You can sleep as long as you want.

655
00:55:59,859 --> 00:56:04,280
-Did he fly 17s or 24s?
-I don't know.

656
00:56:05,281 --> 00:56:08,952
-What group was he with?
-He didn't say.

657
00:56:09,244 --> 00:56:11,996
Well, what did you two talk about?

658
00:56:12,163 --> 00:56:15,166
Rob, you'd better hurry up.
You'll be late for school.

659
00:56:15,333 --> 00:56:17,502
Holy Moses.

660
00:56:17,669 --> 00:56:21,423
I'll see you later. Bye.

661
00:56:31,349 --> 00:56:35,687
Oh, excuse me, captain.
I'm Rob Stephenson, Peggy's brother.

662
00:56:35,854 --> 00:56:38,565
She's in there in the kitchen.
She's fixing your breakfast.

663
00:56:38,732 --> 00:56:41,192
I've gotta run. Goodbye.

664
00:56:50,035 --> 00:56:53,038
-Hello.
-Hello.

665
00:56:53,997 --> 00:56:55,415
Sit down.

666
00:56:59,544 --> 00:57:03,048
-Here, this may help.
-Thanks.

667
00:57:03,214 --> 00:57:04,758
Sit down.

668
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:09,554
You're Peggy, aren't you?

669
00:57:10,221 --> 00:57:14,059
For the last time, yes. Want some eggs?

670
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:18,146
-You think I can take them?
-Sure, they'll be good for you.

671
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:21,483
-Like them scrambled?
-Any way you cook them.

672
00:57:21,649 --> 00:57:23,026
Good.

673
00:57:25,403 --> 00:57:27,113
Sleep all right?

674
00:57:29,574 --> 00:57:31,159
Wonderful.

675
00:57:31,785 --> 00:57:33,536
That's good.

676
00:57:38,875 --> 00:57:44,089
-Can I help you with any of that business?
-You can pour the coffee if you want some.

677
00:57:46,508 --> 00:57:49,260
Do you mind if I ask you
a somewhat personal question?

678
00:57:49,427 --> 00:57:50,762
No.

679
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:55,975
-Where did you sleep last night?
-On the couch.

680
00:57:57,143 --> 00:58:00,397
-That's terrible.
-What's terrible?

681
00:58:00,563 --> 00:58:02,774
I should've had enough sense
to go to a hotel...

682
00:58:02,941 --> 00:58:05,443
...and not come around here
bothering you.

683
00:58:06,277 --> 00:58:11,074
You didn't bother anybody, Fred.
We're very glad to have you here.

684
00:58:11,616 --> 00:58:15,078
Besides, you couldn't have
gotten a room in a hotel.

685
00:58:16,287 --> 00:58:18,915
Did I get out of line with you?

686
00:58:19,624 --> 00:58:22,335
No. Not really.

687
00:58:22,794 --> 00:58:28,133
-That's good. Because, you see, I'm married.
-Yes, I know.

688
00:58:30,802 --> 00:58:33,638
I must have got pretty plastered
last night.

689
00:58:34,472 --> 00:58:36,725
You had nothing on my dad.

690
00:58:36,891 --> 00:58:38,810
Your dad? Who's he?

691
00:58:41,021 --> 00:58:43,314
Don't you remember Al?

692
00:58:45,108 --> 00:58:49,863
Oh, Al. Yeah, good old Al. Where is he?

693
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:52,157
Still asleep, I guess.

694
00:58:53,825 --> 00:58:55,994
So you're Al's daughter.

695
00:58:56,911 --> 00:59:00,040
You've got it all straight now.

696
00:59:01,082 --> 00:59:04,377
-I feel a lot better.
-That's good.

697
00:59:06,838 --> 00:59:09,841
-Are you married, Peggy?
-No.

698
00:59:10,008 --> 00:59:11,634
I guess you've hardly had time.

699
00:59:11,801 --> 00:59:14,804
-You must have been engaged, though.
-No.

700
00:59:15,347 --> 00:59:19,225
Why not? What's the matter
with the guys around here?

701
00:59:19,392 --> 00:59:22,520
I guess the best of them
are already married.

702
00:59:29,235 --> 00:59:32,030
-Good morning, Fred.
-Good morning, Mrs....

703
00:59:32,197 --> 00:59:35,367
-Milly's the name.
-Thanks, Milly.

704
00:59:35,533 --> 00:59:37,827
When Al wakes up,
tell him how much I appreciate--

705
00:59:37,994 --> 00:59:41,206
You're not going.
You haven't even finished your breakfast.

706
00:59:41,373 --> 00:59:44,626
I'm afraid I haven't got
much of an appetite this morning.

707
00:59:44,793 --> 00:59:46,461
Besides, I've gotta get downtown.

708
00:59:46,628 --> 00:59:49,714
Maybe now I can get into
that apartment house where my wife lives.

709
00:59:49,881 --> 00:59:53,009
I'll drive you, Fred.
I've got to get to work at the hospital.

710
00:59:53,176 --> 00:59:54,636
Just be a minute.

711
00:59:54,803 --> 00:59:57,055
I must've acted
pretty disgracefully last night.

712
00:59:57,222 --> 00:59:58,431
No.

713
00:59:58,598 --> 01:00:02,852
You just fell in with bad company
at Butch's and got stinking.

714
01:00:03,395 --> 01:00:07,315
You see, the whole trouble was
I couldn't find Marie, that's my wife.

715
01:00:07,482 --> 01:00:11,778
-I didn't know she had a job in a nightclub.
-Could've happened to anyone.

716
01:00:11,945 --> 01:00:15,281
If Al had come home a little later last night,
we wouldn't have been in.

717
01:00:15,448 --> 01:00:17,450
He wouldn't have known
where to look for us.

718
01:00:17,617 --> 01:00:19,619
-How is Al?
-We don't know yet.

719
01:00:19,786 --> 01:00:21,413
Ready, Fred.

720
01:00:21,579 --> 01:00:25,291
When he wakes up, you can tell him for me,
I think he's a pretty lucky guy.

721
01:00:25,458 --> 01:00:27,002
Thank you, Fred.

722
01:00:27,168 --> 01:00:30,338
-Goodbye, Milly, Thanks for everything.
-Goodbye.

723
01:00:30,505 --> 01:00:33,425
-Bye, Mom.
-Bye, dear.

724
01:03:08,997 --> 01:03:13,460
-What'd you do before the war, Fred?
-I was a fountain attendant.

725
01:03:13,626 --> 01:03:16,671
-A what?
-Soda jerk.

726
01:03:17,672 --> 01:03:21,885
-Surprised?
-Yes, a little.

727
01:03:22,052 --> 01:03:25,055
I bet you mixed up
a fine ice cream soda.

728
01:03:25,221 --> 01:03:28,516
You're darn right.
I was an expert behind that fountain.

729
01:03:28,683 --> 01:03:30,935
I used to toss
a scoop of ice cream in the air...

730
01:03:31,102 --> 01:03:35,231
...adjust for wind drift, velocity, altitude,
and, wham, in the cone every time.

731
01:03:35,774 --> 01:03:39,027
I figure that's where
I really learned to drop bombs.

732
01:03:39,361 --> 01:03:41,654
What do you think you'll do now?

733
01:03:42,697 --> 01:03:45,325
I'm not going back to that drugstore.

734
01:03:46,326 --> 01:03:50,705
Somehow or other, I can't figure myself
getting excited about a root beer float.

735
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:54,167
I don't know just what I will do...

736
01:03:54,334 --> 01:03:57,337
...but I'm gonna take
plenty of time looking around.

737
01:03:59,714 --> 01:04:04,469
I guess after all the places you've been,
Boone City looks pretty dreary to you.

738
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:08,223
Not from where I'm sitting right now.

739
01:04:09,974 --> 01:04:12,560
That's not just a line. I really meant it.

740
01:04:38,753 --> 01:04:41,923
-Who's that?
-It's me. Milly.

741
01:04:43,091 --> 01:04:46,511
-I brought your breakfast.
-Thanks.

742
01:04:46,678 --> 01:04:49,597
-Didn't think you'd be up for hours.
-You know, I had a dream.

743
01:04:49,764 --> 01:04:51,850
I dreamt I was home.

744
01:04:52,350 --> 01:04:55,770
I've had that same dream
hundreds of times before.

745
01:04:56,187 --> 01:04:59,524
This time I wanted to find out
if it's really true.

746
01:05:00,483 --> 01:05:03,153
-Am I really home?
-Looks like it.

747
01:05:03,319 --> 01:05:07,699
And you're going to be royally treated.
You're having breakfast in bed.

748
01:05:10,618 --> 01:05:14,748
I seem to have a vague recollection
that we had a couple of children.

749
01:05:14,914 --> 01:05:17,292
-Is that right?
-That's right.

750
01:05:17,709 --> 01:05:19,044
What ever became of them?

751
01:05:19,210 --> 01:05:22,797
Rob's gone to school
and Peggy's driving downtown with Fred.

752
01:05:22,964 --> 01:05:24,382
Fred?

753
01:05:25,508 --> 01:05:29,596
Oh, yeah, Fred. He's a great guy.

754
01:05:34,267 --> 01:05:35,727
All right?

755
01:05:41,232 --> 01:05:44,944
There's your breakfast.
I have work to do.

756
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:04,589
Well, it was nice knowing you, Peggy.

757
01:06:04,923 --> 01:06:09,844
-That sounds like a permanent goodbye.
-You never know.

758
01:06:10,512 --> 01:06:13,264
You and your wife
must come up to dinner.

759
01:06:13,932 --> 01:06:15,725
That'd be fine.

760
01:06:16,476 --> 01:06:19,020
Oh, there's one thing more.

761
01:06:19,187 --> 01:06:22,107
About that dream I had last night.

762
01:06:22,273 --> 01:06:25,860
I've had it before.
I'm sorry I had to bother you with it.

763
01:06:26,027 --> 01:06:30,073
But you were very kind and you didn't
even mention it this morning.

764
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:33,451
As a matter of fact,
you've been swell about everything.

765
01:06:34,119 --> 01:06:36,538
I think they ought to put you
in mass production.

766
01:06:36,705 --> 01:06:38,832
-Goodbye, Fred.
-Bye.

767
01:06:40,875 --> 01:06:45,380
-Maybe I'd better wait and see if you get in.
-Maybe that's a good idea.

768
01:08:00,955 --> 01:08:02,582
Bye.

769
01:08:30,026 --> 01:08:33,113
All right. All right.

770
01:08:33,655 --> 01:08:35,657
Say, what's the big i--?

771
01:08:36,366 --> 01:08:39,536
-Freddy!
-Hi, babe.

772
01:08:42,831 --> 01:08:45,417
Freddy, darling,
why didn't you let me know?

773
01:08:45,583 --> 01:08:47,836
You didn't give me a chance
to fix my face.

774
01:08:48,003 --> 01:08:51,256
-You look all right, babe.
-Oh, Freddy, darling. I'm so excited.

775
01:08:51,423 --> 01:08:52,966
I can't believe it's you.

776
01:08:53,133 --> 01:08:56,845
Come on in, honey,
where I can look at you.

777
01:08:57,012 --> 01:09:00,890
Oh, you're marvelous. All those ribbons!

778
01:09:01,057 --> 01:09:05,020
You gotta tell me what they all mean.
But not now.

779
01:09:06,730 --> 01:09:10,025
Let me look at you.
But how did you know I was here?

780
01:09:10,191 --> 01:09:12,360
When I got in yesterday,
I went over to Pop's--

781
01:09:12,527 --> 01:09:15,572
-Yesterday? Why didn't--?
-I came here, but it was too late.

782
01:09:15,739 --> 01:09:18,742
You'd already gone to work.
I went from one nightclub to another.

783
01:09:18,908 --> 01:09:21,369
-You were looking for me?
-I was looking for my wife.

784
01:09:21,536 --> 01:09:23,663
You've found her now.

785
01:09:48,730 --> 01:09:50,899
I wonder how Fred's getting along.

786
01:09:51,066 --> 01:09:53,693
Fred looks to me as
if he's able to take care of himself.

787
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:55,445
I'm not so sure about that.

788
01:09:55,612 --> 01:09:58,907
It isn't easy for those Air Force
glamour boys when they get grounded.

789
01:09:59,074 --> 01:10:03,828
Now, when you've been in the infantry,
any change is bound to be an improvement.

790
01:10:04,704 --> 01:10:07,248
Please stop fussing around
and sit down and talk to me.

791
01:10:07,415 --> 01:10:10,085
All right, sergeant.
Gosh, you've got tough.

792
01:10:10,251 --> 01:10:12,379
-Is this all the cream there is?
-That's all.

793
01:10:12,545 --> 01:10:16,091
Fine situation when a man
can't get enough to eat in his own home.

794
01:10:16,257 --> 01:10:17,676
Look at my pants.

795
01:10:17,842 --> 01:10:19,344
-What about them?
-Too big.

796
01:10:19,511 --> 01:10:21,971
Gives you an idea
of what the war did to my waistline.

797
01:10:22,138 --> 01:10:24,766
-You holding your stomach in?
-No, it's disappeared.

798
01:10:24,933 --> 01:10:28,144
I'll have to take my clothes to
Wyndham and Briggs, get them altered.

799
01:10:28,311 --> 01:10:30,522
I wouldn't be in too much of a hurry
about that.

800
01:10:30,689 --> 01:10:34,192
A couple of weeks of heavy eating
and those pants will fit perfectly.

801
01:10:36,528 --> 01:10:38,446
Don't answer it.

802
01:10:44,577 --> 01:10:48,123
Hello. Oh, yes. He's here.

803
01:10:48,289 --> 01:10:50,959
For me?
If it's the War Department, I'm out.

804
01:10:51,126 --> 01:10:52,460
It's Mr. Milton.

805
01:10:52,627 --> 01:10:55,797
-Who?
-Mr. Milton. At the bank.

806
01:10:58,299 --> 01:11:00,301
He'll be right on.

807
01:11:02,929 --> 01:11:04,472
Hello?

808
01:11:05,348 --> 01:11:07,684
Oh, yes, Mr. Milton.

809
01:11:08,768 --> 01:11:12,313
Yeah, it sounds good to hear yours.

810
01:11:13,148 --> 01:11:14,774
Yes.

811
01:11:16,609 --> 01:11:19,571
Yes, indeed, Mr. Milton. Yeah.

812
01:11:19,738 --> 01:11:22,323
Well, not too bad, no.

813
01:11:23,825 --> 01:11:28,496
Yes. Why, of course.
It's very kind of you to say that.

814
01:11:33,001 --> 01:11:34,461
Yes.

815
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:38,590
Well, I'll certainly drop in.

816
01:11:40,425 --> 01:11:44,012
Oh, she's fine, thank you.

817
01:11:44,721 --> 01:11:48,516
-Yes, they're fine too.
-They're fine too.

818
01:11:50,643 --> 01:11:55,190
Well-- I-- That's--

819
01:11:56,232 --> 01:11:58,818
Thank you, Mr. Milton.

820
01:11:58,985 --> 01:12:01,071
Yes, good.

821
01:12:01,488 --> 01:12:02,781
Good--

822
01:12:04,407 --> 01:12:06,034
Good-- Goodbye.

823
01:12:07,452 --> 01:12:08,703
Mr. Milton.

824
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:11,164
He's called up every day
to see if you'd got home.

825
01:12:11,331 --> 01:12:13,875
I guess they want you back at the bank.

826
01:12:14,584 --> 01:12:16,544
He wants me to drop in and talk about it.

827
01:12:16,711 --> 01:12:18,713
You're not going to work right away.

828
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:21,424
You ought to rest a while,
take a vacation.

829
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:23,551
I've got to make money.

830
01:12:23,718 --> 01:12:27,097
Last year it was kill Japs,
and this year it's make money.

831
01:12:27,263 --> 01:12:29,974
We're all right for the time being.

832
01:12:30,392 --> 01:12:33,061
Why do they bother me like that
the first day I get home?

833
01:12:33,228 --> 01:12:35,355
Why can't they give a fellow time
to get used to his own family?

834
01:12:35,522 --> 01:12:37,482
Why don't you come over here
and sit down?

835
01:12:37,649 --> 01:12:41,611
-Chair's liable to break.
-We can't be worrying about chairs.

836
01:12:41,778 --> 01:12:45,740
Not when they want me back
in a nice fat job at a nice fat bank.

837
01:12:45,907 --> 01:12:49,160
-You don't seem very happy about it.
-I'm not.

838
01:12:49,327 --> 01:12:53,832
-Why not, darling?
-I can't help thinking about the other guys.

839
01:12:55,041 --> 01:12:57,585
All the ones who haven't got you.

840
01:12:58,169 --> 01:13:00,505
-You're crazy.
-No.

841
01:13:00,672 --> 01:13:02,924
Too sane for my own good.

842
01:13:27,073 --> 01:13:29,701
-Yes, sir?
-Didn't this used to be Bullard's Drugstore?

843
01:13:29,868 --> 01:13:33,329
Yes, but it was taken over last year
by the Midway chain.

844
01:13:33,496 --> 01:13:36,583
But old Mr. Bullard's still here,
in charge of prescription.

845
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:39,461
-He's right over there by the phone.
-Thanks.

846
01:14:06,279 --> 01:14:07,822
Yes, sir?

847
01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:11,034
-Oh, Fred Derry.
-Hello, Mr. Bullard.

848
01:14:11,201 --> 01:14:14,829
-Oh, it's good to see you again.
-How are you? It's good to see you.

849
01:14:14,996 --> 01:14:17,499
-Say, what happened here?
-Well, I sold out.

850
01:14:17,665 --> 01:14:20,543
The Midway people had been
after this location for a long time.

851
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:23,963
-Didn't he used to work here?
-Yes, he did.

852
01:14:24,130 --> 01:14:26,091
I'll bet he's back looking for a job.

853
01:14:26,257 --> 01:14:30,679
And he'll get it too,
with all those ribbons on his chest.

854
01:14:30,845 --> 01:14:35,058
Well, nobody's job is safe
with all these servicemen crowding in.

855
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:40,021
I'd like to have you meet
our new manager, Mr. Thorpe.

856
01:14:40,188 --> 01:14:43,191
Oh, no, I don't think so.
I just dropped in to say hello to you.

857
01:14:43,358 --> 01:14:46,569
-I don't want that old job back.
-Yes, I know.

858
01:14:46,736 --> 01:14:49,364
But Midway's a big, big outfit.

859
01:14:49,531 --> 01:14:52,575
You never can tell. Come along.

860
01:14:54,577 --> 01:14:57,539
-Thank you, Mr. Bullard.
-I'll see you later.

861
01:14:57,706 --> 01:15:00,250
I can see that you had
a splendid war record, Derry.

862
01:15:00,417 --> 01:15:01,668
Just average, Mr. Thorpe.

863
01:15:01,835 --> 01:15:04,546
You'll understand
that since this business changed hands...

864
01:15:04,713 --> 01:15:07,382
...we're under no obligation
to give you your old job back.

865
01:15:07,549 --> 01:15:10,969
I wasn't thinking of my old job.
I'm looking for a better one.

866
01:15:11,136 --> 01:15:14,264
What are your qualifications?
Your experience?

867
01:15:14,431 --> 01:15:16,057
Two years behind a soda fountain...

868
01:15:16,224 --> 01:15:18,309
...and three years
behind a Norden bombsight.

869
01:15:18,476 --> 01:15:19,519
Yeah.

870
01:15:19,686 --> 01:15:22,605
While in the Army, did you have
any experience in procurement?

871
01:15:22,772 --> 01:15:25,025
-No.
-Purchasing of supplies, materials?

872
01:15:25,191 --> 01:15:27,277
I didn't do any of that.
I just dropped bombs.

873
01:15:27,444 --> 01:15:29,237
-Did you do any personnel work?
-No.

874
01:15:29,404 --> 01:15:33,199
But, as an officer, you surely
had to act in an executive capacity...

875
01:15:33,366 --> 01:15:36,286
...you had to command men,
be responsible for their morale?

876
01:15:36,453 --> 01:15:39,748
No, I was only responsible
for getting the bombs on the target.

877
01:15:39,914 --> 01:15:41,207
I didn't command anybody.

878
01:15:41,374 --> 01:15:44,252
I see.
I'm sure that work required great skill.

879
01:15:44,419 --> 01:15:47,630
But, unfortunately,
we've no opportunities...

880
01:15:47,797 --> 01:15:50,050
-...for that with Midway Drugs.
-Yeah.

881
01:15:50,216 --> 01:15:52,886
However, we might be able to
provide an opening for you...

882
01:15:53,053 --> 01:15:55,430
...as an assistant to Mr. Merkel,
the floor manager.

883
01:15:55,597 --> 01:15:57,682
-Sticky Merkel?
-Clarence Merkel.

884
01:15:57,849 --> 01:16:01,186
Yeah, that's the fella. He used to be
my assistant at the soda fountain.

885
01:16:01,353 --> 01:16:03,563
He's a very good man.

886
01:16:03,730 --> 01:16:08,109
Incidentally, your work would require
part-time duties at the soda fountain.

887
01:16:09,110 --> 01:16:11,446
-At what salary?
-Thirty-two fifty per week.

888
01:16:11,613 --> 01:16:12,739
Thirty-two fifty.

889
01:16:12,906 --> 01:16:15,408
I used to make over $400 a month
in the Air Force.

890
01:16:15,575 --> 01:16:17,369
-The war is over, Derry.
-Is over.

891
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:19,829
Yeah, well, I think I'll look around,
Mr. Thorpe.

892
01:16:19,996 --> 01:16:23,416
Thank you, very much.
Take care of that cold.

893
01:16:27,504 --> 01:16:29,631
-I gotta run. I'll drop back later.
-All right.

894
01:16:29,798 --> 01:16:31,341
-Bye.
-Bye.

895
01:16:31,508 --> 01:16:33,426
Excuse me, girls.

896
01:17:19,014 --> 01:17:22,350
No, conditions are none too good
right now, Al.

897
01:17:22,517 --> 01:17:28,356
Considerable uncertainty in the business
picture. Strikes, taxes still ruinous.

898
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:32,193
-You like that cigar?
-Oh, yes, Mr. Milton. It's fine.

899
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:36,031
Hard to get those during the war, but
they're coming in regularly from Havana.

900
01:17:36,197 --> 01:17:39,701
All things will readjust themselves
in time.

901
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:42,746
We want you back here with us, Al.

902
01:17:42,912 --> 01:17:46,041
Well, that's very nice of you,
Mr. Milton...

903
01:17:46,207 --> 01:17:50,045
...but I noticed Steese
sitting at my old desk.

904
01:17:50,503 --> 01:17:54,257
-I wouldn't wanna push him out.
-Steese will stay right there.

905
01:17:54,424 --> 01:17:56,134
You're moving up.

906
01:17:57,552 --> 01:18:00,889
What would you say to being
vice president in charge of small loans...

907
01:18:01,056 --> 01:18:06,102
...at a salary of $12,000 a year?
What would you say to that, huh?

908
01:18:07,896 --> 01:18:12,734
-I'd say it can't be true.
-Job's there, Al. You're the man for it.

909
01:18:13,818 --> 01:18:15,570
What makes you think I am, Mr. Milton?

910
01:18:15,737 --> 01:18:19,282
Well, your war experience
would prove invaluable to us here.

911
01:18:19,449 --> 01:18:23,578
See, we have many new problems.
This GI Bill of Rights, for instance.

912
01:18:23,745 --> 01:18:28,333
It involves us in consideration
of all kinds of loans to ex-servicemen.

913
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:31,961
We need a man who understands
the soldiers' problems...

914
01:18:32,128 --> 01:18:34,547
...and at the same time
who's well-grounded...

915
01:18:34,714 --> 01:18:37,926
...in the fundamental principles
of sound banking.

916
01:18:38,593 --> 01:18:40,595
In other words, you.

917
01:18:40,970 --> 01:18:44,432
Well? What do you say, Al?

918
01:18:46,685 --> 01:18:49,854
-I'm overwhelmed.
-Of course. Of course.

919
01:18:50,605 --> 01:18:52,440
Will you bring them in now,
Mrs. Garrett?

920
01:18:52,607 --> 01:18:53,650
Yes, sir.

921
01:18:53,817 --> 01:18:56,736
-I'd thought of taking it easy for a while.
-Naturally, my boy.

922
01:18:56,903 --> 01:18:59,280
After what you've been through,
you need a vacation.

923
01:18:59,447 --> 01:19:00,782
Thank you. Thank you.

924
01:19:00,949 --> 01:19:04,285
You're entitled to enjoy life for a change
before you come back to work.

925
01:19:04,452 --> 01:19:06,287
Very kind of you to say that,
Mr. Milton.

926
01:19:06,454 --> 01:19:09,165
While you're resting, let's just....
When you get a chance.

927
01:19:09,332 --> 01:19:12,210
This contains reports with all the figures
on our small loans.

928
01:19:12,377 --> 01:19:15,005
It'll give you the whole picture.
You can look them over.

929
01:19:15,171 --> 01:19:17,173
Just in your spare time, of course.

930
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:22,971
-Oh, briefcase is a slight gift from the bank.
-Well, thank you.

931
01:19:23,138 --> 01:19:25,974
-Thank you very much, Mr. Milton.
-Glad to have you back, Al.

932
01:19:26,141 --> 01:19:27,934
Thank you, sir.

933
01:19:31,646 --> 01:19:33,898
Well, of course, sweetheart.
I knew you'd be heartbroken.

934
01:19:34,065 --> 01:19:38,486
But listen, you can get another blond.
What about Sylvia Mack?

935
01:19:42,365 --> 01:19:46,036
Oh, you're crazy.
I think her legs are cute.

936
01:19:47,328 --> 01:19:50,415
Well, I'm sorry too,
but he doesn't want me to work nights.

937
01:19:50,582 --> 01:19:53,501
He says it's inconvenient.

938
01:19:55,670 --> 01:19:57,797
Oh, he's wonderful. And how.

939
01:19:57,964 --> 01:20:01,343
Snappy uniform,
a whole ribbon counter on his chest.

940
01:20:01,509 --> 01:20:03,845
Sure, I'll bring him in sometime.

941
01:20:04,888 --> 01:20:07,015
The doorbell's ringing.
I guess that's Freddy.

942
01:20:07,182 --> 01:20:09,851
Yeah, yeah. Bye.

943
01:20:13,688 --> 01:20:16,983
Hey, Marie, have you got an extra key?
I'd like to have it.

944
01:20:17,609 --> 01:20:20,362
-What are you looking at?
-Holy smoke, honey.

945
01:20:20,528 --> 01:20:23,365
That's the first time
I've ever seen you in civilian clothes.

946
01:20:23,531 --> 01:20:28,036
Well, from now on, honey,
you're not gonna see me in anything else.

947
01:20:28,203 --> 01:20:31,706
I just got it out of the mothballs
over at Pop's house.

948
01:20:34,584 --> 01:20:36,795
I called up the Blue Devil.

949
01:20:36,961 --> 01:20:38,963
-Who?
-That's the night club where I worked.

950
01:20:39,130 --> 01:20:40,799
-I told them I'm through.
-Oh, swell.

951
01:20:40,965 --> 01:20:44,552
But let's go there for dinner, Freddy.
I'd like to introduce you to the gang.

952
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:47,472
-They've heard me talk so much about you.
-Anything you say.

953
01:20:47,639 --> 01:20:51,226
Here's some perfume
and some other junk I bought in Paris.

954
01:20:51,393 --> 01:20:55,480
Fleurette No. 5. And this scarf's cute.

955
01:20:55,647 --> 01:20:57,732
To think of having things from Paris.

956
01:20:57,899 --> 01:21:00,193
Freddy, honey,
you're just a big hunk of heaven.

957
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:04,197
-What's that a picture of?
-Bomb hits on Düsseldorf.

958
01:21:05,615 --> 01:21:07,742
Well, that's my B-17.

959
01:21:07,909 --> 01:21:09,744
What are those?

960
01:21:10,412 --> 01:21:13,748
Little black flowers that grow in the sky.

961
01:21:14,791 --> 01:21:16,167
Hey, that's me!

962
01:21:16,334 --> 01:21:19,587
Yeah, I had this picture pasted
on the plexiglass over my bombsight.

963
01:21:19,754 --> 01:21:22,549
-It took a lot of trips over Germany, baby.
-That's sweet.

964
01:21:22,716 --> 01:21:24,259
The guys used to kid me about it.

965
01:21:24,426 --> 01:21:27,595
They'd take a look at the picture and ask,
"Who's the dame?"

966
01:21:27,762 --> 01:21:29,931
And when I told them
it was my wife they'd say:

967
01:21:30,098 --> 01:21:32,100
"Go on, nobody's got a wife
looks like that.

968
01:21:32,267 --> 01:21:34,269
What's her telephone number?"

969
01:21:35,770 --> 01:21:38,106
When we go out tonight,
will you wear your uniform?

970
01:21:38,273 --> 01:21:39,816
-Oh, no.
-For my sake.

971
01:21:39,983 --> 01:21:43,028
-I'm sorry, baby.
-I'd be so proud to be out with you.

972
01:21:43,194 --> 01:21:45,155
Won't you, please?

973
01:21:46,656 --> 01:21:48,700
Well, seeing as it's you.

974
01:21:48,867 --> 01:21:51,786
Seeing as I can't find any place
to hang it up, all right.

975
01:21:51,953 --> 01:21:53,621
But it's the last time.

976
01:21:53,788 --> 01:21:56,374
From now on,
if you don't like me in civilian clothes...

977
01:21:56,875 --> 01:22:00,962
-...we'll just have to stay here all the time.
-Would that be so bad?

978
01:22:04,299 --> 01:22:08,094
Seriously, honey, you gotta get yourself
some new clothes. That suit's awful.

979
01:22:08,261 --> 01:22:10,722
I know, it's terrible.

980
01:22:10,889 --> 01:22:13,850
But they tell me
you can't buy anything new now.

981
01:22:14,017 --> 01:22:16,978
I know a place where you can get
snappy suits made to order.

982
01:22:17,145 --> 01:22:18,772
You mean there's a black market?

983
01:22:18,938 --> 01:22:21,608
You can get a lot of things,
if you know the right people.

984
01:22:21,775 --> 01:22:23,985
And if you don't care
how much you spend.

985
01:22:24,486 --> 01:22:28,698
We're not worrying about that, baby.
I got money. Cash money.

986
01:22:28,865 --> 01:22:32,744
Nearly a thousand bucks
right from the good old U.S. Treasury.

987
01:22:32,911 --> 01:22:35,705
Oh, now you look wonderful.

988
01:22:35,872 --> 01:22:37,749
You look like yourself.

989
01:22:37,916 --> 01:22:40,669
You know, honey, it's so wonderful,
I can hardly believe it.

990
01:22:40,835 --> 01:22:44,422
Now we can have a real honeymoon
without a care in the world.

991
01:22:44,589 --> 01:22:48,927
Just as if nothing had ever happened.
Just as if you'd never gone away.

992
01:22:49,094 --> 01:22:53,139
-We're right back where we started.
-Don't say that, Marie.

993
01:22:53,306 --> 01:22:55,934
-Don't say what?
-That we're right back where we started.

994
01:22:56,101 --> 01:22:59,145
We can never be back there again.
We never wanna be back there.

995
01:22:59,312 --> 01:23:01,981
But why not? What is it?
What's the matter with you, Fred?

996
01:23:02,148 --> 01:23:03,233
Oh, never mind. Skip it.

997
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:05,610
I was back to the drugstore
where I used work...

998
01:23:05,777 --> 01:23:07,862
...and I just got suddenly reminded.

999
01:23:10,532 --> 01:23:12,242
Come on, let's go out and have fun.

1000
01:23:41,229 --> 01:23:43,606
-Hello, Wilma.
-Good afternoon, Mr. Parrish.

1001
01:23:43,773 --> 01:23:47,485
-Have you seen Homer?
-He's out in the woodshed.

1002
01:23:47,652 --> 01:23:52,449
Says he wants to get in some practice
shooting. So he can go hunting.

1003
01:23:53,658 --> 01:23:56,536
Thought that he'd seen enough shooting
in the war.

1004
01:23:56,703 --> 01:23:59,748
Well, I guess he just wants
to find something to occupy himself.

1005
01:23:59,914 --> 01:24:01,583
I guess so.

1006
01:24:02,208 --> 01:24:04,586
I wish there was something
I knew to do for him.

1007
01:24:04,753 --> 01:24:08,089
His mother and I have tried
to make him feel at home.

1008
01:24:09,716 --> 01:24:12,969
But he just keeps to himself
all the time.

1009
01:24:37,744 --> 01:24:40,455
Hello, Luella.
What are you kids doing?

1010
01:24:40,622 --> 01:24:43,625
Oh, nothing, we're just playing.

1011
01:24:47,462 --> 01:24:50,548
That's his girl. They're engaged.

1012
01:24:56,262 --> 01:24:59,182
-Oh, hello, Wilma.
-Hello.

1013
01:24:59,516 --> 01:25:01,768
-Looking for something?
-No.

1014
01:25:01,935 --> 01:25:03,728
Go right ahead.

1015
01:25:32,799 --> 01:25:36,678
-How'd you do, Homer?
-Only fair.

1016
01:25:36,845 --> 01:25:38,847
Well, you did fine.

1017
01:25:39,597 --> 01:25:41,349
I'll do better.

1018
01:25:51,901 --> 01:25:54,195
I've been wanting to have
a chance to talk to you.

1019
01:25:54,362 --> 01:25:57,949
-What about?
-About everything.

1020
01:25:58,366 --> 01:26:00,076
About us.

1021
01:26:00,243 --> 01:26:01,995
What about us?

1022
01:26:02,162 --> 01:26:05,832
-We're all right, aren't we?
-No.

1023
01:26:06,416 --> 01:26:09,586
-Listen to me, Homer.
-I'm listening.

1024
01:26:11,087 --> 01:26:15,300
You wrote me that when you got home
you and I were going to be married.

1025
01:26:15,467 --> 01:26:19,387
If you wrote that once, you wrote it
a hundred times. Isn't that true?

1026
01:26:19,888 --> 01:26:23,391
Yes, but things are different now.

1027
01:26:24,893 --> 01:26:26,686
Have you changed your mind?

1028
01:26:26,853 --> 01:26:29,856
Have I said anything about
changing my mind?

1029
01:26:30,148 --> 01:26:33,777
No. That's just it.

1030
01:26:33,943 --> 01:26:36,988
You haven't said anything
about anything.

1031
01:26:41,910 --> 01:26:44,579
-That's not loaded, is it?
-Of course, it isn't loaded.

1032
01:26:44,746 --> 01:26:47,165
Don't you think I know
how to handle a gun?

1033
01:26:47,332 --> 01:26:49,376
I don't know what to think, Homer.

1034
01:26:49,542 --> 01:26:52,379
All I know is, I was in love with you
when you left...

1035
01:26:52,545 --> 01:26:54,923
...and I'm in love with you now.

1036
01:26:55,090 --> 01:26:59,803
Other things may have changed,
but that hasn't.

1037
01:27:09,562 --> 01:27:11,731
You wanna see how the hooks work?

1038
01:27:11,898 --> 01:27:13,942
You wanna see the freak?

1039
01:27:16,611 --> 01:27:17,862
All right, I'll show you.

1040
01:27:19,656 --> 01:27:21,491
Take a good look.

1041
01:27:22,492 --> 01:27:25,286
I didn't mean anything, Homer.

1042
01:27:26,705 --> 01:27:27,997
I was only....

1043
01:27:32,085 --> 01:27:34,587
I'm sorry, Luella.

1044
01:27:34,754 --> 01:27:37,048
It isn't your fault.

1045
01:27:37,340 --> 01:27:38,883
Go on and play with your friends.

1046
01:27:53,189 --> 01:27:55,692
I know, Wilma. I was wrong.

1047
01:27:55,859 --> 01:27:58,111
I shouldn't have acted like that.

1048
01:27:58,278 --> 01:28:01,865
It wasn't her that burned my hands off.

1049
01:28:04,534 --> 01:28:05,827
I'll be all right.

1050
01:28:05,994 --> 01:28:07,787
I just gotta work it out myself.

1051
01:28:07,954 --> 01:28:12,459
-I could help you, Homer, if you'd let me.
-I've gotta work it out myself.

1052
01:28:13,293 --> 01:28:19,215
All I've wanted is for people to treat me
like anybody else instead of pitying me.

1053
01:28:20,258 --> 01:28:23,178
I guess it's hard for them to do that.

1054
01:28:23,345 --> 01:28:27,849
I've just gotta learn to get used to it
and pay no attention.

1055
01:28:29,017 --> 01:28:32,604
-Couldn't I--?
-No, I've gotta do it myself.

1056
01:29:50,932 --> 01:29:53,768
-Yes?
-Okay, Pop, I'm going to bed now.

1057
01:29:53,935 --> 01:29:56,187
Be right with you, Homer.

1058
01:31:14,349 --> 01:31:15,558
Good night, son.

1059
01:31:15,725 --> 01:31:18,269
Good night, Pop. Thanks.

1060
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:41,418
Hello, babe.

1061
01:31:41,584 --> 01:31:43,211
-What you got there?
-Our supper.

1062
01:31:43,378 --> 01:31:46,297
Cream of corn soup, potato salad, salami
and liverwurst.

1063
01:31:46,464 --> 01:31:49,551
We're going to Jackie's Hot Spot.
I phoned and made a reservation.

1064
01:31:49,718 --> 01:31:51,469
We're eating at home.

1065
01:31:51,636 --> 01:31:53,847
What's the matter, honey?
You sick or something?

1066
01:31:54,014 --> 01:31:55,890
No, dear. Broke.

1067
01:31:57,308 --> 01:31:59,310
-Broke?
-You got it.

1068
01:31:59,477 --> 01:32:02,188
But what happened? Where did it go to?

1069
01:32:02,355 --> 01:32:04,733
We spent it, babe.
That's what happened.

1070
01:32:04,899 --> 01:32:06,609
I'm sorry it's so sudden.

1071
01:32:06,776 --> 01:32:08,903
I didn't tell you the money
was almost gone...

1072
01:32:09,070 --> 01:32:11,781
...because every day I kept hoping
I was gonna land a job.

1073
01:32:11,948 --> 01:32:15,285
At last I got it through my thick skull
that I'm not going to get one...

1074
01:32:15,452 --> 01:32:17,912
...so we'll have to forget about
Jackie's Hot Spot...

1075
01:32:18,079 --> 01:32:20,331
...and the Blue Devil and all the rest.

1076
01:32:20,582 --> 01:32:21,875
Why couldn't you get a job?

1077
01:32:22,042 --> 01:32:23,418
-You really been trying?
-Sure.

1078
01:32:23,585 --> 01:32:27,297
I've been all over town.
All the employment offices and the USES.

1079
01:32:27,464 --> 01:32:29,299
They all tell me I don't know anything.

1080
01:32:29,466 --> 01:32:33,470
They say I ought to spend a couple of years
as an apprentice or go to a trade school.

1081
01:32:34,387 --> 01:32:37,182
A couple of years
with you going to kindergarten.

1082
01:32:37,349 --> 01:32:39,684
And what would I be doing
in the meantime?

1083
01:32:39,851 --> 01:32:42,604
Well, you could always help me
with my homework.

1084
01:32:46,983 --> 01:32:49,027
-Fred.
-Yep?

1085
01:32:49,277 --> 01:32:50,612
Are you really all right?

1086
01:32:50,779 --> 01:32:52,781
Of course, I'm all right. Why?

1087
01:32:52,947 --> 01:32:57,285
-I mean, in your mind. Is there anything--?
-My mind?

1088
01:32:57,452 --> 01:33:00,288
You mean you think I'm going goofy?

1089
01:33:01,956 --> 01:33:06,127
I've been wondering.
What was Gadosky?

1090
01:33:07,045 --> 01:33:08,463
Where did you hear about him?

1091
01:33:08,630 --> 01:33:10,131
You talk in your sleep, honey.

1092
01:33:10,298 --> 01:33:12,509
Sometimes you shout.
Something's on fire...

1093
01:33:12,676 --> 01:33:16,304
...and you want somebody to get out.
You keep saying, "Gadosky, Gadosky."

1094
01:33:16,471 --> 01:33:18,181
Gadorsky.

1095
01:33:18,556 --> 01:33:21,601
Oh, he was a friend of mine, a B-17 pilot.
He got it over Berlin.

1096
01:33:21,768 --> 01:33:23,853
Can't you get those things
out of your system?

1097
01:33:24,020 --> 01:33:26,314
-Oh, sure.
-Maybe that's what's holding you back.

1098
01:33:26,481 --> 01:33:29,818
The war's over. You won't get any place
till you stop thinking about it.

1099
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:31,152
Come on, snap out of it.

1100
01:33:31,319 --> 01:33:33,613
Okay, honey, I'll do that.

1101
01:33:35,907 --> 01:33:39,744
I didn't tell you, Fred,
but I got a little money saved.

1102
01:33:39,911 --> 01:33:42,122
Dinner's on me tonight.

1103
01:33:43,164 --> 01:33:46,668
You'd better keep on saving it, babe.
It might come in handy sometime.

1104
01:33:46,835 --> 01:33:49,295
I appreciate the offer,
but we're eating at home.

1105
01:33:49,462 --> 01:33:52,340
Well, I'm hungry.
I'm going out by myself.

1106
01:33:52,507 --> 01:33:54,676
You're not going out.
You're gonna stay here...

1107
01:33:54,843 --> 01:33:57,178
-...and eat what I cook and like it.
-Let go of me.

1108
01:33:57,345 --> 01:33:59,014
When we were married, the justice
of the peace said something about...

1109
01:33:59,180 --> 01:34:01,891
...for richer, for poorer,
for better, for worse. Remember?

1110
01:34:02,058 --> 01:34:04,644
-This is the worse.
-When do we get going on the better?

1111
01:34:04,811 --> 01:34:06,646
Whenever I get wise to myself, I guess.

1112
01:34:06,813 --> 01:34:10,233
Whenever I wake up and realize
I'm not an officer and a gentleman anymore.

1113
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:12,444
I'm just another soda jerk out of a job.

1114
01:34:12,610 --> 01:34:14,696
Now, go on and sit down
and read a magazine...

1115
01:34:14,863 --> 01:34:17,407
...or listen to the radio
while I cook the soup.

1116
01:34:20,744 --> 01:34:23,079
I'll fix you a nice meal, honey.

1117
01:34:23,246 --> 01:34:27,167
Just like I used to do behind the fountain,
before the war.

1118
01:34:42,599 --> 01:34:45,143
The Perfume and Cosmetics Department
is now our outstanding feature.

1119
01:34:45,310 --> 01:34:47,562
It accounts for 34 percent
of our gross intake...

1120
01:34:47,729 --> 01:34:49,731
...and a higher proportion of our profits.

1121
01:34:49,898 --> 01:34:53,735
As you will surmise, our customers in this
department are almost exclusively women.

1122
01:34:53,902 --> 01:34:55,737
Yes, I'd surmised that.

1123
01:34:55,904 --> 01:34:58,740
Familiarize yourself
with the pronunciation of the perfumes.

1124
01:34:58,907 --> 01:35:01,034
For instance, here's a popular number.

1125
01:35:01,201 --> 01:35:03,536
-Rêve Romantique.
-Yeah, that means romantic dream.

1126
01:35:03,703 --> 01:35:05,955
-You speak French?
-Well, I'll tell you, Sticky...

1127
01:35:06,122 --> 01:35:08,541
...just enough to make
my way around the Paris bars.

1128
01:35:08,708 --> 01:35:12,671
Let's get one thing straight, Derry.
The name Sticky is out.

1129
01:35:12,837 --> 01:35:15,590
-Yes, Mr. Merkel. I understand.
-This week, we're pushing...

1130
01:35:15,757 --> 01:35:17,842
...the new champagne
bubble bath preparation.

1131
01:35:18,009 --> 01:35:22,931
A dollar ninety-eight for the large jar. Down
here are some special made-- Come here.

1132
01:35:23,098 --> 01:35:25,433
Down here are some
specially made-up toilet sets.

1133
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:27,352
They don't represent a very great....

1134
01:35:27,519 --> 01:35:30,105
-Good morning, Mr. Brook.
-Good morning.

1135
01:35:30,855 --> 01:35:32,315
-Thank you.
-Good morning.

1136
01:35:32,482 --> 01:35:33,942
I have an appointment with you.

1137
01:35:34,109 --> 01:35:35,694
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

1138
01:35:35,860 --> 01:35:37,737
Good morning, Mrs. Garrett.

1139
01:35:39,114 --> 01:35:42,117
What have we here?
The Bretton Woods agreement?

1140
01:35:42,450 --> 01:35:44,452
That's a Mr. Novak waiting over there.

1141
01:35:44,619 --> 01:35:47,372
I've filled out the basic form.
He's applying for a GI loan.

1142
01:35:47,539 --> 01:35:50,375
-Oh, good. I'll see him.
-Mr. Novak.

1143
01:35:50,750 --> 01:35:53,920
-Sit down, Mr. Novak.
-Thank you, sir.

1144
01:35:54,713 --> 01:35:57,298
Don't sir me, Mr. Novak.

1145
01:35:57,966 --> 01:35:59,759
I'm a sergeant.

1146
01:36:03,805 --> 01:36:05,807
-I see you were in the Navy.
-Yes, sir.

1147
01:36:05,974 --> 01:36:09,144
I mean, yes, I was in the Seabees.

1148
01:36:09,310 --> 01:36:11,146
Where'd you operate?

1149
01:36:11,396 --> 01:36:14,149
All over the Pacific.
One little after island after another.

1150
01:36:14,315 --> 01:36:16,443
What'd you do, mostly?

1151
01:36:16,651 --> 01:36:18,194
We went in before the landings...

1152
01:36:18,361 --> 01:36:20,989
...and cleared the mines
and underwater obstructions.

1153
01:36:21,156 --> 01:36:24,284
When they'd taken enough ground
for an airstrip, we'd build it.

1154
01:36:24,451 --> 01:36:26,244
Fairly interesting work, eh?

1155
01:36:26,411 --> 01:36:30,040
No, it got monotonous.
Those islands all look alike.

1156
01:36:30,206 --> 01:36:32,751
Until Iwo Jima. That was different.

1157
01:36:32,917 --> 01:36:34,627
So I've heard.

1158
01:36:35,754 --> 01:36:38,882
I see you have quite a family.
A wife and four children.

1159
01:36:39,049 --> 01:36:43,053
Yes, there'd have been more
if I hadn't been away three years.

1160
01:36:43,595 --> 01:36:46,681
-And now you wanna buy a farm.
-Yes, sir.

1161
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:49,184
Got my eye on a fine piece of property.

1162
01:36:49,351 --> 01:36:51,811
Forty acres, out near Anton Corners.

1163
01:36:51,978 --> 01:36:53,730
What about collateral?

1164
01:36:55,648 --> 01:36:57,025
Collateral? What's that?

1165
01:36:57,192 --> 01:36:59,194
Security for your loan.

1166
01:36:59,361 --> 01:37:01,696
What can you put up
in the way of property?

1167
01:37:01,863 --> 01:37:06,451
Have you any stocks and bonds,
real estate, valuables of any kind?

1168
01:37:06,618 --> 01:37:11,081
Well, no, Mr. Stephenson, you see,
the point is, I haven't got any property.

1169
01:37:11,247 --> 01:37:14,751
That's why I want the loan,
so I can get the property.

1170
01:37:14,918 --> 01:37:16,628
I see.

1171
01:37:17,420 --> 01:37:20,298
No collateral.
That makes things difficult.

1172
01:37:20,465 --> 01:37:22,634
I'm a good farmer, Mr. Stephenson.

1173
01:37:22,801 --> 01:37:25,220
Why, even during the war
I kept my hand in.

1174
01:37:25,387 --> 01:37:28,181
I used to spend my spare time
down on those little islands...

1175
01:37:28,348 --> 01:37:31,559
...working truck gardens
so my outfit could have fresh tomatoes...

1176
01:37:31,726 --> 01:37:33,603
...and green corn and all that.

1177
01:37:33,770 --> 01:37:38,566
And before the war, I was a sharecropper,
like my father before me.

1178
01:37:38,733 --> 01:37:43,405
And now, I feel I'd like to have
a little piece of my own to work.

1179
01:37:43,571 --> 01:37:46,574
-You like to grow things, eh?
-Yes, sir.

1180
01:37:46,741 --> 01:37:48,743
With the food shortage
all over the world...

1181
01:37:48,910 --> 01:37:52,497
...it's seems to me that farming's about
the most important work there is.

1182
01:37:52,664 --> 01:37:53,915
I mean....

1183
01:37:54,082 --> 01:37:57,002
Well, don't you think so,
Mr. Stephenson?

1184
01:37:58,378 --> 01:37:59,838
Yes.

1185
01:38:01,715 --> 01:38:03,133
You see, Mr. Stephenson...

1186
01:38:03,299 --> 01:38:06,761
...I don't feel this is asking
the bank for a handout.

1187
01:38:06,928 --> 01:38:08,722
I feel it's my right.

1188
01:38:08,888 --> 01:38:12,017
At least, that's what I've been told
by other ex-servicemen...

1189
01:38:12,183 --> 01:38:15,103
...that the government guarantees
loans to us, if we wanna buy--

1190
01:38:15,270 --> 01:38:18,440
Your loan would be administered
through this bank...

1191
01:38:18,606 --> 01:38:22,527
...which would put up half of the $6000
you require.

1192
01:38:22,694 --> 01:38:26,114
Now, that involves risk for this bank,
Mr. Novak.

1193
01:38:32,162 --> 01:38:33,997
Excuse me.

1194
01:38:45,258 --> 01:38:46,676
-Al.
-Homer.

1195
01:38:46,843 --> 01:38:49,387
-Look at you.
-Look at you.

1196
01:38:49,804 --> 01:38:51,473
-So this is where you work.
-Sort of.

1197
01:38:51,639 --> 01:38:53,725
What are you doing here?
Sticking up the bank?

1198
01:38:53,892 --> 01:38:55,727
Look at it, Al, 200 leaves of cabbage.

1199
01:38:55,894 --> 01:38:58,813
That's what I get every month
from Old Mr. Whiskers from now on.

1200
01:38:58,980 --> 01:39:00,815
-Pretty soft, eh?
-Pretty soft.

1201
01:39:00,982 --> 01:39:03,401
-You sure we haven't shortchanged you?
-Oh, no.

1202
01:39:03,568 --> 01:39:06,196
I kept my eye on that guy
when he counted it out.

1203
01:39:06,363 --> 01:39:09,449
Say, Al, did you know Fred Derry
had a job at the Midway drugstore?

1204
01:39:09,616 --> 01:39:10,992
No, I didn't.

1205
01:39:11,159 --> 01:39:13,787
-He introduced me to his wife.
-Yeah?

1206
01:39:13,953 --> 01:39:15,205
-Some dish.
-Yeah.

1207
01:39:15,372 --> 01:39:17,540
We'll all have to get together at Butch's.

1208
01:39:17,707 --> 01:39:19,709
Fine. Oh, that's where I'm going now.

1209
01:39:19,876 --> 01:39:22,295
-Yeah?
-Take a piano lesson.

1210
01:39:23,838 --> 01:39:25,882
Take one for me.

1211
01:39:26,216 --> 01:39:28,677
-See you later. Bye.
-So long, Homer.

1212
01:39:36,851 --> 01:39:39,354
Well, as I was saying, Mr. Novak...

1213
01:39:39,521 --> 01:39:42,107
...there is an element of risk involved.

1214
01:39:42,273 --> 01:39:47,070
We'll have to have the property appraised,
but you'll get your loan.

1215
01:39:48,071 --> 01:39:50,156
Say, Mr. Stephenson...

1216
01:39:50,323 --> 01:39:52,909
-...I don't know how to begin to thank you.
-Don't try.

1217
01:39:53,076 --> 01:39:54,703
You look like a good risk to me.

1218
01:39:54,869 --> 01:39:58,206
And when those tomato plants
start producing, I'll come for free samples.

1219
01:39:58,373 --> 01:40:00,375
I'll let you know
when the papers are ready.

1220
01:40:00,542 --> 01:40:03,461
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1221
01:40:04,212 --> 01:40:06,047
God bless you.

1222
01:40:13,513 --> 01:40:15,390
Oh, I've seen advertisements
about this one.

1223
01:40:15,557 --> 01:40:18,309
Night of Bliss. Is it all that they say it is?

1224
01:40:18,476 --> 01:40:20,186
Well, just what do they say it is?

1225
01:40:20,353 --> 01:40:24,441
Haunting, provocative, languorous.
Oh, yes, I'm sure it's all of those.

1226
01:40:29,237 --> 01:40:30,905
Dexter.

1227
01:40:35,535 --> 01:40:37,078
Don't play with those toys, bud.

1228
01:40:37,245 --> 01:40:38,288
My name ain't Bud.

1229
01:40:38,455 --> 01:40:41,833
-Dexter, you stop that. Do you hear?
-I just wanted to see how it worked.

1230
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:45,086
-Sorry. You heard what Mommy said.
-It's all right.

1231
01:40:45,545 --> 01:40:47,505
Seduction. How much is that?

1232
01:40:47,672 --> 01:40:49,299
This is....

1233
01:40:49,466 --> 01:40:52,969
It's quite expensive.
It's 16.50, but it's a nice size.

1234
01:41:00,769 --> 01:41:02,729
You see what I mean?

1235
01:41:02,896 --> 01:41:04,773
But it's a good, safe bet.

1236
01:41:04,939 --> 01:41:06,524
Just what do you mean by that?

1237
01:41:06,691 --> 01:41:07,776
Well, I mean it's....

1238
01:41:07,942 --> 01:41:10,904
Well, it's a perfume that fits any mood.

1239
01:41:12,113 --> 01:41:13,698
All right, I'll take it.

1240
01:41:13,865 --> 01:41:15,784
Very good, madam.

1241
01:41:16,201 --> 01:41:19,120
Mommy, Mommy, look!

1242
01:41:19,287 --> 01:41:22,707
I shot it down! I shot down a plane!

1243
01:41:29,964 --> 01:41:31,591
I'm very sor--

1244
01:41:31,758 --> 01:41:34,344
-Oh, hello.
-Hello.

1245
01:41:35,804 --> 01:41:37,097
Thank you very much.

1246
01:41:37,263 --> 01:41:39,432
I'll be with you in just a moment, madam.

1247
01:41:39,974 --> 01:41:41,768
Will you take this, please?

1248
01:41:41,935 --> 01:41:44,729
This lady will have your package
and your change in a moment.

1249
01:41:44,896 --> 01:41:46,648
Thank you very much and come in again.

1250
01:41:46,815 --> 01:41:48,316
Thank you.

1251
01:41:50,443 --> 01:41:53,238
-You were wonderful.
-I wanted to smack him.

1252
01:41:53,405 --> 01:41:56,825
It's against the rules here
to chat with customers unless it's a sale.

1253
01:41:56,991 --> 01:41:58,535
All right, I'll buy something.

1254
01:41:58,702 --> 01:42:00,078
What's this?

1255
01:42:00,245 --> 01:42:02,706
Youth Recaptured,
that's a complexion cream.

1256
01:42:02,872 --> 01:42:05,291
But you don't need
any of that phony stuff.

1257
01:42:05,959 --> 01:42:09,212
Well, that's vanishing cream.
This is a vanishing cream remover.

1258
01:42:09,379 --> 01:42:11,089
I'll tell you how you can save money.

1259
01:42:11,256 --> 01:42:14,884
If you don't put that on,
then you don't need this to take that off.

1260
01:42:16,261 --> 01:42:17,595
How about some lotion?

1261
01:42:17,762 --> 01:42:23,226
Here's one at $2.98,
and you'd be over charged at half the price.

1262
01:42:24,144 --> 01:42:26,062
I didn't really come in to buy anything.

1263
01:42:26,229 --> 01:42:29,691
Dad told me you were working here
and I just dropped in to say hello.

1264
01:42:29,858 --> 01:42:31,401
Oh, just a minute.

1265
01:42:31,568 --> 01:42:33,194
I have....

1266
01:42:34,029 --> 01:42:38,116
I have an hour off at 1:00.
Are you doing anything for lunch?

1267
01:42:38,742 --> 01:42:40,243
Why, no.

1268
01:42:40,410 --> 01:42:43,204
Thank you, madam.
I'll meet you outside in 20 minutes.

1269
01:42:43,371 --> 01:42:46,583
-Come in again.
-Thank you.

1270
01:43:02,140 --> 01:43:03,808
The apple pie, she's homemade.

1271
01:43:04,601 --> 01:43:06,519
-Good.
-Thank you.

1272
01:43:08,146 --> 01:43:10,231
It is a nice little place.

1273
01:43:10,398 --> 01:43:11,983
I never heard of it before.

1274
01:43:12,150 --> 01:43:16,112
I used to come here now and then
in the old days, before the war.

1275
01:43:16,488 --> 01:43:19,324
Sometimes I used to think of this place
when I was overseas.

1276
01:43:19,491 --> 01:43:24,496
I thought, "When I get back home
I'm never gonna eat in a dump like Lucia's."

1277
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:27,999
What else did you think you wouldn't do
when you were overseas?

1278
01:43:28,166 --> 01:43:31,336
I never had any clear ideas,
but there were two things I was sure of.

1279
01:43:31,503 --> 01:43:35,173
One, that I knew
I'd never go back to that drugstore.

1280
01:43:35,340 --> 01:43:39,344
-What was the other thing?
-That was even sillier.

1281
01:43:40,011 --> 01:43:42,472
I dreamed I was gonna have
my own home.

1282
01:43:42,639 --> 01:43:46,309
Just a nice little house for my wife
and me out in the country...

1283
01:43:46,476 --> 01:43:48,687
...in the suburbs, anyway.

1284
01:43:48,853 --> 01:43:52,273
That's the cockeyed kind of dream
you have when you're overseas.

1285
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:56,069
You don't have to be overseas
to have dreams like that.

1286
01:43:56,236 --> 01:43:57,320
Yeah.

1287
01:43:57,487 --> 01:44:00,490
You can get crazy ideas
right here at home.

1288
01:44:04,619 --> 01:44:06,871
Didn't you say
you had to be back at work at 2?

1289
01:44:07,038 --> 01:44:08,415
Yeah.

1290
01:44:09,249 --> 01:44:11,209
Well, hadn't you better...?

1291
01:44:11,876 --> 01:44:13,837
Yeah. Check, please.

1292
01:44:14,004 --> 01:44:17,549
Eighty-five cents apiece for lunch,
plus tax, that's a $1.76.

1293
01:44:17,716 --> 01:44:19,259
Okay.

1294
01:44:20,093 --> 01:44:21,219
Thank you very much.

1295
01:44:21,386 --> 01:44:23,388
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

1296
01:44:24,097 --> 01:44:25,724
Goodbye, signorina. Come again.

1297
01:44:25,890 --> 01:44:27,726
We'll do that. So long, Giuseppe.

1298
01:44:27,892 --> 01:44:29,561
Arrivederci, sir.

1299
01:44:38,945 --> 01:44:40,447
Well....

1300
01:44:56,963 --> 01:44:58,798
That shouldn't have happened.

1301
01:44:59,924 --> 01:45:01,926
But I guess it had to.

1302
01:45:09,851 --> 01:45:13,063
-Goodbye, Peggy.
-Goodbye.

1303
01:45:27,118 --> 01:45:29,704
We were discussing
this loan to this man....

1304
01:45:29,871 --> 01:45:31,164
What's his name?

1305
01:45:31,331 --> 01:45:32,957
Novak.

1306
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:35,877
Yes, yes, I approved it.

1307
01:45:36,044 --> 01:45:38,838
Well, may I ask, Al, on what basis?

1308
01:45:39,005 --> 01:45:40,924
On the basis of my own judgment.

1309
01:45:41,091 --> 01:45:45,136
-Novak looked to me like a good bet.
-But the man has no collateral, no security.

1310
01:45:45,303 --> 01:45:49,099
-Evidently, you saw something in this man.
-Yes, Mr. Milton.

1311
01:45:49,265 --> 01:45:51,559
-What was it?
-Security.

1312
01:45:51,726 --> 01:45:53,228
Collateral.

1313
01:45:54,312 --> 01:45:56,564
Mr. Milton, in the Army
I've had to be with men...

1314
01:45:56,731 --> 01:45:58,692
...when they were stripped
of everything...

1315
01:45:58,858 --> 01:46:02,737
...in the way of property except what they
carried around with them and inside them.

1316
01:46:02,904 --> 01:46:06,116
I saw them being tested. Some of them
stood up to it and some didn't.

1317
01:46:06,282 --> 01:46:09,035
But you got so you could tell
which ones you could count on.

1318
01:46:09,202 --> 01:46:11,996
I tell you, this man Novak is okay.

1319
01:46:12,163 --> 01:46:16,835
His collateral is in his hands,
in his heart, in his guts.

1320
01:46:17,002 --> 01:46:19,838
-In his right as a citizen.
-Nobody's denying him his rights.

1321
01:46:20,005 --> 01:46:22,882
Yes, we are. If we deny him
his chance to work in his own way.

1322
01:46:23,049 --> 01:46:25,260
Gentlemen,
there's no need to raise our voices.

1323
01:46:25,427 --> 01:46:29,931
Of course, since you've approved the loan,
the incident is closed.

1324
01:46:30,348 --> 01:46:34,728
-However, in the future, Al--
-Yes, I understand, Mr. Milton.

1325
01:46:34,894 --> 01:46:38,023
In the future,
I must exercise more caution.

1326
01:46:38,398 --> 01:46:40,483
Thank you, Mr. Prew.

1327
01:46:42,485 --> 01:46:44,029
Al.

1328
01:46:47,115 --> 01:46:50,535
Al, you know how I feel about you
and always have.

1329
01:46:50,702 --> 01:46:55,373
Why, I've always considered you
one of the family, so to speak.

1330
01:46:55,540 --> 01:46:59,085
Like my own s-- Younger brother.

1331
01:46:59,377 --> 01:47:03,214
I picked you personally for this job,
and I know you'll make good.

1332
01:47:03,381 --> 01:47:06,301
And we do. We have every desire...

1333
01:47:06,468 --> 01:47:10,055
...to extend a helping hand
to returning veterans...

1334
01:47:10,221 --> 01:47:11,556
...whenever possible.

1335
01:47:11,723 --> 01:47:16,061
But we must all remember
that this is not our money we're doling out.

1336
01:47:16,227 --> 01:47:18,688
It belongs to our depositors...

1337
01:47:18,855 --> 01:47:20,774
...and we can't gamble with it.

1338
01:47:20,940 --> 01:47:23,276
I'll remember, Mr. Milton.

1339
01:47:23,443 --> 01:47:25,695
We'll meet at the Union Club at 7:30.

1340
01:47:25,862 --> 01:47:30,575
-And give my best to your charming wife.
-Thank you, Mr. Milton.

1341
01:47:56,476 --> 01:47:57,602
Hello.

1342
01:47:57,769 --> 01:47:59,354
Oh, hello.

1343
01:47:59,521 --> 01:48:02,190
Say, better hurry and get dressed.
And wear your new suit.

1344
01:48:02,357 --> 01:48:04,651
We're going out to dinner
at the Embassy Club.

1345
01:48:04,818 --> 01:48:07,612
Oh, don't worry, it won't cost a nickel.
We got invited.

1346
01:48:07,779 --> 01:48:10,490
-Who invited us?
-Ms. Peggy Stephenson.

1347
01:48:10,657 --> 01:48:14,119
She called up a little while ago and
said her father was a friend of yours.

1348
01:48:14,285 --> 01:48:17,580
She sounded like a nice kid. She's going
with some boyfriend of hers...

1349
01:48:17,747 --> 01:48:20,125
...and asked us to come on a double date,
as guests.

1350
01:48:20,291 --> 01:48:23,253
-You told her we could go?
-You bet I did.

1351
01:48:23,420 --> 01:48:25,422
Well, call her up and tell her we can't go.

1352
01:48:25,588 --> 01:48:28,800
Tell her I made another engagement.
Tell her anything.

1353
01:48:31,928 --> 01:48:34,222
Say, who is this Peggy Stephenson?

1354
01:48:34,389 --> 01:48:37,058
-She's a girl.
-I didn't think she was a kangaroo.

1355
01:48:37,225 --> 01:48:38,309
Where did you meet her?

1356
01:48:38,476 --> 01:48:40,895
I told you the night I got back
and you weren't here.

1357
01:48:41,062 --> 01:48:42,897
Al Stephenson
and his wife took me home.

1358
01:48:43,064 --> 01:48:45,275
She's their daughter.
I'd never seen her before.

1359
01:48:45,442 --> 01:48:46,985
Or since?

1360
01:48:47,277 --> 01:48:50,488
If you think you're gonna make anything
out of this, you're due for a disappointment.

1361
01:48:50,655 --> 01:48:53,116
I just don't like accepting handouts
when we're broke.

1362
01:48:53,283 --> 01:48:54,951
Well, you'd better get used to it.

1363
01:48:55,118 --> 01:48:59,330
Because I don't see how we're gonna get
much fun on your 32.50 a week.

1364
01:49:15,180 --> 01:49:17,140
Hold still.

1365
01:49:18,516 --> 01:49:21,019
You'll probably have to make a speech.

1366
01:49:21,186 --> 01:49:25,065
It's my plan to meet that situation
by getting well plastered.

1367
01:49:27,025 --> 01:49:29,110
Peggy's going out dancing
with Woody Merrill.

1368
01:49:29,277 --> 01:49:31,738
-Who's he?
-You know, Bill Merrill's son.

1369
01:49:31,905 --> 01:49:35,784
Oh, yeah. Fine people, the Merrills.
Strictly TCR.

1370
01:49:35,950 --> 01:49:38,870
-What's that?
-Top credit rating.

1371
01:49:39,037 --> 01:49:41,956
-Are his intentions honorable?
-I doubt it.

1372
01:49:42,123 --> 01:49:45,377
But they're going to be properly
chaperoned by Fred Derry and his wife.

1373
01:49:45,543 --> 01:49:48,963
Fred Derry? Some chaperone.

1374
01:49:49,214 --> 01:49:51,883
-I think she's crazy about him.
-Who, Merrill?

1375
01:49:52,050 --> 01:49:54,052
No, Fred.

1376
01:49:54,552 --> 01:49:57,681
Have you got any evidence
to support that amazing statement?

1377
01:49:57,847 --> 01:49:59,557
Just a hunch.

1378
01:50:02,686 --> 01:50:05,772
But my hunches are pretty good.

1379
01:50:16,574 --> 01:50:17,951
-Cocktails.
-Oh, no, you don't.

1380
01:50:18,118 --> 01:50:20,787
I made this for Woody Merrill,
he's coming to pick me up.

1381
01:50:20,954 --> 01:50:24,708
Surely you wouldn't deny your poor old
father a drop on a cold night like this.

1382
01:50:24,874 --> 01:50:26,126
I would if I could.

1383
01:50:26,292 --> 01:50:30,296
-I hear you're gonna see Fred.
-Yes.

1384
01:50:30,463 --> 01:50:32,382
What's his wife like?

1385
01:50:32,549 --> 01:50:34,926
I don't know. I'll tell you later.

1386
01:50:35,093 --> 01:50:37,762
They'll have cocktails at the Union Club.

1387
01:50:37,929 --> 01:50:41,808
I know the kind Mrs. Milton serves.
Pink, sweet and nauseating.

1388
01:50:41,975 --> 01:50:44,936
I was just asking Peggy
about Fred's wife.

1389
01:50:45,395 --> 01:50:48,606
Never mind, Mom.
I know what you're both thinking.

1390
01:50:49,607 --> 01:50:50,942
What are we thinking?

1391
01:50:52,318 --> 01:50:54,279
You're afraid I may be in love with Fred.

1392
01:50:55,321 --> 01:50:58,950
-Why, I never had any such id--
-Shut up, Al.

1393
01:50:59,117 --> 01:51:00,493
Are you in love with him?

1394
01:51:02,996 --> 01:51:04,414
Yes.

1395
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:07,208
But I don't want to be.

1396
01:51:07,375 --> 01:51:11,171
That's why I asked him
and his wife to go out with us this evening.

1397
01:51:11,963 --> 01:51:15,633
I think it ought to have
a very healthy effect on me.

1398
01:51:16,259 --> 01:51:18,928
Once I get to know her, I....

1399
01:51:19,471 --> 01:51:23,433
Well, I'm sure I'll stop being silly
about the whole thing.

1400
01:51:27,937 --> 01:51:31,524
We don't need to worry about that child.
She can take care of herself.

1401
01:51:31,691 --> 01:51:33,860
That's what she thinks.

1402
01:51:35,487 --> 01:51:37,030
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

1403
01:51:37,197 --> 01:51:38,990
-You know my father.
-Mr. Stephenson.

1404
01:51:39,157 --> 01:51:40,658
Nice to see you again.

1405
01:51:40,825 --> 01:51:42,118
-Have a drink?
-Thank you.

1406
01:51:42,285 --> 01:51:44,621
I've played a lot of golf with your father.

1407
01:51:44,788 --> 01:51:46,790
I know.
Been to the club since you got back?

1408
01:51:46,956 --> 01:51:49,084
-Haven't had a chance.
-Come on, we'll be late.

1409
01:51:49,250 --> 01:51:50,293
-Right.
-Good night.

1410
01:51:50,460 --> 01:51:53,004
-Night.
-Well, have a good time, children.

1411
01:51:53,171 --> 01:51:54,339
Thank you.

1412
01:51:54,506 --> 01:51:56,591
Give my best to Fred.

1413
01:51:59,219 --> 01:52:01,429
Al, come on.

1414
01:52:02,430 --> 01:52:05,016
Yes, Mr. Milton.

1415
01:52:12,524 --> 01:52:15,985
-Hello, Peggy.
-Oh, Woody, don't be a bore.

1416
01:52:17,153 --> 01:52:19,030
Come on, we'll be late.

1417
01:52:19,322 --> 01:52:22,409
Our country must stand today
where it has always stood...

1418
01:52:22,575 --> 01:52:25,995
...the citadel of individual initiative...

1419
01:52:26,162 --> 01:52:30,417
...the land of unlimited opportunity
for all.

1420
01:52:35,005 --> 01:52:38,675
It is peculiarly appropriate
that we meet here tonight...

1421
01:52:38,842 --> 01:52:41,761
...to honor one
who has valiantly fought for that freedom.

1422
01:52:42,721 --> 01:52:45,056
Ladies and gentlemen,
we greet our friend...

1423
01:52:45,223 --> 01:52:50,020
...our coworker, our hero,
Al Stephenson.

1424
01:52:50,186 --> 01:52:52,355
Come on, on your feet, Al. On your feet.

1425
01:53:00,030 --> 01:53:03,908
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm very happy to be here.

1426
01:53:04,075 --> 01:53:06,536
In fact, I'm very happy to be anywhere.

1427
01:53:06,703 --> 01:53:09,205
In fact, I'm very happy.

1428
01:53:11,291 --> 01:53:15,503
Perhaps it'd be a good idea, if you just put
that bottle right down here in front of me.

1429
01:53:15,670 --> 01:53:20,050
-Here, save yourself quite a number of trips.
-Good old Al.

1430
01:53:25,180 --> 01:53:29,142
And I'm glad to see
you've all pulled through so well.

1431
01:53:29,309 --> 01:53:35,815
As Mr. Milton so perfectly expressed it,
our country stands today...

1432
01:53:35,982 --> 01:53:39,069
...where it stands today.
Wherever that is.

1433
01:53:39,235 --> 01:53:41,071
And I'm sure you'd all agree with me...

1434
01:53:41,237 --> 01:53:44,741
...if I said that now's the time for all of us
to stop all this nonsense...

1435
01:53:44,908 --> 01:53:50,080
...face facts, get down to brass tacks,
forget about the war, and go fishing.

1436
01:53:50,246 --> 01:53:52,499
But I'm not gonna say it.

1437
01:53:52,665 --> 01:53:57,045
I'm just going to sum the whole thing up
in one word.

1438
01:53:59,881 --> 01:54:04,427
My wife doesn't think
I'd better sum it up in that one word.

1439
01:54:05,428 --> 01:54:08,348
I wanna tell you that the reason
for my success as a sergeant...

1440
01:54:08,515 --> 01:54:13,311
...is due primarily to my previous training
in the Corn Belt Loan and Trust Company.

1441
01:54:14,312 --> 01:54:16,773
The knowledge I acquired
in the good old bank...

1442
01:54:16,940 --> 01:54:20,110
...I applied to my problems
in the infantry.

1443
01:54:20,610 --> 01:54:22,946
For instance, in Okinawa,
a major comes to me...

1444
01:54:23,113 --> 01:54:26,157
...he says, "Stephenson, you see that hill?"
"Yes, sir. I see it."

1445
01:54:26,324 --> 01:54:27,450
"All right," he said.

1446
01:54:27,617 --> 01:54:30,995
"You and your platoon
will attack said hill and take it."

1447
01:54:31,705 --> 01:54:36,251
So I said to the major, "But that
operation involves considerable risk.

1448
01:54:36,418 --> 01:54:38,795
We haven't sufficient collateral."

1449
01:54:38,962 --> 01:54:42,924
"I'm aware of that," said the major, "but
the fact remains, that there is the hill...

1450
01:54:43,091 --> 01:54:45,343
...and you are the guys
who are going to take it."

1451
01:54:45,510 --> 01:54:50,640
So I said to him, "I'm sorry, major.
No collateral, no hill."

1452
01:54:51,182 --> 01:54:56,479
So we didn't take the hill,
and we lost the war.

1453
01:54:59,399 --> 01:55:03,820
I think that little story
has considerable significance.

1454
01:55:03,987 --> 01:55:07,282
But I've forgotten what it is.

1455
01:55:10,994 --> 01:55:14,831
And now, in conclusion, I'd like to tell you
a humorous anecdote.

1456
01:55:14,998 --> 01:55:17,500
I know several humorous anecdotes...

1457
01:55:17,667 --> 01:55:20,545
...but I can't think of any way
to clean them up.

1458
01:55:21,379 --> 01:55:23,840
So I'll only say this much.

1459
01:55:24,007 --> 01:55:27,802
I love the Corn Belt Loan
and Trust Company.

1460
01:55:27,969 --> 01:55:32,682
There are some who say that the old bank
is suffering from hardening of the arteries...

1461
01:55:32,849 --> 01:55:34,184
...and of the heart.

1462
01:55:34,351 --> 01:55:37,854
I refuse to listen to such radical talk.

1463
01:55:38,021 --> 01:55:41,691
I say that our bank is alive,
it's generous, it's....

1464
01:55:41,858 --> 01:55:42,901
It's human!

1465
01:55:43,068 --> 01:55:46,154
And we're going to have
such a line of customers...

1466
01:55:46,321 --> 01:55:49,324
...seeking and getting small loans...

1467
01:55:49,491 --> 01:55:52,869
...that people will think we're gambling
with the depositors' money.

1468
01:55:53,036 --> 01:55:55,205
And we will be.

1469
01:55:55,914 --> 01:55:59,459
We'll be gambling on the future
of this country.

1470
01:56:01,419 --> 01:56:02,962
I thank you.

1471
01:56:24,401 --> 01:56:26,903
Oh, Woody, I can't take it anymore.
Let's sit down.

1472
01:56:27,070 --> 01:56:29,239
We can't get out. I'm trapped.

1473
01:56:29,406 --> 01:56:31,116
How do you do?

1474
01:56:31,991 --> 01:56:33,952
Beg your pardon.

1475
01:56:34,119 --> 01:56:36,746
Well, anyway, we can't fall down.

1476
01:56:39,582 --> 01:56:43,461
-Is that table satisfactory?
-Everything. Everything's lovely.

1477
01:56:46,089 --> 01:56:49,968
Thank you very much.
Would you care to order now?

1478
01:56:50,760 --> 01:56:52,429
Sorry.

1479
01:57:02,522 --> 01:57:05,066
-Oh, I can't understand it.
-What?

1480
01:57:05,233 --> 01:57:08,987
Why you're not mad about me.
I think I'm attractive.

1481
01:57:09,529 --> 01:57:13,908
-You are, Woody. You're irresistible.
-Then why do you go on resisting me?

1482
01:57:14,075 --> 01:57:16,870
You know, all marriages
don't have to be like that one.

1483
01:57:17,037 --> 01:57:20,665
-Which one?
-Your friends, Fred and Marie.

1484
01:57:20,832 --> 01:57:22,625
What's wrong with their marriage?

1485
01:57:22,792 --> 01:57:25,545
Oh, there's nothing wrong,
except for one slight detail.

1486
01:57:25,712 --> 01:57:27,172
They just don't like each other.

1487
01:57:32,635 --> 01:57:34,971
Oh, it's murder on the dance floor.
Oh, it's awful.

1488
01:57:35,138 --> 01:57:36,973
You mean
you don't wanna dance anymore?

1489
01:57:37,140 --> 01:57:39,893
I'd love to! You don't you mind
if I borrow him for a while?

1490
01:57:40,060 --> 01:57:41,644
No, not at all.

1491
01:57:47,817 --> 01:57:49,903
Why did you do this, Peggy?

1492
01:57:50,070 --> 01:57:54,282
-Do what? What do you mean?
-Calling up Marie and going out like this.

1493
01:57:54,449 --> 01:57:55,867
Together.

1494
01:57:56,034 --> 01:57:59,829
-I did it deliberately.
-Why?

1495
01:58:00,830 --> 01:58:06,419
To prove to myself that what happened
this afternoon didn't really happen.

1496
01:58:11,508 --> 01:58:13,343
But it did happen.

1497
01:58:13,510 --> 01:58:15,470
It had to happen.

1498
01:58:15,929 --> 01:58:19,683
And if we go on seeing each other, Peggy,
it'll happen again.

1499
01:58:35,699 --> 01:58:37,534
Excuse us.

1500
01:58:40,620 --> 01:58:43,957
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1501
01:58:47,002 --> 01:58:49,879
Oh, we wanna have
a picture taken over there in a few minutes.

1502
01:58:50,046 --> 01:58:51,589
Fine, I'll be there.

1503
01:58:51,756 --> 01:58:53,550
Excuse me.

1504
01:58:56,886 --> 01:58:58,430
Hello, Marie.

1505
01:58:58,596 --> 01:59:00,473
Good evening.

1506
01:59:03,101 --> 01:59:05,478
You gotta watch yourself in this town.
More wolves.

1507
01:59:05,645 --> 01:59:07,564
-I know.
-I pay no attention to the sign.

1508
01:59:08,940 --> 01:59:09,983
Go right in.

1509
01:59:14,863 --> 01:59:18,241
Gee, Woody's a cute boy. He's a lot of fun.
He's got a lot of dough too.

1510
01:59:18,408 --> 01:59:20,410
His family owns half the city, practically.

1511
01:59:20,577 --> 01:59:22,579
Certainly has a terrific yen
for you, Peggy.

1512
01:59:22,746 --> 01:59:24,956
I don't wanna butt
into your personal affairs...

1513
01:59:25,123 --> 01:59:28,293
...but if you'll take my advice, dear,
you'll grab Woody, but quick.

1514
01:59:28,460 --> 01:59:31,379
Woody and I are good friends,
but there's no romance there.

1515
01:59:31,546 --> 01:59:34,299
Never mind the romantic part.
That takes care of itself.

1516
01:59:34,466 --> 01:59:36,885
And I'm speaking from experience.

1517
01:59:37,052 --> 01:59:42,140
They'll tell you money isn't everything.
Well, maybe it isn't, but, boy, how it helps.

1518
01:59:42,307 --> 01:59:45,810
Do you know that while Fred was away,
I was drawing over $500 a month?

1519
01:59:45,977 --> 01:59:48,438
I mean, from his Army pay
and the job I had.

1520
01:59:48,605 --> 01:59:50,857
Now the two of us gotta live on
what Fred gets...

1521
01:59:51,024 --> 01:59:55,028
...from being a drugstore cowboy.
Thirty-two fifty a week.

1522
01:59:55,987 --> 01:59:59,657
Poor Fred. I guess you think
he's an awful sourpuss.

1523
01:59:59,824 --> 02:00:01,618
He didn't used to be that way, though.

1524
02:00:01,785 --> 02:00:06,122
Army's had an awful effect on him.
Knocked all the life out of him.

1525
02:00:06,623 --> 02:00:10,126
Fred isn't going to be satisfied
with that job at the drugstore.

1526
02:00:10,293 --> 02:00:12,462
-He'll get something better.
-Oh, sure.

1527
02:00:12,629 --> 02:00:15,965
Maybe in five years he'll be drawing down
40 or 50 bucks.

1528
02:00:16,132 --> 02:00:19,719
You can't have happy marriages
on that kind of dough.

1529
02:00:23,306 --> 02:00:24,683
You know, Peggy, you're cute.

1530
02:00:24,849 --> 02:00:28,144
But if you don't mind a personal
suggestion, you could use more makeup.

1531
02:00:28,311 --> 02:00:30,647
And I think you could get yourself
a better hairdo.

1532
02:00:30,814 --> 02:00:34,859
I'll give you the name of my hairdresser.
Oh, but you've got nothing to worry about.

1533
02:00:35,026 --> 02:00:40,156
You'll get Woody
and live happily ever after. It's in the bag.

1534
02:00:43,743 --> 02:00:45,453
Thank you.

1535
02:00:51,001 --> 02:00:53,920
Now, everybody get in close together,
we're all palsy-walsy...

1536
02:00:54,087 --> 02:00:58,425
...put our arms around each other.
Come on, Fred. I don't mind.

1537
02:01:00,468 --> 02:01:03,888
Wait a minute, I'll tell you when.
Everybody, happy. Let's all be talking.

1538
02:01:04,055 --> 02:01:07,017
What a marvelous party.
We'll have to do this again, right away.

1539
02:01:07,183 --> 02:01:09,936
Okay, shoot the picture!

1540
02:01:10,937 --> 02:01:13,314
We want four copies, honey.

1541
02:01:16,026 --> 02:01:19,237
Mr. Milton certainly acted enthusiastic
about your speech.

1542
02:01:19,404 --> 02:01:22,407
Yeah, sure, that's how he acted,
the old hypocrite.

1543
02:01:22,574 --> 02:01:24,659
Suppose he'll fire you in the morning?

1544
02:01:24,826 --> 02:01:27,412
No, he'll never do anything as impetuous
as that.

1545
02:01:27,579 --> 02:01:29,539
He'll back me up wholeheartedly...

1546
02:01:29,706 --> 02:01:32,250
...till the next time I give a loan
to some little guy.

1547
02:01:32,417 --> 02:01:34,544
Then I'll have to fight it out
all over again.

1548
02:01:34,878 --> 02:01:37,422
-Yes?
-It's me, Peggy.

1549
02:01:37,589 --> 02:01:40,133
Oh, come in, darling.

1550
02:01:48,558 --> 02:01:51,644
-Did you have a good time?
-Not very.

1551
02:01:51,811 --> 02:01:54,481
What's all this? Children's hour?

1552
02:01:54,856 --> 02:01:56,900
I beg your pardon.

1553
02:01:57,984 --> 02:02:00,904
Well, what's she like?

1554
02:02:03,031 --> 02:02:05,575
I'm glad I went out with them.

1555
02:02:06,201 --> 02:02:09,079
Even though
it was a pretty disagreeable experience.

1556
02:02:09,245 --> 02:02:12,332
It took guts, honey,
which you got plenty.

1557
02:02:12,916 --> 02:02:14,584
I'll need them.

1558
02:02:14,751 --> 02:02:17,462
-I've made up my mind.
-Good girl.

1559
02:02:17,629 --> 02:02:19,422
To do what?

1560
02:02:22,592 --> 02:02:25,011
I'm going to break that marriage up.

1561
02:02:26,262 --> 02:02:29,432
I can't stand it seeing Fred tied to a woman
he doesn't love.

1562
02:02:30,016 --> 02:02:32,060
And who doesn't love him.

1563
02:02:32,227 --> 02:02:37,232
Oh, it's horrible for him.
It's humiliating and it's killing his spirit.

1564
02:02:37,399 --> 02:02:39,317
Somebody's got to help him.

1565
02:02:39,484 --> 02:02:43,530
-Are you sure he doesn't love her?
-Of course I am.

1566
02:02:43,697 --> 02:02:45,740
Did he tell you?

1567
02:02:47,367 --> 02:02:49,828
-Did she?
-No.

1568
02:02:49,994 --> 02:02:51,955
So you just jumped to conclusions.

1569
02:02:52,622 --> 02:02:56,793
He doesn't love her, he hates her.
I know it, I know it.

1570
02:02:56,960 --> 02:02:59,170
Who are you? God?

1571
02:02:59,337 --> 02:03:02,340
How did you get this power to interfere
in other people's lives?

1572
02:03:02,507 --> 02:03:04,884
Is Fred in love with you?

1573
02:03:06,052 --> 02:03:07,595
Yes.

1574
02:03:07,762 --> 02:03:12,600
-You've been seeing him?
-Only once. Today.

1575
02:03:12,767 --> 02:03:15,311
Oh, it was all perfectly respectable.

1576
02:03:15,478 --> 02:03:18,815
But when we were saying goodbye...

1577
02:03:18,982 --> 02:03:22,819
...he took me in his arms
and kissed me...

1578
02:03:22,986 --> 02:03:24,779
...and I knew.

1579
02:03:24,946 --> 02:03:27,866
And you think a kiss
from a smooth operator like Fred...

1580
02:03:28,033 --> 02:03:30,410
...you think that means anything?

1581
02:03:30,577 --> 02:03:32,328
You don't know him.

1582
02:03:32,495 --> 02:03:35,582
You don't know anything about
what's inside him.

1583
02:03:35,749 --> 02:03:38,668
Neither does she. His wife.

1584
02:03:38,835 --> 02:03:41,504
That's probably what she thought
when she married him.

1585
02:03:41,671 --> 02:03:44,799
A smooth operator
with money in his pockets.

1586
02:03:44,966 --> 02:03:48,345
But now he isn't smooth any longer,
and she's lost interest in him.

1587
02:03:48,511 --> 02:03:51,848
Whereas you're possessed
of all the wisdom of the ages.

1588
02:03:52,015 --> 02:03:55,393
You can see into the secret recesses
of his innermost soul.

1589
02:03:55,560 --> 02:03:58,521
I can see because I love him.

1590
02:03:59,272 --> 02:04:01,107
So you're gonna break this marriage up.

1591
02:04:01,274 --> 02:04:04,903
Have you decided yet how you're gonna
do it? You gonna do it with an ax?

1592
02:04:05,070 --> 02:04:07,989
It's none of your business
how I'm going to do it.

1593
02:04:08,156 --> 02:04:11,659
You've forgotten what it's like
to be in love!

1594
02:04:12,660 --> 02:04:14,329
You hear that, Milly?

1595
02:04:14,496 --> 02:04:19,876
I'm so old and decrepit, I've forgotten
how it feels to want somebody desperately.

1596
02:04:20,585 --> 02:04:23,713
Peggy didn't mean that.
Did you, darling?

1597
02:04:26,216 --> 02:04:27,258
No.

1598
02:04:29,052 --> 02:04:31,638
I don't know what I do mean.

1599
02:04:31,805 --> 02:04:36,476
It's just that everything
has always been so perfect for you.

1600
02:04:36,643 --> 02:04:39,396
You loved each other
and you got married in a big church...

1601
02:04:39,562 --> 02:04:42,857
...and you had a honeymoon
in the south of France.

1602
02:04:43,024 --> 02:04:45,902
And you never had any trouble
of any kind.

1603
02:04:46,069 --> 02:04:49,823
So how can you possibly understand
how it is with Fred and me?

1604
02:04:52,992 --> 02:04:55,412
We never had any trouble.

1605
02:04:57,163 --> 02:05:01,835
How many times have I told you
I hated you and believed it in my heart?

1606
02:05:02,460 --> 02:05:05,672
How many times have you said
you were sick and tired of me...

1607
02:05:05,839 --> 02:05:07,340
...that we were all washed up?

1608
02:05:09,134 --> 02:05:13,513
How many times
have we had to fall in love all over again?

1609
02:05:33,116 --> 02:05:37,954
-I'm sorry, Mom.
-Oh, never mind about that, darling.

1610
02:06:06,232 --> 02:06:08,151
-Fred.
-Hi, Butch.

1611
02:06:08,318 --> 02:06:09,778
-Hello, Fred.
-Al here?

1612
02:06:09,944 --> 02:06:13,365
-Yeah, he's back there waiting for you.
-See you later.

1613
02:06:17,243 --> 02:06:20,205
-Hi, Al.
-Sit down, Fred.

1614
02:06:20,372 --> 02:06:22,290
-What are you drinking?
-A cup of coffee.

1615
02:06:22,457 --> 02:06:24,334
Gotta have a clear head for soda jerking.

1616
02:06:24,501 --> 02:06:27,170
-A cup of coffee and a bourbon and soda.
-Yes, sir.

1617
02:06:27,587 --> 02:06:30,924
Well, what's on your mind, Al?
Wanna borrow some money or something?

1618
02:06:32,759 --> 02:06:33,843
I...

1619
02:06:34,010 --> 02:06:36,429
...called you to ask you a question.

1620
02:06:37,138 --> 02:06:39,933
Okay. Shoot.

1621
02:06:40,684 --> 02:06:42,352
Are you in love with Peggy?

1622
02:06:47,273 --> 02:06:49,526
Is there any law compelling me
to answer that one?

1623
02:06:49,693 --> 02:06:50,944
No.

1624
02:06:51,111 --> 02:06:55,281
Nevertheless, I repeat.
Are you in love with Peggy?

1625
02:06:59,369 --> 02:07:00,537
Yes.

1626
02:07:02,414 --> 02:07:06,960
-I thank you for a short and honest answer.
-You're welcome.

1627
02:07:07,127 --> 02:07:10,630
-Now, what do we take up next?
-Your wife.

1628
02:07:10,797 --> 02:07:12,757
What about her?

1629
02:07:12,924 --> 02:07:16,052
Where does she fit
in this romantic situation?

1630
02:07:16,219 --> 02:07:18,722
Is that any of your business?

1631
02:07:19,472 --> 02:07:22,475
That's what Peggy said,
that it's none of my business.

1632
02:07:22,642 --> 02:07:24,602
Oh, you've had her on the carpet too.

1633
02:07:24,769 --> 02:07:28,565
She volunteered some information
to her mother and me.

1634
02:07:28,732 --> 02:07:32,944
You see, we have
a rather unusual relationship in our family.

1635
02:07:33,111 --> 02:07:38,033
It may seem kind of corny and
mid-Victorian, but we tell each other things.

1636
02:07:38,575 --> 02:07:40,785
I happen to be quite fond of Peggy,
and I....

1637
02:07:40,952 --> 02:07:43,496
You don't want her to get mixed up
with a heel like me.

1638
02:07:43,663 --> 02:07:46,583
I haven't called you a heel. Yet.

1639
02:07:46,750 --> 02:07:49,669
I just don't wanna see her
get into this mess.

1640
02:08:00,263 --> 02:08:02,932
Okay, chum, what do we do now?

1641
02:08:03,099 --> 02:08:05,643
Step out and settle this thing
in the alley?

1642
02:08:05,810 --> 02:08:08,521
I wouldn't wanna recommend that
as a solution.

1643
02:08:08,688 --> 02:08:11,107
I've learned a lot of tricks
in fighting dirty.

1644
02:08:11,274 --> 02:08:14,652
If I got tangled up with you,
I might forget myself and break your neck.

1645
02:08:14,819 --> 02:08:16,780
I wouldn't like that.

1646
02:08:16,946 --> 02:08:20,116
You see, Fred, I'm quite fond of you too.

1647
02:08:20,617 --> 02:08:21,659
Thanks.

1648
02:08:21,826 --> 02:08:25,622
But I don't like the idea of you
sneaking around corners to see Peggy...

1649
02:08:25,789 --> 02:08:28,875
...taking her love on a bootleg basis.

1650
02:08:29,334 --> 02:08:31,252
I'm gonna do everything I can...

1651
02:08:31,419 --> 02:08:34,631
...to keep her away from you,
to help her forget about you...

1652
02:08:34,798 --> 02:08:37,801
...and get her married to some decent guy
who can make her happy.

1653
02:08:52,774 --> 02:08:54,943
Then I guess that's it, Al.

1654
02:08:55,110 --> 02:08:57,362
I don't see her anymore.

1655
02:08:57,529 --> 02:09:00,490
I'll put that in the form of a guarantee.

1656
02:09:00,657 --> 02:09:02,951
I won't see her anymore.

1657
02:09:03,493 --> 02:09:05,662
I'll call her up and tell her so.

1658
02:09:05,829 --> 02:09:08,790
-That satisfy you?
-Yeah.

1659
02:09:09,708 --> 02:09:12,377
-Anything else on your mind?
-No.

1660
02:09:13,878 --> 02:09:16,756
Okay, chum, so long.

1661
02:09:16,923 --> 02:09:18,925
So long, Fred.

1662
02:09:21,011 --> 02:09:22,721
The drinks are on me.

1663
02:09:46,369 --> 02:09:48,204
-Hello, Homer.
-Hi, Steve.

1664
02:09:48,371 --> 02:09:50,415
Say, Al Stephenson's back there.

1665
02:09:50,582 --> 02:09:52,459
-Al?
-Yeah.

1666
02:09:53,668 --> 02:09:55,086
-Hi, Al.
-Hello, Homer.

1667
02:09:55,253 --> 02:09:57,380
-How are you? How's the family?
-Fine, thanks.

1668
02:09:57,547 --> 02:09:59,549
-Hello, Homer.
-Hi, Butch.

1669
02:09:59,716 --> 02:10:02,093
-Say, let's show Al that new routine.
-Why, sure.

1670
02:10:02,260 --> 02:10:05,513
Got something to show you, Al.
Well, come on.

1671
02:10:08,516 --> 02:10:11,061
-Boy, wait till you hear this.
-Are you all set, kid?

1672
02:10:11,227 --> 02:10:13,063
-I'm ready when you are.
-Okay.

1673
02:10:13,229 --> 02:10:15,398
One, two, three.

1674
02:11:02,904 --> 02:11:04,614
That's fine.

1675
02:11:05,240 --> 02:11:08,368
What's the matter? Didn't you like it?
We've been working for weeks.

1676
02:11:08,535 --> 02:11:12,330
Sure, Homer, it was swell. I thought you
were kidding about those piano lessons.

1677
02:11:12,497 --> 02:11:15,333
Fred! Hey, Fred!

1678
02:11:16,793 --> 02:11:18,628
That was Fred.

1679
02:11:19,129 --> 02:11:20,463
Yeah.

1680
02:11:20,630 --> 02:11:24,134
-What's the matter? Is anything wrong?
-He had to go back to the drugstore.

1681
02:11:24,300 --> 02:11:26,594
Come on, Homer, buy me a drink.

1682
02:11:42,569 --> 02:11:44,195
Who was it?

1683
02:11:45,321 --> 02:11:46,823
Fred.

1684
02:11:52,412 --> 02:11:58,084
He said he's sorry for what happened,
but it was just one of those things.

1685
02:12:00,253 --> 02:12:04,841
He said it wouldn't be fair to his wife
for us to see each other anymore because...

1686
02:12:05,216 --> 02:12:10,180
...I'm obviously the kind of girl
that takes these things too seriously.

1687
02:12:11,181 --> 02:12:15,018
Then he said goodbye, very politely,
and hung up.

1688
02:12:19,189 --> 02:12:24,152
Well, I guess you and Dad
won't have to worry about me anymore.

1689
02:12:24,903 --> 02:12:28,406
That's the end of my career
as a home wrecker.

1690
02:12:38,875 --> 02:12:42,087
Mom, I know you feel sorry for me.

1691
02:12:42,253 --> 02:12:45,006
You think my poor little heart is broken.

1692
02:12:45,173 --> 02:12:50,387
But you can save your sympathy.
I can see things clearer now.

1693
02:12:51,054 --> 02:12:53,348
I made a fool of myself.

1694
02:12:53,515 --> 02:12:57,060
I'm getting some sense
hammered into me now.

1695
02:12:57,519 --> 02:13:00,355
I'm glad I'm out of that mess.

1696
02:13:00,522 --> 02:13:03,441
I'm glad I'll never see him again!

1697
02:13:07,946 --> 02:13:10,699
Two chocolate sundaes coming up.

1698
02:13:17,163 --> 02:13:20,083
What about a ham and cheese
on whole wheat without any mustard?

1699
02:13:20,250 --> 02:13:23,128
Ham and cheese, dark,
save the mustard, coming up.

1700
02:13:46,109 --> 02:13:47,986
Here you are.

1701
02:13:49,446 --> 02:13:50,947
Thank you.

1702
02:13:52,782 --> 02:13:54,284
-Hello, Homer.
-Hi, Fred.

1703
02:13:54,451 --> 02:13:57,037
How've you been? Glad to see you.

1704
02:13:57,203 --> 02:13:59,039
-Say, Fred.
-Yeah?

1705
02:13:59,205 --> 02:14:00,999
What happened at Butch's?

1706
02:14:01,166 --> 02:14:05,295
-What do you mean?
-I mean, you and Al. Was there any trouble?

1707
02:14:05,462 --> 02:14:08,631
Oh, no, we were just having
a little friendly chat.

1708
02:14:10,550 --> 02:14:12,135
-There you are, sir.
-Thanks.

1709
02:14:12,302 --> 02:14:14,637
-What'll it be, Homer?
-Oh, I don't care.

1710
02:14:14,804 --> 02:14:17,599
-Give me a chocolate sundae.
-Okay.

1711
02:14:19,809 --> 02:14:20,935
Hi.

1712
02:14:21,102 --> 02:14:23,396
-How are you, soldier?
-Sailor.

1713
02:14:23,563 --> 02:14:25,190
Excuse me.

1714
02:14:27,150 --> 02:14:28,735
Say...

1715
02:14:29,194 --> 02:14:31,654
...do you mind
if I ask you a personal question?

1716
02:14:31,821 --> 02:14:34,908
I know what it is. How did I get
these hooks, and how do they work?

1717
02:14:35,075 --> 02:14:37,202
That's what everybody says
when they start off:

1718
02:14:37,369 --> 02:14:39,621
"Do you mind
if I ask you a personal question?"

1719
02:14:39,788 --> 02:14:40,872
Well, I'll tell you.

1720
02:14:41,039 --> 02:14:43,667
I got sick and tired
of that old pair of hands I had.

1721
02:14:43,833 --> 02:14:47,545
You know, an awful lot of trouble
washing them and manicuring my nails.

1722
02:14:47,712 --> 02:14:50,173
So I traded them in
for a pair of these latest models.

1723
02:14:50,340 --> 02:14:53,510
They work by radar. Look.

1724
02:15:03,520 --> 02:15:07,273
-Pretty cute, eh?
-You got plenty of guts.

1725
02:15:08,191 --> 02:15:11,528
It's terrible when you see a guy like you
that had to sacrifice himself.

1726
02:15:11,695 --> 02:15:12,737
And for what?

1727
02:15:14,739 --> 02:15:17,283
And for what? I don't get you, mister.

1728
02:15:17,450 --> 02:15:19,035
-Well--
-Anything else for you?

1729
02:15:19,202 --> 02:15:20,537
Check.

1730
02:15:21,204 --> 02:15:23,415
We let ourselves get sold down the river.

1731
02:15:23,581 --> 02:15:26,418
-We were pushed into war.
-Sure, by the Japs and the Nazis.

1732
02:15:26,584 --> 02:15:28,461
-So we had--
-The Germans and the Japs...

1733
02:15:28,628 --> 02:15:32,048
...had nothing against us. They wanted
to fight the Limeys and the Reds.

1734
02:15:32,215 --> 02:15:33,925
And they would've whipped them too...

1735
02:15:34,092 --> 02:15:38,221
...if we didn't get deceived into it
by a bunch of radicals in Washington.

1736
02:15:38,388 --> 02:15:40,682
What are you talking about?

1737
02:15:41,266 --> 02:15:44,060
We fought the wrong people, that's all.

1738
02:15:44,227 --> 02:15:46,312
Just read the facts, my friend.

1739
02:15:46,479 --> 02:15:48,898
Find out for yourself
why you had to lose your hands.

1740
02:15:49,065 --> 02:15:50,734
And then go do something about it.

1741
02:15:50,900 --> 02:15:53,737
You'd better pay your check, brother,
and go home.

1742
02:15:53,903 --> 02:15:57,490
-Well, who do you think you are?
-Pay the cashier right over there.

1743
02:15:57,657 --> 02:15:59,659
-Coffee, please.
-Yes, ma'am.

1744
02:15:59,826 --> 02:16:00,910
There's another thing.

1745
02:16:01,077 --> 02:16:05,040
Every soda jerk in this country
has got an idea he's somebody.

1746
02:16:14,132 --> 02:16:16,259
Look here, mister,
what are you selling anyway?

1747
02:16:16,426 --> 02:16:19,721
I'm not selling anything
but plain old-fashioned Americanism.

1748
02:16:19,888 --> 02:16:23,266
Some Americanism.
So we're all a bunch of suckers, eh?

1749
02:16:23,433 --> 02:16:26,186
So we should've been on the side
of the Japs and the Nazis?

1750
02:16:26,353 --> 02:16:29,939
Again, I say, just look at the facts.

1751
02:16:30,106 --> 02:16:31,483
I've seen a couple of facts.

1752
02:16:31,649 --> 02:16:34,736
I've seen a ship go down
and over 400 of my shipmates went with it.

1753
02:16:34,903 --> 02:16:36,821
Were those guys suckers?

1754
02:16:36,988 --> 02:16:38,448
That's the unpleasant truth.

1755
02:16:38,615 --> 02:16:41,201
And the sooner we get wise to it,
the better off we're--

1756
02:16:41,368 --> 02:16:46,373
-Oh, if I only had my hands!
-You put those down!

1757
02:16:47,374 --> 02:16:48,875
Take your hands off of him!

1758
02:16:59,427 --> 02:17:01,554
May I get through, please?

1759
02:17:02,806 --> 02:17:04,808
-Go get the druggist.
-Yes, sir.

1760
02:17:04,974 --> 02:17:08,645
-Make way, please. What happened?
-It was Fred Derry. He hit him.

1761
02:17:08,812 --> 02:17:11,147
Bring some spirits of ammonia,
iodine and bandages.

1762
02:17:11,314 --> 02:17:12,357
Yes, sir.

1763
02:17:12,524 --> 02:17:13,983
Don't say it, chum.

1764
02:17:14,150 --> 02:17:18,321
The customer's always right, so I'm fired.
But this customer wasn't right.

1765
02:17:18,488 --> 02:17:20,865
I'll meet you outside in a minute, kid.

1766
02:17:58,153 --> 02:18:01,573
Gee, Fred, I'm sorry I lost you your job.

1767
02:18:01,740 --> 02:18:03,783
-But that guy--
-Yeah, I know.

1768
02:18:03,950 --> 02:18:07,704
You read about guys like that,
but you don't often see them, luckily.

1769
02:18:09,247 --> 02:18:13,585
How about your girlfriend, Wilma?
You and she gonna get married?

1770
02:18:13,752 --> 02:18:15,879
-I don't know.
-Why don't you know?

1771
02:18:16,046 --> 02:18:19,591
-Doesn't she want to get married?
-Oh, it isn't Wilma's fault.

1772
02:18:19,758 --> 02:18:21,301
She's been swell about it.

1773
02:18:21,468 --> 02:18:24,763
-So then it's your fault?
-Yeah, I....

1774
02:18:25,555 --> 02:18:27,390
I guess it is.

1775
02:18:28,141 --> 02:18:31,311
-Will you do me a favor, Homer?
-Sure, Fred, what is it?

1776
02:18:31,478 --> 02:18:35,815
I'm a hot one to be giving advice
to the lovelorn, but go see Wilma now.

1777
02:18:35,982 --> 02:18:40,070
Take her in your arms, kiss her,
ask her to marry you, then marry her.

1778
02:18:40,236 --> 02:18:42,405
Tomorrow,
if you can get a license that fast.

1779
02:18:42,572 --> 02:18:45,283
If you want anybody to stand up for you
at your wedding....

1780
02:18:45,450 --> 02:18:49,287
-There's my bus. So long, kid.
-So long, Fred.

1781
02:20:37,854 --> 02:20:40,940
-You all right, Homer?
-Yes, Pop, I'm going to get a glass of milk.

1782
02:20:41,107 --> 02:20:43,193
Well, just knock on the door
when you want me.

1783
02:20:43,360 --> 02:20:44,819
Okay.

1784
02:21:17,310 --> 02:21:19,771
Wilma. What are you doing
out this hour of night?

1785
02:21:19,938 --> 02:21:23,525
I saw you were up, Homer.
I saw you through the window.

1786
02:21:23,983 --> 02:21:28,196
-I've got to talk to you.
-All right, come in.

1787
02:21:36,496 --> 02:21:38,748
-Want some chicken?
-No, thanks.

1788
02:21:38,915 --> 02:21:41,710
-Sure?
-Yes.

1789
02:21:42,711 --> 02:21:45,338
-Want a glass of milk?
-No, thanks, Homer.

1790
02:21:45,505 --> 02:21:47,424
Sit down, Wilma.

1791
02:21:48,341 --> 02:21:53,680
Homer, my family want me to go away.
Tomorrow.

1792
02:21:54,973 --> 02:21:59,811
-Where?
-Up to Silver Lake, at my Aunt Vera's place.

1793
02:22:03,106 --> 02:22:05,191
That ought to be nice.

1794
02:22:05,358 --> 02:22:09,863
But I don't want to go.
I want to stay here.

1795
02:22:11,656 --> 02:22:15,869
You see, the reason they want me to go
is so that I'll forget about you.

1796
02:22:16,036 --> 02:22:19,706
They figure you don't want me around,
you don't wanna see me...

1797
02:22:19,873 --> 02:22:23,668
...and if I go away for a while,
maybe I'll get all this out of my mind.

1798
02:22:24,544 --> 02:22:29,174
Maybe that's a good idea, Wilma.
Maybe you ought to do that.

1799
02:22:30,300 --> 02:22:32,719
Do you wanna get rid of me?

1800
02:22:34,471 --> 02:22:38,933
Tell me the truth, Homer.
Do you want me to forget about you?

1801
02:22:45,398 --> 02:22:50,028
I want you to be free, Wilma.
To live your own life.

1802
02:22:50,862 --> 02:22:56,826
I don't want you tied down forever
just because you've got a kind heart.

1803
02:22:56,993 --> 02:23:00,914
Homer, why can't you ever understand
the way things really are...

1804
02:23:01,081 --> 02:23:04,668
...the way I really feel?
I keep trying to tell you.

1805
02:23:06,586 --> 02:23:09,422
But you don't know, Wilma.

1806
02:23:10,924 --> 02:23:14,552
You don't know what it'd be like
to have to live with me...

1807
02:23:14,719 --> 02:23:20,141
...to have to face this every day,
every night.

1808
02:23:20,308 --> 02:23:22,852
But I can only find out by trying.

1809
02:23:23,019 --> 02:23:27,107
And if it turns out I haven't
courage enough, we'll soon know it.

1810
02:23:37,325 --> 02:23:41,788
Wilma, you and I have been close
to each other for a long time, haven't we?

1811
02:23:41,955 --> 02:23:44,332
Ever since we were kids.

1812
02:23:46,710 --> 02:23:48,503
Yes, Homer.

1813
02:23:52,716 --> 02:23:55,135
I'm going upstairs to bed.

1814
02:23:57,178 --> 02:24:01,725
I want you to come up
and see for yourself what happens.

1815
02:24:07,188 --> 02:24:09,190
All right, Homer.

1816
02:25:00,200 --> 02:25:02,619
I've learned how to take this harness off.

1817
02:25:12,462 --> 02:25:15,048
I can wiggle into my pajama top.

1818
02:25:23,682 --> 02:25:25,725
I'm lucky, I have my elbows.

1819
02:25:25,892 --> 02:25:29,229
Some of the boys don't.
But I can't button them up.

1820
02:25:29,396 --> 02:25:31,439
I'll do that, Homer.

1821
02:25:55,255 --> 02:25:59,676
This is when I know I'm helpless.
My hands are down there on the bed.

1822
02:25:59,843 --> 02:26:03,596
I can't put them on again
without calling to somebody for help.

1823
02:26:03,763 --> 02:26:06,599
I can't smoke a cigarette or read a book.

1824
02:26:06,933 --> 02:26:10,770
If that door should blow shut,
I can't open it and get out of this room.

1825
02:26:11,938 --> 02:26:16,443
I'm as dependent as a baby that doesn't
know how to get anything except cry for it.

1826
02:26:19,612 --> 02:26:21,781
Well, now you know, Wilma.

1827
02:26:22,449 --> 02:26:24,909
Now you have an idea of what it is.

1828
02:26:25,076 --> 02:26:28,747
I guess you don't know what to say.
It's all right.

1829
02:26:28,913 --> 02:26:32,625
Go on home.
Go away, like your family said.

1830
02:26:34,252 --> 02:26:36,421
I know what to say, Homer.

1831
02:26:36,588 --> 02:26:38,006
I love you.

1832
02:26:38,173 --> 02:26:42,302
And I'm never going to leave you. Never.

1833
02:27:15,168 --> 02:27:17,545
You mean you didn't mind?

1834
02:27:18,088 --> 02:27:22,342
Of course not. I told you I loved you.

1835
02:27:27,305 --> 02:27:33,186
I love you, Wilma.
I always have, and I always will.

1836
02:28:10,181 --> 02:28:13,727
Good night, darling. Sleep well.

1837
02:28:22,694 --> 02:28:24,529
Good night, Wilma.

1838
02:29:23,380 --> 02:29:27,050
Hey, Sugar. You'd better step on it,
or your husband will be home.

1839
02:29:27,217 --> 02:29:30,637
Oh, don't worry. He's job hunting.
He won't come home for another hour.

1840
02:29:30,804 --> 02:29:33,306
-And what if he does?
-I don't understand it.

1841
02:29:33,473 --> 02:29:36,518
Guy like that with all this money around
and he can't get into it.

1842
02:29:36,685 --> 02:29:39,813
-What's the matter with him?
-I guess he just isn't very bright.

1843
02:29:46,111 --> 02:29:47,529
How do you do?

1844
02:29:48,530 --> 02:29:50,990
Fine, thanks. Who are you?

1845
02:29:51,157 --> 02:29:54,119
Fred, I want you to meet Cliff Scully,
an old friend of mine.

1846
02:29:54,285 --> 02:29:57,247
-Hi, Freddy.
-Glad to know you, Scully. Get out.

1847
02:29:57,414 --> 02:29:58,790
A tough guy, huh?

1848
02:29:58,957 --> 02:30:02,002
Now listen, Fred. You're not gonna get
anywhere with that attitude.

1849
02:30:02,168 --> 02:30:05,672
Cliff Scully's an old friend of mine.
He's asked me out, and I'm going out.

1850
02:30:05,839 --> 02:30:07,465
If you don't like it,
you know what you can do.

1851
02:30:07,632 --> 02:30:08,925
You heard me, chum. Get out.

1852
02:30:09,092 --> 02:30:13,179
-What do I do next? Smack him.
-Why ask her? Can't you think for yourself?

1853
02:30:13,346 --> 02:30:16,182
Go on Cliff. I can handle this.
Wait for me downstairs.

1854
02:30:16,349 --> 02:30:17,934
Okay.

1855
02:30:28,194 --> 02:30:29,988
Another ex-serviceman, huh?

1856
02:30:30,155 --> 02:30:33,408
Greetings, brother. Have you
had any trouble getting readjusted?

1857
02:30:33,575 --> 02:30:37,704
Not in particular. It's easy if you just
take everything in your stride.

1858
02:30:38,163 --> 02:30:39,622
That's what I've heard.

1859
02:30:43,877 --> 02:30:46,338
-Be seeing you.
-I doubt it.

1860
02:30:48,131 --> 02:30:51,134
-When did you pick him up?
-I told you. He's an old friend.

1861
02:30:51,301 --> 02:30:54,220
He just dropped in for a friendly drink.

1862
02:30:56,389 --> 02:30:59,392
-Did you know him while I was away?
-I knew lots of people.

1863
02:30:59,559 --> 02:31:01,644
What do you think I was doing
all those years?

1864
02:31:01,811 --> 02:31:04,898
-I don't know, but I can guess.
-Go ahead, guess your head off.

1865
02:31:05,065 --> 02:31:06,649
I could do some guessing myself.

1866
02:31:06,816 --> 02:31:10,320
What were you up to in London
and Paris and all those places?

1867
02:31:10,487 --> 02:31:13,239
I've given you every chance
to make something of yourself.

1868
02:31:13,406 --> 02:31:15,367
I gave up my own job
when you asked me.

1869
02:31:15,533 --> 02:31:18,370
I gave up the best years of my life.
And what have you done?

1870
02:31:18,536 --> 02:31:22,082
You've flopped. Couldn't even hold that job
at the drugstore.

1871
02:31:22,248 --> 02:31:23,958
So I'm going back to work for myself.

1872
02:31:24,125 --> 02:31:26,169
That means I'm going to live
for myself too.

1873
02:31:26,336 --> 02:31:30,382
And in case you don't understand English,
I'm gonna get a divorce.

1874
02:31:30,548 --> 02:31:32,759
What have you got to say to that?

1875
02:31:38,431 --> 02:31:40,141
Don't keep Cliff waiting.

1876
02:31:43,103 --> 02:31:45,647
-What are you gonna do?
-I'm going away.

1877
02:31:45,814 --> 02:31:49,901
-Where?
-As far away from Boone City as I can get.

1878
02:31:50,068 --> 02:31:54,489
That's a good idea.
You'll get a good job someplace else.

1879
02:31:54,656 --> 02:31:57,742
There are drugstores everywhere.

1880
02:32:33,945 --> 02:32:35,405
Here's an old sweater I found.

1881
02:32:35,572 --> 02:32:37,657
-Remember you wore it in high school?
-Sure.

1882
02:32:37,824 --> 02:32:39,951
-You might need it sometime.
-Thanks, Hortense.

1883
02:32:40,118 --> 02:32:44,372
-You forgot these, son.
-Oh, I don't want them, Pop.

1884
02:32:44,539 --> 02:32:45,582
What are they?

1885
02:32:45,749 --> 02:32:49,252
Just a lot of fancy words that don't mean
anything. You can throw them away.

1886
02:32:49,419 --> 02:32:52,881
Say, these are citations for your medals.

1887
02:32:53,048 --> 02:32:55,216
Why, Freddy,
you never showed them to us.

1888
02:32:55,383 --> 02:32:58,178
Those things came in the packages
of K rations.

1889
02:32:58,345 --> 02:33:00,972
Well, we'll treasure them, my boy.

1890
02:33:01,139 --> 02:33:03,850
I'll get the socks I washed for you.

1891
02:33:06,269 --> 02:33:09,939
-Think you're doing the right thing, son?
-You mean going?

1892
02:33:10,106 --> 02:33:13,526
Who's to say in advance whether
it's the right thing or the wrong thing?

1893
02:33:13,693 --> 02:33:16,321
It just means a fresh start
in some other place.

1894
02:33:16,488 --> 02:33:19,199
How do you know
it'll be different anyplace else?

1895
02:33:19,366 --> 02:33:23,912
There's a need here for fellas like yourself
that fought and won the war.

1896
02:33:24,496 --> 02:33:27,457
I know you haven't had the best of breaks
since you got back...

1897
02:33:27,624 --> 02:33:31,544
...but, well, it seems like
you ought to stick here...

1898
02:33:31,711 --> 02:33:35,507
...and slug it out a while longer
on your own home ground.

1899
02:33:37,092 --> 02:33:39,052
You're all right, Pop.

1900
02:33:39,219 --> 02:33:41,680
But I know when it's time to bail out.

1901
02:33:42,681 --> 02:33:44,391
I gotta get going.

1902
02:33:49,396 --> 02:33:52,899
-Here are your clean socks, Fred.
-Just put them in here.

1903
02:33:54,192 --> 02:33:56,945
-Take good care of the old man, won't you?
-I'll do my best.

1904
02:33:57,112 --> 02:34:00,949
-But we'll miss you, Freddy.
-You ought to be used to that by now.

1905
02:34:01,825 --> 02:34:03,576
So long, Pop.

1906
02:34:31,521 --> 02:34:34,441
I'll tell you, captain.
We've got two flights going out tonight.

1907
02:34:34,607 --> 02:34:37,986
One eastbound, one westbound.
You'll have to ask the pilot.

1908
02:34:38,153 --> 02:34:41,698
-Which way you going?
-Which one leaves first?

1909
02:34:42,782 --> 02:34:44,784
Eastbound, 8:00.

1910
02:34:44,951 --> 02:34:48,705
That'll be fine.
I'll just hang around the field until then.

1911
02:34:48,872 --> 02:34:50,999
Say, you don't seem to care
where you're going.

1912
02:34:51,166 --> 02:34:53,668
That's right, chum. I don't.

1913
02:35:07,057 --> 02:35:08,641
Hortense.

1914
02:35:09,601 --> 02:35:14,230
Hortense! Listen to this. Sit down.

1915
02:35:14,397 --> 02:35:20,153
''Headquarters, Eighth Air Force.
Award of the Distinguished Flying Cross.''

1916
02:35:20,653 --> 02:35:22,030
Here.

1917
02:35:22,655 --> 02:35:26,242
''Despite intense pain,
shock and loss of blood...

1918
02:35:26,409 --> 02:35:29,371
...with complete disregard
of his personal safety...

1919
02:35:29,537 --> 02:35:32,165
...Captain Derry crawled
back to his bombsight...

1920
02:35:32,332 --> 02:35:35,585
...guided his formation
on a perfect run over the objective...

1921
02:35:35,752 --> 02:35:38,797
...and released his bombs
with great accuracy.

1922
02:35:38,963 --> 02:35:43,093
The heroism, devotion to duty,
professional skill...

1923
02:35:43,259 --> 02:35:48,139
...and coolness under fire
displayed by Captain Derry...

1924
02:35:49,766 --> 02:35:54,187
...under the most difficult conditions,
reflect highest credit upon himself...

1925
02:35:54,354 --> 02:35:59,025
...and the Armed Forces
of the United States of America.

1926
02:36:00,276 --> 02:36:04,197
By command
of Lieutenant General Doolittle.''

1927
02:39:11,760 --> 02:39:14,220
Hey, bud, what are you doing up there?

1928
02:39:17,057 --> 02:39:18,641
Hey, you!

1929
02:39:19,976 --> 02:39:22,520
What are you doing in that airplane?

1930
02:39:44,042 --> 02:39:46,753
I used to work in one of those.

1931
02:39:46,920 --> 02:39:48,588
Reviving old memories, huh?

1932
02:39:48,755 --> 02:39:51,299
Yeah, or maybe getting some of them
out of my system.

1933
02:39:51,466 --> 02:39:54,552
Well, take your last look at these crates.
We're breaking them up.

1934
02:39:54,719 --> 02:39:58,515
Yeah, I know. You're the junkman.
You get everything sooner or later.

1935
02:39:58,682 --> 02:39:59,724
This is no junk.

1936
02:39:59,891 --> 02:40:02,644
We're using this material
for building prefabricated houses.

1937
02:40:04,646 --> 02:40:06,606
You don't need any help, do you?

1938
02:40:06,773 --> 02:40:08,817
-Out of a job?
-That's it.

1939
02:40:08,983 --> 02:40:12,320
I see. One of the fallen angels
of the Air Force.

1940
02:40:12,487 --> 02:40:14,781
Well, pardon me if I show no sympathy.

1941
02:40:14,948 --> 02:40:17,992
While you glamour boys were up
in the wild blue yonder...

1942
02:40:18,159 --> 02:40:20,120
-...I was down in a tank.
-Listen, chum.

1943
02:40:20,286 --> 02:40:23,206
Sometime I'll be glad to hear
the story of your war experiences.

1944
02:40:23,373 --> 02:40:26,459
What I asked you for was a job.
Have you got one?

1945
02:40:27,127 --> 02:40:28,795
Do you know anything about building?

1946
02:40:28,962 --> 02:40:31,631
No. But there's one thing I do know,
I know how to learn.

1947
02:40:31,798 --> 02:40:33,967
Same as I learned that job up there.

1948
02:40:36,803 --> 02:40:38,930
-Hey, Gus.
-Yes?

1949
02:40:39,097 --> 02:40:41,516
See if you think this guy can be
of any use to us.

1950
02:40:41,683 --> 02:40:43,143
Thanks.

1951
02:40:54,154 --> 02:40:56,823
Now, children, let's remember the words.

1952
02:40:56,990 --> 02:41:01,286
The bride will come down those stairs.
And when I see her, I'll hit the first note...

1953
02:41:01,453 --> 02:41:04,456
...then I'll nod my head
and then we'll sing.

1954
02:41:04,622 --> 02:41:06,249
All right, let's try it.

1955
02:41:07,834 --> 02:41:09,419
-Here she comes.
-Here.

1956
02:41:09,586 --> 02:41:11,504
Wait for the note.

1957
02:41:13,673 --> 02:41:15,300
That's fine.

1958
02:41:22,349 --> 02:41:23,600
-Mrs. Cameron?
-Yes.

1959
02:41:23,767 --> 02:41:24,934
-Mrs. Stephenson?
-Yes.

1960
02:41:25,101 --> 02:41:26,603
Come right in, won't you?

1961
02:41:26,770 --> 02:41:28,355
-My daughter.
-How do you do?

1962
02:41:28,521 --> 02:41:30,732
-How do you do?
-How do you do, Mr. Stephenson?

1963
02:41:30,899 --> 02:41:33,068
-For you.
-Oh, my. You shouldn't have.

1964
02:41:33,234 --> 02:41:34,903
-My daughter.
-Miss Stephenson.

1965
02:41:35,070 --> 02:41:36,488
-Hello.
-Hello, Mr. Cameron.

1966
02:41:36,654 --> 02:41:37,989
-Pleasure.
-Nice to see you.

1967
02:41:38,156 --> 02:41:39,199
Homer's folks.

1968
02:41:39,366 --> 02:41:41,201
Mr. and Mrs. Stephenson.
Ms. Stephenson.

1969
02:41:41,368 --> 02:41:44,204
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

1970
02:41:44,371 --> 02:41:46,373
-Hello, Al. Good you're here.
-Hello, Butch.

1971
02:41:46,539 --> 02:41:47,999
Good to see you. Thank you.

1972
02:41:48,166 --> 02:41:51,086
-Hello, Butch.
-How do you do, Mrs. Stephenson?

1973
02:41:51,252 --> 02:41:53,046
How do you do?

1974
02:41:57,050 --> 02:41:59,052
Steady, boy.

1975
02:42:03,390 --> 02:42:06,267
Gee, Fred, you had me worried.
I heard you were leaving town.

1976
02:42:06,434 --> 02:42:11,189
-I was afraid you wouldn't stand up for me.
-I'll stand up for you, kid, till I drop.

1977
02:42:11,356 --> 02:42:15,985
Oh, Fred, here's the ring. Don't lose it.

1978
02:42:17,153 --> 02:42:20,407
-Hi, Homer. Big day, huh?
-Hi, Al.

1979
02:42:20,573 --> 02:42:24,202
-Hi, Fred.
-Hello, Al.

1980
02:42:25,286 --> 02:42:28,790
-I hear you moved back with your folks.
-Yeah.

1981
02:42:29,958 --> 02:42:33,253
I've been sampling the punch.
I presume it was made for the kiddies.

1982
02:42:33,420 --> 02:42:36,172
-Will you have some, Homer?
-I'd better not, Al.

1983
02:42:36,339 --> 02:42:38,800
-I might give the wrong answers.
-How about you, Fred?

1984
02:42:38,967 --> 02:42:41,428
No, thanks. Maybe later.

1985
02:42:41,594 --> 02:42:44,723
Well, if I must be a solitary drinker,
good luck, kid.

1986
02:42:44,889 --> 02:42:45,932
Thank you, Al.

1987
02:42:46,099 --> 02:42:48,643
-Al! You promised you wouldn't.
-Now, listen, darling.

1988
02:42:48,810 --> 02:42:50,020
-Take a sip.
-Fred. Homer.

1989
02:42:50,186 --> 02:42:52,772
You'll realize there isn't a headache
in a barrel of it.

1990
02:42:52,939 --> 02:42:55,400
Don't worry about Al,
Mrs. Stephenson, he can take it.

1991
02:42:55,567 --> 02:42:56,943
-He certainly can.
-Excuse me.

1992
02:42:57,110 --> 02:42:59,195
Here, see for yourself.

1993
02:43:34,147 --> 02:43:35,315
Hello, Fred.

1994
02:43:35,482 --> 02:43:39,361
-Nice to see you again.
-Hello, Peggy. Nice to see you.

1995
02:43:41,154 --> 02:43:44,324
Well, what have you been
doing with yourself lately?

1996
02:43:44,824 --> 02:43:46,409
Working.

1997
02:43:48,661 --> 02:43:50,205
Yes.

1998
02:43:50,372 --> 02:43:53,333
Dad told me he heard
you were in some kind of building work.

1999
02:43:54,834 --> 02:43:59,506
Well, that's a hopeful way of putting it.
I'm really in the junk business.

2000
02:43:59,964 --> 02:44:03,843
An occupation for which many people feel
I'm well qualified...

2001
02:44:04,010 --> 02:44:05,470
...by temperament and training.

2002
02:44:06,513 --> 02:44:08,473
It's fascinating work.

2003
02:44:09,724 --> 02:44:14,854
-Where's Homer? Wilma's ready.
-I'll get him. Excuse me.

2004
02:44:17,107 --> 02:44:21,277
Come on, children. Mary, Kay, go ahead.
Children. Jackie. Jackie!

2005
02:44:22,445 --> 02:44:23,905
Over here.

2006
02:44:41,214 --> 02:44:42,590
Watch me, now. Watch me.

2007
02:45:21,963 --> 02:45:25,133
Dearly beloved, we are gathered together
here in the sight of God...

2008
02:45:25,300 --> 02:45:27,052
...and in the face of this company...

2009
02:45:27,218 --> 02:45:31,222
...to join together this man
and this woman in holy matrimony.

2010
02:45:31,389 --> 02:45:35,685
If any man can show just cause why they
may not lawfully be joined together...

2011
02:45:35,852 --> 02:45:40,607
...let him now speak,
or else here after forever hold his peace.

2012
02:45:41,441 --> 02:45:44,110
Homer, wilt thou have
this woman to thy wedded wife?

2013
02:45:44,277 --> 02:45:45,528
I will.

2014
02:45:45,695 --> 02:45:48,782
Wilma, wilt thou have
this man to thy wedded husband?

2015
02:45:48,948 --> 02:45:50,283
I will.

2016
02:45:50,450 --> 02:45:52,827
Who gives this woman
to be married to this man?

2017
02:45:53,453 --> 02:45:54,788
I do.

2018
02:45:54,954 --> 02:46:00,168
Now, Homer, will you take Wilma's
right hand in yours and say after me.

2019
02:46:01,461 --> 02:46:04,297
I, Homer, take thee,
Wilma, to my wedded wife.

2020
02:46:04,464 --> 02:46:07,133
I, Homer, take thee,
Wilma, to my wedded wife.

2021
02:46:07,300 --> 02:46:09,969
To have and to hold
from this day forward.

2022
02:46:10,136 --> 02:46:12,597
To have and to hold
from this day forward.

2023
02:46:12,764 --> 02:46:15,975
For better, for worse.
For richer, for poorer.

2024
02:46:16,142 --> 02:46:18,978
For better, for worse.
For richer, for poorer.

2025
02:46:19,145 --> 02:46:23,650
In sickness and in health.
To love and to cherish till death us do part.

2026
02:46:23,817 --> 02:46:25,360
In sickness and in health.

2027
02:46:25,527 --> 02:46:29,489
To love and to cherish till death do--
Us do part.

2028
02:46:30,490 --> 02:46:32,492
Now, Wilma, with your right hand...

2029
02:46:32,659 --> 02:46:36,162
...take Homer by his right hand
and say after me.

2030
02:46:38,540 --> 02:46:41,543
I, Wilma, take thee, Homer,
to my wedded husband.

2031
02:46:41,710 --> 02:46:44,546
I, Wilma, take thee, Homer,
to my wedded husband.

2032
02:46:44,713 --> 02:46:47,173
To have and to hold
from this day forward.

2033
02:46:47,716 --> 02:46:50,135
To have and to hold
from this day forward.

2034
02:46:50,301 --> 02:46:53,513
For better, for worse.
For richer, for poorer.

2035
02:46:53,680 --> 02:46:56,516
For better, for worse.
For richer, for poorer.

2036
02:46:56,683 --> 02:47:01,354
In sickness and in health.
To love and to cherish till death us do part.

2037
02:47:02,022 --> 02:47:08,028
In sickness and in health.
To love and to cherish till death us do part.

2038
02:47:08,194 --> 02:47:09,821
The ring.

2039
02:47:15,994 --> 02:47:19,748
Place it on the fourth finger
of Wilma's left hand.

2040
02:47:42,228 --> 02:47:44,397
Repeat after me.

2041
02:47:44,856 --> 02:47:49,569
-With this ring, I thee wed.
-With this ring, I thee wed.

2042
02:47:56,242 --> 02:48:00,747
Those whom God hath joined together,
let not man put asunder.

2043
02:48:00,914 --> 02:48:05,001
For as much as Homer and Wilma have
consented together in holy wedlock...

2044
02:48:05,168 --> 02:48:08,213
...and have witnessed the same
before God and this company...

2045
02:48:08,380 --> 02:48:12,300
...and thereto have given and pledged
their troth, each to the other...

2046
02:48:12,467 --> 02:48:15,679
...and have declared the same
by giving and receiving a ring...

2047
02:48:15,845 --> 02:48:17,597
...and by joining hands...

2048
02:48:17,764 --> 02:48:22,852
...I pronounce that they are man and wife.
God bless you both.

2049
02:48:58,805 --> 02:49:04,019
You know what it'll be, don't you, Peggy?
It may take us years to get anywhere.

2050
02:49:04,394 --> 02:49:07,939
We'll have no money,
no decent place to live.

2051
02:49:08,106 --> 02:49:11,109
We'll have to work, get kicked around....
