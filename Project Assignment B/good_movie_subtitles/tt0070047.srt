1
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:27,389
Sure do love you.

2
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:31,017
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mrs. MacNeil.

3
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,103
- How are you today?
- Fine, thank you.

4
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,563
That's good.

5
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:37,482
It's okay, I've got it. Thanks.

6
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:40,193
- Good morning, madam.
- Good morning, Karl.

7
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:44,281
Oh, Karl, we've got rats in the attic.
You'd better get some traps.

8
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:47,784
- Rats?
- I'm afraid so.

9
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,244
But the attic is clean.

10
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:51,162
All right, then,
we've got clean rats.

11
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:54,624
- No, no. No rats.
- I just heard them, Karl.

12
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,042
Maybe plumbing.

13
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:59,379
Yeah, or maybe rats. Now,
will you just get the traps?

14
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:00,797
Yes, I go now.

15
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:02,841
Don't go now. The
stores aren't open yet.

16
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:04,759
- I'll go see.
- They're closed!

17
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,393
In the group over here...

18
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,806
I need a priest, a nun
and two students.

19
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:14,311
That's what we want. That's
exactly what we want.

20
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,816
Burke. Oh, Burke.

21
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:21,818
- Is this scene really essential?
- Chris.

22
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:23,778
Just consider if we
can do without it.

23
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:26,781
Take a look at this damn thing.
It just doesn't make sense.

24
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:30,827
It's plain. You're a teacher of the college.
You don't want the building torn down.

25
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:34,247
- Come on. I can read, for Christ's sake.
- Well, what's wrong?

26
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,666
Well, why are they tearing
the building down?

27
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,836
Shall we summon the writer?
He's in Paris, I believe.

28
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:41,171
- Hiding?
- Fucking.

29
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,843
Scene 39: Hotel. Take four.

30
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,846
All right. Hustle, background.
And action.

31
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:51,574
Hasn't there been enough killing?

32
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:54,726
Is this your campus?

33
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:59,189
Get the Defense Department
off this campus!

34
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:03,026
It's our school!

35
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:05,195
- You have no rights!
- Hypocrite!

36
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:07,322
Military complex, man!

37
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,240
And action, Chris.

38
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,451
I've seen enough killing
in my lifetime!

39
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:15,121
There's no need for it!

40
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,502
That's right! That's right!

41
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:24,547
We're all concerned with human
rights, for God's sake...

42
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:27,550
but the kids who want to get
an education have a right too!

43
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:36,893
Don't you understand? It's against
your own principle, for God's sake!

44
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:42,732
You can't accomplish anything by
shutting kids off from their...

45
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:51,157
- If you want... Hold it, hold it!
- Quiet!

46
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:54,744
If you want to effect any change,
you have to do it within the system.

47
00:14:57,522 --> 00:15:00,333
Okay, cut. That's a wrap.

48
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,560
- I'll walk home tonight.
- Okay.

49
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:21,187
Here, take that and drop
it at my house, yeah?

50
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:23,189
- Good night, Tom.
- Good night.

51
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:03,688
There's not a day in my life
that I don't feel like a fraud.

52
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:06,175
I mean, priests, doctors, lawyers.
I've talked to them all.

53
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:09,210
I don't know anyone
who hasn't felt that.

54
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:16,493
Hello?

55
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,078
In here.

56
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,956
- Hi. How did your day go?
- Oh, not too bad.

57
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:25,418
It was like the, uh, Walt Disney
version of the Ho Chi Minh story.

58
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,836
Other than that, terrific.

59
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:29,631
- What we got, anything exciting?
- Here.

60
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,342
- Oh, all right.
- And also, you got an invitation.

61
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:35,053
- What's this?
- Dinner at the White House.

62
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,472
You're kidding. Is it a
big party or something?

63
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:38,932
I think it's five or six people.

64
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:41,935
Oh. Thursday, huh? All right.

65
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:43,144
Hi, Mom.

66
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:45,146
What'd you do today?

67
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:46,981
- Stuff.
- What's that mean, stuff?

68
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:50,985
Well, uh, me and Sharon played
a game in the backyard.

69
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:53,488
- You did.
- And we had a picnic down by the river.

70
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:55,490
That sounds good.

71
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:56,699
You should have seen.

72
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,869
This man came along on
this beautiful gray horse.

73
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,746
- Really? What kind?
- Wasn't he pretty?

74
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,998
Was it a mare, a gelding, what?

75
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,209
- I think it was a gelding.
- Mm-hm.

76
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:09,003
It was gray. Oh,
it was so beautiful.

77
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,422
The guy let me ride it all
around and everything.

78
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:13,629
- You're kidding.
- She rode for half an hour.

79
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:18,680
It was so nice. Oh, I loved it.
Oh, Mom, can't we get a horse?

80
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:22,225
- Not while we're in Washington, honey.
- Why not, Mom? Ha, ha.

81
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:24,227
We'll see when we get home, okay?

82
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:27,021
- When could I have one?
- We'll see, Regan. We'll see.

83
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:30,400
Hey, listen, on the party invitations,
I wanted to write a personal...

84
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:33,319
- Regan, don't! Regan, come back here!
- Ha-ha-ha.

85
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:40,410
- All right, give it up. Give it up!
- No!

86
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:42,537
- Ooh!
- Ha-ha-ha.

87
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:44,330
- You'll be sorry! Come on.
- No!

88
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:16,613
Father?

89
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,240
Could you help an old altar boy?

90
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:20,450
I'm a Catholic.

91
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,642
All right, come on, man.

92
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:48,029
- What, are you crazy?
- Go ahead.

93
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,705
Mama?

94
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,508
Mama?

95
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:02,885
Mama?

96
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:07,056
Dimmy! Dimmy!

97
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:12,395
Oh, how are you, Mama?

98
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:14,731
- I'm so glad to see you.
- You look good.

99
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,607
I'm all right.

100
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:19,235
- How's your leg?
- How about you? You are all right?

101
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:20,737
I'm fine, Mama. I'm fine.

102
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:28,995
Your Uncle John passed
by to visit me.

103
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:31,497
- Oh, really? When?
- Last month.

104
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:38,421
- Too tight?
- No.

105
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,509
You have to stay off it. You can't go up and
down the stairs. You have to give it a rest.

106
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,094
Okay.

107
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:59,025
I could take you somewhere where
you'd be safe. You wouldn't be alone.

108
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:02,987
There would be people around. You wouldn't
be sitting here listening to a radio.

109
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,993
You understand me?

110
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:13,873
This is my house and I'm
not going no place.

111
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,971
Dimmy, you worry for something?

112
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:31,140
- No, Mama.
- You are not happy?

113
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:33,059
Tell me, what is the matter?

114
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:36,396
Mama, I'm all right.
I'm fine. Really, I am.

115
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,098
Here it comes.

116
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:13,599
There.

117
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,170
- Oh, look at that.
- Do you like it?

118
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:21,023
Aw, isn't that funny? Ha, ha.

119
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:24,861
I better put him over here
to dry, though. He's still wet.

120
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:27,321
Oh, here we go.

121
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:30,032
There, he can dry there.

122
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:32,368
Hey, where'd this come from?

123
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:35,955
- I found it.
- Where?

124
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:38,708
Closet.

125
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:41,252
Huh.

126
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:43,045
You been playing with it?

127
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:45,214
- Yup.
- Do you know how?

128
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:47,216
I'll show you.

129
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:52,889
Wait a minute. You need two.

130
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:56,350
No, you don't.
I do it all the time.

131
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,728
Oh, yeah? Well, let's
both play with it.

132
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:03,065
You really don't want
me to play, huh?

133
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:06,444
No, I do. Captain Howdy said no.

134
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:09,572
- Captain who?
- Captain Howdy.

135
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:11,240
Who's Captain Howdy?

136
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:15,119
You know. I make the questions
and he does the answers.

137
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:18,956
- Oh, Captain Howdy. Yeah, I see.
- He's nice.

138
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,083
Oh, I'll bet he is.

139
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:24,086
- Here, I'll show you.
- All right.

140
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:28,257
Captain Howdy, do you
think my mom's pretty?

141
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:32,220
Captain Howdy?

142
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:34,472
Captain Howdy,
that isn't very nice.

143
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:37,141
- Well, maybe he's sleeping.
- You think?

144
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:42,021
Regan, why are you
reading that stuff?

145
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:43,439
Because I like it.

146
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:46,359
It's not even a good picture
of you. Look at that.

147
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:49,111
- You look so mature.
- I wouldn't talk.

148
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:52,281
You wouldn't talk? Well, I didn't
know they were taking it.

149
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:54,450
I didn't have my makeup man there.

150
00:23:54,684 --> 00:23:57,286
Let me take an eyelash
off your face.

151
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:59,622
Okay. No, I didn't get it.

152
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:02,041
- Mm.
- What are we gonna do on your birthday?

153
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:05,086
Isn't it nice it's on
Sunday this year?

154
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:07,380
No work? What can we do?

155
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:08,589
I don't know.

156
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:10,036
Well, what would you like to do?

157
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:12,093
- Got any ideas?
- Mm-mm.

158
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,928
Hmm?

159
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,931
Let me think. Let me think.
What can we do?

160
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:19,809
Hey, we never finished seeing
all the sights in Washington.

161
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:22,311
Didn't get to Lee Mansion
and lots of stuff.

162
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:25,982
Shall we do that? Go sightseeing?
If it's a nice day?

163
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:28,276
- Yeah, let's do that.
- Okay.

164
00:24:28,593 --> 00:24:33,864
And tomorrow night, I'll
take you to a movie. Okay?

165
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:35,950
Oh, I love you.

166
00:24:36,017 --> 00:24:38,661
I love you, Rags.

167
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:42,373
We'll have a good day, yeah?

168
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:45,459
You can bring Mr. Dennings,
if you like.

169
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:47,253
Mr. Dennings?

170
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,505
Well, you know, it's okay.

171
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:50,965
Well, thank you very much...

172
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:54,135
but why on earth would I wanna
bring Burke on your birthday?

173
00:24:54,202 --> 00:24:55,845
Well, you like him.

174
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:59,974
Yeah, I like him. Don't you like him?
Hey, what's going on? What is this?

175
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:03,644
- You're gonna marry him, aren't you?
- Oh, my God. Are you kidding?

176
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:05,479
- What?
- Me marry Burke Dennings?

177
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:07,773
Don't be silly. Of course not.

178
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,859
Where did you ever get
an idea like that?

179
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:12,028
But you like him.

180
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:16,032
Of course I like him. I like pizzas
too, but I'm not gonna marry one.

181
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:18,451
You don't like him like Daddy?

182
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:21,871
Regan, I love your daddy.

183
00:25:21,938 --> 00:25:24,290
I'll always love your daddy, honey.

184
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:28,044
Okay? Burke just comes around
here a lot, because...

185
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,881
well, he's lonely. He
don't got nothing to do.

186
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:35,134
Well, I heard differently.

187
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:37,637
Oh, you did? What
did you hear, huh?

188
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:40,556
- I don't know. I just thought.
- Come on. What did you hear?

189
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:42,391
Well, you didn't think so good.

190
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,769
- How do you know? Ha, ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.

191
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:47,605
Because Burke and I are
just friends. Okay? Really.

192
00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:48,898
Okay.

193
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:51,317
You ready for sleep?

194
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:56,155
- Good night.
- Good night, honey.

195
00:25:56,472 --> 00:26:00,868
<i>Lord, I was born a ramblin' man</i>

196
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:06,582
<i>Lord, I was born a ramblin' man</i>

197
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:18,803
It's my mother, Tom.

198
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:21,972
She's alone. I never
should have left her.

199
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:26,435
At least in New York, I'd be
near her. I'd be close to her.

200
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:29,271
I could see about a
transfer, Damien.

201
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:35,695
I need reassignment, Tom. I want out
of this job. It's wrong, it's no good.

202
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,947
You're the best we've got.

203
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:40,825
Am I really?

204
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,454
It's more than psychiatry,
and you know that, Tom.

205
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:48,416
Some of their problems
come down to faith...

206
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:52,128
their vocation, the meaning of their
lives, and I can't cut it anymore.

207
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:59,677
I need out. I'm unfit.

208
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:05,808
Think I've lost my faith, Tom.

209
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,312
Hello?

210
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:12,982
Yes, this is Mrs. MacNeil.

211
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,109
Operator, you have
got to be kidding!

212
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:18,237
I have been on this
line for 20 minutes!

213
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:20,698
Jesus Christ. Can you believe this?

214
00:27:20,765 --> 00:27:23,659
He doesn't even call his
daughter on her birthday.

215
00:27:23,726 --> 00:27:26,120
- Maybe the circuit is busy.
- Oh, circuits, my ass!

216
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:27,663
He doesn't give a shit.

217
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:31,292
- Why don't you let me...?
- No, I've got it, Sharon. It's all right.

218
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:34,420
Yes. No, operator, don't
tell me there's no answer.

219
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:36,380
It's the Hotel Excelsior in Rome.

220
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:39,175
Would you try it again,
please, and let it ring?

221
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:41,343
Hello? Yes.

222
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:46,223
No, operator, I've given
you the number four times.

223
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:49,769
Do you take an illiteracy test to
get that job, for Christ's sakes?

224
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,313
Don't tell me to be
calm, goddamn it!

225
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:04,492
Yeah?

226
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:07,787
You're kidding me.

227
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:13,167
Okay. I thought I just went to bed.

228
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:15,836
Yeah.

229
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:18,756
Hey, what are we doing, scene 61?

230
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:22,927
Okay. Oh, just remind Flo
about that blue belt, huh?

231
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:25,054
All right. Yeah, I'll see you.

232
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:40,110
What are you doing here?

233
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:42,655
My bed was shaking.

234
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:44,865
I can't get to sleep.

235
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:47,076
Oh, honey.

236
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:09,617
Goddamn it.

237
00:30:13,187 --> 00:30:14,747
Jesus.

238
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:54,912
There's nothing.

239
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:57,164
Oh, Karl.

240
00:30:57,231 --> 00:31:00,501
Jesus Christ, Karl, don't do that.

241
00:31:00,568 --> 00:31:03,128
Very sorry, but you see, no rats.

242
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:06,006
No rats. Thanks a lot.
That's terrific.

243
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:15,367
Oh, my God.

244
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:36,472
Okay. Unroll your fist.

245
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:38,474
Arm up.

246
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,393
Very good. That wasn't
so bad, was it?

247
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,563
Remain perfectly still.
Breathe normally.

248
00:32:58,018 --> 00:33:00,496
Tell me if you feel a vibration.

249
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:03,457
Regan?

250
00:33:08,237 --> 00:33:09,671
You feel anything?

251
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,674
Can you feel this?

252
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:14,802
I don't feel anything.

253
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:22,810
Put this in your mouth.

254
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:25,354
Keep it there. This
tells your temperature.

255
00:33:25,421 --> 00:33:28,899
When the red light goes on,
that's your temperature.

256
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:31,318
I don't want it.

257
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:07,896
A disorder of the nerves.

258
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:09,523
At least we think it is.

259
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,608
We don't know yet
exactly how it works.

260
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:14,236
It's often seen in
early adolescence.

261
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:15,863
She shows all the symptoms.

262
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:17,906
Hyperactivity.

263
00:34:18,057 --> 00:34:19,658
Her temper.

264
00:34:20,476 --> 00:34:22,077
Performance in math.

265
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:24,496
Yeah. Why the math? What is that?

266
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:26,748
It affects her concentration.

267
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:28,584
Ah-ha.

268
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:32,462
- Now, this is for Ritalin.
- Okay.

269
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:34,882
Ten milligrams a day.

270
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:36,633
Is that a tranquilizer?

271
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,968
It's a stimulant.

272
00:34:38,035 --> 00:34:40,762
A stimulant? My God, she's
higher than a kite now.

273
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:43,724
Her condition isn't
quite what it seems.

274
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:46,768
Nobody knows the cause of
hyperkinetic behavior in a child.

275
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:49,396
The Ritalin seems to work
to relieve the condition.

276
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:51,940
And as to how or why,
we really don't know.

277
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:56,445
But, uh, her symptoms could be
overreaction to depression.

278
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:58,280
That's out of my field.

279
00:34:58,806 --> 00:35:01,033
My daughter isn't depressed.

280
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:06,121
Well, you mentioned her
father and the separation.

281
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:08,957
You think I should take
her to a psychiatrist?

282
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:12,544
No. I think we should wait and see
what happens with the Ritalin.

283
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,796
I think that's the answer.

284
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,591
- Okay.
- Let's wait two, three weeks.

285
00:35:17,658 --> 00:35:21,178
All right. And the lies she's been
telling? That's part of it, huh?

286
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:24,765
- Lies?
- Like saying her bed's shaking. That stuff.

287
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:29,186
Have you ever known
your daughter to swear?

288
00:35:29,253 --> 00:35:32,147
- To use obscenities?
- No, never.

289
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:35,317
Hmm. Interesting.

290
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:40,239
Similar... Similar to
things like her lying...

291
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:44,326
- ...it's uncharacteristic for her.
- I don't understand. She doesn't swear.

292
00:35:45,227 --> 00:35:48,789
Well, she let loose quite a string while
I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.

293
00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:53,168
I find that hard to believe.
What did she say?

294
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:57,839
Her vocabulary is rather extensive.

295
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:00,175
Well, give me an
example. Like what?

296
00:36:00,242 --> 00:36:02,552
Specifically, what did she say?

297
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:04,513
Specifically, Mrs. MacNeil...

298
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:08,850
she advised me to keep my
fingers away from her...

299
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:11,853
goddamn cunt.

300
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:18,652
I can't believe it.

301
00:36:22,014 --> 00:36:24,533
- She...
- You don't think a psychiatrist...?

302
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,537
No. I think the best explanation
is always the simplest.

303
00:36:28,604 --> 00:36:32,291
- Well, we'll wait. We'll wait and see.
- Yeah.

304
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:35,711
So in the meantime...

305
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:37,462
try not to worry.

306
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,215
How?

307
00:36:42,201 --> 00:36:44,636
The edema affected her
brain, you understand?

308
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:46,680
She don't let no
doctor come near her.

309
00:36:46,747 --> 00:36:49,266
She was all the time screaming,
talking to the radio.

310
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:52,019
- You should've called me when it happened.
- Listen.

311
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:54,187
Regular hospital not
gonna put up with that.

312
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:56,273
We give her a shot and
bring her here...

313
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:59,318
until the doctors fix up her leg,
then we take her right out.

314
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:01,903
Two or three months and
she's out, good as new.

315
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:09,828
- Miss?
- Yes?

316
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:11,246
We want to see Mrs. Karras.

317
00:37:11,313 --> 00:37:12,956
- Do you have an appointment?
- Yes.

318
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:16,168
- Are you a relative?
- Yes, I am her brother. He is her son.

319
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:18,045
Just a minute.

320
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:42,152
You know, it's funny.

321
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:45,447
If you wasn't a priest, you'd be
famous psychiatrist on Park Avenue.

322
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:49,076
Your mother, she'd be living in
a penthouse instead of there.

323
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:57,167
You go in, Dimmy.
I'll wait for you outside.

324
00:37:58,819 --> 00:38:02,756
You'll find Mrs. Karras in the
last bed on the left-hand side.

325
00:38:04,574 --> 00:38:06,259
No, no. No, no.

326
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:09,846
Go get someone else.
Don't bother the father.

327
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:11,681
Go to your bed. Go to your bed.

328
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:14,643
No, no. No, no.

329
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:18,397
The father will be back
to see you. It's all right.

330
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:30,325
Mama.

331
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:32,077
It's Dimmy, Mama.

332
00:38:36,148 --> 00:38:37,666
Dimmy.

333
00:38:37,733 --> 00:38:40,419
Why you did this to me, Dimmy?

334
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,212
Why?

335
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:47,509
Come on, I'm gonna take
you out of here, Mama.

336
00:38:47,576 --> 00:38:50,196
I'm gonna take you home. I'll get
you out of here tonight, Mama.

337
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:55,767
Mama, everything's gonna be all right.
Mama, I'm gonna take you home.

338
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:58,937
Mama, I'm gonna take you home.

339
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:04,109
- Couldn't you have put her someplace else?
- Like what? Private hospital?

340
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:07,654
Who got the money for
that, Dimmy? You?

341
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:42,397
There seems to be an alien
pubic hair in my drink.

342
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:47,903
- I beg your pardon?
- Never seen it before in my life. Have you?

343
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:55,118
We're pretty comfortable up there compared
to the Gemini and Mercury programs.

344
00:39:55,185 --> 00:39:56,495
They were tight for space.

345
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:59,915
You see, we got about 210 cubic
feet, so we can move around.

346
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:02,209
If you ever go up there again,
will you take me along?

347
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:04,419
Ha-ha-ha. What for?

348
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:05,879
First missionary on Mars.

349
00:40:05,946 --> 00:40:11,343
Tell me, was it public relations you did
for the Gestapo or community relations?

350
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:14,095
- I'm Swiss.
- Yes, of course.

351
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:18,391
And you never went bowling with
Goebbels, either, I suppose, eh?

352
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:20,769
Nazi bastard.

353
00:40:20,836 --> 00:40:23,146
Over behind the church.
You know where I mean?

354
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:25,732
- It's a red brick wing.
- Saint Mike's.

355
00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:28,860
What goes on there? Who's the
priest I keep seeing there?

356
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:32,822
He's there all the time. He has black hair.
He's very intense looking. Who's that?

357
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:34,115
- Damien Karras.
- Karras?

358
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:39,538
That's his office, back of Saint Mike's.
He's our... Our psychiatric counselor.

359
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:44,125
He had a pretty rough knock last night,
poor guy. His mother passed away.

360
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:46,670
She was living by herself...

361
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:50,590
and I guess she was dead a couple
of days before they found her.

362
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:54,427
Cunting Hun.

363
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:58,473
Bloody, damned,
butchering Nazi pig.

364
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:01,893
Stop it! I'll kill you!

365
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:14,155
What's the matter with you?

366
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:15,991
What's for dessert?

367
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:25,667
You sleeping?

368
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:35,385
You get some sleep.

369
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:43,184
Okay. Very good. All right.

370
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:47,814
Listen, Burke, your car's at the curb.
Louie's waiting. It's nice and warm.

371
00:41:56,056 --> 00:41:58,116
Yes, honey. What?

372
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:00,577
Fuck it.

373
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:11,004
- I've never seen him acting up.
- Really. Blind is what he was.

374
00:42:14,616 --> 00:42:19,387
<i>Down on Thoity-Thoid and Thoid</i>

375
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:22,557
- Hi, Chris. This is a great party.
- Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.

376
00:42:22,624 --> 00:42:26,895
I don't need any encouragement. My idea
of heaven is a solid white nightclub...

377
00:42:26,962 --> 00:42:31,066
with me as a headliner for all
eternity, and they love me.

378
00:42:32,968 --> 00:42:35,403
<i>Down on the east side</i>

379
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,697
<i>Of Thoity-Thoid and Thoid</i>

380
00:42:37,764 --> 00:42:43,745
<i>That's my home sweet home</i>

381
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:49,793
<i>Some people think
It's the home of black eyes</i>

382
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:51,795
<i>Just because...</i>

383
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:54,255
Hey, I think we've got a guest.

384
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:58,093
You're gonna die up there.

385
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:07,435
Regan?

386
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:09,354
Oh, my God, honey.

387
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:11,481
Honey, what's the matter?

388
00:43:11,548 --> 00:43:13,066
- Sorry, she's sick.
- It's okay.

389
00:43:13,133 --> 00:43:16,361
She didn't know what she was
saying. Come upstairs. Come on.

390
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:27,122
What made you say that, Regan?

391
00:43:29,566 --> 00:43:31,501
Do you know, sweetheart?

392
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:38,299
Mother?

393
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:40,635
What's wrong with me?

394
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:52,981
It's just like the doctor said.
It's nerves, and that's all. Okay?

395
00:43:53,048 --> 00:43:55,984
You just take your pills
and you'll be fine. Really.

396
00:43:56,343 --> 00:43:57,694
Okay?

397
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:24,721
Is it coming out, Willi?

398
00:44:24,788 --> 00:44:27,515
- Yes, I think so.
- Good.

399
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:33,104
Mother! Mother!

400
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:36,274
Mother! Mother!

401
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:40,361
Mother! Mother!

402
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:44,073
- Oh, my God!
- Make it stop!

403
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:52,582
- I'm gonna fold.
- Big flop.

404
00:44:52,649 --> 00:44:56,628
Another five for the pair. There's
the ten with two and three of clubs.

405
00:44:56,778 --> 00:45:00,089
And a six. Pair of
threes still best.

406
00:45:01,783 --> 00:45:05,845
- I'll talk to you about it tomorrow.
- Yeah!

407
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:11,100
Yeah.

408
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:16,161
Hey, if you get a chance, can
you take a look at it for me?

409
00:45:17,132 --> 00:45:19,473
Where'd you get the money
for the Chivas Regal...

410
00:45:19,509 --> 00:45:20,860
- ...the poor box?
- Ha.

411
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:23,780
That's an insult.
I got a vow of poverty.

412
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:28,284
Where'd you get it, then?

413
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:29,911
I stole it.

414
00:45:32,147 --> 00:45:33,581
I believe you.

415
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:37,377
College presidents shouldn't drink.
Tends to set a bad example.

416
00:45:37,444 --> 00:45:40,421
I figure I saved him
from a big temptation.

417
00:45:42,157 --> 00:45:43,842
Oh, Christ!

418
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:46,719
I should have been there.
I wasn't there. Should have been.

419
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:48,388
There was nothing you could do.

420
00:45:48,997 --> 00:45:50,598
Lie down.

421
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:53,560
Give me the butt. Come on.

422
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:58,898
- Now you think you can sleep?
- Yeah.

423
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:02,026
- Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
- No.

424
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:05,822
I tell fortunes by reading the creases.
Now, shut up and go to sleep.

425
00:46:17,192 --> 00:46:18,835
Good night.

426
00:46:24,908 --> 00:46:27,385
Stealing is a sin.

427
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:15,433
I don't want it!

428
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:18,186
- Regan, honey, it's to help you.
- I don't want it!

429
00:47:18,253 --> 00:47:20,647
- Hold still, honey.
- I don't want it!

430
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:23,024
You fucking bastard!

431
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:28,321
Remember also, O Lord,
thy servant, Mary Karras...

432
00:47:30,807 --> 00:47:36,287
who has gone before us with the sign of
faith and sleeps the sleep of peace.

433
00:47:37,856 --> 00:47:41,751
Lord, I am not worthy
to receive you.

434
00:47:41,818 --> 00:47:45,672
But only say the word
and I shall be healed.

435
00:47:47,407 --> 00:47:50,468
May the body of Christ bring
me to everlasting life.

436
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:08,152
Well, it's a symptom...

437
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:13,908
of a type of disturbance in the
chemical-electrical activity of the brain.

438
00:48:13,975 --> 00:48:18,079
In your daughter's case, the temporal lobe,
up here in the lateral part of the brain.

439
00:48:18,146 --> 00:48:19,455
- Mm-hm.
- It's rare...

440
00:48:19,522 --> 00:48:21,749
but it does cause bizarre
hallucinations...

441
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:23,918
and usually just
before a convulsion.

442
00:48:23,985 --> 00:48:25,169
A convulsion?

443
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:28,965
The shaking of the bed. That's
doubtless due to muscular spasms.

444
00:48:29,032 --> 00:48:32,385
Oh, no, no, that was no spasm.

445
00:48:32,452 --> 00:48:33,928
Look, I got on the bed.

446
00:48:33,995 --> 00:48:37,765
The whole bed was thumping
and rising off the floor...

447
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:40,727
and shaking, the whole
thing, with me on it.

448
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:43,938
Mrs. MacNeil, the problem with
your daughter is not her bed.

449
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:45,940
It's her brain.

450
00:48:52,013 --> 00:48:54,949
So, um, ahem. What causes this?

451
00:48:55,016 --> 00:48:57,285
Lesion. Lesion in
the temporal lobe.

452
00:48:57,352 --> 00:48:59,412
It's a kind of seizure disorder.

453
00:48:59,479 --> 00:49:03,916
Look, Doc, I really don't understand how
her whole personality could change.

454
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:06,794
- In the temporal lobe, it's very common.
- It is?

455
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:10,339
It, uh, can last for
days, even weeks.

456
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:13,801
It isn't rare to
find destructive...

457
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:15,970
even criminal behavior.

458
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:20,433
Hey, do me a favor, will you?
Tell me something good.

459
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:24,854
Don't be alarmed. If it's a lesion,
in a way, she's fortunate.

460
00:49:24,921 --> 00:49:27,607
All we have to do
is remove the scar.

461
00:49:42,105 --> 00:49:46,042
- Let's move her.
- Regan, can you sit up, scoot over?

462
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:53,382
A little more.

463
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:55,510
Good.

464
00:49:59,414 --> 00:50:02,391
Regan, I'm just gonna move
you down on the table, okay?

465
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:04,352
Let me do this.

466
00:50:04,419 --> 00:50:06,354
It's okay.

467
00:50:07,255 --> 00:50:10,817
See? There we go.

468
00:50:14,554 --> 00:50:17,532
It's just for a short time.

469
00:50:29,569 --> 00:50:31,212
You're doing fine.

470
00:50:31,279 --> 00:50:32,421
Very sticky.

471
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:37,176
Good. Now, Regan, you're gonna feel
something a little bit cold and wet.

472
00:50:47,837 --> 00:50:52,150
Okay. Now you're gonna feel a
little stick here. Don't move.

473
00:50:56,304 --> 00:50:57,530
Good.

474
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:05,913
Okay. You're gonna feel some
pressure here. Now, don't move.

475
00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:04,972
Hook up.

476
00:52:37,572 --> 00:52:39,340
There's nothing there.

477
00:52:39,407 --> 00:52:41,968
No vascular displacement at all.

478
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:44,387
Do you want me to
run another series?

479
00:52:44,453 --> 00:52:45,680
I don't think so.

480
00:52:45,746 --> 00:52:47,431
I'd like you to see her again.

481
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:50,851
Excuse me, doctor. Chris
MacNeil is on the phone.

482
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:52,603
She says it's urgent.

483
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:55,273
- You got some time?
- Of course.

484
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:02,238
- Dr. Klein?
- Yes, I'm Dr. Klein.

485
00:53:02,305 --> 00:53:04,031
- This is Dr. Taney.
- How do you do?

486
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:06,701
Things have gotten worse since
I phoned. Come upstairs.

487
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:09,328
- Is she having spasms again?
- They've gotten violent.

488
00:53:09,395 --> 00:53:11,497
- Did you give her the medication?
- Yes.

489
00:53:11,564 --> 00:53:14,208
- What was that?
- Thorazine.

490
00:53:14,275 --> 00:53:16,252
Before that, it was Ritalin.

491
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:21,215
Chris, doctors.

492
00:53:21,282 --> 00:53:23,467
- This is Dr. Taney.
- Mother, please!

493
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:25,386
- What is it?
- Please, make it stop!

494
00:53:25,453 --> 00:53:27,847
It's burning! It's burning!

495
00:53:27,914 --> 00:53:30,141
Do something, doctor.
Please, help her.

496
00:53:30,208 --> 00:53:35,563
Please, Mother, make it stop!
He's trying to kill me!

497
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:38,232
Mother! Mother!

498
00:53:42,637 --> 00:53:44,905
All right, Regan, let's
see what the trouble...

499
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:46,073
Regan!

500
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,492
Keep away! The sow is mine!

501
00:53:49,268 --> 00:53:53,497
Fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me!

502
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:06,093
Stay away from me! Stay away!

503
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:09,722
Hold her steady. Hold her tight!

504
00:54:09,789 --> 00:54:11,599
Don't let them!

505
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:37,291
She's heavily sedated.

506
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:40,461
She'll probably sleep
through tomorrow.

507
00:54:42,154 --> 00:54:45,925
What was going on in there? How
could she fly off the bed like that?

508
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:51,847
Pathological states can
induce abnormal strength...

509
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:54,683
accelerated motor performance.

510
00:54:55,084 --> 00:54:57,144
For example...

511
00:54:57,295 --> 00:55:01,482
say a 90-pound woman sees her child
pinned under the wheel of a truck...

512
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:05,277
runs out and lifts the wheels a
half a foot up off the ground.

513
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:07,905
You've heard the story.
Same thing here.

514
00:55:09,432 --> 00:55:11,659
Same principle, I mean.

515
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:16,122
So, what's wrong with her?

516
00:55:17,565 --> 00:55:19,500
We still think that
the temporal lobe...

517
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:22,711
Oh, what are you talking
about, for Christ's sakes?

518
00:55:22,778 --> 00:55:24,922
Did you see her or not?

519
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:27,299
She's acting like she's
fucking out of her mind!

520
00:55:27,366 --> 00:55:31,846
Psychotic, like a split
personality, or...

521
00:55:33,748 --> 00:55:35,766
Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry.

522
00:55:36,042 --> 00:55:38,561
There haven't been more
than 100 authentic cases...

523
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:42,314
of so-called "split
personality," Mrs. MacNeil.

524
00:55:43,132 --> 00:55:47,862
Now, I know the temptation
is to leap to psychiatry...

525
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:52,700
but any reasonable psychiatrist would
exhaust the somatic possibilities first.

526
00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:57,621
So, what's next?

527
00:55:57,938 --> 00:56:02,209
A pneumoencephalogram, I would
think, to pin down that lesion.

528
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:04,295
It will involve another spinal.

529
00:56:04,362 --> 00:56:05,796
Oh, Christ!

530
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:09,425
Well, what we missed in the
EEG and the arteriograms...

531
00:56:09,492 --> 00:56:12,178
could conceivably turn up there.

532
00:56:12,912 --> 00:56:17,183
At least it would eliminate
certain other possibilities.

533
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:33,240
Dr. Taney says the
x-rays are negative.

534
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:36,410
In other words, normal.

535
00:56:43,526 --> 00:56:45,169
You keep any drugs in your house?

536
00:56:45,236 --> 00:56:48,756
No, of course not.
Nothing like that.

537
00:56:48,823 --> 00:56:50,174
Are you sure?

538
00:56:50,241 --> 00:56:52,593
Well, of course, I'm sure.

539
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:54,261
I'd tell you.

540
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:56,514
Christ, I don't even smoke grass.

541
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:03,938
Are you planning to be home soon?

542
00:57:04,004 --> 00:57:06,190
I mean, uh, to L.A., I mean.

543
00:57:06,507 --> 00:57:08,400
Um...

544
00:57:09,176 --> 00:57:10,778
No, I, uh...

545
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:14,406
I'm building a new house.

546
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:17,201
My old one has been sold.

547
00:57:18,269 --> 00:57:20,120
I don't know.

548
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:24,416
I was gonna take...

549
00:57:26,861 --> 00:57:31,590
I was gonna take Regan to Europe
for a while after she finished school.

550
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,469
Why do you ask?

551
00:57:38,831 --> 00:57:42,184
I think it's time we started
looking for a psychiatrist.

552
00:58:11,155 --> 00:58:12,798
Hello?

553
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:28,814
Sharon?

554
00:59:05,209 --> 00:59:06,560
Shit.

555
00:59:18,597 --> 00:59:19,907
God.

556
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:28,832
Sharon!

557
00:59:32,111 --> 00:59:34,254
What do you mean, leaving
Regan by herself?

558
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:37,349
Her window's wide open.
The room is freezing.

559
00:59:37,408 --> 00:59:39,134
- Didn't he tell you?
- Who?

560
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:41,303
- Burke is...
- What's Burke got to do with it?

561
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:43,889
Nobody was here. When I went
to get the Thorazine...

562
00:59:43,956 --> 00:59:46,433
- ...I had him stay with her, and...
- Oh.

563
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:49,269
- I should have known better. Sorry.
- I guess you should have.

564
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:50,771
How were the tests?

565
00:59:50,838 --> 00:59:53,273
We have to start
looking for a shrink.

566
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:55,067
Hi, Chuck. Come on in.

567
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:57,611
I suppose you heard.

568
00:59:58,012 --> 00:59:59,446
Heard what?

569
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:03,450
You haven't heard.

570
01:00:05,603 --> 01:00:06,745
Burke's dead.

571
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:13,711
He must have been drunk. He fell from
the top of the steps right outside.

572
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:16,463
By the time he hit M Street,
he broke his neck.

573
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:19,133
Oh, God.

574
01:00:20,534 --> 01:00:21,885
No!

575
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:29,518
Yeah, I know.

576
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:47,661
Sharon...

577
01:00:47,728 --> 01:00:48,996
Oh, my God.

578
01:00:52,483 --> 01:00:54,793
Oh, my God.

579
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:06,180
When I touch your
forehead, open your eyes.

580
01:01:13,212 --> 01:01:15,272
Are you comfortable, Regan?

581
01:01:17,925 --> 01:01:19,234
Yes.

582
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:22,362
How old are you?

583
01:01:22,513 --> 01:01:23,906
Twelve.

584
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:28,076
Is there someone inside you?

585
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,162
Sometimes.

586
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:32,956
Who is it?

587
01:01:33,899 --> 01:01:35,375
I don't know.

588
01:01:36,151 --> 01:01:38,295
Is it Captain Howdy?

589
01:01:38,362 --> 01:01:39,797
I don't know.

590
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:43,967
If I ask him to tell me,
will you let him answer?

591
01:01:44,952 --> 01:01:46,428
No.

592
01:01:47,162 --> 01:01:48,388
Why not?

593
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:50,933
I'm afraid.

594
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:53,685
If he talks to me,
I think he'll leave you.

595
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:55,687
Do you want him to leave you?

596
01:01:56,338 --> 01:01:57,523
Yes.

597
01:02:06,265 --> 01:02:09,827
I'm speaking to the person
inside of Regan now.

598
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:15,207
If you are there, you, too, are hypnotized
and must answer all my questions.

599
01:02:16,734 --> 01:02:18,418
Come forward...

600
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,548
and answer me now.

601
01:02:31,999 --> 01:02:34,518
Are you the person inside of Regan?

602
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:40,232
Who are you?

603
01:02:49,641 --> 01:02:51,326
- Help me!
- Let go!

604
01:03:37,856 --> 01:03:39,833
Father Karras?

605
01:03:42,945 --> 01:03:44,588
Have we met?

606
01:03:45,656 --> 01:03:49,509
No, we haven't met,
but they said I could tell.

607
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:52,179
That you look like a boxer.

608
01:03:52,788 --> 01:03:55,599
William F. Kinderman. Homicide.

609
01:03:56,083 --> 01:03:57,768
What's this all about?

610
01:03:57,835 --> 01:04:01,146
It's true. You do
look like a boxer.

611
01:04:01,296 --> 01:04:04,441
Like John Garfield
in <i>Body and Soul.</i>

612
01:04:04,508 --> 01:04:07,319
Exactly. John Garfield.
People tell you that, Father?

613
01:04:09,221 --> 01:04:11,365
Do people tell you you
look like Paul Newman?

614
01:04:11,431 --> 01:04:12,991
Always.

615
01:04:19,481 --> 01:04:22,960
Well, you know this director
who was doing the film here...

616
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:24,628
Burke Dennings?

617
01:04:24,695 --> 01:04:26,296
I've seen him.

618
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:27,965
You've seen him.

619
01:04:28,699 --> 01:04:32,344
You're also familiar
how last week he died?

620
01:04:32,411 --> 01:04:34,221
Only what I read in the papers.

621
01:04:34,288 --> 01:04:39,059
Father, what do you know on
the subject of witchcraft?

622
01:04:39,501 --> 01:04:42,562
From the Witching
end, not the hunting.

623
01:04:42,629 --> 01:04:44,564
I once did a paper on it.

624
01:04:44,631 --> 01:04:45,941
Really?

625
01:04:46,008 --> 01:04:48,193
From the psychiatric end.

626
01:04:48,886 --> 01:04:50,862
I know. I read it.

627
01:04:52,306 --> 01:04:55,200
All of this desecration
in the church...

628
01:04:55,267 --> 01:04:58,704
do you think this has anything
to do with witchcraft?

629
01:04:59,313 --> 01:05:02,416
Maybe. Some rituals used
in the black mass, maybe.

630
01:05:02,482 --> 01:05:07,087
And now Dennings.
You read how he died?

631
01:05:07,154 --> 01:05:08,588
In a fall.

632
01:05:11,742 --> 01:05:16,596
Let me tell you how.
And please, Father...

633
01:05:16,997 --> 01:05:18,807
confidential.

634
01:05:20,208 --> 01:05:22,519
Burke Dennings, good Father...

635
01:05:22,586 --> 01:05:25,605
was found at the bottom of those
steps leading to M Street...

636
01:05:25,672 --> 01:05:28,692
with his head turned
completely around...

637
01:05:28,759 --> 01:05:30,819
facing backwards.

638
01:05:36,350 --> 01:05:37,617
Didn't happen in the fall?

639
01:05:38,185 --> 01:05:39,870
It's possible.

640
01:05:41,563 --> 01:05:44,624
- Possible, however...
- Unlikely.

641
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:46,251
Exactly.

642
01:05:47,569 --> 01:05:51,798
So on the one hand, we've got a
witchcraft kind of murder...

643
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:57,429
and on the other hand, a black
mass-type desecration in the church.

644
01:05:57,496 --> 01:06:00,807
You think the killer and the
desecrator are the same?

645
01:06:02,209 --> 01:06:03,852
Maybe somebody crazy...

646
01:06:03,919 --> 01:06:07,022
somebody with a spite
against the Church.

647
01:06:07,089 --> 01:06:09,983
Some unconscious rebellion.

648
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:11,511
A sick priest, is that it?

649
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:16,323
Look, Father, this is hard for you.
Please, I understand...

650
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:19,868
but for priests on the campus
here, you're the psychiatrist.

651
01:06:19,935 --> 01:06:22,454
You'd know who was sick
at the time, who wasn't.

652
01:06:22,521 --> 01:06:25,415
I mean, this kind of
sickness, you'd know that.

653
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:28,460
I don't know anyone who
fits that description.

654
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:31,505
Ah.

655
01:06:33,073 --> 01:06:35,759
Doctor's ethics. If you knew,
you wouldn't tell, huh?

656
01:06:35,826 --> 01:06:37,094
No, I probably wouldn't.

657
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:40,639
Not to bother you with
trivia, but a psychiatrist...

658
01:06:40,706 --> 01:06:43,642
in sunny California, no less...

659
01:06:43,709 --> 01:06:48,271
was put in jail for not telling the
police what he knew about a patient.

660
01:06:48,839 --> 01:06:53,235
- Is that a threat?
- No, I mention it only in passing.

661
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:56,947
Incidentally, I mention
it only in passing...

662
01:06:57,014 --> 01:07:00,200
I could always tell the judge
it was a matter of confession.

663
01:07:03,937 --> 01:07:06,289
Hey, Father, wait a minute.

664
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:08,375
- Do you like movies?
- Very much.

665
01:07:08,442 --> 01:07:11,586
Well, I get passes to
the best shows in town.

666
01:07:11,653 --> 01:07:15,715
Mrs. K, though, you know, she
gets tired, never likes to go.

667
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:18,009
- That's too bad.
- Yeah, I hate to go alone.

668
01:07:18,076 --> 01:07:20,679
I love to talk film...

669
01:07:20,746 --> 01:07:24,266
discuss, to critique.

670
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:29,604
You want to see a film with me? I got
passes to the Crest. It's Othello.

671
01:07:29,671 --> 01:07:31,606
- Who's in it?
- Who's in it?

672
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:35,735
Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and
Othello, Groucho Marx. You happy?

673
01:07:35,802 --> 01:07:37,904
- I've seen it.
- Ah.

674
01:07:38,138 --> 01:07:41,950
One last time. You can think of
some priest who fits the bill?

675
01:07:42,017 --> 01:07:46,413
- Come on.
- No, answer the question, Father Paranoia.

676
01:07:47,481 --> 01:07:50,250
All right. All right.

677
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:53,753
- You know who I think really did it?
- Who?

678
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:55,755
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.

679
01:07:56,406 --> 01:07:59,009
I could have you
deported, you know that?

680
01:08:01,036 --> 01:08:02,345
I lied.

681
01:08:03,663 --> 01:08:05,599
You look like Sal Mineo.

682
01:08:09,836 --> 01:08:13,356
It looks like a type of disorder that's,
uh, rarely ever seen anymore...

683
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:15,609
except in primitive cultures.

684
01:08:15,884 --> 01:08:20,113
We call it, uh,
somnambular-form possession.

685
01:08:20,639 --> 01:08:23,450
Quite frankly, we really don't
know much about it at all...

686
01:08:23,517 --> 01:08:27,954
except that it starts with
a conflict or a guilt...

687
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:31,917
and it leads to the patient's delusions
that his body has been invaded...

688
01:08:31,983 --> 01:08:35,921
by some alien intelligence. Um...

689
01:08:35,987 --> 01:08:37,255
A spirit, if you will.

690
01:08:37,322 --> 01:08:40,926
Look, I'm telling you again,
and you'd better believe me...

691
01:08:40,992 --> 01:08:43,929
I am not going to lock her
up in some goddamn asylum.

692
01:08:43,995 --> 01:08:46,765
- Well, it's out of...
- And I don't care what you call it.

693
01:08:46,832 --> 01:08:48,642
I'm not putting her away.

694
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:50,310
Well, I'm sorry.

695
01:08:50,377 --> 01:08:52,312
You're sorry? Jesus Christ!

696
01:08:52,379 --> 01:08:57,192
Eighty-eight doctors, and all you can
tell me with all your bullshit is...

697
01:09:13,942 --> 01:09:18,838
Of course, there is one
outside chance for a cure.

698
01:09:19,531 --> 01:09:25,470
But, um, I think of it
as a shock treatment.

699
01:09:26,371 --> 01:09:28,431
As I said, it's a very
outside chance...

700
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:31,268
Would you just name it,
for God's sakes? What is it?

701
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:33,937
- Do you have any religious beliefs?
- No.

702
01:09:34,004 --> 01:09:36,523
What about your daughter?

703
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:38,483
No. Why?

704
01:09:38,592 --> 01:09:40,360
Have you ever heard of exorcism?

705
01:09:42,721 --> 01:09:45,532
Well, it's a stylized ritual...

706
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:52,289
in which the, uh, rabbi or the priest try
to drive out the so-called invading spirit.

707
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:54,541
It's been pretty much
discarded these days...

708
01:09:54,608 --> 01:09:59,462
except by the Catholics, who keep it in
the closet as a sort of embarrassment.

709
01:09:59,571 --> 01:10:02,716
But it, uh, has worked, in fact...

710
01:10:02,782 --> 01:10:05,802
although not for the reasons
they think, of course.

711
01:10:05,869 --> 01:10:09,723
It's purely force of suggestion.

712
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:14,686
The, uh... The victim's belief in
possession is what helped cause it...

713
01:10:14,753 --> 01:10:16,479
so in that same way...

714
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:19,899
the belief in the power of
exorcism can make it disappear.

715
01:10:22,177 --> 01:10:26,323
You're telling me that I should
take my daughter to a witch doctor.

716
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:28,700
Is that it?

717
01:12:07,324 --> 01:12:09,050
Karl?

718
01:12:10,243 --> 01:12:12,846
Did you put this in
Regan's bedroom?

719
01:12:15,457 --> 01:12:17,517
She's going to be well?

720
01:12:18,626 --> 01:12:23,148
Karl, if you put this in Regan's bedroom,
I want you to tell me. Now, did you?

721
01:12:23,214 --> 01:12:25,984
No, not me.

722
01:12:26,051 --> 01:12:27,193
I didn't.

723
01:12:45,278 --> 01:12:48,715
This was under Regan's pillow.
Did you put it there?

724
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:50,508
Of course, I didn't.

725
01:12:51,993 --> 01:12:53,303
I didn't put it.

726
01:12:54,996 --> 01:12:57,515
- Excuse me, madam.
- What?

727
01:12:58,458 --> 01:13:00,727
- A man to see you.
- What man?

728
01:13:07,217 --> 01:13:09,694
Might your daughter
remember, perhaps...

729
01:13:09,761 --> 01:13:12,864
if Mr. Dennings was in
her room that night?

730
01:13:14,224 --> 01:13:16,242
- Why do you ask?
- Mm.

731
01:13:16,559 --> 01:13:18,495
Might she remember?

732
01:13:20,563 --> 01:13:23,958
No, she was heavily sedated.

733
01:13:24,359 --> 01:13:25,919
It's serious?

734
01:13:26,653 --> 01:13:28,379
Yes, I'm afraid it is.

735
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:32,300
- May I ask...?
- We still don't know.

736
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:34,844
Watch out for drafts.

737
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:40,433
A draft in the fall when the house is
hot is a magic carpet for bacteria.

738
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,393
Excuse me, madam. Anything else?

739
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:44,687
No, Karl, we're fine. Thank you.

740
01:13:45,171 --> 01:13:47,065
It's all right, Karl.

741
01:13:51,177 --> 01:13:52,904
Why are you asking all this?

742
01:13:52,971 --> 01:13:54,447
It's strange.

743
01:13:55,598 --> 01:14:00,119
The deceased comes to visit,
stays only 20 minutes...

744
01:14:00,186 --> 01:14:04,457
and leaves all alone
a very sick girl.

745
01:14:05,817 --> 01:14:07,710
And speaking plainly,
Mrs. MacNeil...

746
01:14:07,777 --> 01:14:13,007
it isn't likely he would
fall from a window.

747
01:14:13,533 --> 01:14:16,553
Besides, a fall wouldn't do
to his neck what we found.

748
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:19,556
Except maybe one
chance in a thousand.

749
01:14:19,998 --> 01:14:22,350
No. My hunch...

750
01:14:22,542 --> 01:14:25,895
My opinion...

751
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:30,066
he was killed by a very
powerful man: point one.

752
01:14:31,301 --> 01:14:33,903
And the fracturing of
his skull: point two...

753
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:36,823
plus the various other
things we mentioned...

754
01:14:37,974 --> 01:14:40,952
would make it very probable...

755
01:14:41,019 --> 01:14:43,913
probable, not certain...

756
01:14:44,439 --> 01:14:50,336
that the deceased was killed and then
pushed from your daughter's window.

757
01:14:50,403 --> 01:14:55,091
But nobody was in the room except
your daughter, so how can this be?

758
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:01,264
It could be one way.

759
01:15:01,539 --> 01:15:04,559
If someone came calling between
the time Miss Spencer left...

760
01:15:04,626 --> 01:15:06,894
and the time you returned.

761
01:15:06,961 --> 01:15:09,564
Judas Priest, just a second.

762
01:15:10,465 --> 01:15:13,651
- The servants? They have visitors?
- Not at all.

763
01:15:13,718 --> 01:15:16,362
You were expecting a package
that day, some delivery?

764
01:15:16,429 --> 01:15:17,739
Not that I know of.

765
01:15:17,805 --> 01:15:20,575
Groceries, cleaning, uh, a package?

766
01:15:20,642 --> 01:15:23,453
I really wouldn't know. See,
Karl takes care of all that.

767
01:15:25,438 --> 01:15:26,831
I see.

768
01:15:26,898 --> 01:15:28,958
Would you like to ask him?

769
01:15:29,734 --> 01:15:32,295
No, never mind, it's...

770
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:35,965
It's very remote.

771
01:15:36,574 --> 01:15:39,218
No, never mind.

772
01:15:39,619 --> 01:15:41,262
Yeah.

773
01:15:49,671 --> 01:15:51,731
Would you like some more coffee?

774
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:54,067
Please.

775
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:30,436
That's cute.

776
01:16:31,588 --> 01:16:33,940
Your daughter, she's the artist?

777
01:16:36,134 --> 01:16:38,277
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

778
01:16:38,845 --> 01:16:40,780
Incidentally, um...

779
01:16:41,723 --> 01:16:43,616
you might ask your daughter...

780
01:16:43,683 --> 01:16:47,120
if she remembers seeing Mr. Dennings
in her room that night.

781
01:16:47,186 --> 01:16:50,623
Look, he wouldn't have any reason
in the world to go up to her room.

782
01:16:50,690 --> 01:16:53,876
Oh, I know, I realize...

783
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:57,547
but if certain British doctors never
asked, "What is this fungus?"...

784
01:16:57,614 --> 01:17:00,925
we wouldn't today have
penicillin. Correct?

785
01:17:01,075 --> 01:17:04,762
Well, when she's
better, I'll ask her.

786
01:17:04,829 --> 01:17:07,557
- Yeah, couldn't hurt.
- Okay.

787
01:17:07,624 --> 01:17:10,143
Uh, in the meantime...

788
01:17:11,544 --> 01:17:12,979
That's okay.

789
01:17:13,046 --> 01:17:17,316
- I really hate to ask you this, but...
- What?

790
01:17:17,717 --> 01:17:21,654
For my daughter, could you
please give an autograph?

791
01:17:21,721 --> 01:17:24,198
Of course. Uh, where's a pencil?

792
01:17:24,265 --> 01:17:26,200
Right here. Here.

793
01:17:26,684 --> 01:17:28,077
Oh.

794
01:17:28,353 --> 01:17:29,662
She'd love it.

795
01:17:31,189 --> 01:17:32,832
And what's her name?

796
01:17:35,276 --> 01:17:37,628
I lied. It's for me.

797
01:17:39,322 --> 01:17:43,468
- The spelling is on the back: Kinderman.
- Okay.

798
01:17:43,785 --> 01:17:47,054
You know that film you made, um, <i>Angel?</i>

799
01:17:47,121 --> 01:17:49,640
- Oh, yeah.
- I saw that six times.

800
01:17:49,707 --> 01:17:52,018
- Really?
- It was beautiful.

801
01:17:52,335 --> 01:17:54,979
Ha, ha. Thank you.

802
01:17:57,548 --> 01:18:00,818
You're a very nice lady.

803
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:05,406
- Thank you.
- You're a nice man.

804
01:18:06,265 --> 01:18:09,577
Uh, I'll come back when
she's feeling better.

805
01:18:13,272 --> 01:18:15,208
- Bye.
- Bye.

806
01:18:35,962 --> 01:18:38,022
Please, no!

807
01:18:38,089 --> 01:18:40,274
- Do it!
- Please, don't!

808
01:18:40,341 --> 01:18:43,820
You bitch! Do it! Do it!

809
01:18:43,886 --> 01:18:45,571
Please, no!

810
01:18:47,974 --> 01:18:51,160
Yes! Let Jesus fuck you!

811
01:18:51,227 --> 01:18:54,247
Let Jesus fuck you!
Let him fuck you!

812
01:18:58,443 --> 01:18:59,585
Aah!

813
01:18:59,652 --> 01:19:02,588
Give it! Give it to me! Aah!

814
01:19:03,197 --> 01:19:06,759
- Ugh!
- Lick me! Lick me!

815
01:19:12,165 --> 01:19:13,349
Chris!

816
01:19:14,876 --> 01:19:18,062
Mrs. MacNeil, open the door!

817
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:26,612
Open the door!

818
01:19:26,679 --> 01:19:29,240
Do you know what she did...

819
01:19:29,307 --> 01:19:31,450
your cunting daughter?

820
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:53,097
Chris MacNeil?

821
01:19:53,331 --> 01:19:54,473
Please, go away.

822
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:56,726
I'm Father Karras.

823
01:19:58,544 --> 01:20:00,521
I'm very sorry. Hello.

824
01:20:00,588 --> 01:20:03,024
I should have told you
I wouldn't be in uniform.

825
01:20:03,090 --> 01:20:04,775
Yeah, that would have helped.

826
01:20:04,842 --> 01:20:07,320
- Have you got a cigarette, Father?
- Sure.

827
01:20:11,224 --> 01:20:12,491
Thanks.

828
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:26,005
Cold.

829
01:20:26,072 --> 01:20:27,340
Yeah.

830
01:20:29,116 --> 01:20:30,676
Uh...

831
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:34,305
How did a shrink ever
get to be a priest?

832
01:20:34,372 --> 01:20:37,433
It's the other way around. The Society
sent me through medical school.

833
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:38,726
Oh.

834
01:20:38,793 --> 01:20:40,227
Where?

835
01:20:41,045 --> 01:20:44,649
Harvard, Bellevue, Johns Hopkins.

836
01:20:44,715 --> 01:20:47,193
- Places like that.
- I see.

837
01:20:48,970 --> 01:20:52,031
- You're a friend of Father Dyer's, right?
- Yes, I am.

838
01:20:52,098 --> 01:20:54,575
- Pretty close?
- Pretty close.

839
01:20:54,642 --> 01:20:56,619
Did he talk to you about my party?

840
01:20:56,686 --> 01:20:58,371
He sure did.

841
01:20:58,813 --> 01:21:00,456
About my daughter?

842
01:21:00,523 --> 01:21:02,416
No, I didn't know you had one.

843
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:07,254
- He didn't mention her?
- No.

844
01:21:07,321 --> 01:21:09,048
Oh.

845
01:21:09,407 --> 01:21:11,717
Didn't tell you what she did?

846
01:21:11,784 --> 01:21:13,761
He didn't mention her.

847
01:21:15,288 --> 01:21:17,807
Priests are pretty
tight-mouthed, then, huh?

848
01:21:17,874 --> 01:21:19,976
That depends.

849
01:21:20,167 --> 01:21:22,269
- On what?
- The priest.

850
01:21:22,962 --> 01:21:24,522
Sure.

851
01:21:25,923 --> 01:21:29,652
I mean, what if a person,
uh, came to you...

852
01:21:29,719 --> 01:21:33,072
you know, that was a murderer
or criminal of some kind...

853
01:21:33,139 --> 01:21:36,492
and they wanted some kind of help?

854
01:21:36,559 --> 01:21:38,661
I mean, would you
have to turn him in?

855
01:21:38,728 --> 01:21:41,872
Well, if he came to me for
spiritual advice, I'd say no.

856
01:21:41,939 --> 01:21:44,000
- You wouldn't?
- No, I wouldn't.

857
01:21:44,442 --> 01:21:46,627
But I would try to convince
him to turn himself in.

858
01:21:46,694 --> 01:21:48,254
Mm-hm.

859
01:21:48,529 --> 01:21:52,717
And, uh, how do you go
about getting an exorcism?

860
01:21:56,871 --> 01:21:58,472
I beg your pardon?

861
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:07,481
If, um... If a person's, you know,
possessed by a demon, or something...

862
01:22:07,548 --> 01:22:10,067
how do they get an exorcism?

863
01:22:10,676 --> 01:22:14,739
I'd have to get them into a time machine
and get them back to the 16th century.

864
01:22:14,805 --> 01:22:16,574
I didn't get you.

865
01:22:16,641 --> 01:22:18,951
It just doesn't happen
anymore, Mrs. MacNeil.

866
01:22:19,018 --> 01:22:20,828
Oh, yeah? Since when?

867
01:22:22,021 --> 01:22:26,083
Well, since we learned about mental
illness, paranoia, schizophrenia.

868
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:28,210
All those things they
taught me at Harvard.

869
01:22:28,277 --> 01:22:31,047
Mrs. MacNeil, since the day
I joined the Jesuits...

870
01:22:31,113 --> 01:22:34,967
I've never met one priest who has
performed an exorcism. Not one.

871
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:38,262
Yeah, well...

872
01:22:40,623 --> 01:22:44,518
it just so happens that
somebody very close to me...

873
01:22:44,877 --> 01:22:46,645
is probably possessed.

874
01:22:47,546 --> 01:22:49,356
And needs an exorcist.

875
01:22:49,715 --> 01:22:52,651
Father Karras, it's my little girl.

876
01:22:54,095 --> 01:22:56,447
Then that's all the more reason
to forget about exorcism.

877
01:22:56,514 --> 01:22:57,865
Why? I don't understand.

878
01:22:57,932 --> 01:23:00,743
- To begin with, it could make things worse.
- Oh, how?

879
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:03,162
Secondly, the Church, before
it approves an exorcism...

880
01:23:03,229 --> 01:23:06,540
conducts an investigation to see if
it's warranted. That takes time.

881
01:23:06,607 --> 01:23:08,308
- Yeah, but...
- Meanwhile, your daughter...

882
01:23:08,317 --> 01:23:11,128
- You could do it yourself.
- No. I'd need Church approval...

883
01:23:11,195 --> 01:23:14,131
- ...and that's rarely given.
- But... Uh...

884
01:23:16,075 --> 01:23:17,760
- Could you see her?
- Yes, I could.

885
01:23:17,827 --> 01:23:19,647
I could see her as a
psychiatrist, but I...

886
01:23:19,704 --> 01:23:22,139
Oh, not a psychiatrist.
She needs a priest.

887
01:23:22,206 --> 01:23:25,976
She's seen every fucking psychiatrist
in the world, and they sent me to you.

888
01:23:26,043 --> 01:23:27,895
Now are you gonna
send me back to them?

889
01:23:27,962 --> 01:23:30,940
- Jesus Christ, won't somebody help me?
- You don't understand...

890
01:23:31,007 --> 01:23:34,193
Oh, God, can't you help her?
Just help her!

891
01:24:05,124 --> 01:24:06,976
It wants no straps.

892
01:24:22,516 --> 01:24:23,951
Hello, Regan.

893
01:24:27,438 --> 01:24:30,374
I'm a friend of your mother's.
I'd like to help you.

894
01:24:30,983 --> 01:24:33,460
You might loosen
these straps, then.

895
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:36,755
I'm afraid you might
hurt yourself, Regan.

896
01:24:37,364 --> 01:24:39,592
I'm not Regan.

897
01:24:40,326 --> 01:24:41,719
I see.

898
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:49,560
Well, then, let's introduce
ourselves. I'm Damien Karras.

899
01:24:49,668 --> 01:24:51,353
And I'm the devil.

900
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:53,439
Now, kindly undo these straps.

901
01:24:54,006 --> 01:24:56,692
If you're the devil, why not
make the straps disappear?

902
01:24:56,759 --> 01:25:00,029
That's much too vulgar a
display of power, Karras.

903
01:25:01,388 --> 01:25:02,823
Where's Regan?

904
01:25:03,015 --> 01:25:04,950
In here, with us.

905
01:25:07,061 --> 01:25:09,413
Show me Regan and I'll
loosen one of the straps.

906
01:25:10,231 --> 01:25:13,209
Could you help an old
altar boy, Father?

907
01:25:14,068 --> 01:25:16,545
Your mother's in here
with us, Karras.

908
01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:18,797
Would you like to leave a message?

909
01:25:18,864 --> 01:25:21,217
I'll see that she gets it.

910
01:25:26,497 --> 01:25:28,140
If that's true...

911
01:25:30,584 --> 01:25:33,562
then you must know my
mother's maiden name.

912
01:25:35,047 --> 01:25:36,398
What is it?

913
01:25:44,348 --> 01:25:45,491
What is it?

914
01:26:39,945 --> 01:26:41,547
Thank you.

915
01:26:43,949 --> 01:26:48,887
Look, I'm only against the possibility of
doing your daughter more harm than good.

916
01:26:49,205 --> 01:26:52,391
Nothing you could do
could make it any worse.

917
01:26:52,833 --> 01:26:54,601
I can't do it.

918
01:26:55,127 --> 01:26:57,354
I need evidence that the
Church would accept...

919
01:26:57,421 --> 01:26:59,398
- ...as signs of possession.
- Like what?

920
01:26:59,465 --> 01:27:01,984
Speaking in a language she's
never known or studied.

921
01:27:02,051 --> 01:27:03,485
What else?

922
01:27:04,637 --> 01:27:08,073
I don't know.
I'd have to look it up.

923
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:10,617
I thought you were
supposed to be an expert.

924
01:27:11,393 --> 01:27:13,412
There are no experts.

925
01:27:14,146 --> 01:27:17,708
You probably know as much about
possession as most priests.

926
01:27:18,192 --> 01:27:20,586
Look, your daughter doesn't
say she's a demon.

927
01:27:20,653 --> 01:27:23,130
She says she's the devil himself.

928
01:27:23,197 --> 01:27:25,424
If you've seen as many
psychotics as I have...

929
01:27:25,491 --> 01:27:29,261
you'd realize that's the same thing
as saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte.

930
01:27:30,371 --> 01:27:35,059
You asked me what I think
is best for your daughter.

931
01:27:35,834 --> 01:27:41,690
Six months under observation in
the best hospital you can find.

932
01:27:44,218 --> 01:27:46,403
You show me Regan's double...

933
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:50,657
same face, same
voice, everything...

934
01:27:50,724 --> 01:27:52,868
and I'd know it wasn't Regan.

935
01:27:53,686 --> 01:27:55,371
I'd know in my gut.

936
01:27:56,689 --> 01:28:00,376
I'm telling you that that thing
upstairs isn't my daughter.

937
01:28:00,985 --> 01:28:03,504
I want you to tell me that
you know for a fact...

938
01:28:03,570 --> 01:28:06,757
that there's nothing wrong with
my daughter except in her mind.

939
01:28:06,824 --> 01:28:09,968
Tell me you know for a fact that
an exorcism wouldn't do any good.

940
01:28:10,035 --> 01:28:12,096
You tell me that!

941
01:28:23,549 --> 01:28:26,527
Did Regan know a priest
was coming over?

942
01:28:27,886 --> 01:28:31,115
- No.
- Did you know my mother died recently?

943
01:28:31,724 --> 01:28:34,326
- Yes, I did. I'm very sorry.
- No.

944
01:28:34,893 --> 01:28:36,662
Is Regan aware of it?

945
01:28:37,938 --> 01:28:39,331
Not at all.

946
01:28:40,733 --> 01:28:42,167
Why do you ask?

947
01:28:43,902 --> 01:28:46,004
It's not important. Good night.

948
01:29:12,556 --> 01:29:14,658
<i>Hello?</i>

949
01:29:16,935 --> 01:29:21,331
<i>- Here, take it and just don't...
- Okay. Um.</i>

950
01:29:21,398 --> 01:29:22,958
<i>Hello, Daddy?</i>

951
01:29:23,025 --> 01:29:24,710
<i>This is me.</i>

952
01:29:25,402 --> 01:29:28,630
<i>- What should I say? I don't know.
- Just talk to your daddy.</i>

953
01:29:28,697 --> 01:29:31,133
<i>- Anything you want.
- All right, um...</i>

954
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:36,013
<i>Tell him what you've been doing and
how you're feeling and like that.</i>

955
01:29:37,414 --> 01:29:38,765
<i>Uh...</i>

956
01:29:38,832 --> 01:29:41,393
<i>Well, you see, um...</i>

957
01:29:41,710 --> 01:29:44,897
<i>I mean, I hope you can hear me.
Can you hear me okay?</i>

958
01:29:44,963 --> 01:29:47,298
<i>- Well, uh, let me see.
- He's not gonna answer you.</i>

959
01:29:47,299 --> 01:29:49,485
<i>Uh, ha-ha-ha.</i>

960
01:29:49,551 --> 01:29:51,987
<i>- Go on. Talk to your daddy, honey.
- Um...</i>

961
01:29:52,054 --> 01:29:54,490
<i>I don't know what
to say, though. Um...</i>

962
01:29:54,848 --> 01:29:58,243
<i>Well, let's see. First we... No.</i>

963
01:29:58,519 --> 01:30:01,747
<i>- Wait. I don't know.
- Come on, Regan.</i>

964
01:30:01,814 --> 01:30:03,916
<i>- Tell him about Washington.
- Okay.</i>

965
01:30:03,982 --> 01:30:06,919
<i>See, we're in Washington
now, Daddy, and...</i>

966
01:30:09,113 --> 01:30:12,799
He broke the bread, gave it
to his disciples and said:

967
01:30:15,494 --> 01:30:18,138
"Take this, all of
you, and eat it..."

968
01:30:21,875 --> 01:30:23,268
"...for this is my body."

969
01:30:29,883 --> 01:30:32,903
When the supper was
ended, he took the cup.

970
01:30:33,262 --> 01:30:36,323
Again he gave you
thanks and praise.

971
01:30:36,849 --> 01:30:40,327
He gave the cup to his disciples
and said, "Take this..."

972
01:30:40,561 --> 01:30:43,038
all of you, and drink from it.

973
01:30:46,316 --> 01:30:49,002
This is the cup of my blood.

974
01:30:50,404 --> 01:30:54,591
"The blood of the new and everlasting
covenant, the mystery of faith."

975
01:30:55,784 --> 01:30:58,303
What an excellent day
for an exorcism.

976
01:31:00,372 --> 01:31:01,682
You'd like that?

977
01:31:01,748 --> 01:31:03,767
Intensely.

978
01:31:04,543 --> 01:31:07,020
But wouldn't that drive
you out of Regan?

979
01:31:07,087 --> 01:31:09,439
It would bring us together.

980
01:31:10,716 --> 01:31:12,025
You and Regan?

981
01:31:12,092 --> 01:31:13,902
You and us.

982
01:31:25,063 --> 01:31:29,084
- Did you do that?
- Uh-huh.

983
01:31:33,906 --> 01:31:36,008
- Do it again.
- In time.

984
01:31:36,074 --> 01:31:37,759
No, now.

985
01:31:37,826 --> 01:31:39,678
In time.

986
01:31:40,621 --> 01:31:44,099
Mirabile dictu, don't you agree?

987
01:31:45,501 --> 01:31:46,852
You speak Latin?

988
01:31:57,721 --> 01:32:00,115
How long are you planning
to stay in Regan?

989
01:32:00,557 --> 01:32:03,160
Until she rots and lies
stinking in the earth.

990
01:32:06,188 --> 01:32:07,414
What's that?

991
01:32:07,856 --> 01:32:09,625
Holy water.

992
01:32:10,901 --> 01:32:12,544
You keep it away.

993
01:32:15,781 --> 01:32:17,883
It burns!

994
01:32:17,950 --> 01:32:20,552
Oh, it burns!

995
01:32:43,225 --> 01:32:44,660
Who are you?

996
01:32:56,947 --> 01:33:00,217
You know, I'm, like, in seclusion.

997
01:33:03,829 --> 01:33:06,390
No, I'm just exhausted from work.

998
01:33:08,625 --> 01:33:10,143
Um...

999
01:33:10,502 --> 01:33:12,938
She's... She's all right.

1000
01:33:13,005 --> 01:33:14,981
She's just a little...

1001
01:33:17,676 --> 01:33:19,569
I don't want to talk
about it, okay?

1002
01:33:22,347 --> 01:33:24,241
Um...

1003
01:33:24,433 --> 01:33:28,787
Okay, I'll talk to you. I'll call you
as soon as it's over, all right?

1004
01:33:30,022 --> 01:33:32,499
No, I just... I'm really... I'm
going through something...

1005
01:33:32,566 --> 01:33:34,584
and I just have to, uh...

1006
01:33:35,527 --> 01:33:37,295
No, no. No, no.

1007
01:33:37,446 --> 01:33:39,423
There's nothing.

1008
01:33:40,115 --> 01:33:41,883
Hey, thanks a lot.

1009
01:33:42,534 --> 01:33:44,136
Bye, now.

1010
01:33:58,091 --> 01:34:00,444
- Want a drink?
- Please.

1011
01:34:01,053 --> 01:34:02,487
What do you drink?

1012
01:34:02,554 --> 01:34:04,239
Uh, Scotch.

1013
01:34:05,557 --> 01:34:08,952
- Ice, water.
- Okay.

1014
01:34:14,524 --> 01:34:16,793
No ice. I'll get some
from the kitchen.

1015
01:34:16,902 --> 01:34:18,569
- No, I'll take it straight.
- It's fine.

1016
01:34:18,570 --> 01:34:19,671
No, please, sit.

1017
01:34:19,738 --> 01:34:21,798
- Really? You sure?
- Yeah, sit.

1018
01:34:33,251 --> 01:34:34,978
Where's her father?

1019
01:34:35,045 --> 01:34:36,354
In Europe.

1020
01:34:36,421 --> 01:34:38,356
- Have you told him what's happening?
- No.

1021
01:34:38,423 --> 01:34:40,817
Well, I think you should.

1022
01:34:48,308 --> 01:34:50,332
I told Regan that was holy water.

1023
01:34:50,358 --> 01:34:53,730
I sprinkled it on her and
she reacted very violently.

1024
01:34:55,524 --> 01:34:58,126
- It's tap water.
- What's the difference?

1025
01:34:58,193 --> 01:35:03,048
Holy water's blessed. And that doesn't
help support a case for possession.

1026
01:35:13,417 --> 01:35:16,978
She killed Burke Dennings.

1027
01:35:17,045 --> 01:35:18,355
What?

1028
01:35:21,967 --> 01:35:24,110
She killed Burke Dennings.

1029
01:35:25,637 --> 01:35:28,573
She pushed him out her window.

1030
01:35:42,154 --> 01:35:43,338
Who are you?

1031
01:35:46,408 --> 01:35:48,969
It's a language, all right.
It's English.

1032
01:35:50,328 --> 01:35:51,555
What do you mean?

1033
01:35:51,621 --> 01:35:53,932
It's English in reverse. Listen.

1034
01:35:54,499 --> 01:35:56,351
<i>Give us time.</i>

1035
01:35:56,418 --> 01:35:58,478
<i>Let her die.</i>

1036
01:36:01,339 --> 01:36:04,025
<i>I am no one. I am no one.</i>

1037
01:36:04,092 --> 01:36:05,485
<i>Fear the priest.</i>

1038
01:36:07,387 --> 01:36:09,155
<i>Fear the priest.</i>

1039
01:36:11,767 --> 01:36:13,285
<i>Merrin!</i>

1040
01:36:20,901 --> 01:36:23,128
<i>I am no one.</i>

1041
01:36:25,405 --> 01:36:26,965
<i>Merrin! Fear the priest.</i>

1042
01:36:28,909 --> 01:36:30,802
<i>Merrin!</i>

1043
01:36:31,286 --> 01:36:34,139
<i>Merrin!</i>

1044
01:36:34,623 --> 01:36:36,016
Yeah?

1045
01:36:37,542 --> 01:36:39,019
Yeah?

1046
01:36:40,170 --> 01:36:41,313
I'll be right there.

1047
01:36:59,731 --> 01:37:01,583
I don't want Chris to see this.

1048
01:37:01,650 --> 01:37:04,294
- Well, what's wrong? What is it?
- Shh.

1049
01:38:13,013 --> 01:38:15,448
You're convinced that it's genuine?

1050
01:38:15,891 --> 01:38:17,409
I don't know.

1051
01:38:18,476 --> 01:38:20,870
No, not really, I suppose.

1052
01:38:21,271 --> 01:38:23,415
But I have made...

1053
01:38:23,481 --> 01:38:27,961
a prudent judgment that it meets the
conditions set down in The Ritual.

1054
01:38:28,069 --> 01:38:30,630
You would want to do
the exorcism yourself?

1055
01:38:31,823 --> 01:38:33,174
Yes.

1056
01:38:36,870 --> 01:38:38,972
Might be best to have a
man with experience.

1057
01:38:39,039 --> 01:38:42,434
Maybe someone who's spent
time in foreign missions.

1058
01:38:43,001 --> 01:38:45,061
I understand, Your Excellency.

1059
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:46,771
Let's see who's around.

1060
01:38:46,838 --> 01:38:50,108
In the meantime, I'll call
you as soon as I know.

1061
01:38:50,842 --> 01:38:53,236
Thank you, Your Excellency.

1062
01:38:53,511 --> 01:38:55,697
Well, he does know the background.

1063
01:38:55,764 --> 01:38:59,325
I doubt there's any danger
in just having him assist.

1064
01:38:59,392 --> 01:39:02,203
There should be a
psychiatrist present, anyway.

1065
01:39:02,270 --> 01:39:04,164
What about the exorcist?

1066
01:39:04,356 --> 01:39:05,874
Have you any ideas?

1067
01:39:06,816 --> 01:39:08,960
How about Lankester Merrin?

1068
01:39:09,319 --> 01:39:10,962
Merrin?

1069
01:39:11,154 --> 01:39:12,756
I had a notion he was in Iraq.

1070
01:39:12,822 --> 01:39:15,133
I read he was working
on a dig near Nineveh.

1071
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:16,801
You're right, but he's finished.

1072
01:39:16,868 --> 01:39:20,472
He came back three or four months
ago. He's at Woodstock now.

1073
01:39:20,538 --> 01:39:22,307
What's he doing there, teaching?

1074
01:39:22,374 --> 01:39:25,060
He's working on another book.

1075
01:39:25,126 --> 01:39:29,105
Don't you think he's too old,
Tom? How's his health?

1076
01:39:29,339 --> 01:39:32,984
He must be all right. He's still
running around digging up tombs.

1077
01:39:33,510 --> 01:39:34,694
Mm.

1078
01:39:34,761 --> 01:39:38,406
- Besides, he's had experience.
- I didn't know that.

1079
01:39:38,515 --> 01:39:40,825
Ten, 12 years ago,
I think, in Africa.

1080
01:39:40,892 --> 01:39:44,913
The exorcism supposedly lasted months.
I heard it damn near killed him.

1081
01:39:49,234 --> 01:39:50,710
Father?

1082
01:40:57,385 --> 01:40:59,571
- You're Mrs. MacNeil?
- Yes.

1083
01:40:59,637 --> 01:41:01,114
I'm Father Merrin.

1084
01:41:01,222 --> 01:41:03,616
- Come in.
- Thank you.

1085
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:05,743
- Is Father Karras here?
- Yes.

1086
01:41:05,810 --> 01:41:07,954
- He's here already.
- Father?

1087
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:11,583
- Father Karras.
- It's an honor to meet you, Father.

1088
01:41:17,989 --> 01:41:20,175
- Are you very tired?
- No.

1089
01:41:21,326 --> 01:41:24,429
I'd like you to go quickly across
to the Residence, Damien...

1090
01:41:24,496 --> 01:41:26,431
and gather up a
cassock for myself...

1091
01:41:26,498 --> 01:41:30,560
two surplices, a purple
stole, and some holy water...

1092
01:41:30,627 --> 01:41:32,270
and, um...

1093
01:41:32,504 --> 01:41:35,565
your copy of The Roman
Ritual. The large one.

1094
01:41:35,632 --> 01:41:37,442
I believe we should begin.

1095
01:41:37,842 --> 01:41:40,361
Do you want to hear the
background of the case first?

1096
01:41:40,428 --> 01:41:41,779
Why?

1097
01:41:42,180 --> 01:41:44,449
<i>This is yours to do
with as you please.</i>

1098
01:41:44,516 --> 01:41:48,203
<i>You can choose to escape, if you want,
but you may never be able to return.</i>

1099
01:41:48,269 --> 01:41:50,205
<i>Don't let anyone decide for you.</i>

1100
01:42:03,076 --> 01:42:05,803
Hail Mary, full of grace...

1101
01:42:18,591 --> 01:42:20,818
- Excuse me.
- Thank you.

1102
01:42:22,971 --> 01:42:24,656
Thank you very much.

1103
01:42:24,722 --> 01:42:26,241
You're welcome.

1104
01:42:36,442 --> 01:42:38,836
Would you like some
brandy in that, Father?

1105
01:42:40,780 --> 01:42:43,174
Well, the doctors say I shouldn't.

1106
01:42:43,741 --> 01:42:45,343
But thank God...

1107
01:42:45,410 --> 01:42:47,637
my will is weak.

1108
01:42:56,421 --> 01:43:01,484
<i>Especially important is the warning to
avoid conversations with the demon.</i>

1109
01:43:01,551 --> 01:43:06,030
We may ask what is relevant, but
anything beyond that is dangerous.

1110
01:43:06,097 --> 01:43:08,324
He's a liar. The demon is a liar.

1111
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:10,868
He will lie to confuse us.

1112
01:43:11,895 --> 01:43:16,082
But he will also mix
lies with the truth...

1113
01:43:16,608 --> 01:43:18,042
to attack us.

1114
01:43:19,027 --> 01:43:21,796
<i>The attack is
psychological, Damien.</i>

1115
01:43:22,655 --> 01:43:24,215
<i>And powerful.</i>

1116
01:43:24,949 --> 01:43:26,551
<i>So don't listen.</i>

1117
01:43:26,618 --> 01:43:29,804
<i>Remember that. Do not listen.</i>

1118
01:43:31,414 --> 01:43:33,891
It might be helpful if I gave
you some background...

1119
01:43:33,958 --> 01:43:36,602
on the different personalities
Regan has manifested.

1120
01:43:36,669 --> 01:43:38,646
So far, I'd say there
seem to be three.

1121
01:43:39,088 --> 01:43:41,441
- She's convinced that she's...
- There is only one.

1122
01:44:04,989 --> 01:44:08,468
What is your daughter's
middle name, Mrs. MacNeil?

1123
01:44:08,660 --> 01:44:10,261
Teresa.

1124
01:44:13,206 --> 01:44:15,350
What a lovely name.

1125
01:44:51,244 --> 01:44:53,224
Stick your cock up her ass...

1126
01:44:53,288 --> 01:44:56,140
you motherfucking
worthless cocksucker.

1127
01:44:56,207 --> 01:44:59,060
- Be silent!
- Aah!

1128
01:45:10,221 --> 01:45:12,824
Our Father, who art in heaven...

1129
01:45:14,142 --> 01:45:15,660
hallowed be thy name.

1130
01:45:15,727 --> 01:45:17,537
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done...

1131
01:45:17,645 --> 01:45:19,789
on earth as it is in heaven.

1132
01:45:19,856 --> 01:45:22,500
Give us this day our daily bread.

1133
01:45:22,984 --> 01:45:25,628
Forgive us our trespasses...

1134
01:45:25,695 --> 01:45:28,506
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

1135
01:45:28,573 --> 01:45:30,883
And lead us not into temptation.

1136
01:45:30,950 --> 01:45:32,593
But deliver us from the evil one.

1137
01:45:32,702 --> 01:45:36,514
Save me, O God, by thy name.
By thy might, defend my cause.

1138
01:45:38,249 --> 01:45:43,271
Proud men have risen up against me,
and men of violence seek my life...

1139
01:45:43,338 --> 01:45:47,984
but God is my helper and
the Lord sustains my life.

1140
01:45:48,051 --> 01:45:49,819
In every need, he has delivered me.

1141
01:45:49,886 --> 01:45:52,655
Glory be to the Father, to the
Son and to the Holy Spirit.

1142
01:45:52,722 --> 01:45:55,867
As it was in the beginning, is now
and shall be, world without end.

1143
01:45:55,933 --> 01:45:59,203
- Save your servant.
- Who places her trust in thee, my God.

1144
01:45:59,270 --> 01:46:02,999
- Be unto her, O Lord, a fortified tower.
- In the face of the enemy...

1145
01:46:04,275 --> 01:46:07,837
- Let the enemy have no power over her.
- Son of iniquity be powerless to harm her.

1146
01:46:07,904 --> 01:46:11,841
Your mother sucks cocks in hell,
Karras. You faithless slime.

1147
01:46:11,908 --> 01:46:13,050
The Lord be with you.

1148
01:46:13,117 --> 01:46:15,219
- And also with you.
- Let us pray.

1149
01:46:15,286 --> 01:46:16,721
Holy Lord, almighty Father...

1150
01:46:17,955 --> 01:46:19,098
everlasting God...

1151
01:46:19,165 --> 01:46:21,809
and Father of our
Lord, Jesus Christ...

1152
01:46:21,876 --> 01:46:25,855
who, once and for all, consigned that
fallen tyrant to the flames of hell...

1153
01:46:25,922 --> 01:46:30,568
who sent your only begotten son into the
world to crush that roaring lion...

1154
01:46:31,094 --> 01:46:33,070
hasten to our call for help...

1155
01:46:33,137 --> 01:46:38,117
and snatch from ruination and from
the clutches of the noonday devil...

1156
01:46:38,184 --> 01:46:42,497
this human being, made in
your image and likeness.

1157
01:46:42,563 --> 01:46:47,668
Strike terror, Lord, into the beast
now laying waste to your vineyard.

1158
01:46:47,735 --> 01:46:52,632
Let your mighty hand cast him out of
your servant, Regan Teresa MacNeil...

1159
01:46:53,950 --> 01:46:57,011
so he may no longer hold
captive this person...

1160
01:46:57,120 --> 01:46:59,764
whom it pleased you to
make in your image...

1161
01:46:59,831 --> 01:47:00,932
Aah!

1162
01:47:00,998 --> 01:47:04,810
And to redeem through your son,
who lives and reigns with you...

1163
01:47:04,919 --> 01:47:09,440
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.

1164
01:47:09,841 --> 01:47:11,984
- Amen.
- O Lord, hear my prayer.

1165
01:47:14,804 --> 01:47:16,489
Father Karras.

1166
01:47:18,766 --> 01:47:20,618
Father Karras.

1167
01:47:22,311 --> 01:47:25,957
Damien. The response,
please, Damien!

1168
01:47:26,691 --> 01:47:29,126
And let my cry come unto thee.

1169
01:47:29,193 --> 01:47:33,339
Almighty Lord, word of God
the Father, Jesus Christ...

1170
01:47:33,406 --> 01:47:35,967
God and Lord of all creation...

1171
01:47:37,243 --> 01:47:39,063
Who gave to your holy apostles...

1172
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:42,306
the power to tramp underfoot
serpents and scorpions.

1173
01:47:42,373 --> 01:47:44,392
Grant me...

1174
01:47:44,459 --> 01:47:46,310
your unworthy servant...

1175
01:47:46,377 --> 01:47:48,354
- ...pardon for all my sins...
- Bastards!

1176
01:47:48,421 --> 01:47:53,150
And the power to confront
this cruel demon.

1177
01:48:09,734 --> 01:48:14,213
See the cross of the Lord.
Be gone, you hostile power.

1178
01:48:14,322 --> 01:48:17,341
- O Lord, hear my prayer.
- And let my cry come unto thee.

1179
01:48:17,575 --> 01:48:20,511
- The Lord be with you.
- And also with you.

1180
01:48:50,900 --> 01:48:52,376
Father.

1181
01:49:14,215 --> 01:49:17,568
I cast you out, unclean spirit!

1182
01:49:17,635 --> 01:49:20,863
- Shove it up your ass, you faggot!
- In the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ!

1183
01:49:22,932 --> 01:49:25,201
It is he who commands you!

1184
01:49:25,309 --> 01:49:28,829
He who flung you straight from
heaven to the depths of hell!

1185
01:49:28,938 --> 01:49:30,289
- Fuck him!
- Be gone...

1186
01:49:30,356 --> 01:49:33,417
- Fuck him, Karras!
- ...from this creature of God.

1187
01:49:36,153 --> 01:49:37,463
Be gone!

1188
01:49:37,530 --> 01:49:41,759
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son...

1189
01:49:41,826 --> 01:49:43,761
and the Holy Spirit.

1190
01:49:43,828 --> 01:49:48,391
By this sign of the Holy Cross,
of our Lord Jesus Christ...

1191
01:49:48,457 --> 01:49:52,645
who lives and reigns with the
Father and the Holy Spirit.

1192
01:49:54,255 --> 01:49:55,731
Damien!

1193
01:49:56,299 --> 01:49:57,525
Amen.

1194
01:49:57,633 --> 01:50:00,778
God, defender of the human race...

1195
01:50:02,888 --> 01:50:04,281
look down in pity...

1196
01:50:04,348 --> 01:50:07,451
You killed your mother!
You left her alone to die!

1197
01:50:07,518 --> 01:50:09,745
- Shut up!
- She'll never forgive you!

1198
01:50:09,812 --> 01:50:12,039
- Shut up!
- Bastard!

1199
01:50:13,524 --> 01:50:15,167
I command you...

1200
01:50:15,484 --> 01:50:18,379
by the judge of the
living and the dead...

1201
01:50:18,446 --> 01:50:22,133
to depart from this servant of God.

1202
01:50:24,702 --> 01:50:27,096
It's the power... Holy water.

1203
01:50:31,792 --> 01:50:35,396
It's the power of Christ
that compels you.

1204
01:50:35,755 --> 01:50:38,941
- The power of Christ compels you!
- The power of Christ compels you!

1205
01:50:39,050 --> 01:50:42,319
- The power of Christ compels you!
- The power of Christ compels you!

1206
01:50:42,386 --> 01:50:45,531
- The power of Christ compels you!
- The power of Christ compels you!

1207
01:50:45,598 --> 01:50:48,826
- The power of Christ compels you!
- The power of Christ compels you!

1208
01:50:48,893 --> 01:50:52,329
- The power of Christ compels you!
- The power of Christ compels you!

1209
01:50:52,396 --> 01:50:56,041
- The power of Christ compels you!
- The power of Christ compels you!

1210
01:50:56,108 --> 01:50:59,879
- The power of Christ compels you!
- The power of Christ compels you!

1211
01:51:00,071 --> 01:51:04,175
- The power of Christ compels you!
- The power of Christ compels you!

1212
01:51:04,241 --> 01:51:08,095
- The power of Christ compels you!
- The power of Christ compels you!

1213
01:51:08,412 --> 01:51:11,682
- The power of Christ compels you!
- The power of Christ compels you!

1214
01:51:12,083 --> 01:51:15,770
- The power of Christ compels you!
- The power of Christ compels you!

1215
01:51:15,836 --> 01:51:19,356
- The power of Christ compels you!
- The power of Christ compels you!

1216
01:51:19,423 --> 01:51:22,860
- The power of Christ compels you!
- The power of Christ compels you!

1217
01:51:22,927 --> 01:51:26,405
- The power of Christ compels you.
- The power of Christ compels you.

1218
01:51:26,472 --> 01:51:29,909
He brought you low by his
blood-stained cross!

1219
01:51:29,975 --> 01:51:33,704
Do not despise my command, because
you know me to be a sinner.

1220
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:41,212
It is God himself who commands you.

1221
01:51:44,073 --> 01:51:47,676
The majestic Christ
who commands you.

1222
01:51:48,869 --> 01:51:50,888
God, the Father, commands you.

1223
01:51:54,208 --> 01:51:56,644
God, the Son, commands you.

1224
01:52:00,423 --> 01:52:03,275
God, the Holy Spirit, commands you.

1225
01:52:03,342 --> 01:52:05,611
The mystery of the
cross commands you.

1226
01:52:05,678 --> 01:52:08,614
The blood of the
martyrs commands you.

1227
01:52:28,659 --> 01:52:32,763
Give way to Christ, you
prince of murderers.

1228
01:52:33,956 --> 01:52:37,393
You're guilty before almighty God.

1229
01:52:37,918 --> 01:52:40,521
Guilty before his son.

1230
01:52:40,588 --> 01:52:43,774
Guilty before the whole human race.

1231
01:52:44,008 --> 01:52:46,443
It is the Lord who expels you...

1232
01:52:46,510 --> 01:52:52,199
he who is coming to judge both the living
and the dead and the world, by fire.

1233
01:53:14,121 --> 01:53:15,806
Are you tired?

1234
01:53:23,130 --> 01:53:26,025
Let's rest before we start again.

1235
01:54:01,168 --> 01:54:05,022
Why this girl?
It doesn't make sense.

1236
01:54:13,430 --> 01:54:16,659
I think the point is
to make us despair.

1237
01:54:19,603 --> 01:54:21,872
To see ourselves as...

1238
01:54:23,274 --> 01:54:25,626
animal and ugly.

1239
01:54:28,863 --> 01:54:32,967
To reject the possibility
that God could love us.

1240
01:54:40,416 --> 01:54:42,851
Will you excuse me, Damien?

1241
01:55:34,678 --> 01:55:39,116
<i>Why? Why?</i>

1242
01:55:40,684 --> 01:55:44,747
<i>No. No.</i>

1243
01:56:10,381 --> 01:56:13,859
Dimmy, why you do this to me?

1244
01:56:16,220 --> 01:56:19,782
Please, Dimmy. I'm afraid.

1245
01:56:21,225 --> 01:56:23,410
You're not my mother.

1246
01:56:24,269 --> 01:56:26,580
Dimmy, please!

1247
01:56:39,576 --> 01:56:41,345
What is it?

1248
01:56:46,291 --> 01:56:47,476
Her heart.

1249
01:56:47,918 --> 01:56:49,895
Can you give her something?

1250
01:56:49,962 --> 01:56:51,897
She'll go into a coma.

1251
01:56:55,759 --> 01:56:58,028
You're not my mother!

1252
01:56:58,095 --> 01:56:59,196
Don't listen.

1253
01:56:59,263 --> 01:57:00,989
Why, Dimmy?

1254
01:57:01,849 --> 01:57:03,283
Damien.

1255
01:57:03,350 --> 01:57:04,701
- Dimmy, please.
- Damien.

1256
01:57:09,023 --> 01:57:10,874
Get out.

1257
01:59:04,096 --> 01:59:08,408
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

1258
01:59:23,866 --> 01:59:25,801
Is it over?

1259
01:59:26,243 --> 01:59:27,928
Mm-mm.

1260
01:59:35,752 --> 01:59:37,646
Is she gonna die?

1261
01:59:42,885 --> 01:59:44,361
No.

1262
02:01:02,172 --> 02:01:04,232
You son of a bitch!

1263
02:01:10,097 --> 02:01:12,115
Take me.

1264
02:01:12,182 --> 02:01:13,575
Come into me.

1265
02:01:13,684 --> 02:01:16,787
Goddamn you, take me!

1266
02:01:17,354 --> 02:01:19,081
Take me!

1267
02:01:32,202 --> 02:01:33,762
No!

1268
02:01:43,255 --> 02:01:44,398
Mother.

1269
02:01:47,301 --> 02:01:49,152
Mother.

1270
02:01:54,516 --> 02:01:57,452
Mother.

1271
02:02:00,022 --> 02:02:01,331
Did somebody fall?

1272
02:02:01,398 --> 02:02:02,958
- The steps!
- Help!

1273
02:02:03,025 --> 02:02:04,835
Mother!

1274
02:02:06,611 --> 02:02:07,754
Mother!

1275
02:02:09,489 --> 02:02:10,632
Rags?

1276
02:02:31,928 --> 02:02:34,448
Do you want to make
your confession?

1277
02:02:40,228 --> 02:02:42,372
Are you sorry for...?

1278
02:02:42,439 --> 02:02:47,169
Are you sorry for having offended God
and for all the sins of your past life?

1279
02:03:16,264 --> 02:03:17,782
- Where do you want this?
- What?

1280
02:03:17,849 --> 02:03:19,201
Phonograph.

1281
02:03:19,267 --> 02:03:20,577
Storage.

1282
02:03:29,986 --> 02:03:31,505
That's everything.

1283
02:03:33,490 --> 02:03:35,300
I'm gonna miss you.

1284
02:03:35,367 --> 02:03:36,843
Same here.

1285
02:03:37,285 --> 02:03:39,054
Sure you won't change your mind?

1286
02:03:54,803 --> 02:03:57,447
I found this in her room.

1287
02:04:02,018 --> 02:04:03,954
You better hurry.

1288
02:04:13,613 --> 02:04:15,549
Come on, honey,
we have to get going.

1289
02:04:39,514 --> 02:04:41,408
She doesn't remember any of it.

1290
02:04:41,892 --> 02:04:43,660
That's good.

1291
02:04:47,397 --> 02:04:49,082
- All done.
- Okay.

1292
02:04:49,149 --> 02:04:50,792
Honey, this is Father Dyer.

1293
02:04:50,859 --> 02:04:53,169
- Hi, Father.
- Hello.

1294
02:04:53,945 --> 02:04:55,130
Ready, missus.

1295
02:04:56,990 --> 02:04:58,508
- Goodbye, Father.
- Goodbye.

1296
02:04:58,575 --> 02:05:00,093
I'll call you.

1297
02:05:20,805 --> 02:05:22,490
Bye.

1298
02:05:26,728 --> 02:05:28,580
- Bye, Father.
- I hope I see you again.

1299
02:05:28,647 --> 02:05:30,248
I hope so too.

1300
02:05:30,732 --> 02:05:32,709
Father Dyer?

1301
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:39,883
I thought you'd like to keep this.

1302
02:05:48,917 --> 02:05:50,602
Why don't you keep it?

1303
02:06:55,066 --> 02:06:56,418
Lieutenant.

1304
02:06:57,360 --> 02:06:58,962
You just missed them.

1305
02:07:02,157 --> 02:07:03,758
How's the girl?

1306
02:07:04,576 --> 02:07:06,302
She seemed fine.

1307
02:07:06,911 --> 02:07:08,722
That's important.

1308
02:07:10,707 --> 02:07:12,350
That's important.

1309
02:07:13,376 --> 02:07:15,603
Well, well...

1310
02:07:15,670 --> 02:07:18,148
back to business, back to work.

1311
02:07:18,757 --> 02:07:21,526
- Goodbye, Father.
- Goodbye.

1312
02:07:26,139 --> 02:07:27,490
Father Dyer...

1313
02:07:29,559 --> 02:07:31,453
do you go to films?

1314
02:07:31,519 --> 02:07:32,662
Sure.

1315
02:07:32,854 --> 02:07:36,040
Well, I got passes.

1316
02:07:36,107 --> 02:07:38,543
In fact, I got a pass to
the Crest tomorrow night.

1317
02:07:38,610 --> 02:07:39,836
Would you like to go?

1318
02:07:39,903 --> 02:07:42,756
- What's playing?
<i>- Wuthering Heights.</i>

1319
02:07:42,822 --> 02:07:44,424
Who's in it?

1320
02:07:45,116 --> 02:07:51,306
Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the
role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.

1321
02:07:52,707 --> 02:07:54,350
I've seen it.

1322
02:07:58,630 --> 02:08:00,190
Another one.

1323
02:08:00,924 --> 02:08:03,526
- Had your lunch?
- No.
