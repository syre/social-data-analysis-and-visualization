1
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,820
I'm voting for Dukakis.

2
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,550
Hm...

3
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,510
Well...

4
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,820
Maybe when you have children
who need braces

5
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,230
and half of your husband's pay
cheque goes to the government,

6
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,310
- you'll regret that.
- My husband's pay cheque?

7
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,070
I'm not squeezing
one out till I'm 30.

8
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,630
Will you still be at the Yarn Barn?

9
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,830
That's a great place
to raise children.

10
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:59,470
- That's really funny. - I think
a year of partying's enough.

11
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,430
- She's going to Harvard next fall.
- I haven't gotten in yet.

12
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,590
You think Dukakis will provide for
America till you squeeze one out?

13
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,950
Yeah, I do.

14
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,990
- When can I squeeze one out?
- Eighth grade.

15
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,150
Excuse me.

16
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,350
Donnie, you're such a dick.

17
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,630
Whoa, Elizabeth!
A little hostile there.

18
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,950
Maybe you should be in therapy,

19
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,310
then Mom and Dad can pay someone
to listen to your thoughts

20
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,150
so we don't have to.

21
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,590
Ok. Tell us why
you stopped taking your medication.

22
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,740
You're such a fuck-ass!

23
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,270
- Please.
- Did you just call me a fuck-ass?

24
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,150
- That's enough.
- Go suck a fuck!

25
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,630
- How does one suck a fuck?
- Shall I tell you?

26
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,830
- Please.
- Not at the dinner table.

27
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,030
- Stop.
- Fuck...

28
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,350
What's a fuck-ass?

29
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,830
I took a year off to be with you.

30
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,550
- What?
- How did you know?

31
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,350
- I didn't know it was a big deal.
- It is a big deal.

32
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,870
I'm reading. Get out.

33
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,190
Where do you go at night?

34
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,670
- just get out. - Did you toilet-
paper the Johnsons' house?

35
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,520
- Is that why you're here?
- No.

36
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,390
I stopped rolling houses
in the sixth grade.

37
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,150
Where's my son?
I don't recognise you.

38
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,550
Then you take the goddamn pills.

39
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,870
Bitch.

40
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,110
Our son just called me a bitch.

41
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,110
You're not a bitch.

42
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,710
You're bitchir,
but you're not a bitch.

43
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,310
I want to be a president
who makes sure that we

44
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,260
never again do business with a
drug-running Panamanian dictator

45
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,510
or funnel aid to the Contras
through drug dealers,

46
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,310
Values begin at the top,

47
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,550
Dukakis... Son of a bitch.

48
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,150
Those are the values I want
to bring to the presidency

49
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,270
and to the White House,

50
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,790
- Panama is a friendly country
- Tell him, George.

51
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,390
I talked to the president of Panama
about their money laundering,

52
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,910
Mr Noriega was there,
but there was no evidence,

53
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,910
When the evidence was there,
we indicted him,

54
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,180
I've been watching you,

55
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,990
Come closer,

56
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,870
Closer,

57
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,470
28 days,

58
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,870
six hours,

59
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,470
42 minutes,

60
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,870
12 seconds,

61
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,020
That is when the world will end.

62
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,300
Why?

63
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,270
Son? Donnie Darko?

64
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:08,820
Donnie Darko?
What the heck's going on here?

65
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,190
- Who is it?
- It's Eddie Darko's kid.

66
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,660
He's just a neighbourhood kid.

67
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,830
Guess he was sleep-golfing?

68
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,510
Watch out for that drool spot!

69
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,470
Are you all right, son?

70
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,580
So let's stay off
the links at night, Ok?

71
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,110
I'm sorry, Dr Fisher.
It... It won't happen again.

72
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,870
- Kids...
- Let's golf.

73
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,390
- No one's allowed.
- This is my house.

74
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,830
- I said...
- This is my house!

75
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,110
Wait a minute.

76
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,070
- Here's your brother.
- It fell in your room.

77
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,030
Ms Darko? I'm Bob Garland.
I'm with the FAA.

78
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:07,630
- The what? - I'm with the FAA.
May we speak privately?

79
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,190
- In private?
- Please.

80
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,990
- And here...
- Ok.

81
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,950
All right,
we have arranged a hotel.

82
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,910
Get some sleep
and we'll take care of this.

83
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,870
- Great.
- Thank you.

84
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,590
Kids, come on.
We're going to a hotel.

85
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,260
They don't know where it came from.

86
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,350
- Where's Pop?
- He's still at work,

87
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,270
If it fell from the plane...
what happened to the plane?

88
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,470
They don't know, Samantha.

89
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,720
Can't we make money from this?
Can't we sue the airline?

90
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,630
Shut up, Sam.

91
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,150
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie?
He stinks.

92
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,240
When you fall asleep tonight,

93
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,110
- I'm gonna fart in your face.
- I'm telling Mom!

94
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,300
Samantha, don't go over there.

95
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,620
Frankie Feedler.

96
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,430
You remember. From high school.

97
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,030
He died. Remember?

98
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,150
On his way to the prom.

99
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,350
They said he was doomed.

100
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,590
Jesus.

101
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,910
They could be saying
the same thing about Donnie.

102
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,270
Our Donnie.

103
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,790
But he dodged it.

104
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,030
He dodged his photograph.

105
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,710
Somebody was watching over him.

106
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,270
Mrs Farmer will bring you home
after practice. Bye, honey.

107
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,510
Donnie... good luck.

108
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,910
- Oh, my God! Tell me everything.
- I'm not allowed to talk about it.

109
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,670
- Oh, my God!
- Hi, Cherita.

110
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,820
- Shut up!
- Darko cheats death! Huh?

111
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,830
You're a celebrity! I called you
a jillion times. Where you been?

112
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,540
- At a hotel.
- Dad saw you at the golf course.

113
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,310
- You sleepwalking again, buddy?
- I don't want to talk about it.

114
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,830
Now that you're famous,
have a smoke.

115
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,630
What happens
if you tell Mom and Dad, Sam?

116
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,270
- You'll put Ariel in the garbage
disposal. - Goddamn right, I will.

117
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,750
- So grody. - Hey, Cherita,
you want a cigarette?

118
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,790
- Shut up!
- "Shut up!"

119
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,230
Go back to China, bitch!

120
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,630
Just leave her alone.

121
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,940
- That's some good shit, huh?
- It's a fucking cigarette.

122
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,910
"There would be headlines
in the papers.

123
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,910
"The grown-up gangs who ran
the betting at the wrestling

124
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,670
and the barrow-boys
"would hear with respect

125
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,300
of how Old Misery's house
had been destroyed.

126
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,790
"It was as though this plan had
been with him all his life,

127
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,230
pondered through the seasons,
"now, in his 15th year,

128
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,230
crystallised
with the pain of puberty."

129
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,350
What is Graham Greene trying
to communicate with this passage?

130
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,150
Why did the children
break into Old Misery's house?

131
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,790
- Joanie?
- They wanted to rob him.

132
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,550
If you had actually
read the short story,

133
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,190
which was a whopping 13 pages,
you'd know that the children

134
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,870
find a great deal of money
in the mattress, but burn it.

135
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,470
Donnie Darko, perhaps with your
recent brush with mass destruction,

136
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,630
you can give us your opinion.

137
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,950
They say it when they flood the
house, when they tear it to shreds,

138
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,270
that destruction
is a form of creation,

139
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,710
so burning the money is ironic.

140
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,350
They just want to see what happens
when they tear the world apart.

141
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,390
They want to change things.

142
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,230
- May we help you?
- Yeah, I just registered.

143
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,390
- They put me in the wrong class.
- You look like you belong here.

144
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,350
Um... Where do I sit?

145
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,790
Sit next to the boy
you think is the cutest.

146
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,460
Quiet!

147
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,950
Let her choose.

148
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,390
Joanie, get up.

149
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,470
What people don't understand
is that Dukakis

150
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,990
does not have
the financial infrastructure,

151
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,190
Well, the construction guys

152
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,390
say it will take about a week
to fix the roof.

153
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,630
Airline better not fuck us
on the shingle match.

154
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,280
- They still don't know?
- Know what?

155
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:05,220
- Where it came from?
- Oh, no. They can't tell us.

156
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:09,830
Something about a matching
serial number that got burned.

157
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,590
I had to sign a form saying I
wouldn't talk to anyone about it.

158
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,830
So we can't tell anyone
what nobody knows?

159
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,870
Yeah. But you tell...
What's your doctor's name?

160
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,510
- Dr Thurman, Dad. - Yes.
Tell Dr Thurman whatever you want.

161
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,820
- Dad.
- What?

162
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,710
- Dad!
- Oh...!

163
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,830
What's that woman doing
in the middle of the damn road?!

164
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,430
No mail today. Maybe tomorrow.

165
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,830
What did she say to you?

166
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,470
- I made a new friend.
- Real or imaginary?

167
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,710
- Imaginary. - Would you like
to talk about this friend?

168
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,270
- Frank.
- Frank.

169
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,910
- What did he say?
- He said to follow him.

170
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,830
- Follow him? Where?
- Into the future.

171
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,470
And then what happens?

172
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,190
And then he said...

173
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,350
then he said that the world
was coming to an end.

174
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,270
Do you think
the world is coming to an end?

175
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,870
No.

176
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,230
That's stupid.

177
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,940
For my entire life
I was a victim of my own fear.

178
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,910
Love,

179
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,270
I was feeding fear with food.

180
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,470
Fear,

181
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,270
Finally, I looked in the mirror

182
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,790
Not just in the mirror,
I looked THROUGH the mirror,

183
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,110
In that image,
I saw my ego reflection,

184
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,620
For two years,
I thought it was normal

185
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,020
for a 10-year-old to wet the bed,

186
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,190
Shh! Quiet!

187
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,230
But the solution
was there all the time,

188
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,910
I'm not afraid any more!

189
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,950
All over America, people have
come together to join hands,

190
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:16,910
People who believe that human life
is absolutely too important,

191
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:22,940
too valuable and too precious
to be controlled by fear,

192
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,790
Pay close attention,
You could miss something.

193
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,550
Hello, My name is Jim Cunningham
And welcome to "Controlling Fear".

194
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,020
"...and the prince
was led into a world

195
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,420
of strange and beautiful magic."

196
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,660
Wow.

197
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,910
"The Last Unicorn"
by Samantha Darko.

198
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,390
- Give it back! - "There was once
a unicorn named Ariel..."

199
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,510
- You wrinkled it.
- It's not wrinkled, Sam.

200
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,030
It's 7.45. The bus should've
been here 20 minutes ago.

201
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,070
Maybe Martha finally went nuts
and hijacked it.

202
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,630
There's this rule -
at 7.45, we get to go home.

203
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,470
There's no rule.

204
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:12,830
Cherita, you should... go home.

205
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,750
Yeah, if you're here when the bus
comes, we'll get in trouble.

206
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,990
- Shut up!
- "Shut up!"

207
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:23,510
Hey, Porky Pig...
I hope you get molested.

208
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,510
Hey! Hey! I can't believe this!

209
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,590
School's closed
today because it's flooded.

210
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,950
- No way!
- Yeah.

211
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,630
Holy shit!
That's the best news ever!

212
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,590
My God, is this ever going to stop?

213
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:52,700
Eventually, yes. But right now,
I got 12 classrooms full of water.

214
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,260
All coming
from a busted water main.

215
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,300
- What else?
- What else?

216
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,030
Principal Cole,
I'll show you what else.

217
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,990
That's unbelievable.
That's solid bronze, isn't it?

218
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,990
- Yep.
- How did this happen?

219
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,670
I heard a cat burglar
trashed everything

220
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,110
and the Mongrel
got his head cut off.

221
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,950
- Hah!
- True!

222
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,190
Beth's mom said the boys' locker
room flooded

223
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,550
and they found faeces everywhere.

224
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,870
- What are faeces?
- Baby mice.

225
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,900
Hey.

226
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,270
Has anyone ever told you
that you're sexy?

227
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,790
I like your boobs.

228
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,790
Hey.

229
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,590
Hey.

230
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,710
School's cancelled.

231
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,910
Do you want to walk me home?

232
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,740
Sure.

233
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,430
- Don't look so freaked.
- I'm not.

234
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,710
Check your backpack.
Those guys steal shit.

235
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,630
Fuck 'em!

236
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,750
- So, why'd you move here?
- My parents got a divorce.

237
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:32,190
My mom got a restraining order
against my stepdad.

238
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,190
He has emotional problems.

239
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,230
I have those, too.
What kind does he have?

240
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,870
He stabbed my mom
four times in the chest.

241
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,910
Oh. Did he go to jail?

242
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,270
No, he fled.
They still can't find him.

243
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,390
Mom and I had to change our names.

244
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,190
I thought Gretchen Ross
was pretty cool.

245
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:59,350
I was in jail once. I mean...
I burned down this house.

246
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,470
It was abandoned,
but I got held back in school

247
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,230
and I can't drive till I'm 21.

248
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,990
But I'm over all of that.

249
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,110
I'm... painting and stuff.

250
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:15,550
Writing. I want to be a writer.
Maybe a painter. Maybe both...

251
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,910
I'll write a book
and draw the pictures.

252
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,150
Then maybe people will understand
me. I don't know, change things.

253
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,230
Donnie Darko - what the hell kind
of name is that?

254
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,950
It's like a superhero or something.

255
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,100
What makes you think I'm not?

256
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:42,060
I should go. For physics, Monnitoff
is having me write this essay -

257
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,070
the greatest invention
ever to benefit mankind.

258
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:50,700
It's Monnitoff.
But that's easy. Antiseptics.

259
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:55,390
Like, the whole sanitation thing.
Joseph Lister, 1895.

260
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:00,430
Before antiseptics, there was no
sanitation, especially in medicine.

261
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,190
You mean soap?

262
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,710
Well, I'm really glad
school was flooded today.

263
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,390
Why is that?

264
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,270
We'd never have had
this conversation.

265
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,350
You're weird.

266
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,660
Sorry.

267
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,580
No, that was a compliment.

268
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,390
Well, look, uh...

269
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,310
You want to go with me?

270
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:43,030
- Where do you want to go?
- No, I mean, like, "go" with me.

271
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,790
- You know, like "going together".
- Sure.

272
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,630
Ok. Where are you going?

273
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,230
I'm going home.

274
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,150
Stupid...
"Where are you going?"

275
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,750
I'd like to try something new.

276
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,420
Have you ever been hypnotised?

277
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,020
No.

278
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,310
When I clap twice, you will
wake up. Do you understand?

279
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,390
- Yes.
- So, tell me about your week.

280
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,950
I met a girl.

281
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,590
What is her name?

282
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,630
Gretchen.

283
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,270
We're going together now.

284
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,950
Do you still think
about girls a lot?

285
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,230
Yeah.

286
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:12,510
- How are things going at school?
- I think about girls a lot.

287
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,300
I asked you about school, Donnie.

288
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,470
I think about fucking
a lot during school.

289
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,110
What else do you think about
during school?

290
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,910
"Married With Children".

291
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,750
- You think about your family?
- I just turn down the volume

292
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,270
and think about
fucking Christina Applegate.

293
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,920
I asked you about your family.

294
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,630
No.

295
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,670
I don't think about fucking
my family. That's gross.

296
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,350
I'd like to hear
about your friend Frank.

297
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,150
Sam Bylan.

298
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,510
Cherita Chen.

299
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,270
Donald Darko.

300
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,030
Daye Dennis.

301
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,190
Hey, you fuck!

302
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,340
Did you say I flooded the school?

303
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,470
- I didn't say shit.
- Yeah, well, they think I did it.

304
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,590
If you're innocent, then you have
nothing to worry about, right?

305
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,420
Fuck you! You know what I think?

306
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,190
I think you did it.

307
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,350
Beer and pussy - that's all I need.

308
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:51,630
- We gotta find ourselves
a Smurfette. - Smurfette?

309
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,500
Mm-hm.
Not some tight-ass Middlesex chick.

310
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,310
Like, this cute little blonde

311
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,470
that'll get down with the guys
like Smurfette does.

312
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,350
Smurfette doesn't fuck.

313
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,270
That's bullshit. Why do you think
Papa Smurf made her?

314
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,550
Because the other Smurfs
were getting too horny.

315
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,020
Not vanity.
I heard he was a homosexual.

316
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,870
Then she fucks them
while vanity watches.

317
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,710
What about Papa Smurf?
He must get some action?

318
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,630
What he does,
he films the gang-bang.

319
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,430
Later on, he beats off to the tape.

320
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,710
First of all, Papa Smurf didn't
create Smurfette. Gargamel did.

321
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,350
She was sent as Gargamel's evil spy
to destroy the Smurf village,

322
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,060
but the overwhelming goodness
of the Smurfs transformed her.

323
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:49,310
And as for the whole gang-bang
scenario, it just couldn't happen!

324
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,590
Smurfs are asexual.
They don't even have

325
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,990
reproductive organs
under those little pants.

326
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:01,030
That's what's so illogical
about being a Smurf.

327
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,670
What's the point of living
if you don't have a dick?

328
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,750
Donnie, why you gotta get
smart on us?

329
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,270
Grandma Death.

330
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,820
Excuse me! Excuse me!

331
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:24,750
Stay off the road, Miss Sparrow,
or I will call Social Services.

332
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:29,070
I hate that Miss Farmer.
She's such a fucking bitch!

333
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,870
Yeah.

334
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,430
- How old is Grandma Death?
- 101.

335
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,270
She does the same thing every day.

336
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:43,270
Just walks back and forth
and back and forth to the mailbox.

337
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,030
Nothing ever in there.

338
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,230
Oh, wait, wait, wait...

339
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:59,110
She's going back to the box.
We may still have mail.

340
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,470
- Mail, mail, mail.
- Here it is.

341
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,790
This could be it. Oh...?

342
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,190
Oh, no dice, Grandma. Sorry.

343
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,390
Someone ought to write that bitch.

344
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,230
Authorities continued their search

345
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:17,070
for a suspect in the Middlesex
Ridge School vandalism.

346
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,830
The private school
has asked for donations

347
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,270
to restore its beloved mascot,
known only as the Mongrel...

348
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,940
It's very helpful.
There's a good turnout tonight.

349
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,040
What are you trying
to accomplish here?

350
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:42,790
There was urine and faeces
flooded in my office.

351
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,310
Whatever fits.

352
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,990
"Whatever fits"?

353
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,710
In cooperation
with the county police,

354
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,990
we have begun
an active investigation

355
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,110
into the cause of the flooding.

356
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:02,350
And our suspects include
several of our own students...

357
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:06,430
I want to know why this filth
is being taught to our children.

358
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,950
Kitty, I would appreciate
if you would wait...

359
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,630
Dr Cole, not only am I a teacher,

360
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,910
but I am also a parent
of a Middlesex child.

361
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,590
Therefore I am the only person here

362
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,870
who transcends
the parent-teacher bridge.

363
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:41,110
Don't worry, you got away with it.

364
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,790
I have in my hand Graham Greene's
"The Destructors".

365
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,710
This short story is part of my
daughter's English assignment.

366
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,030
In this story,
several children destroy

367
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,230
an elderly mars house
from inside out.

368
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,870
How can you do that?

369
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,990
And how do they do this?

370
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:25,670
They flood the house
by breaking through a water main.

371
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,740
I can do anything I want.

372
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,230
And so can you.

373
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,470
And I think that this garbage
should be removed!

374
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,020
Excuse me.
What is the real issue here?

375
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,680
The PTA doesn't ban books.

376
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,030
The PTA must acknowledge
that pornography

377
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,500
is being taught in our curriculum!

378
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:56,720
- It's meant to be ironic. - Excuse
me. Go back to grad school.

379
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,630
Why did you make me
flood the school?

380
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,070
They are in great danger.

381
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:10,150
Do you even know
who Graham Greene is?

382
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,750
I think we have all seen "Bonanza".

383
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,950
Well, um... while we are
on other topics...

384
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,670
Where do you come from?

385
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,230
Do you believe in time travel?

386
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,470
Who are you talking to?

387
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,140
I was just taking my pills, Sam.

388
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,420
A storm is coming, Frank says.

389
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,350
A storm that will swallow
the children,

390
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:00,540
And I will deliver them
from the kingdom of pain.

391
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,950
I'll deliver them
back to their doorsteps,

392
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:07,350
send the monsters
back to the underground.

393
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,550
I'll send them back to a place
where no one else can see them.

394
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,150
Except for me.

395
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,750
Because I am Donnie Darko.

396
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,670
Who is Frank?

397
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,630
A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.

398
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,790
In these modern times,

399
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,510
our attitude and beliefs
are so delicate, so fragile.

400
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:54,790
I have had a Cunning Vision,
This vision has released me.

401
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,790
It's important that
our lifeline be rejuvenated,

402
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,510
so that we can breathe again.

403
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,670
It's time to breathe.

404
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,830
It is time to breathe.

405
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,590
Thank you, Jim Cunningham.

406
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,430
Thank you, Jim Cunningham.

407
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,270
So now let us begin Lifeline
Exercise Number One,

408
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,430
Please press stop now.

409
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:30,900
As you can see, the lifeline
is divided into two polar extremes.

410
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,350
Fear and love.

411
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,270
Fear is in the negative
energy spectrum.

412
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,550
- Love is in the positive
energy spectrum. - No, duh (!)

413
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:47,390
Excuse me?
"No, duh" is a product of fear.

414
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:53,790
Now, on each card
is a character dilemma

415
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,440
which applies to the lifeline.

416
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,950
Please... Take this. Thank you.

417
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,830
Please read
each character dilemma aloud

418
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:10,190
and place an "X' on the lifeline
in the appropriate place.

419
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,470
Cherita?

420
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:24,550
"Juanita has
an important math test today.

421
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,670
"She's known about the test for
several weeks, but has not studied.

422
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:32,030
"In order to keep from failing,

423
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:35,350
Juanita decides
to cheat on the math test."

424
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,230
Good. Good. Very good.

425
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,100
Mr Darko.

426
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,500
"Ling Ling finds a wallet
filled with money.

427
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,230
"She takes it to the address
on the driver's licence

428
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,270
but keeps the money."

429
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,200
I'm sorry, Miss Farmer.
I don't get this.

430
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,310
Just place an "X'
in the appropriate place.

431
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:12,790
I know what to do, but you can't
lump things into two categories.

432
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:15,750
The lifeline is divided that way.

433
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,670
Well, life isn't that simple.
I mean...

434
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:23,300
Who cares if Ling Ling
keeps the money?

435
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,270
It has nothing to do
with fear or love.

436
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,190
They are the deepest
human emotions.

437
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,230
Ok. But you're not listening to me.

438
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,670
There are other things
to take into account,

439
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,710
the whole spectrum
of human emotion.

440
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,870
You can't just lump everything

441
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,070
into two categories
and deny everything else!

442
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:45,110
If you don't complete
the assignment, you'll get a zero.

443
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:53,990
Donald,
let me preface this by saying

444
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:59,200
that your Iowa Test scores
are... intimidating.

445
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,070
So...

446
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,350
Let's go over this again.

447
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,270
What exactly
did you say to Miss Farmer?

448
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,070
I'll tell you.
He asked me

449
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,700
to forcibly insert the lifeline
exercise card into my anus!

450
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:38,790
Nobody cares about responsibility,
morality, family values...

451
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:46,430
Kitty... Excuse us, please.

452
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:55,910
They've suspended him from after-
school activities for six months.

453
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:02,300
Since this jet engine fiasco,
I don't know what's gotten into...

454
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,750
I'll say this because our daughters
are on the dance team together

455
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,670
and I respect you,

456
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,320
but after witnessing
your sors behaviour,

457
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,350
I have significant doubts
about your...

458
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,150
Our paths through life
must be righteous.

459
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,590
Go home and look in the mirror

460
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:26,590
and pray that your son doesn't
succumb to the path of fear.

461
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,060
Do you remember
that weird gym teacher, Mrs Farmer?

462
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:42,830
Yeah. Ok, well, my brother told her
to shove a book up her ass today.

463
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,750
And then my parents
just bought him all this new shit.

464
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:51,380
Yeah, I know. I wish a jet engine
would fall on my room.

465
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:12,070
- Dr Monnitoff.
- Donnie.

466
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,790
I know this is gonna
sound kind of weird,

467
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,910
but do you know anything
about... time travel?

468
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,700
A wormhole
with an Einstein-Rosen bridge,

469
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:33,740
which is theoretically a wormhole
in space controlled by man.

470
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,620
So, according to Hawking,

471
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:42,070
a wormhole may be able
to provide a short cut

472
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:45,590
for jumping between two distant
regions of space-time.

473
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,750
So to travel back in time,
you have to have a spaceship

474
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,990
faster than the speed of light.

475
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:54,230
- Theoretically.
- And be able to find a wormhole.

476
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,620
The basic principles of time travel
are there.

477
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:00,830
Your vessel and portal.
Your vessel can be anything.

478
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,950
- Like a DeLorean?
- Metal craft of any kind.

479
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:09,710
You know, I love that movie. It's
so... like, futuristic, you know?

480
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:15,180
Listen, um... don't tell anybody
that I gave you this.

481
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,310
Woman who wrote this
used to teach here.

482
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,750
She was a nun long before that.

483
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:26,910
Then overnight she became
this entirely different person.

484
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:30,190
She up and left the church,
wrote this book...

485
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:34,230
She started teaching science,
right here at Middlesex.

486
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,030
"The Philosophy of Time Travel".

487
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,390
Roberta Sparrow?

488
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,310
That's right.

489
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,830
Roberta Sparrow?

490
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,430
Roberta Sparrow.

491
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,030
Grandma Death.

492
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,910
It's called
"The Philosophy of Time Travel".

493
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:41,750
- What does philosophy have to do
with it? - Guess who wrote it.

494
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:42,950
Who?

495
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:47,510
Roberta Sparrow.
Huh! She wrote a book.

496
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:52,390
- Grandma Death wrote a book.
- That's a terrible nickname.

497
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:56,550
We almost ran her down
the other day.

498
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:01,790
She lives in that piece of crap
house, and you know she's loaded.

499
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,590
- You're right. - She was known
for her gem collection.

500
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:10,630
Kids used to go up there
all the time

501
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,070
and try to steal stuff from her.

502
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,870
She became a total recluse.

503
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:20,750
I didn't know she was alive
till we damn near knocked her down.

504
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,150
She was just standing
in the road, frozen.

505
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,270
I walked over to see if she was OK.

506
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,870
And she whispered in my ear.

507
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:38,630
- What did she say? - I think Frank
wants me to talk to her.

508
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:43,190
He asked if I knew
about time travel.

509
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,670
She wrote a book about it,

510
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,430
so that can't be
a coincidence, right?

511
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,550
What did she say to you?

512
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:58,860
She said that every living creature
on earth dies alone.

513
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,940
How did that make you feel?

514
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:11,350
It reminded me of my dog Callie.

515
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:18,030
She died when I was eight and she
crawled underneath the... the porch.

516
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,260
To die.

517
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,670
To be alone.

518
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,030
Do you feel alone right now?

519
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,110
I don't know...

520
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,430
I'd like to believe I'm not,
but I just...

521
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:50,590
I've just never seen any proof,
so I just don't debate it any more.

522
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:54,910
I could spend my whole life
debating it over and over

523
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,230
and still wouldn't have proof,

524
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:00,110
so I just don't debate it any more.

525
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,110
It's absurd.

526
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,790
The search for God is absurd?

527
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,910
It is if everyone dies alone.

528
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:17,070
Does that scare you?

529
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:22,310
I don't want to be alone.

530
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:38,200
And his tapes have made me realise

531
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:42,790
that for the last 39 years, I have
been a prisoner of my own fear.

532
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:44,830
Fear.

533
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:49,590
You have got to meet
this Jim Cunningham.

534
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,430
I can't believe he's single.

535
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:57,030
It has been a disappointing night
for these Super Bowl champions.

536
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:00,820
You're right, Dan, Coach Joe Gibbs
is on the sidelines.

537
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:05,030
He's gotta be thinking, "What
happened? What went wrong tonight?"

538
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,350
- And here's the kick,
- Oh!

539
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,950
It's no good...

540
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:15,670
- Shit, we need a quarterback.
- We need a miracle.

541
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,030
We need to go for a safety.

542
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:24,630
What the future holds for this MVP,
we'll have to wait and see.

543
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,190
You guys want anything?

544
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:38,790
This week on "Who's The Boss?"
Samantha borrows Tony's van

545
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:42,030
and gets caught without a licence.

546
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,070
Better make sure
we don't miss that one.

547
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:50,390
Here we are again,
Fourth down now...

548
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,350
Tomorrow, we meet our partners

549
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,900
for the Young Inventors' Fair.

550
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:55,590
What if you could go back in time
and take those hours of pain

551
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,110
and replace them
with something better?

552
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:01,980
- Like images?
- Yeah, a Hawaiian sunset

553
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:03,750
or the Grand Canyon.

554
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,270
Things that remind you
how beautiful...

555
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:09,870
We've been going together
for two weeks.

556
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,100
Yeah?

557
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,150
Well, I er... I...

558
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,990
You want to kiss me?

559
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:30,470
- I'm sorry, I...
- Look, Donnie, wait. I just...

560
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,990
- Well, I like you a lot.
- I just want it to be

561
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:35,710
at a time when... it...

562
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:40,380
- When what?
- When it reminds me just...

563
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:45,430
When it reminds you
how beautiful the world can be?

564
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,230
Yeah.

565
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,350
And there's some fat guy
staring at us.

566
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:23,670
I don't think telling any woman

567
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:26,630
to forcibly insert
an object up her anus

568
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,910
is something
that should go without consequence.

569
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,790
I think we should buy him a moped.

570
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:42,230
I think we should get a divorce.

571
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:57,070
- You won't tell Mom, will you?
- Why would I?

572
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:00,070
- You tell Mom everything.
- No, I don't.

573
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:08,070
- Let me see it.
- No, it's not finished. It's...

574
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,950
Ok. It's cool.

575
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,150
That's scary.

576
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:21,820
You think?

577
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,310
Thank you for seeing us
at such late notice.

578
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:31,310
We both felt
we should come and discuss...

579
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:34,670
What I think is going on
with your son.

580
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,230
Yes.

581
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:40,190
Um... Well, he's er...

582
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:46,270
You know about his past,
and he was suspended from school

583
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:47,790
for insulting his gym teacher.

584
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:52,710
I'm not sure that's a good example.
I think he had just cause.

585
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:56,790
Rose, let me lay out
what I believe is happening here.

586
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,510
Donnie's aggressive behaviour...

587
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:07,230
his increased detachment
from reality,

588
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:13,270
seem to stem from his inability to
cope with the forces in the world

589
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:16,190
that he perceives
to be threatening.

590
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:24,040
Has he ever told you about Frank?

591
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:29,990
Frank?

592
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,550
Yes, the giant bunny rabbit.

593
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:35,740
The what?

594
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:45,030
I don't recall
him ever having mentioned a rabbit.

595
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:46,590
Donnie is experiencing

596
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:49,670
what is commonly called
a daylight hallucination.

597
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,590
This is a common occurrence
among paranoid schizophrenics.

598
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:15,390
- What can we do? - I would like
to do more hypnotherapy...

599
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:20,110
...and increase his medication.

600
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:32,310
Whatever will help him, really,
is... That's why we're here.

601
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:37,190
We just would like him
to experience some relief.

602
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:42,430
So if you think
that more medication will do that,

603
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:47,070
then I think
we should give it a try.

604
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,310
It's complicated.

605
01:04:58,240 --> 01:04:59,270
Yeah?

606
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:04,270
There's like a force in your brain
that just sends you someplace.

607
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:06,950
Do you go someplace familiar?

608
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:12,550
No, but each time I keep waking up
farther from my house.

609
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,230
Scary.

610
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,430
Donnie Darko.

611
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:35,670
I know.

612
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:47,750
- Good morning, you mongrels!
- Good morning.

613
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:50,830
Is that all you can muster?
Good morning!

614
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:55,230
- Good morning! - Now,
that's a tiny, tiny bit better.

615
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:58,180
But I still sense some students

616
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:01,190
who are actually afraid
to say "good morning".

617
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:02,950
Good morning!

618
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:07,590
Yeah, that's what I like to hear!
Too many young men and women today

619
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:11,070
are completely paralysed
by their fears.

620
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:16,870
They surrender their bodies
to the temptation and destruction

621
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:19,750
of drugs, alcohol
and premarital sex.

622
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:24,670
Now, I'm going to tell you
a little story today.

623
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:28,790
It's a heartbreakingly sad story
about a young man

624
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:33,110
whose life was completely destroyed
by these instruments of fear,

625
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:38,350
a young man searching for love
in all the wrong places.

626
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:41,630
His name was Frank.

627
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:55,190
- We're moving through time.
- What?

628
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,470
Hi. My stepsister, like,

629
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:02,910
I sometimes worry
that she eats too much.

630
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,560
- Shut up, Kim!
- I'm just trying to help.

631
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:07,070
Oh, sweetheart, please!

632
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:09,870
There's no reason
to be embarrassed here.

633
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:14,710
Many times we eat because we are
afraid to face our ego reflection.

634
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:18,470
We find ourselves
looking at the mirror,

635
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:22,180
rather than into
and through the mirror.

636
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:26,630
When we do that, we can finally see
how beautiful we are.

637
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:31,590
- Thanks! - Sure. Come up here.
Don't be afraid.

638
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:40,510
Er, how can I find out
what I wanna be when I grow up?

639
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:43,190
Oh! That's a hard one.

640
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:48,030
Well, look deep inside of yourself,
deep within your heart,

641
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:54,790
and find what makes you feel love,
pure, unconditional love

642
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:57,180
and go to that.
In your studies, in your athletics,

643
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,910
in your relationships,
go towards love.

644
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,430
- Thank you.
- Come on up.

645
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:06,860
Next.

646
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:16,230
- How do I learn how to fight?
- "How do I learn how to fight?"

647
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:22,470
Son, violence is a product of fear.
Learn to truly love yourself -

648
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:26,950
TRULY love yourself -
and the world will be yours.

649
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:29,870
- Ok.
- Get yourself up here!

650
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:31,230
All right!

651
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,540
- Good morning.
- Good morning!

652
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,670
Um... How much are they paying you
to be here?

653
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:45,070
Er... Excuse me?

654
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:50,030
- What's your name, son?
- Gerald.

655
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:53,430
Well, Gerald,
I think you're afraid.

656
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,750
Do you want us to buy your book?

657
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:58,990
Because that was
the worst advice ever.

658
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:02,790
See how sad this is?
Want your sister to lose weight?

659
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:06,470
Tell her to stop eating Twinkies
and play field hockey.

660
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:09,710
No one knows what they want to be.

661
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:13,230
It takes time to find that out.
Right, Jim?

662
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:15,470
And you...

663
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:18,030
Yeah, you.

664
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:21,550
Sick of some jerk shoving your head
down the toilet?

665
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:23,670
Well, lift some weights

666
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:27,710
or take a karate lesson, and next
time kick him in the balls.

667
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:34,920
Son... See this? This is an anger
prisoner, a textbook example.

668
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,150
- Prisoner.
- Do you see the fear, people?

669
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:40,940
This boy is scared to death.

670
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:44,630
Son, it breaks my heart
to say this,

671
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:48,630
but I believe you're a very
troubled and confused young man.

672
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:51,550
You are searching
in all the wrong places.

673
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:54,100
You're right, actually.

674
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:56,830
I am pretty troubled
and pretty confused.

675
01:09:56,920 --> 01:10:00,670
And I'm afraid, really, really
afraid. Really afraid, but I... I...

676
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:03,830
I think you're
the fucking Antichrist.

677
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:19,630
It's amazing.
He thinks he's telling the truth.

678
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:22,470
Everything he says
is a fucking lie.

679
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,470
Everything he says!

680
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:29,030
Everyone thinks he's so rad.
He's such a fucking chud...

681
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,150
Are you ok?

682
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,270
Sit down. Calm down.

683
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:45,750
You ever hear of Grandma Death?

684
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:47,740
Who?

685
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:56,750
"The Philosophy of Time Travel".
What is this?

686
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:59,790
She wrote it.

687
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:12,070
I'm... I'm seeing stuff...

688
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:15,780
Like really messed-up stuff.

689
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:19,390
That book describes
stuff I've been seeing,

690
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:22,070
and it can't just be a coincidence.

691
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:36,550
She must be in.
She never leaves this house.

692
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:38,430
Maybe she's asleep.

693
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:00,430
Donnie, look.

694
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,830
Send her a letter.

695
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,350
Each vessel travel
along a vector through space-time

696
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:46,710
along its centre of gravity.

697
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:48,430
Like a spear.

698
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:54,550
- Pardon? - Like a spear
coming out of your chest.

699
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:57,340
Um... Sure. Yeah.

700
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:00,430
In order for the vessel
to travel through time,

701
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:03,470
it's got to find a portal,
a wormhole or...

702
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:05,430
Could these portals...?

703
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:09,500
Could these portals
just appear anywhere, any time?

704
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,790
I think that's highly unlikely.

705
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:15,830
No, you're talking about
an act of God.

706
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:18,510
If God controls time,
time is pre-decided.

707
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:21,550
I'm not following you.

708
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:24,750
Every living thing
follows a set path.

709
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:29,310
And if you could see your path,
then you could see the future?

710
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:32,780
That's a form of time travel.

711
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:35,590
Well, you're contradicting
yourself.

712
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:38,030
If we were able
to see our destinies

713
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:40,420
manifest themselves visually,

714
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:44,190
then we would be given a choice
to betray our destinies.

715
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:46,710
The mere fact
that this choice exists

716
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:50,110
would make all preformed destiny
come to an end.

717
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:53,710
Not if you travel
within God's channel.

718
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:01,750
I'm not going to be able
to continue this conversation.

719
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:06,540
- Why?
- I could lose my job.

720
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,140
Ok.

721
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:20,670
It gives me no pleasure to deny you

722
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:24,300
one of the great writers
of the 20th century.

723
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:29,070
Alas, I have not yet been elected
queen of the universe,

724
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:33,030
so I must obey the rules.

725
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:37,300
So, anyone seen in this school
reading this book

726
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,550
will be suspended.

727
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:40,910
Not to worry.

728
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:45,590
Someone pre-ordered a dozen copies
at the Sarasota Mall bookstore.

729
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:49,870
In Mr Greene's absence,

730
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:53,910
we will now be reading another
classic -"Watership Down".

731
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,310
Here, Donnie.

732
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,190
Pass these back.

733
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,510
Maybe you and Frank
can read this one together.

734
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:23,110
Now you know where he lives.

735
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:28,750
And they grow
out of our... chest, solar plexus?

736
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:33,150
Just like she described, the way
they moved and they smelled.

737
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:35,350
It's like they're workers.

738
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:40,790
Assigned to each one of us.
They just... They're like liquid.

739
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:46,910
I followed it
into my parents' bedroom.

740
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:49,670
What did you find?

741
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:56,950
Nothing.

742
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:05,380
- So we call them IMGs.
- Infant Memory Generators.

743
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:08,870
You buy these glasses
for your infant,

744
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:12,110
and they wear them
at night when they sleep.

745
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:15,510
But inside the glasses
are these slide photographs.

746
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:19,470
Each photograph is of something
peaceful or beautiful,

747
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:21,590
whatever the parents want.

748
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:24,430
What effect would it have
on an infant?

749
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:28,190
Well, nobody remembers
their infancy.

750
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:30,350
Anybody who says they do is lying.

751
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:33,510
So, this will help develop memory
earlier in life.

752
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:34,580
Yeah.

753
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:37,670
Did you consider
that infants need darkness

754
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:40,350
as part of their natural
development?

755
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:46,020
No.

756
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:49,940
Yeah.

757
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:55,190
What if the parents put in pictures
of Satan or dead people?

758
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:58,230
Is that what you'd show your kids?

759
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:04,350
Er, well, I mean, didn't your dad,
like, stab your mom?

760
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:15,390
Get out.

761
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:18,750
Gretchen!

762
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:22,940
Gretchen! Gretchen.
I'm sorry about those guys.

763
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:54,070
- Two for "Evil Dead", please.
- That'll be $2.

764
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:44,510
Why do you wear
that stupid bunny suit?

765
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:53,470
Why are you wearing
that stupid man suit?

766
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,910
Take it off.

767
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:27,390
What happened to your eye?

768
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:45,590
Why do they call you Frank?

769
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:49,020
It is the name of my father.

770
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,870
And his father before me.

771
01:20:57,960 --> 01:20:59,350
Frank...

772
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:05,830
whers this going to stop?

773
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:08,910
You should already know that.

774
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:13,820
Watch the movie screen.

775
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:18,830
There's something
I want to show you.

776
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:29,190
Have you ever seen a portal?

777
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:52,150
Burn it to the ground.

778
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:09,950
Ok. Now, girls,
I want you to concentrate.

779
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:12,830
Failure is not an option.

780
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:18,110
And, Bethany, if you feel the need
to vomit up there, just swallow it.

781
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:22,230
- Ok, Mom. - Hey, you guys,
good luck out there.

782
01:24:02,130 --> 01:24:04,440
Now, that was really something.

783
01:24:04,530 --> 01:24:07,730
Thank you, Cherita Chen,
with "Autumn Angel".

784
01:24:07,810 --> 01:24:10,810
Now the moment
we've all been waiting for.

785
01:24:10,890 --> 01:24:15,650
It is my pleasure to introduce
to you Emily Bates, Suzy Bailey,

786
01:24:15,730 --> 01:24:19,770
Samantha Darko, Beth Farmer
and Joanie James.

787
01:24:20,090 --> 01:24:22,240
They are Sparkle Motion.

788
01:27:15,370 --> 01:27:17,520
How long was I asleep for?

789
01:27:18,410 --> 01:27:20,090
Whole movie.

790
01:28:02,730 --> 01:28:05,530
Well, look what the cat dragged in!

791
01:28:08,570 --> 01:28:10,770
How you doing, Donnie?

792
01:28:17,010 --> 01:28:19,730
Your little sister
was broken-hearted

793
01:28:19,810 --> 01:28:22,730
that you missed
her big show last night.

794
01:28:24,370 --> 01:28:25,890
- Dad?
- Hm?

795
01:28:27,010 --> 01:28:28,530
I'm crazy.

796
01:28:29,730 --> 01:28:32,010
You're not crazy.

797
01:28:33,450 --> 01:28:35,490
I used to be crazy.

798
01:28:38,690 --> 01:28:40,570
But you're not crazy.

799
01:28:44,330 --> 01:28:45,930
- Look, you're my only son...
- I know...

800
01:28:46,010 --> 01:28:52,090
No, hold it. I know I'm not
the best communicator, but...

801
01:28:55,050 --> 01:29:00,330
...whatever happens to you,
be honest, tell the truth,

802
01:29:01,730 --> 01:29:05,360
even if they do look at you
funny -they will.

803
01:29:05,450 --> 01:29:08,330
But what you gotta understand, son,

804
01:29:08,410 --> 01:29:11,800
is that almost all of those people
are full of shit.

805
01:29:18,170 --> 01:29:22,250
They're all part of this great
big conspiracy of bullshit.

806
01:29:24,770 --> 01:29:27,490
And they're scared
of people like you.

807
01:29:28,890 --> 01:29:30,770
Because those bullshitters know

808
01:29:30,850 --> 01:29:33,730
that you're smarter
than all of them.

809
01:29:35,650 --> 01:29:38,570
You know what you say
to people like that? Hm?

810
01:29:41,730 --> 01:29:43,490
"Fuck you."

811
01:29:47,930 --> 01:29:51,720
The blaze was extinguished
sometime after 8,00 last night.

812
01:29:51,810 --> 01:29:54,490
Firefighters discovered
what has been referred to

813
01:29:54,570 --> 01:29:56,800
as a kiddie porn dungeon,

814
01:29:57,290 --> 01:30:03,160
Cunningham, who has become
a recent celebrity, was arrested...

815
01:30:03,250 --> 01:30:06,800
- Oh, my God! ...while at Sarasota
Heights Country Club.

816
01:30:07,170 --> 01:30:10,960
Arson has not been ruled out
as the cause of the fire,

817
01:30:11,410 --> 01:30:15,010
Now a group
of Cunning Vision employees...

818
01:30:15,090 --> 01:30:16,650
Dad played golf with that guy.

819
01:30:16,730 --> 01:30:18,930
...vehemently denied
the alleged link

820
01:30:19,010 --> 01:30:22,050
to a child pornography
publishing circuit.

821
01:30:22,130 --> 01:30:26,130
In a vicious statement, Connie
attacked fire department officials,

822
01:30:26,210 --> 01:30:28,410
claiming a mass conspiracy.

823
01:30:32,970 --> 01:30:36,330
I'm sorry, Karen.
This is a progressive school,

824
01:30:37,050 --> 01:30:40,600
but we don't feel
your methods are appropriate.

825
01:30:41,650 --> 01:30:44,690
What exactly about my methods
are inappropriate?

826
01:30:51,410 --> 01:30:54,770
I am sorry that you have failed.

827
01:30:58,930 --> 01:31:02,450
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have another appointment.

828
01:31:03,690 --> 01:31:06,370
You can finish out the week.

829
01:31:12,090 --> 01:31:14,650
Fuck!

830
01:31:37,690 --> 01:31:40,530
Good afternoon.
It's a great pleasure to announce

831
01:31:40,610 --> 01:31:43,490
that the Middlesex Ridge School
dance team

832
01:31:43,570 --> 01:31:48,410
has been invited to perform on
"Star Search '88" in Los Angeles.

833
01:32:16,410 --> 01:32:21,040
- I know now a terrible thing
is coming. - What do you mean?

834
01:32:21,130 --> 01:32:27,690
The field, the field,
it's covered with blood,

835
01:32:28,650 --> 01:32:31,410
Blood? Don't be silly.

836
01:32:44,290 --> 01:32:49,050
All right, it's getting dark,
We should get back to the burrow.

837
01:32:49,130 --> 01:32:53,890
Back to the burrow? It'll come
there, it's all around us!

838
01:32:53,970 --> 01:32:57,330
- Stop it, Fiver,
- We've got to leave here.

839
01:33:05,490 --> 01:33:08,850
When the other rabbits
hear of Fiver's vision,

840
01:33:08,930 --> 01:33:10,290
do they believe him?

841
01:33:10,370 --> 01:33:12,330
Why should we care?

842
01:33:13,690 --> 01:33:16,210
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.

843
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:19,120
Why should I mourn for a rabbit?

844
01:33:19,410 --> 01:33:23,290
Is the death of one species
less tragic than another?

845
01:33:23,530 --> 01:33:26,530
Of course. A rabbit's not like us.

846
01:33:26,770 --> 01:33:29,240
It has no history books,
no photographs,

847
01:33:29,330 --> 01:33:31,640
no knowledge of sorrow or regret.

848
01:33:31,730 --> 01:33:36,090
I'm sorry. Don't get me wrong,
I like rabbits.

849
01:33:36,170 --> 01:33:37,890
They're cute and horny.

850
01:33:37,970 --> 01:33:40,360
If you're cute and horny,
you're happy.

851
01:33:40,450 --> 01:33:42,680
You don't know why you're alive.

852
01:33:42,770 --> 01:33:46,810
You just want to have sex as many
times as possible before you die.

853
01:33:47,690 --> 01:33:51,290
I just don't see the point
in crying over a dead rabbit...

854
01:33:52,090 --> 01:33:55,880
who never even feared death
to begin with.

855
01:33:56,850 --> 01:33:58,000
You're wrong.

856
01:33:58,090 --> 01:34:02,050
These rabbits are the product
of the author's imagination.

857
01:34:02,130 --> 01:34:04,730
He cares for them,
so we care for them,

858
01:34:04,810 --> 01:34:07,490
otherwise we've just
missed the point.

859
01:34:10,530 --> 01:34:14,050
Arert we forgetting
about the miracle of storytelling?

860
01:34:15,610 --> 01:34:19,160
The deus ex machina?
The god machine?

861
01:34:21,130 --> 01:34:23,410
That's what saved the rabbits.

862
01:34:30,330 --> 01:34:33,170
No, it was ridiculous.
I'll call you back.

863
01:34:35,370 --> 01:34:37,360
- Rose.
- Kitty.

864
01:34:39,290 --> 01:34:43,760
I'm sure you've heard the horrible
allegations against Jim Cunningham.

865
01:34:43,850 --> 01:34:47,080
I know. Something about
a kiddie porn dungeon...

866
01:34:47,170 --> 01:34:49,930
Oh, please, please!
Don't use those words!

867
01:34:51,290 --> 01:34:55,370
It's obviously a conspiracy
to destroy an innocent man.

868
01:34:55,890 --> 01:35:00,210
I'm spearheading the Jim Cunningham
defence campaign.

869
01:35:02,410 --> 01:35:06,770
Rose, I have to appear at his
arraignment tomorrow morning.

870
01:35:06,850 --> 01:35:11,130
The girls have to leave
for Los Angeles.

871
01:35:11,210 --> 01:35:15,570
As their coach, I was the obvious
choice to chaperone them.

872
01:35:15,650 --> 01:35:18,880
- But now you can't go.
- Yes.

873
01:35:20,210 --> 01:35:23,050
Now, believe me,
of all the other mothers,

874
01:35:23,130 --> 01:35:25,410
I would never dream of asking you.

875
01:35:25,490 --> 01:35:28,370
But none of the others
are available.

876
01:35:30,770 --> 01:35:35,090
I don't know, Kitty. It's a bad
weekend. Eddie's in New York.

877
01:35:36,290 --> 01:35:39,250
Rose, I don't know if you realise

878
01:35:39,330 --> 01:35:43,250
what an opportunity
this is for our daughters!

879
01:35:43,970 --> 01:35:49,410
This has been a dream of Samantha's
and all of ours for a long time.

880
01:35:49,490 --> 01:35:52,090
I made her lead dancer!

881
01:35:53,290 --> 01:35:57,250
Sometimes I doubt your commitment
to Sparkle Motion!

882
01:36:27,930 --> 01:36:30,530
Elizabeth will be in charge.

883
01:36:30,970 --> 01:36:33,440
She'll drive you to therapy.

884
01:36:34,090 --> 01:36:35,730
And if you need anything,

885
01:36:35,810 --> 01:36:38,850
you promise me
that you will call Dr Thurman?

886
01:36:49,050 --> 01:36:52,650
How does it feel
to have a wacko for a son?

887
01:36:57,810 --> 01:36:59,640
It feels wonderful.

888
01:37:32,130 --> 01:37:34,360
Here... Sorry! Here you are!

889
01:37:36,970 --> 01:37:40,120
- You guys are gonna win.
I know it. - So do I.

890
01:37:40,650 --> 01:37:45,330
Here's the keys. There's food
in the fridge and do not...

891
01:37:45,410 --> 01:37:48,250
Mom, go.
You're gonna miss your plane.

892
01:37:48,330 --> 01:37:50,930
Mom, I need...

893
01:37:52,490 --> 01:37:55,250
There's nothing broken in my brain.

894
01:37:55,930 --> 01:37:58,490
- I know.
- Bye, Donnie.

895
01:38:03,570 --> 01:38:06,490
Ok, go. Go!

896
01:38:29,370 --> 01:38:30,930
Hello, Donnie.

897
01:38:31,690 --> 01:38:32,760
It's Friday.

898
01:38:32,850 --> 01:38:36,610
Shouldrt you be off with
your friends, scaring old people?

899
01:38:41,570 --> 01:38:45,570
- What's going on? - I don't know.
That's a good question.

900
01:38:47,650 --> 01:38:52,360
I'm no longer your English teacher.
They fired me.

901
01:38:52,930 --> 01:38:56,720
That's bullshit!
You're the only good teacher here.

902
01:38:59,930 --> 01:39:01,130
Thank you.

903
01:39:03,650 --> 01:39:05,410
What's "cellar door"?

904
01:39:07,170 --> 01:39:09,480
This famous linguist once said

905
01:39:09,570 --> 01:39:13,200
that of all the phrases
in the English language,

906
01:39:13,290 --> 01:39:17,410
of all the endless combinations
of words in all of history,

907
01:39:17,490 --> 01:39:20,530
"cellar door"
is the most beautiful.

908
01:39:20,610 --> 01:39:22,490
"Cellar door."

909
01:39:56,690 --> 01:40:00,650
I promise that one day everything's
gonna be better for you.

910
01:40:02,970 --> 01:40:04,250
Shut up!

911
01:40:18,370 --> 01:40:22,050
- I want to talk about your past.
- No-

912
01:40:22,930 --> 01:40:25,930
I want to talk
about you and your parents.

913
01:40:27,450 --> 01:40:31,050
They didn't buy me
what I wanted for Christmas.

914
01:40:31,770 --> 01:40:34,570
What did you want for Christmas
that year?

915
01:40:35,530 --> 01:40:37,970
Hungry Hungry Hippos.

916
01:40:39,930 --> 01:40:44,050
How did you feel, being denied
these Hungry Hungry Hippos?

917
01:40:45,250 --> 01:40:48,770
- Regret.
- What else makes you feel regret?

918
01:40:52,010 --> 01:40:55,970
- That I did it again.
- You did it again?

919
01:40:57,850 --> 01:41:01,850
I flooded my school and I burned
down that pervert's house.

920
01:41:04,850 --> 01:41:08,320
I only have a few days left
before they catch me.

921
01:41:08,410 --> 01:41:10,370
Did Frank tell you
to do these things?

922
01:41:10,450 --> 01:41:14,290
I have to obey him.
He saved my life.

923
01:41:15,170 --> 01:41:18,210
I have to obey him
or I'll be left all alone.

924
01:41:18,290 --> 01:41:20,120
And then...

925
01:41:21,210 --> 01:41:25,090
And then I won't be able to figure
out what this is all about.

926
01:41:25,570 --> 01:41:28,250
I won't know his master plan.

927
01:41:29,450 --> 01:41:33,450
Do you mean God's master plan?

928
01:41:33,530 --> 01:41:35,600
Do you now believe in God?

929
01:41:35,690 --> 01:41:38,690
I have the power
to build a time machine.

930
01:41:39,690 --> 01:41:41,600
How is that possible?

931
01:41:44,330 --> 01:41:47,290
How is time travel possible,
Donnie?

932
01:41:47,890 --> 01:41:50,120
Time's up, Frank said.

933
01:41:50,490 --> 01:41:53,770
- When is this going to happen?
- Soon.

934
01:42:15,010 --> 01:42:17,210
What is going to happen?

935
01:42:21,210 --> 01:42:24,440
- Frank is gonna kill.
- Who is he going to kill?

936
01:42:29,330 --> 01:42:32,450
- Who is he going to kill?
- I can see him!

937
01:42:37,650 --> 01:42:39,930
The sky's gonna open up.

938
01:42:46,450 --> 01:42:52,320
If the sky suddenly opened up,
there would be no law, no rule.

939
01:42:53,250 --> 01:42:56,610
There would only be you
and your memories,

940
01:42:57,090 --> 01:43:01,010
the choices you've made
and the people you've touched.

941
01:43:02,210 --> 01:43:07,210
If this world were to end,
there would only be you and him...

942
01:43:09,130 --> 01:43:11,040
...and no one else.

943
01:43:41,090 --> 01:43:43,730
You can stop
taking your medication.

944
01:43:43,810 --> 01:43:48,170
They're placebos.
Just pills made out of water.

945
01:43:50,010 --> 01:43:51,330
Thank you.

946
01:43:52,330 --> 01:43:53,810
Donnie...

947
01:43:55,930 --> 01:44:00,850
An atheist is someone who denies
altogether the existence of God.

948
01:44:01,210 --> 01:44:03,010
You're an agnostic.

949
01:44:03,810 --> 01:44:06,330
An agnostic is someone...

950
01:44:07,330 --> 01:44:10,960
who believes that there is
no proof of the existence of God,

951
01:44:11,050 --> 01:44:16,050
but does not deny
a possibility that God exists.

952
01:44:23,770 --> 01:44:26,000
Goodbye, Dr Thurman.

953
01:44:49,090 --> 01:44:50,160
Hey.

954
01:44:51,730 --> 01:44:53,010
I got in.

955
01:44:57,650 --> 01:44:59,330
I'm going to Harvard.

956
01:45:01,490 --> 01:45:05,040
Hey, we should totally throw
a party. Mom and Dad are gone.

957
01:45:05,130 --> 01:45:08,410
It's Halloween.
We could get away with it.

958
01:45:08,490 --> 01:45:12,010
Ok. But it has to be small.

959
01:45:44,730 --> 01:45:48,250
We got eggs, water balloons
and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.

960
01:45:48,330 --> 01:45:50,530
I stole four beers from my dad.

961
01:45:50,610 --> 01:45:54,000
- We got a keg.
- Keg beer is for pussies.

962
01:46:17,290 --> 01:46:19,930
Rose, this is Lilian Thurman.

963
01:46:20,570 --> 01:46:24,200
It is important that you call me
as soon as you get this message.

964
01:46:24,290 --> 01:46:25,490
Thank you.

965
01:46:50,610 --> 01:46:51,650
You ok?

966
01:46:53,890 --> 01:46:55,850
Yeah. My mom's gone.

967
01:46:58,050 --> 01:46:59,570
You want to come in?

968
01:47:23,530 --> 01:47:25,440
I don't know.

969
01:47:25,530 --> 01:47:29,690
She didn't leave a note
and the house was all messed up.

970
01:47:31,130 --> 01:47:33,040
But you're ok.

971
01:47:36,170 --> 01:47:37,890
Did you call the cops?

972
01:47:38,930 --> 01:47:40,690
Yeah, they said
I should leave the house

973
01:47:40,770 --> 01:47:44,560
and that I should go
to a safe place.

974
01:47:46,610 --> 01:47:51,000
I'm just so scared. I keep thinking
something awful is happening and...

975
01:47:53,210 --> 01:47:55,770
It's my fucking stepdad, I know it.

976
01:48:05,730 --> 01:48:09,730
I guess some people are just born
with tragedy in their blood.

977
01:48:14,650 --> 01:48:18,490
- Hey, have you seen Frank?
- No, they went on a beer run.

978
01:48:22,490 --> 01:48:26,250
If you're there, please pick up.
Oh, well, Good news,

979
01:48:26,330 --> 01:48:28,800
The girls got
three and a half stars

980
01:48:28,890 --> 01:48:31,410
and are in the quarter-finals.

981
01:48:31,490 --> 01:48:34,530
Samantha was amazing, Anyway...

982
01:48:34,610 --> 01:48:37,170
We're taking the red-eye back
tonight and...

983
01:48:37,250 --> 01:48:40,130
- Mom, we've got to leave.
- Yeah. Ok.

984
01:48:40,210 --> 01:48:43,170
We should arrive
8:30 in the morning.

985
01:48:44,050 --> 01:48:48,050
Um... I hope everything's...
I hope everything's all right.

986
01:48:48,570 --> 01:48:50,210
I love you. Bye.

987
01:50:53,130 --> 01:50:55,520
- Come with me.
- Where are we going?

988
01:50:55,850 --> 01:50:58,610
- Donnie?
- Look, we gotta go.

989
01:50:59,770 --> 01:51:03,130
- We've got to see Grandma Death.
- Why? About the book?

990
01:51:03,210 --> 01:51:04,890
- No, it's Frank.
- Donnie...

991
01:51:04,970 --> 01:51:07,170
Time is running out! We gotta go.

992
01:51:53,450 --> 01:51:56,600
Donnie, nobody's here.
Let's just forget about it.

993
01:51:58,490 --> 01:52:00,400
"Cellar door."

994
01:52:00,490 --> 01:52:01,770
What?

995
01:53:04,330 --> 01:53:05,970
Donnie! Donnie!

996
01:53:09,930 --> 01:53:11,130
Donnie!

997
01:53:12,170 --> 01:53:15,530
- Why the fuck are you here?
- Oh, my God!

998
01:53:19,690 --> 01:53:21,520
- You're dead!
- What do we do?

999
01:53:21,610 --> 01:53:23,680
- Shit!
- Leave them alone!

1000
01:53:27,770 --> 01:53:30,370
Don't fucking move!
Don't fucking move!

1001
01:53:39,130 --> 01:53:40,650
There's a car!

1002
01:53:42,330 --> 01:53:44,850
- Get the hell out of here!
- Come on!

1003
01:53:45,850 --> 01:53:48,160
Seth, a car's coming. Let's go!

1004
01:53:48,250 --> 01:53:50,690
I have a bigger knife now.

1005
01:53:51,930 --> 01:53:52,970
Fuck!

1006
01:54:00,330 --> 01:54:02,640
Did you call the fucking cops?

1007
01:54:02,730 --> 01:54:05,410
- Deus ex machina.
- What did you just say?

1008
01:54:07,490 --> 01:54:10,770
- What the fuck did you say?
- Our saviour.

1009
01:54:15,330 --> 01:54:16,160
Donnie!

1010
01:54:47,250 --> 01:54:48,570
Frank...

1011
01:55:14,290 --> 01:55:15,730
Is she dead?

1012
01:55:24,810 --> 01:55:28,360
What were you guys doing
in the middle of the road?!

1013
01:55:36,090 --> 01:55:37,210
Go home!

1014
01:55:38,490 --> 01:55:41,290
Go and tell your parents
everything will be ok.

1015
01:55:42,850 --> 01:55:44,170
Go!

1016
01:56:11,890 --> 01:56:17,410
The storm is coming.
You must hurry.

1017
01:58:51,050 --> 01:58:53,280
I'm going home.

1018
02:00:59,730 --> 02:01:03,770
Dear Roberta Sparrow,
I've reached the end of your book

1019
02:01:04,250 --> 02:01:07,330
and there's so many things
I need to ask you.

1020
02:01:08,170 --> 02:01:11,370
Sometimes I'm afraid
of what you might tell me.

1021
02:01:15,290 --> 02:01:17,330
Sometimes I'm afraid
that you'll tell me

1022
02:01:17,410 --> 02:01:19,800
this is not a work of fiction.

1023
02:01:20,570 --> 02:01:25,010
I can only hope that the answer
will come to me in my sleep.

1024
02:01:26,250 --> 02:01:28,930
I hope that when the world ends

1025
02:01:29,010 --> 02:01:32,090
I can breathe a sigh of relief

1026
02:01:32,170 --> 02:01:35,850
because there will be
so much to look forward to.

1027
02:06:21,930 --> 02:06:24,450
Hey. What's going on?

1028
02:06:26,330 --> 02:06:30,690
Horrible accident.
My neighbour... got killed.

1029
02:06:32,330 --> 02:06:35,850
- What happened?
- Got smushed by a jet engine.

1030
02:06:42,410 --> 02:06:44,090
What was his name?

1031
02:06:44,610 --> 02:06:46,840
Donnie. Donnie Darko.

1032
02:06:49,770 --> 02:06:52,130
I feel bad for his family.

1033
02:06:52,850 --> 02:06:54,290
Yeah.

1034
02:07:01,690 --> 02:07:03,650
Did you know him?

1035
02:07:06,850 --> 02:07:08,680
No.
