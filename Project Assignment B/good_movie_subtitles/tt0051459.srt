1
00:02:42,572 --> 00:02:45,006
We want Pollitt. Brick Pollitt.

2
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:46,201
We want Pollitt.

3
00:02:46,372 --> 00:02:47,771
Brick Pollitt.

4
00:04:18,212 --> 00:04:19,281
Don't you do that!

5
00:04:19,812 --> 00:04:21,609
I'm warning you, Trixie.

6
00:04:21,812 --> 00:04:22,449
Gooper!

7
00:04:22,652 --> 00:04:25,849
Can't you stop your child
from putting her hands in the ice cream?

8
00:04:30,092 --> 00:04:32,765
Couldn't you at least wash your hands
before you did that?

9
00:04:44,052 --> 00:04:44,802
Maggie!

10
00:04:45,012 --> 00:04:46,843
You stop that!

11
00:04:47,052 --> 00:04:49,407
How could you do that to a child?

12
00:04:49,932 --> 00:04:52,162
Like this, honey.

13
00:05:00,412 --> 00:05:02,562
Did you see what she did?

14
00:05:02,772 --> 00:05:05,764
I told her to wash her hands first.

15
00:05:20,412 --> 00:05:23,927
One of those no-neck monsters
hit me with some ice cream.

16
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:27,251
Why do you call Gooper's kiddies
''no-neck monsters''?

17
00:05:27,412 --> 00:05:30,290
Because your brother's children
have got no necks.

18
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:36,201
Their fat little heads sit on their fat bodies
without a bit of connection.

19
00:05:36,372 --> 00:05:37,725
That's too bad.

20
00:05:37,932 --> 00:05:41,561
Especially 'cause, if they have no necks
you can't wring them. Right, honey?

21
00:05:45,652 --> 00:05:46,528
Here we are!

22
00:05:46,732 --> 00:05:48,051
Come on, Buster, Sonny.

23
00:05:48,212 --> 00:05:50,521
Go get in the car. We're all going to go.

24
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:55,530
Did you ever hear so many dog's names
tagged on to children?

25
00:05:55,732 --> 00:05:59,088
They've got five monsters
and number six coming up.

26
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:02,967
They've brought the whole bunch here
like animals to display at a county fair.

27
00:06:03,172 --> 00:06:05,402
It's so obvious, it's disgusting.

28
00:06:05,612 --> 00:06:07,250
It's obvious what they're up to.

29
00:06:07,772 --> 00:06:10,002
What are they up to, Maggie?

30
00:06:11,892 --> 00:06:14,360
I'll tell you what they're up to, boy of mine.

31
00:06:14,572 --> 00:06:17,689
They're up to cutting you out
of your father's estate.

32
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:20,682
Everybody knows Big Daddy's...

33
00:06:20,892 --> 00:06:22,530
...dying of....

34
00:06:23,492 --> 00:06:26,848
I ought to send Sister Woman a bill
for a new pair of stockings.

35
00:06:27,492 --> 00:06:28,481
Do we?

36
00:06:28,732 --> 00:06:29,847
Do we what?

37
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,810
Know that Big Daddy is dying of....

38
00:06:34,532 --> 00:06:36,124
Don't you believe it?

39
00:06:36,532 --> 00:06:38,284
You'll know soon enough.

40
00:06:38,492 --> 00:06:40,210
Suppose he is?

41
00:06:40,412 --> 00:06:42,209
There's some things you've got to face.

42
00:06:42,292 --> 00:06:45,443
There's some things in this world
you've simply got to face.

43
00:06:45,852 --> 00:06:48,764
Why was Big Daddy in that horrible clinic
for six weeks...

44
00:06:48,852 --> 00:06:51,082
...if the examination didn't show anything?

45
00:06:51,172 --> 00:06:55,165
Why did Brother Man bring his whole tribe
down here in this sticky heat?

46
00:06:55,732 --> 00:06:58,371
And why so many allusions
to you and Rainbow Hill?

47
00:06:59,212 --> 00:07:00,770
You know what Rainbow Hill is?

48
00:07:00,892 --> 00:07:04,487
It's a place that's famous for treating
famous alcoholics and dope fiends.

49
00:07:04,572 --> 00:07:05,846
I'm not famous.

50
00:07:06,052 --> 00:07:06,768
No...

51
00:07:07,012 --> 00:07:08,604
...and you don't take dope.

52
00:07:08,812 --> 00:07:11,372
Otherwise you'd be a perfect candidate
for Rainbow Hill.

53
00:07:11,572 --> 00:07:14,689
That's where Brother Man's
going to tell Big Daddy to ship you.

54
00:07:15,252 --> 00:07:17,129
Over my dead body!

55
00:07:17,652 --> 00:07:19,483
Rainbow Hill.

56
00:07:22,412 --> 00:07:25,324
With you out of the way,
Gooper gets hold of the estate...

57
00:07:25,532 --> 00:07:28,808
...signs the checks, and cuts off our credit
whenever he wants.

58
00:07:29,012 --> 00:07:31,003
How'd you like that, baby?

59
00:07:31,372 --> 00:07:33,010
You're doing just about everything...

60
00:07:33,172 --> 00:07:36,767
...to aid and abet them
in grabbing control, after Big Daddy--

61
00:07:43,092 --> 00:07:44,445
Well, you are.

62
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:47,651
Quitting work,
devoting yourself to drinking!

63
00:07:47,852 --> 00:07:50,810
Breaking your ankle last night
on the high school field.

64
00:07:52,052 --> 00:07:53,201
Brick?

65
00:07:54,412 --> 00:07:56,642
We've got one thing on our side.

66
00:07:57,132 --> 00:07:58,281
No, two things.

67
00:07:58,492 --> 00:08:00,050
Are my seams straight?

68
00:08:01,092 --> 00:08:02,889
Big Daddy dotes on you, honey.

69
00:08:03,092 --> 00:08:05,925
He just can't stand Brother Man
and his wife...

70
00:08:06,132 --> 00:08:08,282
...that fertility monster.
She's odious to him.

71
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:09,482
I can tell.

72
00:08:09,692 --> 00:08:11,967
Just like I can tell he likes me.

73
00:08:12,172 --> 00:08:14,891
That's the second thing
we've got on our side.

74
00:08:20,052 --> 00:08:21,883
He likes me.

75
00:08:22,892 --> 00:08:26,567
The way he looks me up and down,
and over....

76
00:08:27,572 --> 00:08:29,483
He's still got an eye for girls.

77
00:08:29,692 --> 00:08:31,683
That kind of talk is disgusting.

78
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:36,568
Anybody ever tell you
you were a back-aching Puritan?

79
00:08:36,932 --> 00:08:40,163
I think it's mighty fine how that old fellow,
on death's doorstep...

80
00:08:40,252 --> 00:08:43,642
...takes in my shape with what
I consider deserved appreciation.

81
00:08:45,132 --> 00:08:49,648
Gooper still cherishes the illusion
he took a giant step up the social ladder...

82
00:08:49,852 --> 00:08:53,128
...when he married Mae Flynn
of the no-neck Memphis Flynns...

83
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,892
...because she was queen
of the Cotton Carnival.

84
00:08:56,092 --> 00:08:58,845
I can just see Gooper
falling for Her Majesty...

85
00:08:59,052 --> 00:09:03,011
...sitting on that brass throne,
riding that tacky float down Main Street...

86
00:09:03,212 --> 00:09:07,922
...smiling and bowing, and blowing kisses
to all the trash on the street.

87
00:09:09,012 --> 00:09:10,968
You know what happened to her?

88
00:09:11,412 --> 00:09:12,845
No, what happened to her?

89
00:09:13,692 --> 00:09:16,604
Somebody spat tobacco juice in her face.

90
00:09:16,812 --> 00:09:20,248
Some drunk at the Hotel Gayoso
leaned out the window and said:

91
00:09:20,452 --> 00:09:23,171
''Hey, Queenie! ''

92
00:09:23,372 --> 00:09:26,648
Sister Mae looked up and smiled
and waved...

93
00:09:26,852 --> 00:09:29,969
...and that drunk shot a squirt
of tobacco juice...

94
00:09:30,132 --> 00:09:32,088
...right in her face.

95
00:09:43,932 --> 00:09:45,729
Why are you looking at me like that?

96
00:09:46,772 --> 00:09:48,649
Like what?

97
00:09:49,132 --> 00:09:50,929
Like you were just looking.

98
00:09:53,172 --> 00:09:55,242
I wasn't conscious of looking at you.

99
00:09:59,372 --> 00:10:00,521
I was conscious of it.

100
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:13,246
-If you were thinking the same thing--
-No, Maggie!

101
00:10:13,452 --> 00:10:15,886
-Why not?
-Will you please keep your voice down?

102
00:10:16,052 --> 00:10:17,371
No!

103
00:10:18,612 --> 00:10:20,523
I know you better than you think.

104
00:10:20,732 --> 00:10:22,529
I've seen that look before...

105
00:10:22,732 --> 00:10:24,484
...and I know what it used to mean.

106
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:29,049
-And it still means the same thing now.
-You're not the same woman now, Maggie.

107
00:10:29,452 --> 00:10:31,647
Don't you think I know that?

108
00:10:31,972 --> 00:10:34,406
-Don't you think I know--
-Know what, Maggie?

109
00:10:34,812 --> 00:10:37,849
That I've gone through
this horrible transformation.

110
00:10:38,052 --> 00:10:40,202
I've become hard and frantic and cruel.

111
00:10:40,372 --> 00:10:42,806
Are you planning on meeting
Big Daddy's plane?

112
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,569
I get so lonely.

113
00:10:53,012 --> 00:10:54,889
Everybody gets that.

114
00:10:56,852 --> 00:10:59,366
Living with somebody you love can be...

115
00:10:59,572 --> 00:11:02,291
...lonelier than living entirely alone...

116
00:11:03,252 --> 00:11:05,482
...when the one you love doesn't love you.

117
00:11:16,332 --> 00:11:19,244
You can't even stand
drinking out of the same glass, can you?

118
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:20,686
Would you like to live alone?

119
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:21,882
No!

120
00:11:27,732 --> 00:11:29,563
No, I wouldn't.

121
00:11:32,852 --> 00:11:35,286
Why can't you lose your good looks, Brick?

122
00:11:35,492 --> 00:11:37,483
Most drinking men lose theirs.

123
00:11:37,652 --> 00:11:39,210
Why can't you?

124
00:11:40,052 --> 00:11:43,840
I think you've even got better looking
since you went on the bottle.

125
00:11:46,892 --> 00:11:48,723
You were such a wonderful lover.

126
00:11:48,932 --> 00:11:50,570
You'll be late!

127
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,402
You were so exciting to be in love with.

128
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,682
Mostly, I guess, because you were....

129
00:12:01,172 --> 00:12:02,890
If I thought you'd...

130
00:12:03,172 --> 00:12:05,925
...never make love to me again...

131
00:12:08,932 --> 00:12:13,528
...I'd find the longest, sharpest knife
and stick it straight into my heart.

132
00:12:14,252 --> 00:12:16,004
I'd do that.

133
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:23,729
How long does this have to go on,
this punishment?

134
00:12:23,892 --> 00:12:26,611
Haven't I served my term?
Can I get a pardon?

135
00:12:26,772 --> 00:12:31,562
Your finishing-school voice sounds like
you were running upstairs to say, ''Fire! ''

136
00:12:33,372 --> 00:12:34,964
Is it any wonder?

137
00:12:35,812 --> 00:12:37,768
You know what I feel like?

138
00:12:37,972 --> 00:12:40,532
I feel all the time like a cat
on a hot tin roof.

139
00:12:40,692 --> 00:12:42,284
Then jump off the roof, Maggie.

140
00:12:42,492 --> 00:12:45,962
Cats jump off roofs and land uninjured.
Do it. Jump.

141
00:12:46,172 --> 00:12:47,082
Jump where?

142
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:48,645
Into what?

143
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:50,410
Take a lover.

144
00:12:52,612 --> 00:12:54,568
I don't deserve that!

145
00:13:00,692 --> 00:13:03,252
I can't see any man but you.

146
00:13:04,692 --> 00:13:07,968
Even with my eyes closed, I just see you.

147
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,922
Why can't you get ugly, Brick?

148
00:13:15,092 --> 00:13:18,971
Why can't you get fat or ugly or something,
so I can stand it?

149
00:13:20,172 --> 00:13:23,482
You'll make out fine.
Your kind always does.

150
00:13:23,692 --> 00:13:25,648
I'm more determined than you think.

151
00:13:25,852 --> 00:13:27,649
I'll win all right.

152
00:13:27,852 --> 00:13:29,171
Win what?

153
00:13:30,252 --> 00:13:33,801
What is the victory
of a cat on a hot tin roof?

154
00:13:37,932 --> 00:13:40,366
Just staying on it, I guess...

155
00:13:40,532 --> 00:13:42,443
...as long as she can.

156
00:13:54,012 --> 00:13:56,845
Calm down. Not yet. Now wait a minute.

157
00:13:57,092 --> 00:13:58,286
Where are the flowers?

158
00:13:58,452 --> 00:14:00,841
Aren't you putting it on a little thick?

159
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,131
Get ready, now!

160
00:14:20,412 --> 00:14:22,880
Mama, she didn't bring anything
for Big Daddy.

161
00:14:23,252 --> 00:14:26,483
Pretty seedy looking flowers
for Big Daddy, huh, Gooper?

162
00:14:26,692 --> 00:14:27,920
I picked them myself.

163
00:14:28,132 --> 00:14:29,963
Looks like she picked them off a grave.

164
00:14:30,132 --> 00:14:34,284
Don't talk about graves when we don't
know if Big Daddy's going to live or die.

165
00:14:39,172 --> 00:14:39,888
Get ready.

166
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:47,051
Hello, Mae.

167
00:14:47,252 --> 00:14:48,765
Hello, children.

168
00:15:02,332 --> 00:15:04,288
Doc, isn't it great?

169
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:10,049
Kiss me!

170
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,204
Kiss your grandmother.

171
00:15:13,772 --> 00:15:15,251
Darling Big Daddy!

172
00:15:15,412 --> 00:15:17,767
You look fine, Big Daddy.

173
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:20,488
Doc, do you want to tell them the news?

174
00:15:20,852 --> 00:15:24,322
The exploratory operation proved
there's nothing wrong with Big Daddy.

175
00:15:24,532 --> 00:15:25,647
Nothing at all!

176
00:15:26,172 --> 00:15:28,561
Just a spastic colon. And that's all.

177
00:15:28,772 --> 00:15:30,728
-Great news!
-Isn't that great news?

178
00:15:31,452 --> 00:15:33,488
That's the best birthday present of all.

179
00:15:33,972 --> 00:15:35,007
Where's Brick?

180
00:15:35,212 --> 00:15:37,328
Uncle Brick got drunk and broke his leg.

181
00:15:37,532 --> 00:15:38,885
-How?
-What's that?

182
00:15:39,092 --> 00:15:41,970
Got drunk again and tried to jump
the high hurdles at 3:00 AM.

183
00:15:42,172 --> 00:15:44,367
That poor boy still thinks he's an athlete.

184
00:15:44,572 --> 00:15:46,449
Couldn't keep it out of the local paper.

185
00:15:46,532 --> 00:15:47,885
AP got hold of it too.

186
00:15:48,052 --> 00:15:49,610
Yeah, and U/P...

187
00:15:49,812 --> 00:15:53,487
...and thanks to your professional
legal advice, every other P.

188
00:15:53,932 --> 00:15:55,160
Let's go home.

189
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,442
Don't you want to ride with the children?

190
00:15:57,652 --> 00:15:58,926
No!

191
00:16:00,212 --> 00:16:02,931
He's his sassy old self again, all right!

192
00:16:03,132 --> 00:16:04,804
Be quiet, woman!

193
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:14,205
Hush up!

194
00:16:24,412 --> 00:16:25,765
Welcome home, Cap'n Pollitt.

195
00:16:34,252 --> 00:16:37,085
I'm going to live, Maggie. I'm going to live.

196
00:16:37,612 --> 00:16:40,206
They had me real scared.

197
00:16:40,612 --> 00:16:42,125
I've wasted so much time.

198
00:16:42,332 --> 00:16:45,244
I've got a million different kinds
of feelings left in me.

199
00:16:45,452 --> 00:16:49,047
And I'm going to use them.
I'm going to use them all.

200
00:17:26,972 --> 00:17:30,328
Why did you and Brick
suddenly drive up from New Orleans?

201
00:17:30,532 --> 00:17:32,363
For your birthday, what else?

202
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:35,689
I had one last year and the year before.
Didn't see you then.

203
00:17:35,892 --> 00:17:37,962
You know how Brick is sometimes.

204
00:17:38,132 --> 00:17:40,851
Maybe he thought he was coming
to my funeral instead.

205
00:17:41,052 --> 00:17:44,010
Brick loves you! He does!

206
00:17:45,852 --> 00:17:47,570
But does he love you?

207
00:17:48,732 --> 00:17:51,371
What do you want? Proof?

208
00:17:52,212 --> 00:17:53,884
If I was married to you three years...

209
00:17:54,092 --> 00:17:56,083
...you'd have the living proof.

210
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:58,647
You'd have three kids
and a fourth in the oven.

211
00:18:01,332 --> 00:18:04,130
Get me out of this. I want to talk to Brick.

212
00:18:10,812 --> 00:18:13,451
He wants some more ice, Miss Margaret.

213
00:18:17,412 --> 00:18:18,367
''We love you when we're with you

214
00:18:18,572 --> 00:18:20,324
''And we love you out of sight

215
00:18:24,012 --> 00:18:26,890
''Big Mama, too''

216
00:18:40,212 --> 00:18:41,725
I've got news, honey!

217
00:18:41,932 --> 00:18:43,331
Big news.

218
00:18:43,572 --> 00:18:45,608
Big Daddy's going to live.

219
00:18:47,892 --> 00:18:50,326
That's right, he's a well man.

220
00:18:50,532 --> 00:18:54,047
That's what Big Mama said and Dr. Baugh
was right there with them.

221
00:18:54,332 --> 00:18:56,766
You should've seen Mae and Gooper's face.

222
00:18:57,292 --> 00:18:59,726
They almost dropped dead
from shock themselves.

223
00:18:59,892 --> 00:19:00,802
He's all right?

224
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:02,604
Feeling like 40...

225
00:19:02,772 --> 00:19:03,966
...and talking like 20.

226
00:19:04,052 --> 00:19:06,043
And we can drive back
to New Orleans tonight.

227
00:19:06,132 --> 00:19:09,169
-I'm taking no chances on moving you.
-I won't break.

228
00:19:09,412 --> 00:19:12,882
Or letting them poison
Big Daddy's mind against you.

229
00:19:13,532 --> 00:19:17,491
I just want you to get dressed
and come to Big Daddy's birthday party.

230
00:19:17,772 --> 00:19:20,969
First thing Big Daddy asked about was you.

231
00:19:21,172 --> 00:19:23,732
Big Daddy! Now what makes him so big?

232
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:26,681
His big heart, his big belly...

233
00:19:26,892 --> 00:19:28,120
...or his big money?

234
00:19:29,412 --> 00:19:31,562
The heat has made you cross.

235
00:19:31,732 --> 00:19:33,290
Give me my crutch.

236
00:19:35,812 --> 00:19:38,121
Why don't you put on
your silk pajamas, honey...

237
00:19:38,332 --> 00:19:40,243
...and come on down to the party?

238
00:19:40,452 --> 00:19:42,647
There's a lovely cool breeze.

239
00:19:43,332 --> 00:19:45,163
Give me my crutch, Maggie.

240
00:19:46,332 --> 00:19:48,448
Lean on me, baby.

241
00:19:54,932 --> 00:19:57,571
You've got a nice smell about you.

242
00:19:59,252 --> 00:20:01,812
-Was your bathwater cool?
-No.

243
00:20:03,492 --> 00:20:06,689
I know something
that would make you cool and fresh.

244
00:20:07,572 --> 00:20:09,164
Alcohol rub.

245
00:20:09,812 --> 00:20:11,086
Cologne.

246
00:20:11,892 --> 00:20:13,371
No thanks. We'd smell alike.

247
00:20:13,452 --> 00:20:15,920
Like a couple of cats in the heat.

248
00:20:25,732 --> 00:20:27,404
It's cool on the lawn.

249
00:20:27,612 --> 00:20:31,685
I am not going down there.
Not for you and not for Big Daddy!

250
00:20:34,452 --> 00:20:36,329
At least give him this present...

251
00:20:36,532 --> 00:20:39,922
...that I remembered to buy for you,
for his birthday.

252
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:42,363
Just write a few words on this card.

253
00:20:42,572 --> 00:20:44,051
You write something.

254
00:20:44,252 --> 00:20:47,688
It's got to be your handwriting.
It's your present.

255
00:20:47,892 --> 00:20:49,245
I didn't get him a present.

256
00:20:49,452 --> 00:20:50,680
What's the difference?

257
00:20:50,892 --> 00:20:52,962
If there's no difference, you write the card!

258
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:55,885
-And have him know you didn't remember?
-I didn't remember!

259
00:20:56,052 --> 00:20:58,008
You don't have to prove it to him!

260
00:20:58,212 --> 00:21:00,282
Just write, ''Love, Brick''...

261
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:01,641
...for heaven's sake!

262
00:21:01,812 --> 00:21:04,690
-You've got to.
-I don't have to do anything!

263
00:21:04,892 --> 00:21:08,009
You forget the conditions I agreed on
to stay living with you!

264
00:21:08,092 --> 00:21:12,051
I'm not living with you.
We occupy the same cage, that's all!

265
00:21:20,052 --> 00:21:24,364
That's the first time you've raised
your voice in a long time.

266
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:28,485
A crack in the stone wall?

267
00:21:34,332 --> 00:21:37,005
I think that's a fine sign. Mighty fine.

268
00:21:42,492 --> 00:21:43,686
What did you do that for?

269
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:50,132
To give us a little privacy for a while.

270
00:21:51,212 --> 00:21:53,043
Don't make a fool of yourself.

271
00:21:56,932 --> 00:21:59,571
I don't mind making a fool
of myself over you.

272
00:21:59,732 --> 00:22:02,200
I mind. I feel embarrassed for you.

273
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:03,965
Feel embarrassed!

274
00:22:04,852 --> 00:22:05,967
I can't live on this way.

275
00:22:06,132 --> 00:22:10,045
-You agreed to accept that condition!
-I know I did, but I can't!

276
00:22:12,252 --> 00:22:13,401
Let go.

277
00:22:19,572 --> 00:22:21,290
Let go, Maggie!

278
00:22:38,492 --> 00:22:39,720
Son!

279
00:22:42,212 --> 00:22:45,010
We've got the most wonderful news
about Big Daddy!

280
00:22:45,372 --> 00:22:46,930
What's this door doing locked?

281
00:22:47,092 --> 00:22:49,322
You think there's robbers in the house?

282
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,329
Brick's getting dressed, Big Mama.

283
00:22:52,532 --> 00:22:53,806
He's still getting dressed.

284
00:22:54,012 --> 00:22:56,924
It won't be the first time
I've seen Brick not dressed.

285
00:22:57,132 --> 00:22:58,406
Open this door.

286
00:23:08,532 --> 00:23:09,487
Brick, honey!

287
00:23:09,652 --> 00:23:11,370
Sweetheart, how does your leg feel?

288
00:23:11,572 --> 00:23:14,609
Come out of there. I want to give you
the news about Big Daddy.

289
00:23:14,772 --> 00:23:16,808
I told him already.

290
00:23:17,012 --> 00:23:18,923
I just hate locked doors in the house.

291
00:23:19,132 --> 00:23:22,568
I know you do
but people need privacy, don't they?

292
00:23:22,772 --> 00:23:24,842
No, ma'am, not in my house.

293
00:23:25,012 --> 00:23:28,288
What did you take this off for?
It looked so sweet on you.

294
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:30,847
Not sweet enough
for Big Daddy's birthday party.

295
00:23:32,332 --> 00:23:33,321
Out!

296
00:23:34,772 --> 00:23:35,887
Out, you little monster!

297
00:23:43,212 --> 00:23:46,443
Mae and Gooper are so touchy
about their children.

298
00:23:46,612 --> 00:23:50,400
You hardly even dare suggest
there's any room for improvement.

299
00:23:50,612 --> 00:23:52,091
Brick, hurry on out!

300
00:23:52,292 --> 00:23:55,090
Shoot, Maggie, you just don't like children.

301
00:23:55,292 --> 00:23:57,760
Why that's not true. I adore them.

302
00:23:57,972 --> 00:23:59,087
Well brought up.

303
00:23:59,252 --> 00:24:01,561
Why not have some, then,
and bring them up well?

304
00:24:01,652 --> 00:24:04,485
-Instead of picking on theirs?
-Big Mama!

305
00:24:04,692 --> 00:24:07,570
Hugh and Betsy have got to go.
They're waiting to say goodbye.

306
00:24:07,652 --> 00:24:10,325
I'll be right down.
Tell them to hold their horses.

307
00:24:11,892 --> 00:24:12,768
Where's Brick?

308
00:24:22,172 --> 00:24:24,845
What you said about having children....

309
00:24:25,012 --> 00:24:27,003
It's still kind of a secret, but--

310
00:24:28,572 --> 00:24:31,405
Shoot, Maggie! Stop playing so dumb.

311
00:24:31,692 --> 00:24:33,683
Is he still drinking this stuff much?

312
00:24:35,292 --> 00:24:38,125
-He may have had a little highball.
-Don't laugh about it.

313
00:24:38,332 --> 00:24:41,244
Some men stop drinking when they marry.
Others start.

314
00:24:41,452 --> 00:24:43,408
-He never drank before--
-That's not fair!

315
00:24:43,492 --> 00:24:45,960
Fair or not, I want to ask you a question.

316
00:24:46,572 --> 00:24:47,971
Do you make Brick happy?

317
00:24:49,092 --> 00:24:50,411
Well?

318
00:24:52,892 --> 00:24:55,326
-Why don't you ask if he makes me happy?
-I know--

319
00:24:55,412 --> 00:24:56,401
It works both ways.

320
00:24:56,492 --> 00:25:00,724
Something ain't right.
You're childless and my son drinks.

321
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:03,605
-We're leaving, Big Mama.
-I'm coming!

322
00:25:03,852 --> 00:25:05,888
When a marriage goes on the rocks...

323
00:25:06,092 --> 00:25:08,686
...the rocks are there, right there!

324
00:25:08,892 --> 00:25:10,166
Goodbye, Ida.

325
00:25:10,372 --> 00:25:11,930
I'm coming.

326
00:25:17,852 --> 00:25:19,843
That's not fair.

327
00:25:20,212 --> 00:25:22,043
All right, I'm coming.

328
00:25:26,612 --> 00:25:28,284
Is Brick here?

329
00:25:28,972 --> 00:25:31,247
I thought I'd check his ankle.

330
00:25:31,812 --> 00:25:33,165
Is it giving him much pain?

331
00:25:33,372 --> 00:25:36,682
You know how Brick is, Doc.
He hardly ever complains.

332
00:25:36,852 --> 00:25:40,447
Even when he had
that awful back injury in football.

333
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,721
Brick's birthday present for Big Daddy.

334
00:25:45,732 --> 00:25:48,326
I think they're fixing
to sit down at the table.

335
00:25:52,772 --> 00:25:55,764
You forgot to write out the card, honey.

336
00:25:58,772 --> 00:25:59,807
Thanks, Doc.

337
00:26:06,892 --> 00:26:08,211
Can I get you something cool?

338
00:26:08,972 --> 00:26:09,961
No, thanks.

339
00:26:10,372 --> 00:26:12,090
How's the ankle?

340
00:26:14,772 --> 00:26:16,364
Itches some.

341
00:26:17,172 --> 00:26:20,642
Funny, that's the same leg
you tore a muscle in the....

342
00:26:21,052 --> 00:26:22,280
'Bama State.

343
00:26:22,492 --> 00:26:23,925
Twenty-one to--

344
00:26:24,132 --> 00:26:24,803
Nothing.

345
00:26:25,012 --> 00:26:27,162
You miss football, don't you?

346
00:26:27,372 --> 00:26:29,169
Hurt much when you put weight on it?

347
00:26:29,332 --> 00:26:30,321
Some.

348
00:26:30,532 --> 00:26:34,002
Yeah, you were quite a team,
you and Skipper.

349
00:26:36,372 --> 00:26:37,964
What is it, Doc?

350
00:26:38,372 --> 00:26:41,603
You didn't leave that party
to come up and discuss my health.

351
00:26:41,972 --> 00:26:42,688
That's right.

352
00:26:42,772 --> 00:26:45,240
-I've already heard the good news--
-It's bad news.

353
00:26:46,132 --> 00:26:48,088
It's what we expected.

354
00:26:48,452 --> 00:26:50,568
It's malignant and it's terminal.

355
00:26:50,772 --> 00:26:52,649
He hasn't a chance.

356
00:26:52,852 --> 00:26:55,810
-But Maggie said, and Big Mama--
-Lies.

357
00:26:56,372 --> 00:26:57,600
I lied to them.

358
00:26:58,532 --> 00:27:00,727
I lied to him, too.

359
00:27:02,012 --> 00:27:02,967
Professional ethics.

360
00:27:04,692 --> 00:27:05,204
Gooper?

361
00:27:05,412 --> 00:27:07,926
I told him the truth
coming in from the airfield.

362
00:27:08,532 --> 00:27:09,681
He's going to die.

363
00:27:11,492 --> 00:27:12,971
He's going to die.

364
00:27:21,492 --> 00:27:24,529
''Jesus wants me for a sunbeam''

365
00:27:27,172 --> 00:27:29,481
What kind of truth is that?

366
00:27:48,052 --> 00:27:50,964
''Jesus wants me for a sunbeam

367
00:27:51,172 --> 00:27:53,606
''To shine for him each day

368
00:27:54,972 --> 00:27:57,964
''In every way try to please him

369
00:27:58,172 --> 00:28:00,686
''At home, at school, at play

370
00:28:01,492 --> 00:28:02,925
''A sunbeam

371
00:28:05,092 --> 00:28:07,890
''Jesus wants me for a sunbeam

372
00:28:08,372 --> 00:28:10,966
''A sunbeam, a sunbeam

373
00:28:11,412 --> 00:28:14,131
''I'll be a sunbeam for him''

374
00:28:14,412 --> 00:28:15,731
Amen!

375
00:28:16,252 --> 00:28:19,050
-Did you like the singing, Big Daddy?
-Pass the black-eyed peas.

376
00:28:19,732 --> 00:28:23,088
Look at Big Daddy eat!
Ain't it something to thank your stars for?

377
00:28:23,252 --> 00:28:25,083
They've been practicing just for you.

378
00:28:25,172 --> 00:28:26,366
Tell them to sit and eat.

379
00:28:26,452 --> 00:28:28,329
-Children, come on.
-Over there!

380
00:28:28,532 --> 00:28:30,443
Yeah. Over there.

381
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,884
Look here. Telegrams!

382
00:28:33,092 --> 00:28:35,652
Hundreds of them from every corner
of this great state--

383
00:28:35,732 --> 00:28:37,006
Wishing you happy birthday.

384
00:28:37,172 --> 00:28:38,730
Do you want me to read them?

385
00:28:38,932 --> 00:28:40,923
One from the governor and the senator--

386
00:28:41,012 --> 00:28:44,049
It must be getting on to election time,
hey, Deacon?

387
00:28:44,212 --> 00:28:46,806
Let's remember,
we're all lambs in the same pasture.

388
00:28:47,012 --> 00:28:50,766
Everybody, including Big Daddy,
owes thanks to those in high places who--

389
00:28:50,972 --> 00:28:52,041
Gave us nothing!

390
00:28:52,212 --> 00:28:56,091
Every scrap on this table was raised
right here on this place, Deacon.

391
00:28:56,292 --> 00:29:00,490
I made a pastureland out of this place
when it was nothing but a swamp.

392
00:29:00,692 --> 00:29:03,764
And it was done with the help of God,
and not any governor.

393
00:29:04,052 --> 00:29:04,723
Amen.

394
00:29:04,932 --> 00:29:06,729
''Boom, boom and it makes me crazy''

395
00:29:06,932 --> 00:29:08,365
Great balls of fire!

396
00:29:08,572 --> 00:29:09,721
Surprise!

397
00:29:09,932 --> 00:29:12,844
-What are they up to now?
-It's part of the entertainment.

398
00:29:13,012 --> 00:29:14,843
Don't they get any intermission?

399
00:29:15,052 --> 00:29:16,531
That's funny!

400
00:29:17,012 --> 00:29:18,365
That's very funny!

401
00:29:18,572 --> 00:29:20,722
He don't mean it, Sister Woman.

402
00:29:20,932 --> 00:29:23,400
-He loves children!
-Of course he does!

403
00:29:23,572 --> 00:29:25,483
Will you put some honey on this?

404
00:29:25,692 --> 00:29:28,684
They're all Pollitts,
I'm proud to say, every one of them.

405
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:31,486
I know Big Daddy's
just as proud as we are...

406
00:29:31,692 --> 00:29:33,808
...that there's a flesh-and-blood dynasty...

407
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:36,122
...waiting to take over.

408
00:29:36,332 --> 00:29:38,323
That's no way to talk.

409
00:29:38,532 --> 00:29:39,328
What way?

410
00:29:39,532 --> 00:29:43,411
''Take over.'' When we all know...

411
00:29:43,612 --> 00:29:45,967
...Big Daddy's going to live
to be at least 100.

412
00:29:46,052 --> 00:29:47,610
I'll drink to that!

413
00:29:47,972 --> 00:29:50,042
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere!

414
00:29:50,252 --> 00:29:51,890
To Big Daddy!

415
00:29:53,372 --> 00:29:55,886
In the name of every person
in this county...

416
00:29:55,972 --> 00:29:59,362
...in the name of the church
and school board, the board of trustees...

417
00:29:59,452 --> 00:30:02,524
...felicitations on your 65th birthday.

418
00:30:03,732 --> 00:30:05,882
Brick, honey,
I brought you something to eat.

419
00:30:06,092 --> 00:30:07,571
I'm not hungry.

420
00:30:10,932 --> 00:30:12,888
What's that supposed to mean?

421
00:30:13,092 --> 00:30:13,968
We're leaving.

422
00:30:14,172 --> 00:30:15,890
-We can't.
-I can.

423
00:30:16,092 --> 00:30:19,607
-The party's coming up here to you.
-I'll get one of the boys to drive me.

424
00:30:19,812 --> 00:30:23,441
You just can't walk out
on Big Daddy's birthday party!

425
00:30:23,652 --> 00:30:25,290
Don't you care nothing about him?

426
00:30:25,372 --> 00:30:26,771
Get out of my way.

427
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:30,167
Get out of my way, Maggie!

428
00:30:32,652 --> 00:30:34,449
You've got no cause to dislike him.

429
00:30:36,692 --> 00:30:38,011
Do I dislike him?

430
00:30:38,212 --> 00:30:42,091
It's obvious to everybody.
Especially to him.

431
00:30:46,092 --> 00:30:47,650
What's he ever done to you?

432
00:30:47,852 --> 00:30:48,841
What?

433
00:30:49,052 --> 00:30:51,202
Why do you hate him so much?

434
00:30:51,572 --> 00:30:52,925
What's he ever done to you?

435
00:30:56,692 --> 00:30:57,408
Nothing.

436
00:30:58,932 --> 00:31:01,366
What was Dr. Baugh doing up here?

437
00:31:02,732 --> 00:31:04,370
What did he--

438
00:31:08,852 --> 00:31:11,047
That's right. Big Daddy is going to die.

439
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:16,367
I don't believe that.

440
00:31:16,812 --> 00:31:19,645
Dr. Baugh wouldn't lie to Big Daddy.

441
00:31:19,852 --> 00:31:21,126
Wouldn't he, Maggie?

442
00:31:25,772 --> 00:31:27,728
Poor Big Daddy.

443
00:31:28,852 --> 00:31:30,683
I'm fond of him.

444
00:31:30,892 --> 00:31:33,486
I'm genuinely fond of that old man.

445
00:31:33,772 --> 00:31:35,649
I really am, you know.

446
00:31:37,092 --> 00:31:39,128
When he finds out....

447
00:31:40,092 --> 00:31:42,447
I wouldn't want to be the one to tell him.

448
00:31:44,732 --> 00:31:46,211
That's why you want to go now.

449
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:50,240
Yeah, that's why I want to leave now.

450
00:31:52,852 --> 00:31:54,968
You've got to do this for me, Maggie.

451
00:31:55,172 --> 00:31:57,481
And leave the field to Gooper and his wife?

452
00:31:57,652 --> 00:31:58,607
No, sir!

453
00:31:58,812 --> 00:32:00,325
Let's face facts, baby.

454
00:32:00,532 --> 00:32:02,204
You're a drinker. That takes money.

455
00:32:02,412 --> 00:32:03,686
I don't want his money!

456
00:32:03,892 --> 00:32:05,803
Are you ready to settle for ten-cent beer?

457
00:32:05,892 --> 00:32:08,929
That's what Gooper'll dole out to you
when they freeze you out.

458
00:32:09,132 --> 00:32:11,282
They've got a plan, baby.

459
00:32:11,492 --> 00:32:15,804
You should've heard them
laying it on to Big Daddy. A mile a minute!

460
00:32:16,012 --> 00:32:18,446
Big Mama's already on their side.

461
00:32:18,932 --> 00:32:21,924
You're a drinker and I'm childless.

462
00:32:22,612 --> 00:32:26,048
We've got to beat that plan,
we've just got to!

463
00:32:28,972 --> 00:32:30,451
I've been so...

464
00:32:30,612 --> 00:32:33,649
...disgustingly poor all my life.

465
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:36,447
That's the truth, Brick.

466
00:32:37,532 --> 00:32:39,409
Have you, Maggie?

467
00:32:41,452 --> 00:32:43,249
You don't know what it's like to have to...

468
00:32:43,372 --> 00:32:46,603
...suck up to people you can't stand,
just because they have money.

469
00:32:47,652 --> 00:32:49,722
You don't know what it's like...

470
00:32:49,932 --> 00:32:51,968
...never having any clothes.

471
00:32:52,932 --> 00:32:55,002
That dress I married you in...

472
00:32:55,212 --> 00:32:59,125
...was a hand-me-down
from a snotty, rich cousin I hated.

473
00:33:01,172 --> 00:33:03,402
You can be young without money.

474
00:33:04,532 --> 00:33:06,762
But you can't be old without it.

475
00:33:09,212 --> 00:33:11,282
Where did I fail you?

476
00:33:11,852 --> 00:33:14,082
Where did I make my mistake?

477
00:33:15,572 --> 00:33:17,802
Make that your last drink
until after the party...

478
00:33:17,892 --> 00:33:19,325
...please, honey.

479
00:33:25,972 --> 00:33:29,009
I think I made my mistake
when I tried to tell you about Skipper.

480
00:33:29,332 --> 00:33:31,129
That's my fatal error.

481
00:33:31,332 --> 00:33:33,448
-I never should--
-Shut up about Skipper!

482
00:33:33,652 --> 00:33:35,449
I mean it! Shut up!

483
00:33:35,652 --> 00:33:38,212
The laws of silence won't work about that!

484
00:33:38,412 --> 00:33:40,243
Not about Skipper and us.

485
00:33:40,452 --> 00:33:44,161
It's like locking the door on a fire
to forget the house is burning.

486
00:33:44,252 --> 00:33:45,810
Hey, everybody!

487
00:33:46,132 --> 00:33:49,920
But not looking at a fire doesn't put it out.

488
00:33:50,172 --> 00:33:54,802
This time I'm going to finish.
That night in the hotel room, Skipper--

489
00:33:54,892 --> 00:33:56,405
I don't want to hear about it!

490
00:33:56,652 --> 00:33:59,246
Why won't you face the truth, just once...

491
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:02,449
...about Skipper, about me, about yourself?

492
00:34:03,652 --> 00:34:05,643
Are you bringing that party up here or not?

493
00:34:05,812 --> 00:34:07,211
Kit and caboodle, son.

494
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:10,165
That won't do any good.
I'm going to say this...

495
00:34:10,372 --> 00:34:13,170
...and I don't care if it's in front of them.

496
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:16,729
Do you want to be hit with this crutch?

497
00:34:16,812 --> 00:34:18,803
Are you still blaming me
for Skipper's death?

498
00:34:18,892 --> 00:34:20,484
I could kill you with this crutch.

499
00:34:20,692 --> 00:34:22,842
Good Lord! Do you think I'd care?

500
00:34:23,052 --> 00:34:25,885
Skipper and I had a friendship.
Why won't you let it alone?

501
00:34:25,972 --> 00:34:28,202
-It's got to be told!
-I don't want to hear it!

502
00:34:28,412 --> 00:34:31,643
It's got to be told
and you never let me tell it. I love you...

503
00:34:31,852 --> 00:34:34,491
...and that's worth fighting for.
Not Skipper!

504
00:34:34,692 --> 00:34:36,205
Skipper was no good!

505
00:34:36,412 --> 00:34:37,765
Maybe I'm no good.

506
00:34:37,972 --> 00:34:39,121
Nobody's good.

507
00:34:39,332 --> 00:34:41,607
But Skipper is dead!

508
00:34:41,972 --> 00:34:43,724
And I'm alive!

509
00:34:43,892 --> 00:34:45,769
Maggie the cat is alive!

510
00:34:45,972 --> 00:34:47,291
I'm alive!

511
00:34:47,492 --> 00:34:49,403
Why are you afraid of the truth?

512
00:34:49,612 --> 00:34:50,601
Truth?

513
00:34:58,052 --> 00:35:01,727
Little girl, somebody ought to teach you...

514
00:35:01,932 --> 00:35:04,605
...to knock before you open a door.

515
00:35:04,812 --> 00:35:09,169
Otherwise, people might think
you're lacking in good breeding.

516
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:15,530
What's Uncle Brick doing on the floor?

517
00:35:16,612 --> 00:35:18,762
I tried to kill your Aunt Maggie...

518
00:35:21,972 --> 00:35:23,246
...but I failed...

519
00:35:23,972 --> 00:35:27,806
...and I fell. Little girl,
would you hand me my crutch, please?

520
00:35:32,812 --> 00:35:35,645
What were you jumping high hurdles for?

521
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:39,801
Because I used to, and people like to do
what they used to do...

522
00:35:40,492 --> 00:35:43,086
...after they've stopped being able to do it.

523
00:35:43,252 --> 00:35:46,528
That's right. And that's your answer.

524
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:47,927
Now go away.

525
00:35:49,292 --> 00:35:52,409
Stop that, you little no-neck monster!

526
00:35:52,612 --> 00:35:56,844
You're just jealous
because you can't have babies.

527
00:36:05,652 --> 00:36:06,846
You see?

528
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:12,120
Mae and Gooper gloat over us
being childless...

529
00:36:13,412 --> 00:36:16,722
...even in front of their little
no-neck monsters.

530
00:36:22,132 --> 00:36:24,646
I went to a doctor in Memphis.

531
00:36:25,012 --> 00:36:27,082
A gynecologist.

532
00:36:28,212 --> 00:36:31,761
He says there's no reason
why we can't have a child...

533
00:36:31,972 --> 00:36:33,883
...whenever we want.

534
00:36:40,692 --> 00:36:44,048
-Are you listening?
-Yes, Maggie, I hear you.

535
00:36:45,452 --> 00:36:48,683
But how in hell do you imagine
you're going to have a child...

536
00:36:48,852 --> 00:36:51,366
...by a man who cannot stand you?

537
00:36:59,132 --> 00:37:01,168
That, boy of mine...

538
00:37:02,412 --> 00:37:05,722
...is a problem I'll just have to work out.

539
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,321
Here comes that party, here we come!

540
00:37:08,532 --> 00:37:11,330
Here comes that birthday party!

541
00:37:11,612 --> 00:37:13,170
That's nice.

542
00:37:15,012 --> 00:37:19,210
The preacher almost cried when I told him
I got a stained-glass memorial window.

543
00:37:19,412 --> 00:37:21,209
Who gave you that window, Deacon?

544
00:37:21,332 --> 00:37:24,130
Clyde Fletcher's widow,
a generous woman of fine character.

545
00:37:24,332 --> 00:37:26,971
What someone should give our church
is a cooling system.

546
00:37:27,052 --> 00:37:28,451
Yes, sir. Exactly my thought.

547
00:37:28,532 --> 00:37:31,922
Let's see, they've had the typhoid shots
and the tetanus shots...

548
00:37:32,132 --> 00:37:36,569
...diphtheria shots, hepatitis shots,
polio shots.

549
00:37:38,532 --> 00:37:41,046
Gooper, what have all the kiddies
been shot for?

550
00:37:41,252 --> 00:37:43,322
Everything but stealing chickens.

551
00:37:50,652 --> 00:37:51,641
Well, Brick?

552
00:37:52,332 --> 00:37:54,527
Congratulations, Big Daddy,
on your birthday.

553
00:37:54,732 --> 00:37:57,405
-Bull!
-Guess what memorial Gus's family gave?

554
00:37:57,612 --> 00:38:01,082
-A new house and basketball court--
-Deacon!

555
00:38:01,972 --> 00:38:05,089
What's all this talk about
memorial stained-glass windows?

556
00:38:05,292 --> 00:38:08,045
Figuring on somebody kicking off
around here?

557
00:38:08,292 --> 00:38:11,887
How about some nice music
to start the party off with?

558
00:38:15,452 --> 00:38:17,602
Turn that damn thing off!

559
00:38:19,572 --> 00:38:21,608
Where's my Brick?

560
00:38:21,692 --> 00:38:24,331
-Where's my precious baby?
-Sorry, turn it back on.

561
00:38:24,652 --> 00:38:26,210
How does your leg feel, honey?

562
00:38:26,292 --> 00:38:29,762
Your hand was made for holding
something better! Put that liquor down.

563
00:38:29,972 --> 00:38:32,486
-He is putting it down, all right!
-Turn that off!

564
00:38:33,012 --> 00:38:35,890
How about a birthday kiss, honey?

565
00:38:40,452 --> 00:38:45,128
Hey, everybody, you know the first time
Big Daddy kissed me, I fainted.

566
00:38:45,332 --> 00:38:47,209
It's a fact. Ain't that so, honey?

567
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:51,805
Do you all know how he proposed to me?
I was four months swole with Gooper...

568
00:38:52,012 --> 00:38:55,049
...and Big Daddy said,
''That's my kid, ain't it?''

569
00:38:55,252 --> 00:38:57,482
It was kind of funny.
I'd never had a beau...

570
00:38:57,652 --> 00:39:00,291
...till I met your father.
He said, ''I want that kid.

571
00:39:00,492 --> 00:39:01,720
''I need him.

572
00:39:01,932 --> 00:39:06,130
''He ain't going to have nobody else's name
but mine. Let's get the preacher.

573
00:39:06,292 --> 00:39:08,726
''That's what marriage is for. Family.''

574
00:39:09,812 --> 00:39:12,531
Children were mighty important
to Big Daddy, even then.

575
00:39:12,692 --> 00:39:14,489
Ida, will you stop that yammering?

576
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:17,964
That's just his manner of talking.
He don't mean it.

577
00:39:18,172 --> 00:39:20,811
I've been his one and only lover,
haven't I, sweetheart?

578
00:39:21,252 --> 00:39:23,083
Ida, will you keep quiet?

579
00:39:24,012 --> 00:39:25,604
Children, come on!

580
00:39:30,092 --> 00:39:33,084
Here comes Big Daddy's birthday!

581
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,766
''Big Daddy's a jolly good fellow

582
00:39:38,972 --> 00:39:41,281
''Big Daddy's a jolly good fellow

583
00:39:42,492 --> 00:39:44,960
''And so is Big Mama, too

584
00:39:51,132 --> 00:39:54,442
''Big Daddy's a jolly good fellow

585
00:39:55,532 --> 00:39:58,763
''And so is Big Mama, too''

586
00:40:00,772 --> 00:40:03,923
-Ida, what the hell's the matter with you?
-She's just so happy.

587
00:40:05,012 --> 00:40:09,244
I'm so happy.
I've just got to cry or something.

588
00:40:10,132 --> 00:40:12,043
Big Daddy's 100 percent...

589
00:40:12,252 --> 00:40:13,321
...healthy!

590
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:17,806
Aren't you going to give Big Daddy
his birthday present?

591
00:40:25,932 --> 00:40:29,527
-You can open up your birthday present.
-You open it. I want to talk to Brick.

592
00:40:29,732 --> 00:40:31,211
Brick, come over here.

593
00:40:31,732 --> 00:40:33,882
Big Daddy's calling you.

594
00:40:34,092 --> 00:40:36,686
Big Mama, take them out for me.

595
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:40,521
-It's a cashmere robe!
-You sound surprised.

596
00:40:40,732 --> 00:40:44,884
-I've never seen a cashmere robe before.
-That's funny!

597
00:40:45,612 --> 00:40:47,125
What's so funny about it?

598
00:40:47,732 --> 00:40:49,802
All my family ever had was family.

599
00:40:50,812 --> 00:40:51,881
Quiet!

600
00:40:52,092 --> 00:40:55,209
-You bought it yourself last Saturday.
-I said quiet!

601
00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:59,485
The salesgirl that sold it to you
waited on me and she told me about it.

602
00:40:59,692 --> 00:41:01,410
-Sister Woman!
-Quiet!

603
00:41:01,612 --> 00:41:03,967
-Stork and the Grim Reaper, neck and neck.
-Deacon!

604
00:41:04,052 --> 00:41:05,087
Deacon!

605
00:41:06,052 --> 00:41:10,409
I'm not butting in on more talk about
memorial stained-glass windows, am I?

606
00:41:10,892 --> 00:41:12,371
Not at all.

607
00:41:13,332 --> 00:41:16,005
What do you get out
of this charity work, anyway?

608
00:41:16,892 --> 00:41:18,883
I love humanity. That's my reward.

609
00:41:19,092 --> 00:41:21,925
And if humanity returns your love,
you might get elected...

610
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:23,968
...councilman or mayor, hey, Deacon?

611
00:41:24,172 --> 00:41:25,844
Don't start picking on Deacon.

612
00:41:26,052 --> 00:41:28,327
-That's all right. I was--
-Good night, Deacon.

613
00:41:28,412 --> 00:41:32,291
That's exactly what I was about to say.
I better go before it starts raining.

614
00:41:32,492 --> 00:41:35,962
Good night, everybody.
Bless each and every one in this place.

615
00:41:37,172 --> 00:41:40,369
They tell me you were indulging in
some athletics last night.

616
00:41:40,572 --> 00:41:43,609
-I was trying to, yes, sir.
-At 3:00 in the morning?

617
00:41:44,052 --> 00:41:47,806
What were you doing on the high school
athletic field at 3:00 in the morning?

618
00:41:47,892 --> 00:41:52,682
I was running and jumping the hurdles.
They've got too high for me now.

619
00:41:53,332 --> 00:41:54,526
Because you were drunk!

620
00:41:54,652 --> 00:41:57,610
Sober, I would not have tried
to jump even the low ones.

621
00:41:57,972 --> 00:42:00,122
It's time to blow out the candles!

622
00:42:00,532 --> 00:42:02,966
A toast to Big Daddy Pollitt...

623
00:42:03,172 --> 00:42:05,891
...on his 65th birthday.

624
00:42:06,092 --> 00:42:09,926
-To the biggest cotton planter--
-I told you, quit this bull!

625
00:42:10,012 --> 00:42:12,845
I won't let you talk this way,
not even on your birthday.

626
00:42:12,932 --> 00:42:16,288
I'll talk like I want to on my birthday,
or any other rotten day.

627
00:42:16,372 --> 00:42:19,170
Anybody don't like it,
they know what they can do about it.

628
00:42:19,252 --> 00:42:22,244
-I know you don't mean that.
-You don't know nothing, never did.

629
00:42:22,332 --> 00:42:25,847
-You don't mean that.
-Yes, I do mean it.

630
00:42:27,132 --> 00:42:31,045
I've put up with a lot of bull around here
because I thought I was dying.

631
00:42:31,252 --> 00:42:33,561
That's when you started taking over.

632
00:42:33,772 --> 00:42:37,970
Your loud voice and busybody butting in
here and there and everywhere.

633
00:42:38,132 --> 00:42:41,841
Sashaying around here,
making a big noise like a boss.

634
00:42:42,052 --> 00:42:44,441
I'm the only boss around here.

635
00:42:44,852 --> 00:42:47,730
I built this place with no help from you.

636
00:42:47,892 --> 00:42:50,770
And I'll run this place till the day I die.

637
00:42:50,972 --> 00:42:54,487
Is that plain to you, Ida?
Is that perfectly clear to you?

638
00:42:54,692 --> 00:42:55,841
I ain't going to die.

639
00:42:56,372 --> 00:42:59,409
Ain't nothing wrong with me
but a spastic colon!

640
00:42:59,972 --> 00:43:02,850
Made spastic, I reckon,
by all the lies and liars...

641
00:43:03,052 --> 00:43:05,361
...I've had to put up with around here.

642
00:43:05,572 --> 00:43:10,009
And all the hypocrisy I've had to live with
these 40 years I've lived with you.

643
00:43:11,092 --> 00:43:13,003
Now blow out them candles.

644
00:43:13,972 --> 00:43:16,930
Go on. Blow out them candles
on that stupid cake.

645
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:26,003
In all these years
you never believed I loved you.

646
00:43:28,612 --> 00:43:30,091
And I did.

647
00:43:31,572 --> 00:43:33,324
I did so much.

648
00:43:34,452 --> 00:43:35,931
I did love you.

649
00:43:37,332 --> 00:43:41,211
I even loved your hate and your hardness.

650
00:43:47,252 --> 00:43:50,289
-Big Daddy should make plans.
-If he should die before--

651
00:43:51,052 --> 00:43:52,326
Excuse me.

652
00:43:57,412 --> 00:43:58,640
Son!

653
00:44:02,892 --> 00:44:04,371
I was calling Brick.

654
00:44:05,492 --> 00:44:07,926
I was just delivering him to you.

655
00:44:19,532 --> 00:44:22,171
-What did you do that for?
-Do what?

656
00:44:23,572 --> 00:44:25,005
Wipe off her kiss?

657
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,447
Did I?

658
00:44:29,652 --> 00:44:31,768
Your woman's got a better shape on her...

659
00:44:31,972 --> 00:44:33,485
...than Gooper's got on his.

660
00:44:34,012 --> 00:44:38,210
-Is that the only difference you've noticed?
-Difference in shape is pretty important.

661
00:44:38,412 --> 00:44:41,085
-But in a way, they're a lot alike.
-How's that?

662
00:44:41,292 --> 00:44:44,170
They don't look peaceful. How's that?

663
00:44:44,452 --> 00:44:46,408
They're a couple of cats...

664
00:44:46,652 --> 00:44:50,725
...sitting in the middle of 28,000 acres
of land. That's a lot of land.

665
00:44:51,092 --> 00:44:55,370
They're both squaring off, determined
to get a bigger piece whenever you let go.

666
00:44:56,252 --> 00:44:58,971
Yeah, well, I've got a surprise
for them babies.

667
00:44:59,172 --> 00:45:02,482
I ain't letting go for a long time yet,
if they're waiting for that.

668
00:45:02,572 --> 00:45:06,247
You just sit tight and let them
scratch each other's eyes out.

669
00:45:06,452 --> 00:45:07,805
You bet your life.

670
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:12,001
Gooper's wife, she's a good breeder.
You'll have to admit she's fertile.

671
00:45:12,212 --> 00:45:14,601
Five head of them already
and more coming.

672
00:45:15,892 --> 00:45:19,168
6-0. She'll probably drop a litter next time.

673
00:45:21,492 --> 00:45:24,131
-Are you stuck out there?
-I was just passing by.

674
00:45:24,212 --> 00:45:26,043
You were just sneaking and spying.

675
00:45:26,252 --> 00:45:29,881
Do I have to lock all the doors around here
to have a private conversation?

676
00:45:30,092 --> 00:45:32,970
-Why hurt those that really love you?
-Bull!

677
00:45:33,212 --> 00:45:35,567
I'm going to move you and Gooper
out of that room.

678
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:39,168
It's none of your business what goes on
in here between Brick and Maggie.

679
00:45:39,372 --> 00:45:41,932
I hate sneaking and spying!
It makes me puke!

680
00:45:46,852 --> 00:45:48,126
They listen, do they?

681
00:45:48,372 --> 00:45:50,124
Yeah, they listen.

682
00:45:50,332 --> 00:45:53,005
They run and tell Big Mama
everything they hear.

683
00:45:53,252 --> 00:45:56,801
They say Maggie sleeps on the bed
and you sleep on the sofa. Is that true?

684
00:45:57,812 --> 00:45:59,882
If you don't like Maggie, get rid of her!

685
00:46:00,252 --> 00:46:02,686
-What are you doing now?
-Freshening up my drink.

686
00:46:02,892 --> 00:46:05,406
-You know you've a real liquor problem?
-Yes, sir.

687
00:46:05,492 --> 00:46:09,280
-Is that why you quit sports announcing?
-I guess so. Yes, sir, that's it.

688
00:46:09,492 --> 00:46:10,368
Don't guess!

689
00:46:10,572 --> 00:46:12,449
It's too important!

690
00:46:12,972 --> 00:46:14,564
So you quit.

691
00:46:15,412 --> 00:46:18,085
-Some kind of a disappointment?
-I don't know. Do you?

692
00:46:18,172 --> 00:46:20,845
I'm asking you.
How should I know if you don't?

693
00:46:25,172 --> 00:46:28,562
Do you think a shot of that whisky
would injure my spastic condition?

694
00:46:30,732 --> 00:46:31,960
No, sir.

695
00:46:33,132 --> 00:46:34,963
It might do it some good.

696
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,202
The sky is open again, boy. It's open!

697
00:46:44,412 --> 00:46:46,164
That's the way to feel.

698
00:46:51,252 --> 00:46:52,970
I can breathe.

699
00:46:54,292 --> 00:46:56,965
All my life I've been like a doubled-up fist...

700
00:46:57,172 --> 00:46:59,891
...pounding and smashing and driving!

701
00:47:00,532 --> 00:47:03,205
But now I'm going
to take things easy with them.

702
00:47:05,012 --> 00:47:06,411
Do you know what I'm thinking?

703
00:47:06,492 --> 00:47:07,925
What's that, sir?

704
00:47:08,212 --> 00:47:09,327
Pleasure!

705
00:47:11,492 --> 00:47:14,962
I'll tell you, I still have a feeling for women,
and I'm 65.

706
00:47:15,172 --> 00:47:17,527
-That's mighty remarkable.
-Remarkable?

707
00:47:18,132 --> 00:47:19,087
Admirable.

708
00:47:19,292 --> 00:47:23,490
It's not only remarkable and admirable,
it's downright satisfying.

709
00:47:23,692 --> 00:47:26,604
-I'm going to have me a ball.
-A ball?

710
00:47:26,812 --> 00:47:28,530
I'm going to pick me a choice woman...

711
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:32,321
...and I'm going to smother her in minks
and choke her with diamonds.

712
00:47:32,532 --> 00:47:34,250
I'm going to be happy!

713
00:47:36,492 --> 00:47:39,325
Why are you so restless?
You got ants in your britches?

714
00:47:39,412 --> 00:47:40,891
-Yes, sir.
-Why?

715
00:47:42,532 --> 00:47:45,000
-Something hasn't happened yet.
-What's that?

716
00:47:45,212 --> 00:47:47,601
-A click in my head.
-Did you say, ''click''?

717
00:47:47,732 --> 00:47:51,486
Yes, sir. That click in my head
that makes me feel peaceful.

718
00:47:51,692 --> 00:47:53,762
Boy, sometimes you worry me.

719
00:47:55,092 --> 00:47:59,643
Like a switch clicking off in my head.
Turns the hot light off and the cool one on.

720
00:47:59,732 --> 00:48:01,529
All of a sudden, there's peace.

721
00:48:03,932 --> 00:48:06,048
You're a real alcoholic!

722
00:48:07,412 --> 00:48:08,686
That is the truth.

723
00:48:08,892 --> 00:48:13,090
Yes, sir, I am an alcoholic.
So, if you'll just excuse me.

724
00:48:13,412 --> 00:48:15,403
-No, I won't!
-I'm waiting for that click...

725
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:19,246
...and I don't get it unless I'm alone!
I'm not talking. When it's quiet!

726
00:48:19,332 --> 00:48:23,769
You'll hear plenty of that in the grave.
Right now we're going to talk.

727
00:48:23,972 --> 00:48:27,282
This talk is like all the others.
It gets nowhere and it's painful!

728
00:48:28,252 --> 00:48:32,564
-Let it be painful.
-I can crawl and hop if I have to.

729
00:48:33,492 --> 00:48:38,566
If you aren't careful, you'll crawl out
this family and be drinking on skid row.

730
00:48:38,652 --> 00:48:40,244
Yeah, that will come too.

731
00:48:40,812 --> 00:48:44,646
No. Now that I'm straightened out,
I'm going to straighten you out.

732
00:48:44,732 --> 00:48:46,085
Sit down!

733
00:48:46,292 --> 00:48:50,046
It's no use. We talk in circles.
We have nothing to say to each other!

734
00:48:56,972 --> 00:48:59,361
-Where are you going?
-To get another bottle.

735
00:48:59,572 --> 00:49:01,881
No, you're not, you drunken whelp!

736
00:49:03,652 --> 00:49:07,406
-Why are you shouting? I can't stand it!
-Get out of here!

737
00:49:07,612 --> 00:49:10,126
Leave us alone! Why do you drink?

738
00:49:12,172 --> 00:49:14,367
You had better know why you drink
or give it up!

739
00:49:14,972 --> 00:49:16,200
Give me my crutch.

740
00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:17,208
Why do you drink?

741
00:49:17,292 --> 00:49:19,328
I stepped on that foot and now I'm in pain.

742
00:49:19,532 --> 00:49:20,760
Good!

743
00:49:27,252 --> 00:49:28,605
At least you're not too numb...

744
00:49:28,692 --> 00:49:31,286
...with liquor to feel pain.

745
00:49:33,732 --> 00:49:35,723
-Why do you drink?
-Give me my crutch.

746
00:49:35,932 --> 00:49:39,561
-Tell me first.
-No, give me a drink first.

747
00:49:41,492 --> 00:49:44,325
-First you've got to tell me!
-All right! Disgust!

748
00:49:44,532 --> 00:49:47,524
-Disgust with what?
-You strike a hard bargain.

749
00:49:47,732 --> 00:49:52,169
-Boy, do you want liquor that bad?
-Yes, sir, I want liquor that bad.

750
00:49:56,092 --> 00:49:58,208
What are you disgusted with?

751
00:49:58,972 --> 00:50:02,123
Mendacity! Do you know what that is?
It's lies and liars!

752
00:50:02,292 --> 00:50:04,487
Who's been lying to you? Maggie?

753
00:50:04,692 --> 00:50:06,922
No, not one lie or one person.
The whole thing.

754
00:50:07,092 --> 00:50:08,889
-You got a headache?
-No, I'm trying--

755
00:50:09,092 --> 00:50:12,801
Trying to concentrate, but you can't
because your brain is soaked with liquor.

756
00:50:13,012 --> 00:50:14,081
Wet brain!

757
00:50:15,292 --> 00:50:16,407
Mendacity!

758
00:50:16,612 --> 00:50:20,366
What do you know about mendacity?
I could write a book on it.

759
00:50:20,572 --> 00:50:23,803
-It's your sister calling from Memphis.
-To hell with her!

760
00:50:24,372 --> 00:50:25,441
Get out of there!

761
00:50:25,812 --> 00:50:28,451
Go on. Close the door after you.

762
00:50:28,652 --> 00:50:29,482
Mendacity!

763
00:50:29,892 --> 00:50:34,568
Look at the lies I've got to put up with.
Pretenses, hypocrisy!

764
00:50:34,772 --> 00:50:39,050
Pretending like I care for Big Mama.
I haven't tolerated her in 40 years.

765
00:50:39,652 --> 00:50:43,327
Church! It bores me, but I go.

766
00:50:43,612 --> 00:50:47,890
All those swindling lodges, social clubs,
and money-grabbing auxiliaries...

767
00:50:48,052 --> 00:50:50,441
...that's got me on their number one
sucker list.

768
00:50:50,612 --> 00:50:54,651
Boy, I've lived with mendacity.
Why can't you live with it?

769
00:50:54,852 --> 00:50:59,528
You've got to. There's nothing to live with
but mendacity. Is there?

770
00:51:00,532 --> 00:51:02,602
Yes, sir, you can live with this.

771
00:51:05,492 --> 00:51:06,481
That's not living.

772
00:51:07,932 --> 00:51:10,924
-That's dodging away from life.
-I want to dodge away from it.

773
00:51:11,012 --> 00:51:12,525
Then why not kill yourself?

774
00:51:12,692 --> 00:51:13,966
Because I like to drink.

775
00:51:14,172 --> 00:51:15,890
I can't talk to you!

776
00:51:16,092 --> 00:51:16,842
I'm sorry.

777
00:51:17,052 --> 00:51:20,089
Do you expect me to turn over
28,000 acres of the richest land...

778
00:51:20,292 --> 00:51:22,283
...this side of the Nile to a drunk fool?

779
00:51:22,492 --> 00:51:23,083
No, sir.

780
00:51:23,252 --> 00:51:27,040
I like you, son, but why should I subsidize
worthless behavior?

781
00:51:27,252 --> 00:51:28,401
Give it to Gooper and Mae.

782
00:51:28,612 --> 00:51:32,321
I can't stand Gooper and Mae
and those five screaming monkeys.

783
00:51:33,652 --> 00:51:36,291
I don't have to turn it over to any of you!

784
00:51:36,492 --> 00:51:40,610
To this day, I ain't made no will.
Now I don't have to, the pressure's off.

785
00:51:40,812 --> 00:51:43,645
I can wait and see
if you pull yourself together or not.

786
00:51:43,732 --> 00:51:44,528
That's right.

787
00:51:45,052 --> 00:51:48,044
-I'm not kidding.
-No, sir, I know you're not kidding.

788
00:51:48,852 --> 00:51:49,887
You don't care?

789
00:51:50,092 --> 00:51:52,048
No, sir, I don't care.

790
00:51:53,252 --> 00:51:54,844
Tell Lacey to drive me to the station.

791
00:51:54,932 --> 00:51:56,809
-Now wait a minute!
-Or I'll drive myself.

792
00:51:57,012 --> 00:51:58,889
I'm going home tonight. Now!

793
00:51:59,092 --> 00:52:01,811
-This is your home.
-Is it? Since when?

794
00:52:02,932 --> 00:52:04,843
Let's not leave it like this.

795
00:52:05,092 --> 00:52:07,560
Like all them other talks we've had.

796
00:52:07,772 --> 00:52:11,048
We always seem to talk around things.

797
00:52:11,412 --> 00:52:15,007
Seem to leave things unsaid and unspoken.

798
00:52:15,292 --> 00:52:18,682
-Now we've got to talk straight.
-It's too late for talk.

799
00:52:18,892 --> 00:52:19,961
Why?

800
00:52:20,172 --> 00:52:21,969
What are you disgusted about?

801
00:52:22,412 --> 00:52:25,131
Because you can't play football anymore?

802
00:52:25,492 --> 00:52:28,689
Because you lost your job?
I'll get it back for you!

803
00:52:34,452 --> 00:52:37,967
What? Sit in a glass box
watching games that I can't play?

804
00:52:38,172 --> 00:52:41,482
Describing what I can't do
while others do it?

805
00:52:42,652 --> 00:52:47,203
Filling my Coke with bourbon so I can
stand it? You'll get that back for me?

806
00:52:47,612 --> 00:52:49,682
I think you're passing the buck.

807
00:52:52,492 --> 00:52:53,811
Do you know many drinking men?

808
00:52:53,972 --> 00:52:55,485
I've known a good number.

809
00:52:55,692 --> 00:52:57,762
Could any of them they tell you
why they drank?

810
00:52:57,852 --> 00:52:59,490
You're passing the buck?

811
00:52:59,692 --> 00:53:03,367
You're passing the buck
to things like disgust and mendacity.

812
00:53:03,572 --> 00:53:05,642
If you've got to use that kind of language...

813
00:53:05,812 --> 00:53:08,849
...it's 90 proof bull and I ain't buying any!

814
00:53:09,012 --> 00:53:13,961
You started drinking with your friend
Skipper's death. Ain't that the truth?

815
00:53:22,692 --> 00:53:23,966
What are you suggesting?

816
00:53:25,012 --> 00:53:25,967
Nothing. But--

817
00:53:26,172 --> 00:53:27,400
But what?

818
00:53:27,572 --> 00:53:28,561
Say your mind.

819
00:53:28,932 --> 00:53:29,967
Say it!

820
00:53:30,772 --> 00:53:32,888
-Why are you so excited?
-Go ahead, say it!

821
00:53:33,092 --> 00:53:34,491
Why are you shouting like that?

822
00:53:34,572 --> 00:53:36,528
Skipper and I were friends, understand?

823
00:53:36,692 --> 00:53:38,125
Gooper said that Skipper was--

824
00:53:38,212 --> 00:53:41,045
Skipper is the only thing
that I've got left to believe in!

825
00:53:41,132 --> 00:53:42,724
And you drag it through the gutter!

826
00:53:42,812 --> 00:53:45,326
-Just a minute!
-You make it shameful and filthy!

827
00:53:54,892 --> 00:53:56,120
Give me your hand.

828
00:53:58,732 --> 00:54:02,008
I don't want your hand.
To hell with all lies and liars!

829
00:54:02,612 --> 00:54:05,172
Didn't you ever look up to anybody?

830
00:54:05,332 --> 00:54:07,050
Anybody at all in your whole life?

831
00:54:07,252 --> 00:54:09,971
Didn't you ever believe in anything,
anybody?

832
00:54:11,252 --> 00:54:14,005
No, sir, I guess you didn't.

833
00:54:14,332 --> 00:54:17,449
Nothing and nobody
except Big Daddy himself.

834
00:54:17,652 --> 00:54:19,643
You and Skipper played football together.

835
00:54:19,732 --> 00:54:22,292
Made a few touchdowns.
Does that make him God Almighty?

836
00:54:22,492 --> 00:54:23,720
I could depend on him.

837
00:54:23,852 --> 00:54:26,764
-On the football field!
-Anytime, anywhere, anyplace!

838
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:28,485
-Are you sure of that?
-Yes.

839
00:54:28,692 --> 00:54:30,045
Bull!

840
00:54:30,372 --> 00:54:33,569
Why did your big strong man fall apart?

841
00:54:34,132 --> 00:54:35,724
Why did Skipper crack up?

842
00:54:37,292 --> 00:54:38,520
All right.

843
00:54:39,652 --> 00:54:42,212
You're asking for it,
we're going to have that talk.

844
00:54:43,252 --> 00:54:45,561
That straight, true talk.

845
00:54:45,812 --> 00:54:47,245
It's too late to stop now.

846
00:54:47,452 --> 00:54:48,885
Can you say it without a drink?

847
00:54:48,972 --> 00:54:51,532
I haven't heard that mechanical click yet.

848
00:54:51,732 --> 00:54:55,725
You need a lot of crutches, don't you?
Clicks. Whisky.

849
00:54:55,932 --> 00:54:57,729
What else do you need?

850
00:54:57,932 --> 00:54:58,489
Skipper?

851
00:54:59,572 --> 00:55:02,450
-He was a crutch for you too, wasn't he?
-Yes, sir.

852
00:55:02,612 --> 00:55:05,126
I could lean on him, in school and out of it.

853
00:55:05,892 --> 00:55:09,487
How did Maggie take
this great and true friendship?

854
00:55:12,212 --> 00:55:13,042
Ask her.

855
00:55:13,252 --> 00:55:14,162
I'm asking you.

856
00:55:14,372 --> 00:55:17,728
If you want to know why Skipper
cracked up, ask Maggie the cat.

857
00:55:17,932 --> 00:55:18,682
What did she do?

858
00:55:19,452 --> 00:55:22,603
Chase him out of the window
of that Chicago hotel?

859
00:55:22,772 --> 00:55:26,242
Did that little bitty girl shove
your big hero out all by herself?

860
00:55:26,892 --> 00:55:27,927
Why?

861
00:55:29,012 --> 00:55:31,082
What went on
between Skipper and Maggie?

862
00:55:32,492 --> 00:55:33,368
Ask her.

863
00:55:38,332 --> 00:55:39,606
Maggie, come here.

864
00:55:39,692 --> 00:55:42,490
Can I be of assistance, Big Daddy?

865
00:55:45,932 --> 00:55:48,366
Trixie's ready to play the piano for you!

866
00:55:48,572 --> 00:55:50,722
Go ahead, play.

867
00:55:58,412 --> 00:56:01,324
What was going on
between you and Skipper?

868
00:56:03,252 --> 00:56:05,163
Well, you see, Big Daddy....

869
00:56:07,092 --> 00:56:08,241
Well?

870
00:56:09,452 --> 00:56:11,249
Come on, Maggie!

871
00:56:11,452 --> 00:56:13,488
You wanted to talk truth upstairs.

872
00:56:13,652 --> 00:56:15,085
Go ahead!

873
00:56:15,252 --> 00:56:17,812
Big Daddy wants to know. Tell him!

874
00:56:22,932 --> 00:56:24,604
Skipper didn't like me.

875
00:56:24,812 --> 00:56:26,768
Why didn't Skipper like you?

876
00:56:26,972 --> 00:56:29,532
-You know he was against our marriage.
-Why?

877
00:56:29,732 --> 00:56:33,327
-Because it meant less freedom for you.
-Freedom to do what?

878
00:56:33,492 --> 00:56:35,926
Freedom to run from town to town.

879
00:56:36,132 --> 00:56:38,282
Planes, trains, always running!

880
00:56:38,452 --> 00:56:42,570
-Football practice, dirty stories--
-Nobody forced you to come along with us!

881
00:56:42,772 --> 00:56:46,685
I didn't expect to spend my honeymoon
in the locker room with the boys.

882
00:56:46,892 --> 00:56:50,168
Since when did a man's smell
ever injure your sensitive feelings?

883
00:56:50,372 --> 00:56:51,805
Football, baby!

884
00:56:52,012 --> 00:56:54,287
The idea of football smelled.

885
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:57,285
Especially the notions
of a professional team.

886
00:56:57,492 --> 00:56:59,642
He didn't need any team of his own.

887
00:56:59,852 --> 00:57:03,208
He could've gotten a spot
on any pro team in the country.

888
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:06,601
You organized your own team
on account of Skipper.

889
00:57:06,812 --> 00:57:10,168
-You're a liar!
-He wasn't good enough on his own.

890
00:57:10,372 --> 00:57:12,602
Professional football is a business...

891
00:57:12,812 --> 00:57:13,801
...not a social club!

892
00:57:14,492 --> 00:57:16,448
You mean the business of making money?

893
00:57:16,652 --> 00:57:19,120
Yeah, money!
The stuff your dreams are made of!

894
00:57:19,612 --> 00:57:22,285
The Dixie Stars never made a nickel!

895
00:57:22,452 --> 00:57:24,761
Not from the first day to the last.

896
00:57:24,972 --> 00:57:27,008
It wasn't the money, it was the cheers.

897
00:57:27,212 --> 00:57:28,611
He lapped them up.

898
00:57:28,812 --> 00:57:32,282
The cheers didn't mean anything to me.
But they did to you!

899
00:57:32,492 --> 00:57:35,211
Because they shut you out
and you hated that.

900
00:57:35,412 --> 00:57:37,607
Not by the crowds, baby, by you.

901
00:57:37,812 --> 00:57:39,530
By the man I worshiped.

902
00:57:39,732 --> 00:57:42,007
That's why I hated Skipper.

903
00:57:42,732 --> 00:57:46,247
You hated him so much you got him drunk
and went to bed with him.

904
00:57:56,692 --> 00:57:58,444
Is that true?

905
00:58:05,852 --> 00:58:09,561
You don't think I ravished a football hero?

906
00:58:12,692 --> 00:58:14,284
Skipper was drunk.

907
00:58:14,732 --> 00:58:16,643
So are you most of the time.

908
00:58:16,852 --> 00:58:19,491
I don't seem to make out so well with you.

909
00:58:23,492 --> 00:58:26,564
Are you saying nothing happened
between you and Skipper?

910
00:58:26,772 --> 00:58:29,240
-You know what happened.
-I don't know!

911
00:58:29,452 --> 00:58:31,204
I wasn't there.

912
00:58:31,412 --> 00:58:34,165
I couldn't play that Sunday.
I wasn't in Chicago.

913
00:58:34,372 --> 00:58:36,328
-I was in the hospital--
-Skipper played.

914
00:58:36,412 --> 00:58:37,765
He played all right!

915
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:40,088
His first professional game without Brick.

916
00:58:42,052 --> 00:58:44,122
Tell Big Daddy what happened.

917
00:58:44,332 --> 00:58:45,765
Go on, tell him.

918
00:58:45,972 --> 00:58:47,803
You're a sports announcer.

919
00:58:48,012 --> 00:58:52,164
Give us a running account
of the all-American bust.

920
00:58:52,372 --> 00:58:55,170
Tell him how many times
Skipper fumbled...

921
00:58:55,372 --> 00:58:57,806
...and stumbled and fell apart.

922
00:58:58,132 --> 00:59:02,011
On offensive he was useless.
On defensive he was a coward.

923
00:59:02,212 --> 00:59:03,565
And it was all over:

924
00:59:03,732 --> 00:59:06,644
Chicago: 47, Dixie Stars: 0.

925
00:59:06,852 --> 00:59:08,410
Bad breaks. An off day.

926
00:59:08,612 --> 00:59:09,567
No, baby.

927
00:59:09,972 --> 00:59:12,691
Without you, Skipper was nothing.

928
00:59:12,852 --> 00:59:14,922
Outside: big, tough, confident.

929
00:59:15,092 --> 00:59:16,923
Inside: pure jelly!

930
00:59:17,972 --> 00:59:20,327
You saw the game on TV.
You saw what happened.

931
00:59:20,532 --> 00:59:23,126
But I didn't see what happened
in Skipper's hotel room.

932
00:59:23,212 --> 00:59:25,043
That little episode was not on TV.

933
00:59:25,252 --> 00:59:28,324
Tell Big Daddy
why you were in Skipper's room.

934
00:59:28,532 --> 00:59:29,851
He was sick.

935
00:59:30,252 --> 00:59:31,651
Sick with drink.

936
00:59:31,852 --> 00:59:33,080
He wouldn't come out.

937
00:59:33,172 --> 00:59:34,491
He'd busted some furniture...

938
00:59:34,572 --> 00:59:38,201
...and the hotel manager said to stop him
before he called the police.

939
00:59:38,452 --> 00:59:40,647
So I went to his room.

940
00:59:40,932 --> 00:59:43,526
I scratched on his door
and begged him to let me in.

941
00:59:43,732 --> 00:59:45,051
He was half crazy.

942
00:59:45,252 --> 00:59:46,844
Violent and screaming one minute...

943
00:59:47,052 --> 00:59:49,247
...weak and crying the next.

944
00:59:49,452 --> 00:59:52,808
And all the time, scared stiff about you.

945
00:59:53,652 --> 00:59:57,327
So I said to him maybe it was time
we forgot about football.

946
00:59:57,812 --> 01:00:01,122
Maybe he ought to get a job
and let me and Brick alone.

947
01:00:02,252 --> 01:00:04,641
I thought he'd hit me.

948
01:00:05,692 --> 01:00:07,523
He walked toward me...

949
01:00:07,932 --> 01:00:11,641
...with a funny sort of smile on his face.

950
01:00:13,092 --> 01:00:15,481
Then he did the strangest thing.

951
01:00:15,852 --> 01:00:17,570
He kissed me.

952
01:00:18,212 --> 01:00:20,680
That was the first time
he'd ever touched me.

953
01:00:21,172 --> 01:00:23,163
And then I knew what I was going to do.

954
01:00:23,372 --> 01:00:25,249
I'd get rid of Skipper.

955
01:00:25,452 --> 01:00:29,047
I'd show Brick that their deep,
true friendship was a big lie.

956
01:00:29,732 --> 01:00:31,085
I'd prove it by showing...

957
01:00:31,292 --> 01:00:34,728
...that Skipper would make love
to his best friend's wife.

958
01:00:35,252 --> 01:00:36,970
He didn't need any coaxing.

959
01:00:37,172 --> 01:00:39,049
He was more than willing.

960
01:00:39,252 --> 01:00:41,482
He even seemed to have the same idea.

961
01:00:42,492 --> 01:00:44,289
You're just trying to whitewash it.

962
01:00:44,812 --> 01:00:45,642
I'm not!

963
01:00:45,852 --> 01:00:47,570
I was trying to win back my husband.

964
01:00:47,692 --> 01:00:50,650
It didn't matter how.
I would've done anything.

965
01:00:50,852 --> 01:00:52,763
Even that.

966
01:00:53,812 --> 01:00:55,404
But at the last second...

967
01:00:55,572 --> 01:00:57,244
...I got panicky.

968
01:00:58,332 --> 01:01:00,846
Supposing I lost you instead?

969
01:01:01,652 --> 01:01:04,564
Supposing you'd hate me
instead of Skipper?

970
01:01:05,492 --> 01:01:07,244
So I ran.

971
01:01:08,012 --> 01:01:09,286
Nothing happened!

972
01:01:09,492 --> 01:01:12,290
I've tried to tell him a hundred times
but he won't let me.

973
01:01:12,892 --> 01:01:14,120
Nothing happened!

974
01:01:14,332 --> 01:01:16,448
Hallelujah, St. Maggie.

975
01:01:18,172 --> 01:01:20,527
I wanted to get rid of Skipper.

976
01:01:21,372 --> 01:01:23,044
But not if it meant losing you.

977
01:01:23,252 --> 01:01:25,482
He blames me for Skipper's death.

978
01:01:26,372 --> 01:01:29,205
Maybe I got rid of Skipper.

979
01:01:31,772 --> 01:01:34,206
Skipper won out anyway.

980
01:01:36,452 --> 01:01:38,886
I didn't get rid of him at all.

981
01:01:46,372 --> 01:01:48,840
Isn't it an awful joke, honey?

982
01:01:49,692 --> 01:01:51,728
I lost you anyway.

983
01:01:54,292 --> 01:01:56,806
-You didn't talk to him again before he--
-No.

984
01:01:57,772 --> 01:01:59,728
-But Brick did.
-How do you know?

985
01:01:59,892 --> 01:02:01,644
-Skipper told me.
-When?

986
01:02:01,852 --> 01:02:04,366
When they put his broken body
in the ambulance.

987
01:02:04,572 --> 01:02:06,483
I rode with him to the hospital.

988
01:02:06,732 --> 01:02:10,725
He kept saying,
''Why did Brick hang up on me?''

989
01:02:12,052 --> 01:02:13,804
Why, Brick?

990
01:02:28,772 --> 01:02:30,808
-Where are you going?
-Home.

991
01:02:33,652 --> 01:02:36,291
-You can't drive. You're drunk.
-Not yet, Big Daddy.

992
01:02:36,372 --> 01:02:38,203
Not yet. Now, give me that bottle.

993
01:02:42,132 --> 01:02:43,850
What are you running away from?

994
01:02:48,172 --> 01:02:51,244
Why did you hang up on Skipper
when he called you?

995
01:02:54,652 --> 01:02:55,880
Answer me!

996
01:02:56,772 --> 01:02:59,491
What did he say?
Was it about him and Maggie?

997
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:01,887
-He said they'd made love.
-And you believed him?

998
01:03:02,092 --> 01:03:03,127
Yes.

999
01:03:03,972 --> 01:03:05,724
Then why haven't you thrown her out?

1000
01:03:06,252 --> 01:03:08,925
Something's missing here.
Why did Skipper kill himself?

1001
01:03:09,652 --> 01:03:11,244
Because somebody let him down.

1002
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:19,890
I let him down.

1003
01:03:21,892 --> 01:03:23,803
When he called that night...

1004
01:03:26,732 --> 01:03:28,927
...I couldn't make sense out of....

1005
01:03:29,532 --> 01:03:32,046
But there was one thing that was sure.

1006
01:03:34,172 --> 01:03:36,447
Skipper was scared.

1007
01:03:36,932 --> 01:03:38,570
Scared...

1008
01:03:39,892 --> 01:03:42,565
...about what happened that day
on the football field.

1009
01:03:42,772 --> 01:03:43,568
That I'd blame him.

1010
01:03:43,772 --> 01:03:46,844
Scared that I'd walk out on him.

1011
01:03:48,412 --> 01:03:51,529
Skipper afraid! I couldn't believe that.

1012
01:03:51,732 --> 01:03:55,042
I mean, inside he was real
deep-down scared...

1013
01:03:55,732 --> 01:03:58,371
...and he broke like a rotten stick.

1014
01:03:59,572 --> 01:04:01,722
He started crying:

1015
01:04:02,692 --> 01:04:04,523
''I need you.''

1016
01:04:04,732 --> 01:04:07,087
He kept babbling, ''Help me.''

1017
01:04:08,452 --> 01:04:10,283
Me help him?

1018
01:04:11,892 --> 01:04:13,962
How does one drowning man...

1019
01:04:14,172 --> 01:04:15,730
...help another drowning man?

1020
01:04:16,212 --> 01:04:18,043
So you hung up on him.

1021
01:04:19,732 --> 01:04:21,688
And then that phone...

1022
01:04:22,292 --> 01:04:24,203
...started to ring again.

1023
01:04:25,772 --> 01:04:29,321
It rang and it rang
and it wouldn't stop ringing.

1024
01:04:29,732 --> 01:04:34,567
And I lay in that hospital bed,
unable to move or run from that sound.

1025
01:04:34,812 --> 01:04:37,246
It kept ringing louder and louder.

1026
01:04:37,652 --> 01:04:41,167
And the sound of that
was like Skipper screaming for help.

1027
01:04:45,332 --> 01:04:47,562
And I couldn't pick it up.

1028
01:04:49,172 --> 01:04:51,640
So that's when he killed himself?

1029
01:04:55,972 --> 01:04:57,041
Yes.

1030
01:04:58,772 --> 01:05:00,808
Because I let him down.

1031
01:05:05,332 --> 01:05:09,644
So that disgust with mendacity
is really disgust with myself.

1032
01:05:09,852 --> 01:05:14,004
When I hear that click I don't hear
the sound of that phone ringing anymore.

1033
01:05:14,212 --> 01:05:16,203
And I can stop thinking.

1034
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:17,970
I'm ashamed!

1035
01:05:18,172 --> 01:05:21,403
That's why I'm a drunk.
When I'm drunk I can stand myself.

1036
01:05:21,852 --> 01:05:24,491
But the truth is always there
in the morning, isn't it?

1037
01:05:25,412 --> 01:05:27,164
And it's here right now.

1038
01:05:28,532 --> 01:05:32,161
You're just feeling sorry for yourself.
That's all it is. Self-pity!

1039
01:05:32,372 --> 01:05:34,602
You didn't kill Skipper. He killed himself.

1040
01:05:34,772 --> 01:05:37,764
You, Skipper and lots like you,
living in a kid's world...

1041
01:05:37,972 --> 01:05:41,681
...playing games, touchdowns,
no worries, no responsibilities.

1042
01:05:41,972 --> 01:05:43,928
Life ain't no damn football game.

1043
01:05:44,132 --> 01:05:46,123
Life ain't just a bunch of high spots.

1044
01:05:47,492 --> 01:05:50,768
You're a 30-year-old kid.
Soon you'll be a 50-year-old kid...

1045
01:05:51,212 --> 01:05:53,601
...pretending you hear cheers
when there ain't any.

1046
01:05:53,692 --> 01:05:55,887
Dreaming and drinking your life away.

1047
01:05:56,092 --> 01:05:57,411
Heroes in the real world...

1048
01:05:57,612 --> 01:06:00,968
...live 24 hours a day,
not just two hours in a game.

1049
01:06:01,612 --> 01:06:04,809
Mendacity! You won't--

1050
01:06:07,172 --> 01:06:10,608
You won't live with mendacity,
but you're an expert at it.

1051
01:06:10,772 --> 01:06:12,808
The truth is pain and sweat...

1052
01:06:13,012 --> 01:06:17,085
...paying bills and making love to a woman
that you don't love anymore.

1053
01:06:17,292 --> 01:06:19,283
The truth is dreams that don't come true...

1054
01:06:19,412 --> 01:06:22,290
...and nobody prints your name
in the paper till you die.

1055
01:06:28,052 --> 01:06:29,485
Now, here.

1056
01:06:33,412 --> 01:06:35,323
The truth is you never growed up.

1057
01:06:35,532 --> 01:06:37,602
-Grown-ups don't hang up on friends.
-Get away.

1058
01:06:37,692 --> 01:06:40,843
And they don't hang up on their wives.
They don't hang up on life.

1059
01:06:41,012 --> 01:06:43,572
Now that's the truth that you can't face.

1060
01:06:43,772 --> 01:06:45,285
-Can you face the truth?
-Try me.

1061
01:06:45,372 --> 01:06:46,930
Sure, somebody else's truth!

1062
01:06:47,012 --> 01:06:48,764
-You're running again.
-Yeah, I am.

1063
01:06:48,852 --> 01:06:51,366
Running from lies,
like birthday congratulations...

1064
01:06:51,452 --> 01:06:54,888
...and many happy returns of the day
when there won't be any, and--

1065
01:07:06,092 --> 01:07:07,889
Please, let me go home.

1066
01:07:09,172 --> 01:07:10,890
-What did you say?
-I don't remember.

1067
01:07:10,972 --> 01:07:14,089
-There won't be any happy returns?
-Forget it.

1068
01:07:14,292 --> 01:07:16,726
Let me go home.
Leave the place to Gooper and Mae.

1069
01:07:16,812 --> 01:07:20,043
Who said I was going to leave
the place or anything?

1070
01:07:20,252 --> 01:07:21,731
I'll outlive you.

1071
01:07:21,932 --> 01:07:22,967
I'll bury you.

1072
01:07:23,172 --> 01:07:25,128
-I'll buy your coffin.
-That's right.

1073
01:07:25,332 --> 01:07:27,243
Many happy returns.

1074
01:07:32,852 --> 01:07:34,570
They were lying...

1075
01:07:34,772 --> 01:07:36,091
...weren't they, son...

1076
01:07:36,452 --> 01:07:38,602
...about that report from the clinic?

1077
01:07:40,492 --> 01:07:41,971
This pain...

1078
01:07:42,132 --> 01:07:43,804
...that keeps grabbing at me....

1079
01:07:44,932 --> 01:07:46,285
It's death...

1080
01:07:47,412 --> 01:07:48,527
...ain't it?

1081
01:07:49,492 --> 01:07:50,925
Answer me!

1082
01:07:51,212 --> 01:07:52,645
The truth!

1083
01:07:53,732 --> 01:07:58,487
You said it yourself.
Mendacity is a system we live in.

1084
01:08:33,332 --> 01:08:34,242
Brick, wait!

1085
01:08:56,212 --> 01:08:58,362
Look at us, Maggie.

1086
01:08:58,572 --> 01:09:00,961
The great Pollitt Enterprises...

1087
01:09:01,572 --> 01:09:03,449
...stuck in the....

1088
01:09:04,572 --> 01:09:06,244
I hurt him, Maggie.

1089
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:12,610
I hurt him really bad.

1090
01:09:12,812 --> 01:09:14,450
What's the matter? What's happened?

1091
01:09:14,652 --> 01:09:17,450
-Why is Big Daddy--
-We've got to talk to you.

1092
01:09:17,812 --> 01:09:19,370
-Get Dr. Baugh!
-Where is he?

1093
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:21,608
I don't know, just find him.

1094
01:09:30,652 --> 01:09:31,528
Doc!

1095
01:09:33,172 --> 01:09:35,732
I wouldn't go down to him right now.

1096
01:09:35,972 --> 01:09:37,007
Sweetheart!

1097
01:09:38,292 --> 01:09:40,408
Big Daddy, can you hear me?

1098
01:09:41,932 --> 01:09:43,251
What are you doing?

1099
01:09:43,572 --> 01:09:45,130
I'm coming down.

1100
01:09:48,212 --> 01:09:50,965
No need to, Ida.
We'll be coming up in a minute.

1101
01:10:01,212 --> 01:10:03,043
If that pain gets too bad...

1102
01:10:04,052 --> 01:10:05,804
...this is morphine...

1103
01:10:06,132 --> 01:10:07,884
...and a syringe.

1104
01:10:08,452 --> 01:10:11,046
The instructions are written out.

1105
01:10:12,852 --> 01:10:15,127
It's no use pretending anymore.

1106
01:10:15,332 --> 01:10:17,846
When that pain hits, it'll hit hard.

1107
01:10:18,892 --> 01:10:20,962
Make it easy on yourself.

1108
01:10:23,332 --> 01:10:24,651
Here.

1109
01:10:25,172 --> 01:10:27,891
You'd better take off those wet clothes.

1110
01:10:28,692 --> 01:10:29,568
Why?

1111
01:10:29,772 --> 01:10:32,002
You afraid I might catch cold and die?

1112
01:10:48,132 --> 01:10:49,451
Why can't I go down to him?

1113
01:10:49,532 --> 01:10:51,011
Well, he's....

1114
01:10:53,292 --> 01:10:55,806
His stomach's upset, Ida.

1115
01:10:57,652 --> 01:10:59,449
All he needs is a peppermint.

1116
01:11:01,052 --> 01:11:02,770
It's time we had that talk, Doc.

1117
01:11:02,932 --> 01:11:05,730
-It'll be painful.
-Painful things can't always be avoided.

1118
01:11:05,932 --> 01:11:08,002
So I've noticed. But there are times--

1119
01:11:08,212 --> 01:11:10,089
It's time we all had our talk.

1120
01:11:10,292 --> 01:11:12,487
What talk are you talking about?

1121
01:11:13,292 --> 01:11:16,329
-What were they fighting about?
-We didn't discuss it.

1122
01:11:16,412 --> 01:11:18,448
What's he doing in the cellar all alone?

1123
01:11:18,612 --> 01:11:20,011
Why can't Big Mama see him?

1124
01:11:20,212 --> 01:11:21,327
You heard why.

1125
01:11:21,532 --> 01:11:24,683
He's got the stomach upset.
It's made him irritable.

1126
01:11:24,972 --> 01:11:28,442
When couples have been together
as long as me and Big Daddy...

1127
01:11:28,652 --> 01:11:32,247
...they get irritable with each other
from too much devotion.

1128
01:11:33,372 --> 01:11:34,930
Isn't that so?

1129
01:11:36,172 --> 01:11:38,128
Of course that's so.

1130
01:11:38,932 --> 01:11:40,604
He loves his family.

1131
01:11:40,852 --> 01:11:43,366
He loves them around,
but it strains his nerves.

1132
01:11:43,572 --> 01:11:46,211
He wasn't himself.
I could tell he was all worked-up.

1133
01:11:46,292 --> 01:11:48,852
It's the party and the excitement.

1134
01:11:49,052 --> 01:11:51,520
He's probably just a little worn out,
that's all.

1135
01:11:51,732 --> 01:11:53,051
Did you notice how he ate?

1136
01:11:53,132 --> 01:11:55,327
He ate like a P-I-G hog.

1137
01:11:55,892 --> 01:11:57,803
I hope he doesn't regret it.

1138
01:11:58,172 --> 01:11:59,241
Who?

1139
01:11:59,532 --> 01:12:01,011
Big Daddy?

1140
01:12:01,612 --> 01:12:03,568
He helped himself twice to hopping John.

1141
01:12:04,052 --> 01:12:07,362
He just loves hopping John.
We had a real country dinner.

1142
01:12:07,572 --> 01:12:09,005
And candied yams.

1143
01:12:09,412 --> 01:12:12,404
That man put away
enough to stuff a field hand.

1144
01:12:13,092 --> 01:12:15,162
I hope he doesn't have
to pay for it later on.

1145
01:12:15,372 --> 01:12:16,487
What's that?

1146
01:12:16,692 --> 01:12:17,920
Gooper say he hopes--

1147
01:12:18,132 --> 01:12:20,327
Shoot! Gooper says!

1148
01:12:20,532 --> 01:12:23,092
There ain't nothing wrong
with Big Daddy but nerves.

1149
01:12:25,332 --> 01:12:26,208
Ain't that so?

1150
01:12:29,492 --> 01:12:31,960
He's as sound as a dollar.
And now he knows he is.

1151
01:12:32,172 --> 01:12:36,290
That's why he ate such a supper.
He had a load off his mind, knowing he...

1152
01:12:36,492 --> 01:12:39,052
...he wasn't doomed to...

1153
01:12:39,692 --> 01:12:42,047
...what he thought he was doomed to.

1154
01:12:44,492 --> 01:12:46,448
Nothing's going to hurt Big Daddy.

1155
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:48,762
We won't allow anything to happen to him.

1156
01:12:49,292 --> 01:12:51,362
Doc, come here!

1157
01:12:51,452 --> 01:12:52,805
I don't need any doctor.

1158
01:12:52,892 --> 01:12:54,689
He's something to say about Big Daddy.

1159
01:12:54,772 --> 01:12:56,251
I want Brick.

1160
01:12:57,052 --> 01:12:58,883
He'll be down directly.

1161
01:12:59,092 --> 01:13:01,367
Sticky rain always makes me sick.

1162
01:13:02,372 --> 01:13:04,932
Give me something
to wash this tablet down with.

1163
01:13:05,172 --> 01:13:08,130
What's wrong?
You've all got such long faces.

1164
01:13:10,932 --> 01:13:12,126
Big Mama needs you.

1165
01:13:12,332 --> 01:13:13,890
They'll tell her without me.

1166
01:13:14,012 --> 01:13:15,491
Please, Brick.

1167
01:13:15,692 --> 01:13:18,286
I just can't stand the way
that Mae and Gooper are--

1168
01:13:18,452 --> 01:13:20,886
What? Trying to grab this place
for themselves?

1169
01:13:21,092 --> 01:13:23,128
Let them have it all.

1170
01:13:23,332 --> 01:13:25,641
If you want to fight for a piece
of his carcass...

1171
01:13:25,732 --> 01:13:27,962
...you go ahead,
but you'll do it without me.

1172
01:13:28,052 --> 01:13:32,170
I deserved that. But not this time.
This time you're wrong.

1173
01:13:32,372 --> 01:13:33,725
What I can't stand is....

1174
01:13:33,812 --> 01:13:36,849
It's not losing this place, it's Big Mama.

1175
01:13:37,772 --> 01:13:40,491
I know what it's like
to lose somebody you love.

1176
01:13:40,692 --> 01:13:43,286
Careful, your claws are showing.

1177
01:13:46,452 --> 01:13:47,726
Close that door.

1178
01:13:47,932 --> 01:13:49,524
Don't close that door.

1179
01:13:50,452 --> 01:13:52,044
Let a little air circulate.

1180
01:13:52,732 --> 01:13:55,644
We shouldn't risk Big Daddy
hearing this discussion.

1181
01:13:56,052 --> 01:13:58,008
What discussion of what?

1182
01:13:58,092 --> 01:13:59,650
-Maggie, Brick!
-Now, now, Big Mama--

1183
01:13:59,732 --> 01:14:02,371
There won't be a word said
in Big Daddy's house...

1184
01:14:02,572 --> 01:14:05,530
...that he can't hear if he wants to.
Brick, where are you?

1185
01:14:05,612 --> 01:14:07,887
Where do you think?
Gone to pieces, that's where!

1186
01:14:08,292 --> 01:14:10,328
Doc, ain't there a cure for drinkers?

1187
01:14:10,532 --> 01:14:12,488
-He don't need no cure.
-Of course not.

1188
01:14:12,692 --> 01:14:14,922
He'll just drink all the whisky in the state.

1189
01:14:15,132 --> 01:14:16,565
Stop that kind of talk!

1190
01:14:17,492 --> 01:14:21,041
Big Daddy takes a drink now and then.
I don't trust a man who don't drink.

1191
01:14:21,252 --> 01:14:22,685
Good for you!

1192
01:14:23,332 --> 01:14:25,926
Sit down and hold Big Mama's hand
while we talk.

1193
01:14:27,492 --> 01:14:29,323
What are you all surrounding me for?

1194
01:14:29,532 --> 01:14:31,329
I don't need anyone to hold my hand.

1195
01:14:31,532 --> 01:14:32,442
Are you all crazy?

1196
01:14:32,532 --> 01:14:35,763
-You calm yourself, sweetheart.
-You calm yourself, Sister Woman!

1197
01:14:35,972 --> 01:14:37,246
How can I calm myself...

1198
01:14:37,332 --> 01:14:40,210
...with everyone staring at me
as if blood was on my face?

1199
01:14:42,132 --> 01:14:43,963
What's all this about?

1200
01:14:45,052 --> 01:14:46,167
Sit down, Mae.

1201
01:14:46,372 --> 01:14:49,125
Big Mama wants to know the truth
about the clinic report.

1202
01:14:49,332 --> 01:14:50,651
Truth!

1203
01:14:51,532 --> 01:14:54,092
Everybody keeps hollering about the truth.

1204
01:14:54,292 --> 01:14:55,691
The truth is as dirty...

1205
01:14:55,892 --> 01:14:56,961
...as lies!

1206
01:15:05,492 --> 01:15:07,323
Is there something I don't know, Doc?

1207
01:15:07,412 --> 01:15:08,367
Well, Ida....

1208
01:15:08,492 --> 01:15:09,971
I want to know!

1209
01:15:13,292 --> 01:15:16,250
-Somebody must be lying.
-Sit down, Mama, please.

1210
01:15:16,892 --> 01:15:18,610
I want to know about my husband.

1211
01:15:18,852 --> 01:15:22,367
He had the most thorough examination
at the Oppenheim Clinic.

1212
01:15:22,572 --> 01:15:24,528
One of the best clinics in the country.

1213
01:15:24,612 --> 01:15:27,080
The best in the country, bar none.

1214
01:15:27,252 --> 01:15:29,812
They were 99.9 percent sure
before they even started.

1215
01:15:30,052 --> 01:15:31,246
Right, Doc?

1216
01:15:31,572 --> 01:15:32,561
Sure of what?

1217
01:15:32,692 --> 01:15:34,091
-Not now!
-The test was positive!

1218
01:15:34,292 --> 01:15:35,725
Shut up.

1219
01:15:41,332 --> 01:15:44,404
It's hopeless. He knows it, too.

1220
01:15:45,372 --> 01:15:46,361
Hopeless?

1221
01:15:46,572 --> 01:15:49,132
-Now, now, darling.
-You had to know.

1222
01:15:50,292 --> 01:15:53,011
Why didn't they cut it out of him?

1223
01:15:54,292 --> 01:15:57,125
-It's gone past the knife.
-He's dying, Big Mama.

1224
01:15:57,332 --> 01:15:59,607
You get away from me, Mae!

1225
01:15:59,812 --> 01:16:00,608
I want Brick.

1226
01:16:00,692 --> 01:16:02,683
Where's my Brick? Where's my only son?

1227
01:16:06,572 --> 01:16:08,369
Mama, please.

1228
01:16:09,772 --> 01:16:11,842
-I'm your son, too.
-Gooper's your firstborn.

1229
01:16:11,932 --> 01:16:13,763
-Now, listen to me!
-No!

1230
01:16:14,172 --> 01:16:16,049
-He'll be in pain.
-Gooper and I think--

1231
01:16:16,252 --> 01:16:17,605
Shut up!

1232
01:16:17,812 --> 01:16:19,450
Do you want to see him suffer?

1233
01:16:19,572 --> 01:16:21,961
Then he's got to be started on morphine.

1234
01:16:22,132 --> 01:16:24,692
Nobody's going to give
my husband morphine.

1235
01:16:31,772 --> 01:16:34,286
Why don't you give her a while
to adjust to the idea?

1236
01:16:34,372 --> 01:16:36,124
It's Maggie who's upsetting her.

1237
01:16:36,212 --> 01:16:40,205
Instead of the needle, haven't you got a pill
to make the pain disappear?

1238
01:16:40,372 --> 01:16:43,808
Sometimes I wish I had a pill
to make people disappear.

1239
01:16:44,012 --> 01:16:46,526
Thanks for everything, Doc.
We sure do appreciate....

1240
01:17:03,092 --> 01:17:03,888
Does Brick know?

1241
01:17:17,492 --> 01:17:19,323
You know, honey...

1242
01:17:21,212 --> 01:17:23,521
...we was never a very happy family.

1243
01:17:25,972 --> 01:17:28,247
There wasn't much joy in this house.

1244
01:17:28,452 --> 01:17:31,569
It wasn't Big Daddy's fault. It was just....

1245
01:17:32,052 --> 01:17:35,442
You know how some homes are happy.

1246
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:41,009
I thought, coming home from the clinic
today, ''Now we'll be happy here.''

1247
01:17:41,612 --> 01:17:44,763
You and Brick will live with us
and have your children here.

1248
01:17:44,972 --> 01:17:47,088
And we'll help each other be happy.

1249
01:17:52,172 --> 01:17:54,083
Nothing's ever the way you plan, is it?

1250
01:18:00,732 --> 01:18:02,006
Margaret, honey...

1251
01:18:02,212 --> 01:18:03,486
...you've got to help Brick.

1252
01:18:03,572 --> 01:18:05,164
Make him pull himself together.

1253
01:18:05,372 --> 01:18:07,966
-He's going to take hold of things.
-What things?

1254
01:18:10,532 --> 01:18:11,408
The place.

1255
01:18:11,892 --> 01:18:13,530
Big Mama, you've had a shock.

1256
01:18:13,732 --> 01:18:14,960
We've all had a shock.

1257
01:18:15,052 --> 01:18:17,885
-Let's be realistic.
-Big Daddy wouldn't be foolish enough--

1258
01:18:17,972 --> 01:18:21,089
He'd never put this place
in irresponsible hands!

1259
01:18:21,172 --> 01:18:23,481
He ain't putting this place
in anybody's hands.

1260
01:18:23,892 --> 01:18:26,167
My husband is not going to die!

1261
01:18:26,372 --> 01:18:28,681
I want you to get that in your heads.
Both of you.

1262
01:18:28,772 --> 01:18:31,127
-We're hoping too.
-We intend to pray for him.

1263
01:18:31,332 --> 01:18:33,323
I won't let you persuade Big Daddy to--

1264
01:18:33,412 --> 01:18:35,323
Gooper is your firstborn!

1265
01:18:35,532 --> 01:18:39,081
He's always had to carry a bigger load
of the responsibilities than Brick.

1266
01:18:39,572 --> 01:18:43,201
Brick never carried a thing in his life
but a football or a highball.

1267
01:18:43,412 --> 01:18:44,731
Will you let me talk, please?

1268
01:18:44,812 --> 01:18:46,211
Yes, of course.

1269
01:18:47,652 --> 01:18:50,405
A 28,000 acre plantation
is a mighty big thing to run.

1270
01:18:50,612 --> 01:18:51,965
Almost single-handed.

1271
01:18:52,172 --> 01:18:55,562
You had your law practice in Memphis.
When did you run this place?

1272
01:18:55,732 --> 01:18:58,166
Mama, let's be fair.

1273
01:18:58,852 --> 01:19:01,082
Ever since Big Daddy's health
started failing...

1274
01:19:01,172 --> 01:19:03,732
...Gooper's worked like a fool
to keep this place up.

1275
01:19:03,932 --> 01:19:07,368
Gooper won't admit it.
He never thought of it as a duty.

1276
01:19:07,852 --> 01:19:09,570
Big Daddy don't know what he owns.

1277
01:19:09,772 --> 01:19:13,685
The point is I won't see this place ruined
by a drunken ex-football hero.

1278
01:19:13,892 --> 01:19:15,644
Shut up about my husband!

1279
01:19:15,852 --> 01:19:16,648
You shut up!

1280
01:19:16,732 --> 01:19:18,609
He has no right to slander--

1281
01:19:18,812 --> 01:19:21,372
I can discuss my brother
with my family members...

1282
01:19:21,812 --> 01:19:24,007
...which don't include you!

1283
01:19:25,692 --> 01:19:27,330
Why not go up and drink with Brick?

1284
01:19:27,412 --> 01:19:29,846
If the hero hadn't passed out already.

1285
01:19:30,052 --> 01:19:32,441
He may have to pass up
the Sugar Bowl this year.

1286
01:19:32,852 --> 01:19:34,968
Or was it the Rose Bowl
he made his run in?

1287
01:19:35,052 --> 01:19:36,644
It was the punch bowl, honey.

1288
01:19:36,732 --> 01:19:38,688
The cut-glass punch bowl.

1289
01:19:39,212 --> 01:19:41,203
I always get that boy's bowls mixed up.

1290
01:19:41,812 --> 01:19:45,248
I have never seen such malice
toward a brother.

1291
01:19:45,452 --> 01:19:47,568
What about his malice toward Gooper?

1292
01:19:47,772 --> 01:19:50,445
He can't even stand being
in the same room with me.

1293
01:19:52,452 --> 01:19:53,965
Can I help you, Mr. Brick?

1294
01:19:54,132 --> 01:19:55,451
No, thank you, Lacey.

1295
01:19:55,652 --> 01:19:58,212
-Where's my father?
-He's in the cellar.

1296
01:19:58,412 --> 01:20:00,209
And he's alone.

1297
01:20:00,572 --> 01:20:01,687
And he's....

1298
01:20:02,372 --> 01:20:03,930
Thank you, Lacey.

1299
01:20:04,412 --> 01:20:07,484
-It's a deliberate campaign to ruin Brick.
-He don't need help.

1300
01:20:07,572 --> 01:20:10,325
For the most disgusting,
sordid reasons on earth.

1301
01:20:10,532 --> 01:20:11,442
Avarice.

1302
01:20:11,652 --> 01:20:14,041
Avarice and greed!

1303
01:20:14,252 --> 01:20:15,128
No, Margaret.

1304
01:20:15,332 --> 01:20:16,651
Don't cry.

1305
01:20:16,852 --> 01:20:19,082
That takes the cake!

1306
01:20:19,292 --> 01:20:20,964
Who are the tears for?

1307
01:20:21,812 --> 01:20:22,528
Brick?

1308
01:20:22,732 --> 01:20:23,767
Big Daddy?

1309
01:20:23,852 --> 01:20:24,921
Or for yourself?

1310
01:20:25,252 --> 01:20:27,083
Are you crying 'cause you're childless?

1311
01:20:27,172 --> 01:20:28,730
You know why she's got no kids?

1312
01:20:28,932 --> 01:20:32,129
Ask her big, beautiful husband.

1313
01:20:32,932 --> 01:20:35,526
You just won't let me do this
the nice way, will you?

1314
01:20:37,452 --> 01:20:39,647
You always said I never loved Big Daddy.

1315
01:20:39,852 --> 01:20:41,285
How would you know?

1316
01:20:42,572 --> 01:20:43,800
How would he know?

1317
01:20:43,932 --> 01:20:45,809
Did he ever let anyone love him?

1318
01:20:46,012 --> 01:20:48,480
It was always Brick.
From the day he was born...

1319
01:20:48,572 --> 01:20:51,086
...he was always partial to Brick. Why?

1320
01:20:51,252 --> 01:20:53,812
Big Daddy wanted me to become a lawyer.
I did.

1321
01:20:54,012 --> 01:20:55,331
He said get married. I did.

1322
01:20:55,532 --> 01:20:57,250
He said have kids. I did.

1323
01:20:57,452 --> 01:20:59,408
He said live in Memphis. I did.

1324
01:20:59,612 --> 01:21:02,126
Whatever he said to do, I did.

1325
01:21:03,332 --> 01:21:05,892
I don't give a damn
whether Big Daddy likes me...

1326
01:21:06,092 --> 01:21:07,650
...or did or never did...

1327
01:21:07,852 --> 01:21:09,888
...or will or will never.

1328
01:21:11,172 --> 01:21:14,562
I've appealed for common decency
and fair play.

1329
01:21:14,772 --> 01:21:16,410
Now I'm telling you!

1330
01:21:16,732 --> 01:21:18,609
I intend to protect my interests.

1331
01:21:18,772 --> 01:21:21,332
I'm not a corporation lawyer for nothing.

1332
01:21:22,012 --> 01:21:23,968
Go get my briefcase out of our bedroom.

1333
01:21:30,572 --> 01:21:32,130
It was....

1334
01:21:32,372 --> 01:21:34,966
It was the Cotton Bowl, Sister Woman.

1335
01:21:53,812 --> 01:21:54,927
Pa?

1336
01:22:34,332 --> 01:22:36,892
-Give me your hand.
-I don't want your hand!

1337
01:23:28,412 --> 01:23:29,367
No.

1338
01:23:29,572 --> 01:23:30,925
It's my pain.

1339
01:23:31,092 --> 01:23:32,844
That makes it my business.

1340
01:23:33,172 --> 01:23:35,925
I thought you went and hid yourself.
What do you want?

1341
01:23:36,172 --> 01:23:38,128
I came to apologize.

1342
01:23:39,572 --> 01:23:41,244
What for, telling me the truth?

1343
01:23:41,452 --> 01:23:44,649
-There must a dozen reasons.
-Save them.

1344
01:23:44,852 --> 01:23:47,366
I hate apologies. Especially for the truth.

1345
01:23:47,572 --> 01:23:50,530
Whatever you did, don't apologize.
Just don't do it again.

1346
01:23:50,732 --> 01:23:52,723
If you didn't do it, start doing it.

1347
01:23:52,932 --> 01:23:54,923
Start by getting me a cigar
out of that coat.

1348
01:23:55,012 --> 01:23:57,526
-You think you ought to--
-Get me the cigar, boy!

1349
01:24:03,212 --> 01:24:04,201
It's wet from rain.

1350
01:24:04,292 --> 01:24:08,171
You're all wet yourself.
It's a lousy joke, but it's true.

1351
01:24:11,892 --> 01:24:13,803
Modern science!

1352
01:24:25,812 --> 01:24:27,291
Get me that...

1353
01:24:31,612 --> 01:24:32,442
...that robe.

1354
01:24:43,852 --> 01:24:46,764
-There's a bottle in that desk.
-I don't want a drink.

1355
01:24:46,972 --> 01:24:48,371
I do.

1356
01:24:48,532 --> 01:24:50,124
I want a drink.

1357
01:24:50,612 --> 01:24:53,172
I've got a million clicks in my guts.

1358
01:24:54,452 --> 01:24:56,841
Knives sharpening themselves.

1359
01:24:59,732 --> 01:25:01,848
You know about clicks, don't you?

1360
01:25:04,932 --> 01:25:07,162
So you bought me a birthday present, huh?

1361
01:25:08,452 --> 01:25:10,170
No, Maggie bought it.

1362
01:25:11,932 --> 01:25:14,924
-She's got good taste that girl.
-In some things, yes...

1363
01:25:15,132 --> 01:25:16,804
...but not in men.

1364
01:25:19,612 --> 01:25:21,170
Nice soft material.

1365
01:25:21,572 --> 01:25:23,449
This is my soft birthday.

1366
01:25:23,652 --> 01:25:26,883
Not my gold or silver.
This is my soft birthday.

1367
01:25:31,892 --> 01:25:33,484
Here's to my...

1368
01:25:33,652 --> 01:25:35,404
...last birthday.

1369
01:25:36,692 --> 01:25:38,683
Aren't you drinking to that?

1370
01:25:40,852 --> 01:25:42,444
Clickety-click.

1371
01:25:53,452 --> 01:25:55,602
You know what I'm going to do
before I die?

1372
01:25:56,852 --> 01:25:58,922
I'm going to open up all these boxes.

1373
01:26:01,172 --> 01:26:02,764
Will you look at this stuff?

1374
01:26:03,332 --> 01:26:04,447
Bought most of it...

1375
01:26:04,652 --> 01:26:07,166
...when I took your mother to Europe
on that tour.

1376
01:26:07,252 --> 01:26:09,971
Never had such a lousy time in my life.

1377
01:26:10,292 --> 01:26:13,011
That Europe is nothing
but a great big auction.

1378
01:26:13,292 --> 01:26:16,841
Bunch of old worn-out places.
It's just a big fire sale.

1379
01:26:17,052 --> 01:26:19,043
Big Mama went wild in it.

1380
01:26:19,252 --> 01:26:21,812
She just bought and bought.

1381
01:26:22,532 --> 01:26:25,410
She was lucky I'm a rich man.
Yes, it sure is lucky.

1382
01:26:26,172 --> 01:26:29,164
Got any idea what I'm worth? Ask Gooper.

1383
01:26:29,372 --> 01:26:31,966
He knows to the penny
unless I miss my guess.

1384
01:26:33,332 --> 01:26:36,847
Close on $10 million in cash
and blue-chip stocks...

1385
01:26:37,052 --> 01:26:39,771
...besides some 28,000 acres
of the richest land...

1386
01:26:39,972 --> 01:26:41,724
...this side of the Valley Nile.

1387
01:26:41,932 --> 01:26:44,048
That is pretty rich to be.

1388
01:26:46,732 --> 01:26:51,328
There's one thing you can't buy
in a Europe fire sale...

1389
01:26:51,852 --> 01:26:54,002
...or any other market on earth.

1390
01:26:54,612 --> 01:26:56,170
That's your life.

1391
01:26:58,932 --> 01:27:01,571
You can't buy back your life
when it's finished.

1392
01:27:01,812 --> 01:27:03,609
No, sir. Nobody can do that.

1393
01:27:05,252 --> 01:27:06,651
Feeling sorry for me or you?

1394
01:27:11,092 --> 01:27:12,047
For you, Papa.

1395
01:27:12,212 --> 01:27:14,772
That's good,
because you're going to miss me.

1396
01:27:16,812 --> 01:27:19,246
Why did you let Ma buy all this stuff?

1397
01:27:19,892 --> 01:27:23,680
The human animal is a beast
that eventually has to die.

1398
01:27:24,052 --> 01:27:27,328
If he's got money, he buys and he buys.

1399
01:27:28,212 --> 01:27:30,931
The reason why he buys everything he can,
is because...

1400
01:27:31,012 --> 01:27:34,846
...of a crazy hope that one of the things
he buys will be life everlasting...

1401
01:27:35,412 --> 01:27:37,243
...which it never can be.

1402
01:27:37,652 --> 01:27:41,247
I've suddenly noticed you don't call me
Big Daddy anymore.

1403
01:27:41,452 --> 01:27:44,330
If you needed a Big Daddy,
why didn't you come to me?

1404
01:27:44,532 --> 01:27:48,366
If you wanted someone to lean on, why
Skipper? Why not me? I'm your father.

1405
01:27:48,652 --> 01:27:51,325
You should've come to your kinfolk.
Those who love you.

1406
01:27:51,412 --> 01:27:54,688
You don't know what love means.
To you it's another four-letter word.

1407
01:27:54,772 --> 01:27:56,251
You've got a short memory.

1408
01:27:56,532 --> 01:28:00,241
-What did you want that I didn't buy?
-You can't buy love!

1409
01:28:00,452 --> 01:28:03,683
You bought $1 million worth of junk!
Does it love you?

1410
01:28:03,892 --> 01:28:07,123
Who do you think I bought it for?
It's yours, the place, the money!

1411
01:28:07,332 --> 01:28:09,209
I don't want things!

1412
01:28:11,652 --> 01:28:13,290
We drew this up--

1413
01:28:15,412 --> 01:28:18,722
-We drew this up with the advice--
-Get out of the way.

1414
01:28:20,532 --> 01:28:22,762
-Get out of my way.
-We're settling this first.

1415
01:28:22,852 --> 01:28:25,844
-I don't want to see it.
-It's a sort of a plan. A preliminary.

1416
01:28:33,332 --> 01:28:34,811
Waste!

1417
01:28:44,372 --> 01:28:45,725
Worthless!

1418
01:28:54,292 --> 01:28:55,725
Worthless!

1419
01:29:16,812 --> 01:29:17,847
Don't, son.

1420
01:29:19,412 --> 01:29:20,845
Please don't cry.

1421
01:29:35,292 --> 01:29:36,520
That's funny.

1422
01:29:37,132 --> 01:29:40,568
I never saw you cry before.
Did you ever cry as a kid?

1423
01:29:40,652 --> 01:29:45,009
Can't you understand?
I never wanted your place or money.

1424
01:29:45,292 --> 01:29:47,408
I don't want to own anything!

1425
01:29:47,612 --> 01:29:50,763
All I wanted was a father, not a boss!

1426
01:29:51,252 --> 01:29:53,288
I wanted you to love me.

1427
01:29:53,492 --> 01:29:54,971
I did and I do.

1428
01:29:56,012 --> 01:29:58,446
Not me and not Gooper,
and not even Mama.

1429
01:29:58,612 --> 01:29:59,931
That's a lie.

1430
01:30:00,132 --> 01:30:01,565
I loved her. I gave her--

1431
01:30:01,772 --> 01:30:04,730
Things, Papa, you gave her things.

1432
01:30:04,932 --> 01:30:07,366
A house, a trip to Europe, all this junk.

1433
01:30:07,572 --> 01:30:11,042
Some jewelry.
You gave her things, not love.

1434
01:30:12,692 --> 01:30:14,489
I gave her an empire.

1435
01:30:14,692 --> 01:30:17,490
I've seen you out there on your empire...

1436
01:30:17,692 --> 01:30:20,729
...with the men who run it for you.
You don't know their names...

1437
01:30:20,932 --> 01:30:24,402
...or if they've kids or are happy.
You've never looked into their faces.

1438
01:30:24,492 --> 01:30:27,962
What are faces? You don't build an empire
by remembering faces.

1439
01:30:28,212 --> 01:30:31,090
Next week,
I'll start building that textile plant.

1440
01:30:31,292 --> 01:30:35,080
I'll not only grow my own cotton,
I'll weave it and market it.

1441
01:30:35,252 --> 01:30:35,968
I'll tell you...

1442
01:30:36,172 --> 01:30:38,481
...in a year or two from now--

1443
01:30:53,572 --> 01:30:57,645
The men who build empires die,
and empires die too.

1444
01:30:58,292 --> 01:30:59,520
No, it won't.

1445
01:30:59,732 --> 01:31:01,643
That's why I've got you and Gooper.

1446
01:31:01,852 --> 01:31:03,046
Look at Gooper.

1447
01:31:03,252 --> 01:31:06,483
Look at what he's become.
Is that what you wanted him to be?

1448
01:31:06,692 --> 01:31:08,125
Look at me.

1449
01:31:08,452 --> 01:31:12,491
You were right. I am a 30-year-old kid.
And pretty soon I'll be a 50-year-old kid.

1450
01:31:12,692 --> 01:31:15,889
I don't know what to believe in.
What's the good of living?

1451
01:31:16,092 --> 01:31:19,482
There's got to be some purpose in life,
some meaning.

1452
01:31:20,092 --> 01:31:23,562
Look at me, for the sake of God,
before it's too late!

1453
01:31:23,732 --> 01:31:26,485
For once, look at me as I really am.

1454
01:31:26,692 --> 01:31:27,920
Look at me!

1455
01:31:29,332 --> 01:31:30,845
I'm a failure. I'm a drunk.

1456
01:31:30,972 --> 01:31:34,442
On my own in the open market,
I'm not worth the price of a decent burial.

1457
01:31:34,652 --> 01:31:39,009
-All of you blame me for everything, huh?
-No, Papa.

1458
01:31:42,372 --> 01:31:45,284
We've known each other all my life
and we're strangers.

1459
01:31:45,892 --> 01:31:50,249
You own 28,000 acres.
You own $10 million.

1460
01:31:50,452 --> 01:31:54,650
You own a wife and two children.
You own us, but you don't love us.

1461
01:31:55,612 --> 01:31:58,080
-In my own way--
-No, sir.

1462
01:31:58,492 --> 01:32:00,483
You don't even like people.

1463
01:32:01,412 --> 01:32:04,609
You wanted Gooper and me to have kids.
Why?

1464
01:32:05,732 --> 01:32:09,611
I want a part of me to keep living.
I won't have it end with the grave.

1465
01:32:09,812 --> 01:32:10,961
Look!

1466
01:32:11,572 --> 01:32:14,006
This is what my father left me.

1467
01:32:14,212 --> 01:32:15,645
This lousy old suitcase!

1468
01:32:16,332 --> 01:32:18,527
On the inside was nothing...

1469
01:32:18,732 --> 01:32:22,281
...but his uniform
from the Spanish-American War.

1470
01:32:22,492 --> 01:32:24,722
This was his legacy to me.

1471
01:32:24,932 --> 01:32:26,524
Nothing at all!

1472
01:32:28,532 --> 01:32:31,330
And I built this place from nothing.

1473
01:32:36,172 --> 01:32:38,242
And that's all he left you?

1474
01:32:38,612 --> 01:32:41,046
Yeah, he was a hobo.

1475
01:32:42,612 --> 01:32:45,365
Best-known tramp on the boxcar circuit.

1476
01:32:45,572 --> 01:32:48,962
He worked once in a while as a field hand.
I'd tag along.

1477
01:32:49,572 --> 01:32:52,848
Sat on my bare bottom, in the dirt,
waiting for him.

1478
01:32:54,292 --> 01:32:55,964
Outside of hunger...

1479
01:32:56,172 --> 01:32:58,527
...first thing I could remember is shame.

1480
01:32:58,732 --> 01:33:01,451
I was ashamed
of that miserable, old tramp.

1481
01:33:01,892 --> 01:33:06,044
I was riding boxcars when I was nine,
something you never had to do.

1482
01:33:06,252 --> 01:33:09,483
And you'll never have to bury me
like I did him.

1483
01:33:10,172 --> 01:33:13,323
I buried him in a meadow,
alongside a railroad track.

1484
01:33:13,492 --> 01:33:16,768
We were running to catch a freight
and his heart gave out.

1485
01:33:19,692 --> 01:33:21,091
You know something?

1486
01:33:22,372 --> 01:33:24,488
That lousy old tramp died laughing.

1487
01:33:24,692 --> 01:33:26,284
Laughing at what?

1488
01:33:27,252 --> 01:33:29,049
Himself, I guess.

1489
01:33:29,252 --> 01:33:30,651
A hobo tramp...

1490
01:33:30,852 --> 01:33:34,561
...not a nickel in his jeans.
No future, no past.

1491
01:33:36,052 --> 01:33:39,727
Or maybe he was laughing
because he was happy.

1492
01:33:40,612 --> 01:33:42,443
Happy at having you with him.

1493
01:33:42,612 --> 01:33:45,331
He took you everywhere
and he kept you with him.

1494
01:33:47,092 --> 01:33:48,969
I don't want to talk about that.

1495
01:34:03,732 --> 01:34:05,450
Yeah, I loved him.

1496
01:34:09,332 --> 01:34:12,130
I reckon I never loved anything
as much as that...

1497
01:34:12,332 --> 01:34:13,970
...lousy old tramp.

1498
01:34:15,732 --> 01:34:17,085
And you say...

1499
01:34:17,292 --> 01:34:19,601
...he left you nothing but a suitcase...

1500
01:34:19,812 --> 01:34:23,168
...with a uniform in it
from the Spanish-American War?

1501
01:34:23,692 --> 01:34:25,330
And some memories.

1502
01:34:26,612 --> 01:34:27,806
And love.

1503
01:34:33,452 --> 01:34:35,727
Did I tell you all them stories
about my old man?

1504
01:34:35,932 --> 01:34:37,445
About fifty times.

1505
01:34:51,092 --> 01:34:54,448
It's a plan to protect the Delta's
biggest estate from irresponsibility.

1506
01:34:54,532 --> 01:34:55,487
You have to sign.

1507
01:34:58,612 --> 01:35:00,330
Where is it?

1508
01:35:01,172 --> 01:35:01,809
What?

1509
01:35:01,932 --> 01:35:05,129
What the doctor left
to make his pain easier.

1510
01:35:05,772 --> 01:35:09,321
Brick's down there with him.
He'll help Big Daddy.

1511
01:35:09,532 --> 01:35:10,931
Help him? How?

1512
01:35:11,132 --> 01:35:13,123
By running the 100-yard dash?

1513
01:35:13,332 --> 01:35:16,244
Maybe he'll cheer him up
by kicking some field goals.

1514
01:35:16,532 --> 01:35:19,251
One more crack, Queenie...

1515
01:35:19,412 --> 01:35:23,644
...and I will not only spit in your eye
but I will punch it black and blue.

1516
01:35:23,732 --> 01:35:24,562
Hold on a minute!

1517
01:35:24,652 --> 01:35:27,166
-I'm not listening to any more--
-Mae was only saying--

1518
01:35:27,252 --> 01:35:29,891
I know what she said,
and I know exactly what she meant.

1519
01:35:29,972 --> 01:35:31,769
The only world that Brick knows--

1520
01:35:31,852 --> 01:35:34,002
It's not a world he made.

1521
01:35:38,132 --> 01:35:39,008
Ladies!

1522
01:35:40,852 --> 01:35:43,207
-No.
-Why won't you take it?

1523
01:35:44,172 --> 01:35:47,369
-It'll kill the pain, that's all.
-It'll kill the senses, too.

1524
01:35:47,572 --> 01:35:50,211
When you've got pain
at least you know you're alive.

1525
01:35:56,052 --> 01:35:57,963
It's easing somewhat now.

1526
01:35:59,892 --> 01:36:01,564
When you've got pain...

1527
01:36:01,972 --> 01:36:04,884
...it's better to judge yourself,
a lot of things.

1528
01:36:05,092 --> 01:36:07,481
I'm not going to stupefy myself
with that stuff.

1529
01:36:07,572 --> 01:36:09,164
I want to think clear.

1530
01:36:09,372 --> 01:36:11,761
I want to see everything
and feel everything.

1531
01:36:11,972 --> 01:36:13,644
Then I won't mind going.

1532
01:36:14,772 --> 01:36:16,842
I've got the guts to die.

1533
01:36:17,052 --> 01:36:19,885
What I want to know is,
have you got the guts to live?

1534
01:36:20,252 --> 01:36:21,651
I don't know.

1535
01:36:22,932 --> 01:36:24,411
We can try.

1536
01:36:26,252 --> 01:36:29,164
We could start by helping each other
up these stairs.

1537
01:36:41,172 --> 01:36:42,321
Yes, sir.

1538
01:36:45,772 --> 01:36:46,841
At least read them.

1539
01:36:46,972 --> 01:36:49,122
Put those papers away
before I tear them up.

1540
01:36:49,332 --> 01:36:51,482
I don't want to know what's in them.

1541
01:36:51,692 --> 01:36:55,970
I'm talking in Big Daddy's language.
I'm his wife, not his widow. His wife!

1542
01:36:56,332 --> 01:36:58,607
-What I've got here--
-He said it's just a plan.

1543
01:36:58,692 --> 01:37:02,367
Plan basis. What I'll say to your plan is....

1544
01:37:03,932 --> 01:37:06,924
What is it Big Daddy says
when he's disgusted?

1545
01:37:07,132 --> 01:37:09,965
He says ''bull'' when he's disgusted.

1546
01:37:10,132 --> 01:37:12,726
That's right. I say ''bull'' like Big Daddy.

1547
01:37:12,932 --> 01:37:15,685
-Coarse language don't seem called for.
-Bull!

1548
01:37:15,892 --> 01:37:17,803
I am outraged by this kind of talk.

1549
01:37:17,892 --> 01:37:20,884
Then stop talking like your father's dead
and me along with him.

1550
01:37:20,972 --> 01:37:22,928
What about her? She wants her share, too.

1551
01:37:24,132 --> 01:37:26,202
As far as Brick is concerned...

1552
01:37:26,412 --> 01:37:28,846
...nobody's going to take nothing.

1553
01:37:29,052 --> 01:37:30,690
Not till Big Daddy lets go...

1554
01:37:30,892 --> 01:37:34,771
...and maybe just possibly, not even then!

1555
01:37:35,092 --> 01:37:37,003
No, Mama, not even then.

1556
01:37:41,012 --> 01:37:42,730
Hello, Bucky!

1557
01:37:45,492 --> 01:37:48,211
Looks like the wind took some liberties
with this place.

1558
01:37:48,372 --> 01:37:50,044
-Evening, Cap'n!
-Evening, Cap'n!

1559
01:37:50,132 --> 01:37:52,726
-Storm cross over the river?
-Gone to Arkansas.

1560
01:37:52,932 --> 01:37:54,604
Rain do some good, Cap'n?

1561
01:37:54,772 --> 01:37:56,364
Some good, I reckon.

1562
01:37:58,292 --> 01:37:59,520
Some good.

1563
01:38:01,172 --> 01:38:02,525
You could at least read them.

1564
01:38:02,612 --> 01:38:05,649
Put them away before I tear them up.
I don't know what's in them.

1565
01:38:05,812 --> 01:38:07,245
I don't want to know.

1566
01:38:08,772 --> 01:38:09,966
Can I come in?

1567
01:38:11,772 --> 01:38:14,366
Has the storm done any damage?

1568
01:38:14,572 --> 01:38:17,086
Which storm are you talking about?
The one outside...

1569
01:38:17,172 --> 01:38:19,083
...or that hullabaloo going on in here?

1570
01:38:27,452 --> 01:38:28,567
Excuse me, sir.

1571
01:38:28,892 --> 01:38:33,204
Heard some mighty loud talking.
What's the powwow about?

1572
01:38:33,572 --> 01:38:36,484
Nothing, Big Daddy. Nothing at all.

1573
01:38:36,972 --> 01:38:39,964
What's in them important-looking
documents you've got there?

1574
01:38:40,372 --> 01:38:42,932
Nothing. Nothing much of anything at all.

1575
01:38:43,212 --> 01:38:47,569
Then what are you and Sister Woman
scurrying and scrounging around for?

1576
01:38:48,172 --> 01:38:50,606
Looks like a whole lot of nothing to me.

1577
01:38:53,772 --> 01:38:55,808
What's that smell in this room?

1578
01:38:56,612 --> 01:38:58,284
Didn't you notice it, Brick?

1579
01:38:58,932 --> 01:39:02,561
Didn't you notice the powerful
and obnoxious odor of mendacity?

1580
01:39:05,972 --> 01:39:08,440
Yes, sir, I think I did.

1581
01:39:08,652 --> 01:39:11,883
Ain't nothing more powerful
than the odor of mendacity.

1582
01:39:12,972 --> 01:39:15,327
-Didn't you notice it, Gooper?
-What, sir?

1583
01:39:15,572 --> 01:39:17,528
What about you, Sister Woman?

1584
01:39:17,732 --> 01:39:21,247
Didn't you notice an unpleasant smell
of mendacity in this room?

1585
01:39:21,732 --> 01:39:23,927
I don't even know what that is.

1586
01:39:24,132 --> 01:39:27,568
You can smell it. It smells like death.

1587
01:39:32,092 --> 01:39:35,880
What's the matter with that woman?
What's-your-name, what's wrong?

1588
01:39:36,252 --> 01:39:39,050
She just had a slight dizzy spell.

1589
01:39:39,252 --> 01:39:41,561
You'd better watch that.
A stroke's a bad way to go.

1590
01:39:44,252 --> 01:39:47,767
Look, he's wearing
Brick's birthday present.

1591
01:39:48,932 --> 01:39:52,368
I haven't given you my present yet
but I will now.

1592
01:39:52,692 --> 01:39:54,364
I have an announcement.

1593
01:39:54,572 --> 01:39:56,324
What kind of an announcement?

1594
01:39:57,732 --> 01:39:59,848
An announcement of life beginning.

1595
01:40:02,292 --> 01:40:04,123
A child is coming...

1596
01:40:05,172 --> 01:40:07,606
...sired by Brick out of Maggie the cat.

1597
01:40:11,412 --> 01:40:13,607
I have Brick's child in my body.

1598
01:40:14,452 --> 01:40:16,408
And that is my present to you.

1599
01:40:16,852 --> 01:40:20,481
Did you ever in your born days
hear such a bald-faced lie?

1600
01:40:20,692 --> 01:40:21,807
Shut up.

1601
01:40:23,572 --> 01:40:24,891
Thank you.

1602
01:40:25,092 --> 01:40:26,810
Thank you very much.

1603
01:40:39,732 --> 01:40:43,361
Yes, indeed, this girl has life in her body.

1604
01:40:44,372 --> 01:40:45,964
And that's no lie.

1605
01:40:46,892 --> 01:40:50,168
I want my lawyer in the morning.
My lawyer!

1606
01:40:51,732 --> 01:40:53,768
-Brick?
-Yes, Big Daddy?

1607
01:40:56,412 --> 01:40:59,324
I'm going out to look this place over
before I give it up.

1608
01:40:59,812 --> 01:41:01,848
The place and the people on it.

1609
01:41:07,852 --> 01:41:09,251
You want to come with me?

1610
01:41:22,612 --> 01:41:24,728
What were you two talking about
down there?

1611
01:41:24,812 --> 01:41:25,688
Us.

1612
01:41:26,092 --> 01:41:27,207
Me, too?

1613
01:41:28,052 --> 01:41:28,689
Yeah.

1614
01:41:28,892 --> 01:41:31,531
You ripped your own brother apart.

1615
01:41:32,812 --> 01:41:34,404
Do you believe that, Gooper?

1616
01:41:38,412 --> 01:41:39,811
-No.
-Well, I do!

1617
01:41:40,012 --> 01:41:40,922
Keep still.

1618
01:41:41,132 --> 01:41:45,250
A family crisis brings out the best
and the worst in every member.

1619
01:41:45,572 --> 01:41:46,971
That's the truth.

1620
01:41:47,212 --> 01:41:48,361
Amen.

1621
01:41:49,332 --> 01:41:52,529
You want to talk about the truth?
You're not pregnant.

1622
01:41:52,692 --> 01:41:54,045
-Be still.
-She made it up.

1623
01:41:54,252 --> 01:41:57,369
-I said shut up.
-Don't you try to kid us.

1624
01:41:58,812 --> 01:42:00,530
She's not kidding you.

1625
01:42:00,732 --> 01:42:04,008
How can she have a child by you,
when you won't even--

1626
01:42:04,252 --> 01:42:05,162
Keep quiet!

1627
01:42:05,372 --> 01:42:08,887
We occupy the next room
and the walls aren't soundproof.

1628
01:42:09,092 --> 01:42:13,404
We hear the nightly pleading
and the nightly refusals!

1629
01:42:13,612 --> 01:42:16,570
Not everybody makes as much noise
about love as you do.

1630
01:42:20,212 --> 01:42:23,648
I never thought you would stoop
to her level!

1631
01:42:23,732 --> 01:42:26,929
You heard what Big Daddy said,
''That girl's got life in her body.''

1632
01:42:27,012 --> 01:42:28,650
-That's a lie!
-No.

1633
01:42:30,052 --> 01:42:32,520
No, truth is something desperate,
and Maggie's got it.

1634
01:42:32,612 --> 01:42:35,922
Believe me, it is desperate,
and she has got it.

1635
01:42:37,532 --> 01:42:40,330
Why don't you say something, honey?

1636
01:42:40,852 --> 01:42:42,365
All right, honey.

1637
01:42:42,572 --> 01:42:43,607
Shut up!

1638
01:42:47,732 --> 01:42:48,847
Yes?

1639
01:42:49,012 --> 01:42:50,604
Come on up here.

1640
01:42:51,852 --> 01:42:52,887
Yes, sir!

1641
01:43:02,412 --> 01:43:04,368
That girl's got life in her, all right.

1642
01:43:07,332 --> 01:43:09,892
Thank you for keeping still.

1643
01:43:10,212 --> 01:43:12,328
For backing me up in my lie.

1644
01:43:14,372 --> 01:43:17,967
We are through with lies
and liars in this house.

1645
01:43:19,692 --> 01:43:20,886
Lock the door.
