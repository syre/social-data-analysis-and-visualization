<i>I am the police.</i>
<i>And I'm here to arrest you.</i>

<i>You've broken the law.</i>
<i>I did not write the law.</i>

00:00:43,883 --> 00:00:47,476
<i>I may even disagree with the law.
But I will enforce it.</i>

4
00:00:47,551 --> 00:00:49,541
<i>No matter how you plead,</i>
<i>cajole, beg</i>

00:00:49,617 --> 00:00:51,550
<i>or attempt to</i>

00:00:58,317 --> 00:01:00,477
<i>If you fight me,</i>
<i>I will fight back.</i>

10
00:01:00,551 --> 00:01:03,211
<i>If you shoot at me,</i>
<i>I will shoot back.</i>

11
00:01:03,718 --> 00:01:06,082
<i>By law, I am</i>
<i>unable to walk away.</i>

12
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,345
<i>I'm a consequence.</i>
<i>I am the unpaid bill.</i>

13
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:11,611
<i>I am fate with</i>
<i>a badge and a gun.</i>

14
00:01:12,284 --> 00:01:14,444
<i>Behind my badge is</i>
<i>a heart like yours.</i>

15
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,844
<i>I bleed. I think. I love.</i>

16
00:01:19,384 --> 00:01:21,647
<i>And, yes, I can be killed.</i>

17
00:01:22,484 --> 00:01:24,781
<i>And although I am but one man,</i>

18
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:27,682
<i>I have thousands of brothers and
sisters who are the same as me.</i>

19
00:01:28,684 --> 00:01:32,082
<i>They will lay down their lives for me.
And I them.</i>

20
00:01:32,784 --> 00:01:34,341
<i>We stand watch together.</i>

21
00:01:34,884 --> 00:01:36,350
<i>A thin blue line.</i>

22
00:01:36,517 --> 00:01:38,848
<i>Protecting the prey</i>
<i>from the predators.</i>

<i>The good from the bad.</i>

24
00:01:41,117 --> 00:01:43,141
<i>We are the police.</i>

Go ahead, motherfucker.
Try to run, you son of a bitch.

27
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,210
Hold on,
hold on, hold on!

Come around, come around, dude!
Come around!

Get the fuck around, dude!

<i>Pull to the right!
Pull to the right!</i>

Bro, he's not
gonna pull to the right.

36
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:19,142
You stupid motherfucker!

37
00:02:19,951 --> 00:02:21,349
Man, he almost lost it!

00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,712
Pit him, man!
Pit him, pit him!

39
00:02:26,451 --> 00:02:27,611
Got him!

40
00:02:35,617 --> 00:02:36,914
Fuck you!

41
00:02:45,918 --> 00:02:47,908
You good?
Good, good, good.

42
00:02:48,784 --> 00:02:50,876
This fucker's down.
I'm going to hook him.

43
00:02:58,384 --> 00:02:59,908
You're all good.

Holy shit.

48
00:03:15,784 --> 00:03:19,081
All right. This is my
day job. Some of you...

49
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:20,243
Sorry, bro, I'm recording.

50
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:23,341
This is my day job. Some of
you might know me as Brian.

51
00:03:23,417 --> 00:03:25,146
Or Taylor.

52
00:03:25,218 --> 00:03:28,310
But here I am Police
Officer Two Brian Taylor.

53
00:03:28,617 --> 00:03:30,948
This is where
the forces of good

54
00:03:31,051 --> 00:03:33,745
prepare to fight
the forces of evil.

55
00:03:34,051 --> 00:03:36,608
This is my partner,
Officer Zavala.

56
00:03:36,718 --> 00:03:37,741
I'm in my <i>chones,</i> dude.

57
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:39,375
I know, dude, come on, come on.
I'm in my <i>chones.</i> No.

58
00:03:39,451 --> 00:03:40,645
Come on, man.
I'm good, bro.

59
00:03:40,718 --> 00:03:42,844
We work basic patrol
here at Newton.

60
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:45,010
One of the toughest
divisions in the LAPD.

61
00:03:45,085 --> 00:03:47,517
Shootin' Newton, baby, that's right.
Lucky 13.

62
00:03:47,684 --> 00:03:50,174
This is a department-issue sidearm.
Glock 19.

63
00:03:51,251 --> 00:03:53,683
Spyderco tactical knife.

64
00:03:54,517 --> 00:03:57,178
This little thing can
break windows, here.

65
00:03:59,185 --> 00:04:01,345
Two Smith & Wesson handcuffs.

66
00:04:02,085 --> 00:04:04,382
Can of OC spray.
Pepper spray.

67
00:04:04,584 --> 00:04:06,245
Two extra mags.

68
00:04:06,418 --> 00:04:08,351
What else?
That's my nametag, here.

69
00:04:08,418 --> 00:04:10,543
You can see my
partner's dirty locker.

70
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,209
Yours is like a woman.
Look at this.

71
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:13,479
What is this, Pottery Barn?

72
00:04:13,718 --> 00:04:16,549
Are you gonna shut the fuck up
and get ready for roll call?

73
00:04:16,784 --> 00:04:19,513
Dude, don't swear, man. I have to
edit that out, when you swear.

74
00:04:19,617 --> 00:04:22,982
Oh, fuck. Oh, shit, dude.
Fuck, man.

75
00:04:23,485 --> 00:04:24,883
Okay, now in Spanish.

76
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:28,379
Hey.
You kids having fun?

77
00:04:28,452 --> 00:04:30,214
Oh, look,
it's Officer Van Hauser.

78
00:04:30,452 --> 00:04:32,442
Officer Three.
Van Hauser.

79
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:35,350
Considered un-promotable
by the department.

80
00:04:35,418 --> 00:04:38,078
And the angriest fucking
cop in the world.

81
00:04:38,318 --> 00:04:40,807
Taylor, I'm gonna tell Sarge
that you're taping in here.

82
00:04:40,884 --> 00:04:41,873
- What'd you say?
- What?

83
00:04:41,951 --> 00:04:44,884
I'm gonna tell Sarge
that you're taping in here.

84
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:48,217
Oh. Yeah, well, it's not
really called taping anymore.

85
00:04:48,285 --> 00:04:50,047
It uses flash cards,
but it's not really a...

86
00:04:50,452 --> 00:04:51,441
Don't worry about it.

87
00:04:51,518 --> 00:04:52,610
God damn it!

88
00:04:52,851 --> 00:04:54,216
Hold up, hold up.

89
00:04:54,285 --> 00:04:55,445
Like that?
Mmm-hmm.

90
00:04:55,518 --> 00:04:56,848
Turn it on.

91
00:04:57,385 --> 00:04:59,045
So, am I recording you?

92
00:04:59,118 --> 00:05:00,585
Yes, dude,
and I'm recording you.

93
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,143
Oh, that's so cool.

94
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,708
See that thing there?
Yeah.

95
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:05,113
That is the lens right there.

96
00:05:05,185 --> 00:05:06,811
Just like that on that,
this right here.

97
00:05:06,884 --> 00:05:08,442
Hey, guys, quiet down.

98
00:05:10,552 --> 00:05:12,416
All right, let's settle down.
Let's settle down.

99
00:05:12,485 --> 00:05:15,452
Captain's here, he'd like to say a few words.
Let's quiet down.

100
00:05:15,518 --> 00:05:16,848
Thank you, Sergeant.
Good afternoon.

101
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:18,044
Good afternoon.
Put it down.

102
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,248
I'd like to welcome
back Zavala and Taylor.

103
00:05:21,051 --> 00:05:23,041
DA cleared these guys
in last month's shooting.

104
00:05:23,118 --> 00:05:24,779
Turned out to be
a good shooting.

105
00:05:24,884 --> 00:05:26,647
I know first-hand what
you guys went through.

106
00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:29,049
It's an unpleasant experience
being under that much scrutiny.

107
00:05:30,018 --> 00:05:31,280
But you need to
remember something.

108
00:05:31,351 --> 00:05:34,443
An on-the-job shooting is
still considered a homicide.

109
00:05:34,518 --> 00:05:36,508
It's never an easy ride.

110
00:05:36,585 --> 00:05:40,484
If you do the right thing,
I will always have your back.

111
00:05:40,552 --> 00:05:41,984
Do the wrong thing
and cross me,

112
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:44,348
I will personally
throw you under the bus.

113
00:05:44,785 --> 00:05:46,649
- Am I clear?
- Yes, sir!

114
00:05:46,719 --> 00:05:48,276
Taylor, am I clear?
Yes, sir.

115
00:05:48,351 --> 00:05:50,147
Sergeant, am I clear?
Yes, sir.

116
00:05:50,218 --> 00:05:52,208
- Have a nice day.
- Thank you, Captain.

117
00:05:57,351 --> 00:06:01,216
Quiet down! See this?
It's a ticket book.

118
00:06:01,719 --> 00:06:03,447
Inside are
things called tickets.

119
00:06:03,518 --> 00:06:04,541
Son of a bitch.

120
00:06:04,618 --> 00:06:07,414
You can do things like
stop motorists and cut citations

121
00:06:07,485 --> 00:06:09,418
for speeding or
going through a light.

122
00:06:09,618 --> 00:06:11,209
You all need to write.

123
00:06:11,285 --> 00:06:12,616
Sarge, we cut
citations every watch.

124
00:06:12,685 --> 00:06:14,845
I'm not talking to you, I'm
talking to these two idiots.

125
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:16,613
- My partner has a question.
- Yes.

126
00:06:16,685 --> 00:06:18,083
I don't really
know how to write.

127
00:06:19,452 --> 00:06:22,317
But I do sign
and draw pictures.

128
00:06:22,385 --> 00:06:24,113
Seriously, you
don't start writing,

129
00:06:24,185 --> 00:06:25,880
Captain's gonna shit on my head

130
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:28,180
- and in turn, I'm gonna shit on your head.
- Hmm.

131
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:30,980
And I promise you, you guys
are gonna be separated.

132
00:06:31,052 --> 00:06:32,143
Do it, Sarge.

133
00:06:32,218 --> 00:06:33,845
Orozco
and Davis, X 25.

134
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,408
Peterson and Washington, X 41.

135
00:06:36,518 --> 00:06:39,144
Zavala and Taylor,
you got X 13.

136
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:40,942
Williams and Cho, X 8.

137
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:44,884
Alameda and Green, X 21.
Van Hauser and Sook, X 4.

138
00:06:44,952 --> 00:06:47,248
Yeah, Sarge?
That's not our area.

139
00:06:47,318 --> 00:06:49,149
That's not your area?
No, we work 9.

140
00:06:49,218 --> 00:06:53,050
Oh, I'm sorry, fellas. Oh, no, you're right.
You're on X 13.

141
00:06:53,385 --> 00:06:54,909
Sorry, fellas,
this isn't Monopoly.

142
00:06:54,985 --> 00:06:56,451
You don't get to
choose your real estate.

143
00:06:56,518 --> 00:06:58,008
Now go. Get out.

144
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:02,181
Zavala, try not to kill anybody
before the end of the watch.

145
00:07:02,251 --> 00:07:03,582
Really, Sarge?

146
00:07:03,652 --> 00:07:06,244
Sarge, if we kill someone
in X 13, can we go back to X 9?

147
00:07:07,251 --> 00:07:08,684
Today
is a brand new day.

148
00:07:08,752 --> 00:07:11,309
Get the shop, gas the
shop, wash the shop.

149
00:07:11,385 --> 00:07:14,046
Make sure day watch didn't leave
behind any surprises for us.

150
00:07:14,152 --> 00:07:15,675
Look for guns, drugs, puke.

151
00:07:15,752 --> 00:07:16,912
Pay attention, Boot.

152
00:07:16,985 --> 00:07:18,417
- Goodbye. Hurry up.
- Yes, sir.

153
00:07:18,485 --> 00:07:19,713
How you doing,
Van Hauser?

154
00:07:19,785 --> 00:07:20,979
I warned you
about that shit.

155
00:07:21,052 --> 00:07:22,382
Where you running
with that piece, Boot?

156
00:07:22,685 --> 00:07:24,118
What?
Why you so scared?

157
00:07:24,186 --> 00:07:25,846
Go, go! Jesus Christ!
Go on, shit.

158
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,749
Jesus! It's like it's day one.

159
00:07:27,952 --> 00:07:29,816
Boot, slow down with that piece.
Slow down!

160
00:07:29,885 --> 00:07:31,045
Orozco, have
you been working out?

161
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:34,086
Yeah, with your mom. Why are
you shooting everything?

162
00:07:34,252 --> 00:07:35,479
It's for his class.

163
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:37,013
I thought you
were studying law.

164
00:07:37,452 --> 00:07:38,680
Pre-law.
I need an art elective.

165
00:07:38,885 --> 00:07:40,284
I'm taking filmmaking.

166
00:07:40,352 --> 00:07:41,716
Well, get my good side, eh?

167
00:07:41,785 --> 00:07:42,979
You don't
have a good side.

168
00:07:44,086 --> 00:07:45,882
Listen, you know they
can subpoena that shit

169
00:07:45,952 --> 00:07:47,646
if something goes
sideways, right?

170
00:07:48,086 --> 00:07:49,109
Think twice.

171
00:07:49,186 --> 00:07:50,948
Two words. Erase button.

172
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:52,451
Two words. Just
'cause you guys think

173
00:07:52,518 --> 00:07:53,883
you're these big
ghetto gunfighters now,

174
00:07:53,952 --> 00:07:55,441
don't mean you can be
dropping your calls.

175
00:07:55,719 --> 00:07:57,152
That was at least
two dozen words.

176
00:07:57,219 --> 00:07:58,776
Yeah, well, I barely got a GED,

177
00:07:58,852 --> 00:08:00,376
so what do you expect,
white boy?

178
00:08:00,618 --> 00:08:01,812
Unbelievable.

179
00:08:01,885 --> 00:08:04,148
Saddle up, ladies, we're
sick of holding up your end.

180
00:08:04,219 --> 00:08:05,345
Admit it,
you'd hit that shit.

181
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:06,942
Orozco?
Yeah.

182
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,679
With a cinderblock.

183
00:08:08,752 --> 00:08:10,310
Check the roof, Boot.

184
00:08:10,386 --> 00:08:11,613
Where's your shop?

185
00:08:12,453 --> 00:08:14,317
I got Red Bull, Monster and...

186
00:08:14,386 --> 00:08:16,046
They all say 13,
check the roof.

187
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:17,585
Thank you, ma'am.
Faster, Boot, let's go.

188
00:08:17,652 --> 00:08:18,812
Get in the car!
Yes, sir!

189
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:19,986
And then I got
you some kombucha

190
00:08:20,052 --> 00:08:21,075
'cause I know you
like that stuff.

191
00:08:21,152 --> 00:08:24,176
Fuck that shit!
 What is that?

192
00:09:10,952 --> 00:09:13,385
Dude, it's good
to be back, man.

193
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:16,851
Old lady was driving me crazy at
the <i>casa,</i> like making me do shit.

194
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:19,909
Oh, no! She dared ask
for your help around the house.

195
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:22,282
That's incredible.
Outrageous.

196
00:09:22,352 --> 00:09:24,875
Just 'cause I look like
the dudes from Home Depot,

197
00:09:24,952 --> 00:09:27,044
doesn't mean I do the shit
the Home Depot dudes do.

198
00:09:27,252 --> 00:09:28,275
I would never profile you

199
00:09:28,352 --> 00:09:29,375
as a man who helps
his wife with chores.

200
00:09:29,453 --> 00:09:30,442
Shut up.

201
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:31,542
Dude, I'm your homie, okay?

202
00:09:31,619 --> 00:09:34,176
I would never, ever do that.

203
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:36,010
Oh, bro!
Hmm?

204
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:38,181
Her brother was
always coming over

205
00:09:38,252 --> 00:09:40,583
during the day to swim.
Every day.

206
00:09:41,052 --> 00:09:42,679
I hate everything about him.

207
00:09:42,753 --> 00:09:44,049
He smells like weed sometimes.

208
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:45,643
Like he's got,
like, a prescription.

209
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,516
And Gabby was like,
"No, it's all good."

210
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:49,212
I was like, "Whatever, get
him the hell out of here."

211
00:09:49,386 --> 00:09:51,876
I swear to God, I'm filling
in that pool with cement.

212
00:09:51,952 --> 00:09:53,112
Not personally,
'cause you'll hire

213
00:09:53,186 --> 00:09:54,312
a Home Depot dude
for that task.

214
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:55,785
Fuck you.

215
00:09:57,052 --> 00:10:00,611
<i>13X 13,</i>
<i>4-15 man at 9742 Maple.</i>

216
00:10:00,686 --> 00:10:03,551
<i>Code 2. Incident 4-5-6-2.</i>

217
00:10:04,086 --> 00:10:05,849

<i>X 13, roger.</i>

219
00:10:07,186 --> 00:10:08,209
First customer of the day.

220
00:10:08,286 --> 00:10:10,719
I hope they enjoy
our police service.

221
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,616
Suck my dick! That motherfucker's
a lying-ass nigga.

222
00:10:22,686 --> 00:10:24,346
Fuck him and fuck you, too!

223
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:26,409
Shut your fucking... If you touch
me, I will fucking shoot you.

224
00:10:26,486 --> 00:10:27,544
Stay where you are.

225
00:10:27,619 --> 00:10:29,279
I don't give a fuck about
both you motherfuckers.

226
00:10:29,352 --> 00:10:30,910
I'm ready to die today.
Fuck y'all.

227
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,646
This can go one of
several ways right now.

228
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,414
It is all about your attitude.

229
00:10:34,586 --> 00:10:36,212
Fuck you! I got my mail!

230
00:10:36,286 --> 00:10:37,378
I helped him!

231
00:10:37,453 --> 00:10:39,977
I helped him give me my mail!
I'm getting tired of this shit!

232
00:10:40,219 --> 00:10:41,413
All right. I'm not
playing with y'all.

233
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,781
Sir,
if you've been drinking,

234
00:10:42,853 --> 00:10:44,547
you need to stay
the fuck inside

235
00:10:44,619 --> 00:10:46,279
and not intimidate
the mailman. That's it.

236
00:10:46,352 --> 00:10:48,115
Fuck you! You
need to shut the fuck up!

237
00:10:48,186 --> 00:10:49,915
'Cause without that badge
and gun, you ain't shit.

238
00:10:49,986 --> 00:10:52,044
Yeah? You're less than
motherfucking nothing.

239
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,677
You motherfucking, border-hopping...
Oh, yeah?

240
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,343
...donkey-riding,
Mexican motherfucker.

241
00:10:55,419 --> 00:10:57,511
Is that so? You want to
find out what I'm about?

242
00:10:57,619 --> 00:10:59,643
Show me! Yeah, I wanna see!
Fuck.

243
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,516
Let's settle this right here
like grown men, motherfucker!

244
00:11:01,586 --> 00:11:02,644
Not again, man.

245
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,710
What'd you say? You wanna take a fade?
You want to fight me?

246
00:11:04,786 --> 00:11:06,480
Yeah, I want to fight you.
Let's go, bro.

247
00:11:06,553 --> 00:11:08,782
I whoop your punk ass, you gonna
get the fuck up out of my crib?

248
00:11:08,853 --> 00:11:11,116
Hell, no. But you
called me out, bro!

249
00:11:11,187 --> 00:11:12,778
Now I'm calling you out!
What's up?

250
00:11:12,853 --> 00:11:14,115
You whoop my ass,

251
00:11:14,187 --> 00:11:17,154
I'll put them motherfucking
handcuffs on my motherfucking self.

252
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,516
- And that's on the set.
- Door.

253
00:11:18,586 --> 00:11:19,678
It's gonna be
a pleasure beating

My fucking fantasy.

255
00:11:21,286 --> 00:11:23,015
I don't know who the fuck you
think you're fucking with,

256
00:11:23,087 --> 00:11:25,020
but I love this shit. Beatin'
a motherfucking punk-ass

257
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,711
- police-ass like yours.
- Keep talking, bro.

258
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:28,219
Let's get this
shit popping, motherfucker.

259
00:11:40,386 --> 00:11:41,478
Shit.

260
00:11:45,586 --> 00:11:46,712
This shit's crazy!

261
00:11:54,087 --> 00:11:57,485
Fucking kick his ass!
Come on! Come on, Z! Z!

262
00:12:04,187 --> 00:12:05,415
Yo, Z! Z! Z!

263
00:12:06,619 --> 00:12:08,984
Now get the fuck up.
You like that?

264
00:12:09,287 --> 00:12:10,345
This ain't no wrassling match.

265
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,648
You all right? You all right?
You all right?

266
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,278
Come on!

267
00:12:16,619 --> 00:12:17,984
Oh, shit!

00:12:19,387 --> 00:12:20,751
Come on, man!

269
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,918
That's what happens when
you fuck with the police.

270
00:12:29,953 --> 00:12:32,352
Yeah, come on. Take him! Take him!
Take him! Take him!

271

Fuck you,

272
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,278
Ooh!

273
00:12:43,253 --> 00:12:45,243
Fucking did that shit.

274
00:12:47,554 --> 00:12:48,645
You all right?

275
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,217
Give me the hooks.

276
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,278
What's up, <i>putos?</i>

277
00:13:10,554 --> 00:13:13,680
It's big bad Wicked from
Curbside Gang Locos.

278
00:13:14,053 --> 00:13:15,452
You ready for this shit?

279
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,043
Fuck, yeah. I was born
to fucking do this shit.

280
00:13:18,687 --> 00:13:20,915
Show these motherfuckers
whose <i>barrio</i> this is.

281
00:13:20,986 --> 00:13:22,248
You almost
ran the light, stupid.

282
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,514
You're gonna get
us pulled over, La.

283
00:13:23,687 --> 00:13:26,085
Fuck that shit.
I gotta fucking be at work.

284
00:13:26,387 --> 00:13:29,047
You better not bust out wasting
my motherfucking time, homie,

285
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,451
I'm gonna tell you
that shit right now.

286
00:13:30,754 --> 00:13:32,584
Hey, La La, when you
gonna fuck the homeboy?

287
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,052
I'm not fucking
the homeboy, dawg.

288
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,143
Yeah, right.

289
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,414
Shit, what I look like?

290
00:13:37,487 --> 00:13:40,079
The little fucking <i>paisa</i> hoochies
you guys fucking kick it with?

291
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:41,712
What you packing, baby?

292
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:45,276
I'm packing a motherfucking 30-round
clip for these slob-ass niggas.

293
00:13:45,353 --> 00:13:46,445
This is it right here, man.

294
00:13:46,554 --> 00:13:47,714
Slow down,
this is the street, La.

295
00:13:47,853 --> 00:13:48,979
This is it.
This is it. All right.

296
00:13:49,053 --> 00:13:51,145
Wicked, you're gonna jump and
get the party started, got it?

297
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,278
I got you, baby.

298
00:13:52,353 --> 00:13:53,479
Listen to the homie.

299
00:13:53,554 --> 00:13:55,077
All right, put your
fucking face on, let's go!

300
00:13:55,153 --> 00:13:56,279
Get
your shit ready.

301
00:13:56,353 --> 00:13:57,650
Put that fucking shit away!

302
00:13:57,721 --> 00:13:59,119
Make sure your fucking
shit is good to go.

303
00:13:59,187 --> 00:14:00,620
What the fuck do I
gotta fucking tell you?

304
00:14:00,687 --> 00:14:02,711
I don't want to fucking
have to baby you, man!

305
00:14:03,953 --> 00:14:05,045
Get ready, homies.
Get ready.

306
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,678
Get your face on!
All right. Fuck.

307
00:14:06,854 --> 00:14:08,787
- You guys ready?
- Ready.

308
00:14:08,921 --> 00:14:10,012
All right.

309
00:14:11,454 --> 00:14:13,944
But on some real shit, dawg, I'm
gonna have to holler at you, B.

310
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,078
Niggas keep on talking about
how you got your ass whooped

311
00:14:16,153 --> 00:14:17,677
by a motherfucking
little punk-ass wonton.

312
00:14:17,754 --> 00:14:19,550
Nah, Blood,
these niggas is hating.

313
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,587
Let me tell you something. Me
and the cop got down, right?

314
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:25,678
Motherfucker took off his
badge, dropped his gun.

315
00:14:25,754 --> 00:14:27,015
I mean, he kept it gangster.

316
00:14:27,087 --> 00:14:29,145
We straight-up squabbled.
Head up.

317
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,710
But they still took you
to the county though, huh?

318
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,754
Yeah, but for
disorderly conduct.

319
00:14:32,854 --> 00:14:34,514
Not for squabbling with
the police, you feel me?

320
00:14:34,587 --> 00:14:35,884
You fought a cop
and they didn't put

321
00:14:35,954 --> 00:14:37,215
no "assault on
a peace officer" on you?

322
00:14:37,287 --> 00:14:39,151
Listen to me, my nigga.
I'm trying to tell y'all.

323
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,216
They really showed me
love to keep it G.

324
00:14:41,287 --> 00:14:43,345
I'm a two-time felon, right?
Y'all know that, right?

325
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,910
Could have struck me
out and gave me life

326
00:14:44,987 --> 00:14:46,453
for fighting that cop,
you feel me?

327
00:14:46,554 --> 00:14:47,680
I got right out,
it wasn't shit.

328
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,312
All right, but we heard
you got your ass beat, Blood.

329
00:14:50,387 --> 00:14:52,251
You better shut
the fuck up, CK.

330
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,549
I'll run this fucking fork up
in your ass, I swear to God.

331
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,712
Let me
tell you something,

332
00:14:56,088 --> 00:14:58,384
win, lose or draw,

333
00:14:58,454 --> 00:14:59,978
as long as you
squabble and get down,

334
00:15:00,287 --> 00:15:01,948
that's gangster, you
understand what I'm saying?

335
00:15:02,021 --> 00:15:03,010
Yup.

336
00:15:03,088 --> 00:15:05,486
I mean, that Mexican cop might
be acting bull with you, Tre.

337
00:15:05,554 --> 00:15:08,316
But he's still out there killing niggas.
Straight out.

338
00:15:08,387 --> 00:15:10,650
No, no, no.
Listen to me, all y'all.

339
00:15:10,721 --> 00:15:13,381
This whole fucking thing is
like changing of the guard.

340
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:16,149
Back in the day, all these
neighborhoods used to be black,

341
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,346
and what are they now?

342
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,887
Mexicans.
Exactly.

343
00:15:19,353 --> 00:15:21,014
There used to be chicken
stands on the corner,

344
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,816
now there's fucking taco
stands on every corner.

345
00:15:23,154 --> 00:15:24,882
We're in some real shit and
if we don't come together,

346
00:15:24,954 --> 00:15:26,443
we're gonna be some extinct
niggas pretty soon.

347
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,509
Watch it,
watch it, watch it!

348
00:15:42,121 --> 00:15:43,213
Go, go, go!

349
00:15:50,721 --> 00:15:53,517
Get CK,
Blood! Get CK!

350
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:54,977
Fuck!

351
00:15:55,987 --> 00:15:58,681
Fuck, yeah! We got
those <i>putos!</i> We got 'em!

352
00:15:59,854 --> 00:16:01,548
Eat shit,
motherfuckers!

353
00:16:01,754 --> 00:16:03,812
Fuck! We fucking
lit 'em up, dawg!

354
00:16:03,887 --> 00:16:07,116
Show those <i>putos</i> whose
neighborhood this fucker is! Shit.

355
00:16:07,188 --> 00:16:08,779
Fucking proud of you, man.

356
00:16:08,854 --> 00:16:10,912
And that's what I'm fucking
telling you. Good.

357
00:16:11,188 --> 00:16:13,450
That was fucking good, man. That's
what I'm fucking telling you.

358
00:16:13,687 --> 00:16:15,711
I'm proud of you.
Fucking proud.

359
00:16:15,787 --> 00:16:18,050
Fucking did it. That's what I'm
fucking talking about, man.

360
00:16:18,121 --> 00:16:19,644
I'm fucking proud of you, man.

361
00:16:19,721 --> 00:16:22,018
Fucking proud of you, man,
now you're a fucking man.

362
00:16:22,088 --> 00:16:23,679
Right? Right?
Right, homie.

363
00:16:23,787 --> 00:16:24,776
Right.

364
00:16:24,854 --> 00:16:25,843
All right then.

365
00:16:25,921 --> 00:16:28,320
No fucking fear, man.
No fucking fear.

366
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:30,321
That's how we
fucking do it, man.

367
00:16:30,388 --> 00:16:32,252
That's how we
fucking do it, man.

368
00:16:33,954 --> 00:16:36,853
Call the motherfucking ambulance!
They got CK!

369
00:16:36,921 --> 00:16:38,751
Somebody call a fucking ambulance!

370
00:16:38,821 --> 00:16:39,947
Hold on, dawg, hold on.

371
00:16:40,021 --> 00:16:42,511
Bitch-ass sewer rats
was from Curbside. I seen them.

372
00:16:42,587 --> 00:16:44,952
Fucking <i>eses</i> are serving us.
Curbside's serving us.

373
00:16:45,021 --> 00:16:46,647
Curbside's banging
all over us on Bloods.

374
00:16:46,721 --> 00:16:47,881
Peanut, you got that chopper?

375
00:16:48,388 --> 00:16:49,854
Let's go hit
these punk-ass fools.

376
00:16:49,921 --> 00:16:51,013
Cut that fucking camera off!

377
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,621
So this is what we believe
to be the Code 37 vehicle

378
00:17:05,687 --> 00:17:07,018
used in
the drive-by last night.

379
00:17:07,088 --> 00:17:08,350
Curbside Gang's
at it again, bro.

380
00:17:08,421 --> 00:17:10,251
It fits the description.
It comes back as stolen.

381
00:17:10,887 --> 00:17:13,548
Curbside likes these vehicles
because they blend in,

382
00:17:13,621 --> 00:17:14,985
you can put a lot
of people in them.

383
00:17:15,054 --> 00:17:18,385
This door slides back, and
the gang members open fire.

384
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:20,649
The victim was a male black
from a Blood set that

385
00:17:20,721 --> 00:17:22,279
has basically been at war
with this Hispanic gang

386
00:17:22,388 --> 00:17:23,514
over control of narcotic sales.

387
00:17:23,787 --> 00:17:24,913
Partner.
Yeah.

388
00:17:25,221 --> 00:17:26,518
What up?
Check this out.

389
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,654
Oh, shit.
Those are shell casings.

390
00:17:29,754 --> 00:17:31,880
Detectives told us that three
different weapons were used

391
00:17:31,954 --> 00:17:34,012
and we're seeing at least
two kinds of shells, so...

392
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:35,953
Shit.

393
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:37,215
What's up?

394
00:17:37,388 --> 00:17:39,719
Those are the Homicide
detectives working the case.

395
00:17:40,521 --> 00:17:41,987
- The hell's this?
- What?

396
00:17:42,054 --> 00:17:43,282
<i>Candid Camera?</i>

397
00:17:43,388 --> 00:17:44,945
No, sir, it's just
a project I'm working on.

398
00:17:45,021 --> 00:17:46,113
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

399
00:17:46,188 --> 00:17:47,314
I don't want to see that.

400
00:17:47,388 --> 00:17:50,821
There are.45 and.09 millimeter
shell casings inside.

401
00:17:50,887 --> 00:17:52,286
How do you know that?

402
00:17:52,354 --> 00:17:53,651
Did you touch them?
No, sir.

403
00:17:53,722 --> 00:17:54,780
Did you fuck up my vehicle?

404
00:17:54,854 --> 00:17:55,843
No, sir.

405
00:17:55,921 --> 00:17:58,013
Sir, we found it,
we called you.

406
00:17:58,088 --> 00:17:59,817
The big dogs are here now,

407
00:17:59,921 --> 00:18:02,252
so set up some yellow tape and
stay on the other side of it.

408
00:18:04,254 --> 00:18:06,687
Dude, it's been two hours, we're
still waiting for the detectives

409
00:18:06,755 --> 00:18:08,688
to release the scene so
we can go back on patrol.

410
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:12,779
Comfortable footwear. Policing is
all about comfortable footwear.

411
00:18:19,954 --> 00:18:22,922
Officer Van Hauser.
Good evening.

412
00:18:22,987 --> 00:18:24,648
Sarge said I should
relieve you guys

413
00:18:24,722 --> 00:18:26,621
so you can go back to being
the street gods that you are.

414
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:27,711
I'm down with that.

415
00:18:29,354 --> 00:18:32,344
Hey, hey!
On the street.

416
00:18:33,254 --> 00:18:37,381
Watch the street. Make sure no
assholes come up here and kill us.

417
00:18:37,455 --> 00:18:39,012
Yes, sir.

418
00:18:40,188 --> 00:18:41,655
Fucking Christ.

419
00:18:41,722 --> 00:18:44,553
Officer Van Hauser, have you
made a difference today?

420
00:18:47,755 --> 00:18:49,017
You know,
I see you guys out here,

421
00:18:49,088 --> 00:18:50,646
you're being good little
company men, aren't you?

422
00:18:50,722 --> 00:18:52,019
You're doing the Lord's work?

423
00:18:52,088 --> 00:18:54,180
And you're making a
difference, as you call it.

424
00:18:54,288 --> 00:18:55,516
It's all fun and games to you,

425
00:18:55,588 --> 00:18:58,111
you get to run and jump
and fight and shoot.

426
00:18:58,188 --> 00:19:00,348
One day, mark my words.

427
00:19:00,421 --> 00:19:03,354
One day the LAPD is gonna bend
you over your black and white,

428
00:19:03,421 --> 00:19:05,217
and they are going to
fuck you up the ass.

429
00:19:06,288 --> 00:19:11,312
They are going to fuck you
so long and so hard,

430
00:19:12,254 --> 00:19:14,221
you're gonna want to eat your
gun just to make it stop.

431
00:19:14,288 --> 00:19:16,915
And if you don't eat your gun

432
00:19:16,988 --> 00:19:19,352
and the fucking
somehow magically stops,

433
00:19:21,188 --> 00:19:22,780
they're gonna give
you freeway therapy.

434
00:19:22,855 --> 00:19:26,016
You're gonna end up doing
West End Valley day watch,

435
00:19:26,089 --> 00:19:29,817
spending two hours every day
on the fucking freeway

436
00:19:29,888 --> 00:19:32,878
just thinking about the
fucking that they gave you.

437
00:19:33,888 --> 00:19:36,787
Bad guys attack from up front. The
department comes in from the rear.

438
00:19:38,521 --> 00:19:40,045
Watch your six.

439
00:19:40,788 --> 00:19:45,222
I'm ready. This may say
Purell, but it's really K-Y.

440
00:19:46,822 --> 00:19:48,153
Officer Zavala.

441
00:19:48,255 --> 00:19:51,415
That's funny. You kids
have fun out there.

442
00:19:51,488 --> 00:19:53,751
The LAPD's got
a big fucking cock.

443
00:19:53,822 --> 00:19:55,255
You got a big heart.

444
00:19:56,022 --> 00:19:57,750
Thank you
for sharing that.

445
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:59,255
Can't wait to
get it up the ass.

446
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,547
Dude, are you gonna hook up
with a Mexican girl?

447
00:20:08,621 --> 00:20:09,952
Quit trying to hook me
up with one, dude.

448
00:20:10,055 --> 00:20:11,749
Dude, it'd be great
if you did, but...

449
00:20:11,822 --> 00:20:13,482
I get it, man. Shit.

450
00:20:16,122 --> 00:20:18,089
Sweet brown sugar.

451
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:20,215
You should marry
one of my cousins.

452
00:20:20,289 --> 00:20:21,347
If they're anything like you,

453
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:23,445
I wouldn't be able to stand
a fucking hour with them.

454
00:20:25,688 --> 00:20:27,053
Waking up in the morning,
they'd be like,

455
00:20:27,122 --> 00:20:28,350
"Hey,
can I tell you a story?"

456
00:20:28,422 --> 00:20:29,411
I know.

457
00:20:29,488 --> 00:20:31,285
"Here's a story about this
and a story about that

458
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,844
"and a story about this
and a story about that..."

459
00:20:32,922 --> 00:20:34,980
But, dude, all you gotta do is this.
All you gotta do is this.

460
00:20:35,089 --> 00:20:36,317
"Mmm-hmm.

461
00:20:36,521 --> 00:20:37,681
"Yeah. Yeah."

462
00:20:37,822 --> 00:20:39,221
"You want to come
to my cousin's <i>quinceañera?</i>

463
00:20:39,389 --> 00:20:41,878
"My daughter's <i>quinceañera?</i>
My brother's <i>quinceañera?"</i>

464
00:20:41,955 --> 00:20:43,717
Yeah.
"My sister's <i>quinceañera?"</i>

465
00:20:43,788 --> 00:20:45,948
There's always something
happening, though, bro.

466
00:20:46,022 --> 00:20:47,080
It's better than, like,

467
00:20:47,155 --> 00:20:49,951
"Do you know the new kind
of flavored coffee I have?

468
00:20:50,022 --> 00:20:51,319
"Do you like this kind
of coffee?" Oh, really?

469
00:20:51,389 --> 00:20:53,219
Shut the fuck up. "The
baristas are excellent."

470
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:55,552
You like fucking coffee, dude,
don't give me that shit.

471
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,282
I like fucking
good Starbucks coffee.

472
00:20:57,355 --> 00:21:00,345
Whatever. I'll let you lay into me.
Lay into me, dude. Fine.

473
00:21:01,788 --> 00:21:05,778
<i>13X-ray 13. Missing
juvenile, 2717 Jefferson.</i>

474
00:21:05,855 --> 00:21:08,879
<i>Code 2 incident</i>
<i>5-7-5-5 and RD 13-27.</i>

be Code 6 on the missing juvenile.</i>

476
00:21:14,922 --> 00:21:16,718
I can't see dick.

477
00:21:18,355 --> 00:21:19,912
Hi.

478
00:21:21,355 --> 00:21:23,413
Yeah. We got a call
about some missing children.

479
00:21:23,489 --> 00:21:25,853
Yes. Yes,
my babies are gone.

480
00:21:25,922 --> 00:21:27,150
All right.
My babies are gone.

481
00:21:27,222 --> 00:21:28,314
You want to let us in?
We can talk.

482
00:21:28,389 --> 00:21:29,617
We can have a conversation
about this, all right?

483
00:21:29,689 --> 00:21:31,019
Oh, okay, okay.

484
00:21:31,155 --> 00:21:33,145
My babies are gone. They've
been missing all night.

485
00:21:33,222 --> 00:21:35,212
- And I've been here. 
- Why don't you step over here a second?

486
00:21:35,289 --> 00:21:36,517
Officer,
we're wasting time.

487
00:21:36,589 --> 00:21:37,816
Sir,
let me see your hands.

488
00:21:37,888 --> 00:21:39,446
How many children are missing?

489
00:21:39,522 --> 00:21:42,182
Oh! Two.
A boy and a girl.

490
00:21:42,255 --> 00:21:44,381
Ma'am, what are the ages of the
children that are missing?

491
00:21:44,456 --> 00:21:47,480
One is one and the
other'll be three soon.

492
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,216
- Sir!
- Somebody took them.

493
00:21:49,322 --> 00:21:51,414
Let me see your hands, please.
Let me see your hands.

494
00:21:51,489 --> 00:21:53,718
- ...quick, quick. In and out.
- Put your hands behind your head.

495
00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:55,278
All right. All right.

496
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,754
Hands
behind your head!

497
00:21:56,822 --> 00:21:57,982
I've been
here all night.

498
00:21:58,055 --> 00:21:59,386
Officer,
we're good here.

499
00:21:59,489 --> 00:22:00,717
Listen, don't say
anything to them, man.

500
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:02,016
I know,
but they're not here.

501
00:22:02,089 --> 00:22:03,215
They're gone.
The babies are gone.

502
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:04,278
What did you say?

503
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:05,788
I'm gonna check
the house, okay?

504
00:22:05,855 --> 00:22:07,913
Please listen to me. I'm trying to tell you.
I've looked...

505
00:22:07,988 --> 00:22:09,216
The kids are
with their grandma.

506
00:22:09,289 --> 00:22:11,085
- Is this your husband?
- That's not my husband.

507
00:22:11,189 --> 00:22:13,213
- Sit the fuck down!
- I've been looking.

508
00:22:13,289 --> 00:22:14,620
I'm gonna check the house.

509
00:22:14,723 --> 00:22:17,315
Sometimes children can hide under
a bed or in a closet, okay?

510
00:22:17,389 --> 00:22:18,720
You can talk to my partner.

511
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:20,050
You're wasting time!

512
00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:23,654
The kids are not here! If you can
please go outside and get my kids.

513
00:22:23,723 --> 00:22:25,121
Talk to my partner.

514
00:22:25,189 --> 00:22:27,349
Stop, don't push me!
My babies are missing!

515
00:22:27,422 --> 00:22:29,082
Let me see some type of warrant.
You got a warrant?

516
00:22:29,155 --> 00:22:30,349
Officer, let me see
some type of warrant.

517
00:22:30,422 --> 00:22:31,616
We don't need
a warrant, she let us in.

518
00:22:31,689 --> 00:22:33,485
Why the fuck
did you say anything?

519
00:22:33,556 --> 00:22:35,682
Why the fuck did
you say anything?

520
00:22:35,756 --> 00:22:37,620
Sit down, man. Officer,
can I get a cigarette?

521
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:39,383
Not right now.

522
00:22:39,489 --> 00:22:40,820
I'm trying to
tell you, the kids

523
00:22:40,889 --> 00:22:42,719
are with their grandma,
man, okay?

524
00:22:42,823 --> 00:22:44,289
I heard you.
They're with the grandma.

525
00:22:47,556 --> 00:22:48,921
Would you please
listen to me, Officer?

526
00:22:49,022 --> 00:22:50,250
Let me see
some type of warrant.

527
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:55,184
You shut the fuck up!
Why did you let them in here?

528
00:22:55,255 --> 00:22:56,313
Press charges
on this motherfucker!

529
00:22:56,389 --> 00:22:57,515
You fucking bitch,
I'm gonna kill you!

530
00:22:57,589 --> 00:22:59,215
I'm gonna
kill you, motherfucker!

531
00:22:59,289 --> 00:23:00,984
Get the fuck off me!

532
00:23:01,456 --> 00:23:02,582
What
the fuck's happening?

533
00:23:02,689 --> 00:23:03,951
Wait a minute!
All right, all right!

534
00:23:04,023 --> 00:23:06,455
Did you hear
what I said to you?

535
00:23:06,522 --> 00:23:08,853
You just let me know how clear
I have to make myself to you.

536
00:23:08,923 --> 00:23:10,355
Why don't you open
your fucking mouth

537
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:12,083
and tell me how clear I
have to make myself to you?

538
00:23:12,155 --> 00:23:14,384
Partner! Partner!
Get off him.

539
00:23:15,489 --> 00:23:17,149
Brian, what's up?

540
00:23:17,389 --> 00:23:18,686
You okay, partner?

541
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:20,050
What's happening, Brian?

542
00:23:20,123 --> 00:23:21,555
Fuck you, you
dumb-ass smoking bitch!

543
00:23:21,622 --> 00:23:23,089
I'm gonna kick
you in the fucking face!

544
00:23:23,155 --> 00:23:24,452
I found the kids.

545
00:23:24,522 --> 00:23:26,114
Go ahead, you fucking crackhead.

546
00:23:26,456 --> 00:23:27,616
Shit.

547
00:23:31,556 --> 00:23:32,716
Shh, shh!

548
00:23:32,856 --> 00:23:34,550
It's okay, it's okay.
You're okay now.

549
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,021
You're okay.
Shh, shh.

550
00:23:36,689 --> 00:23:38,679
I'm just gonna... Shit.

551
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:45,717
It's okay. It's okay,
sweetie. All right.

552
00:23:46,056 --> 00:23:47,955
Hey, buddy, stay still.

553
00:23:51,256 --> 00:23:53,620
All right, you're okay now.
You're okay.

554
00:23:57,389 --> 00:23:59,788
Come here, come here.
You okay?

555
00:24:00,056 --> 00:24:01,579
You gonna take care
of your sister?

556
00:24:17,356 --> 00:24:19,118
Fucking kids.

557
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,216
It's so funny.

558
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:55,221
It's so funny to text.

559
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:56,484
Who are you texting?
That same bitch?

560
00:24:57,023 --> 00:24:58,320
Dude, yeah.
She's smart, man.

561
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:59,888
She's like the first girl I can

562
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,321
actually have
a conversation with.

563
00:25:01,523 --> 00:25:04,080
You know she has a Master of
Sciences in Fluid Hydraulics.

564
00:25:04,956 --> 00:25:06,684
Fluid Hydraulics?
Yes.

565
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,383
I wouldn't brag
about that, dude.

566
00:25:09,622 --> 00:25:11,953
That she has a master's
degree in Fluid Hydraulics.

567
00:25:12,622 --> 00:25:14,590
I date all these girls, man.
They're smoking hot.

568
00:25:14,689 --> 00:25:16,213
Yeah, your little
fucking badge bunnies.

569
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,847
I get laid without a badge,
thank you very much.

570
00:25:17,923 --> 00:25:19,220
Because you were
in the Marines.

571
00:25:19,423 --> 00:25:21,390
Don't ask, don't tell.

572
00:25:21,457 --> 00:25:23,185
There's a pattern.
An MO here.

573
00:25:23,723 --> 00:25:25,747
First date is dinner
and a respectful kiss.

574
00:25:26,689 --> 00:25:29,316
Second date is dinner,
full carnal knowledge.

575
00:25:29,756 --> 00:25:32,280
And then third date is dinner
and uncomfortable silences

576
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,754
when I try and discuss
anything of merit.

577
00:25:35,689 --> 00:25:38,213
Then it's two or three booty
calls and it's on to the next.

578
00:25:39,356 --> 00:25:43,948
Okay, I went to prom and I
got married a week later.

579
00:25:44,023 --> 00:25:47,013
And I ain't tapped anybody but Old
Faithful for, like, eight years.

580
00:25:47,323 --> 00:25:50,484
So I don't know what you're
tripping about, dude.

581
00:25:50,557 --> 00:25:52,683
Okay. Wait, look at me real quick.
Uh-huh.

582
00:25:52,756 --> 00:25:54,314
Okay, ready?
Okay.

583
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:57,118
I want somebody to talk to.
Not just sleep with.

584
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,020
Do you fucking understand
what I'm saying?

585
00:25:59,123 --> 00:26:00,181
Oh!

586
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,514
Yeah.
Jesus, dude.

587
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,680
White people get hung up on this
fucking "soul mate" bullshit.

588
00:26:06,056 --> 00:26:09,421
Just hook up with a chick
that can cook and wants kids.

589
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:10,821
Some bitch that's down for you,

590
00:26:10,889 --> 00:26:13,220
that won't fuck your friends,
and you're straight.

591
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:15,723
Dude, you're the smartest
motherfucker I know,

592
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:18,518
you're not gonna find some
chick that's as smart as you.

593
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,318
Ooh! Whoa!

594
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,683
Really, dude?
Yeah, what?

595
00:26:22,757 --> 00:26:26,019
Really? I'm sorry that the perfect
girl wasn't dropped in front of me

596
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:27,489
when I was 18 years old.

597
00:26:27,724 --> 00:26:29,190
Do you talk to Gabby?

598
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:31,189
Do you even have
discussions with the girl?

599
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,814
Do you want me to translate that
into fucking His... Spanish?

600
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:34,947
Into Hispanic?

601
00:26:35,023 --> 00:26:37,013
Whatever the fuck it is.

602
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:39,653
Yeah, bro, what do
you think, we're mutes?

603
00:26:39,857 --> 00:26:42,982
And we just...
Like, sign to each other?

604
00:26:43,056 --> 00:26:44,353
Yeah, we talk, stupid.

605
00:26:44,423 --> 00:26:46,549
Gabby's a trip.
You know she's a trip, bro.

606
00:26:46,623 --> 00:26:48,283
You should hear the shit
that comes out of her mouth.

607
00:26:48,557 --> 00:26:50,319
You know what? She would
be great on <i>Jeopardy!</i>

608
00:26:50,523 --> 00:26:51,922
She's way smarter than I am.

609
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:54,655
All right, so you see what I'm talking about.
That's all I want, man.

610
00:26:54,724 --> 00:26:56,054
I know you want
a chick like my girl,

611
00:26:56,123 --> 00:26:57,181
but I'll kill you
if you touch her.

612
00:26:57,757 --> 00:27:00,622
Fuck! I'm going to kill you, dude!
Shut up, man!

613
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,714
What's this chick's name, dude?

614
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:07,117
You don't deserve to
fucking know her name.

615
00:27:07,857 --> 00:27:09,847
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Dude, fuck that!

616
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:13,413
Janet. Did you run her?

617
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:15,384
Yes, she's clean.

618
00:27:16,057 --> 00:27:18,421
She's kind of the complete package, man.
It's like...

619
00:27:20,957 --> 00:27:22,548
We're going out again.

620
00:27:23,057 --> 00:27:25,081
Saturday's my little
sister's <i>quinceañera.</i>

621
00:27:25,156 --> 00:27:27,487
You should roll through with
Janet from another planet.

622
00:27:27,557 --> 00:27:30,047
Dude, this shit's gonna be
hard-core Mexican, though, bro.

623
00:27:30,457 --> 00:27:32,219
You know how my <i>familia</i> rolls.

624
00:28:05,724 --> 00:28:07,123
Hey, <i>mija.</i>

625
00:28:08,356 --> 00:28:10,290
What's up?
Come here, baby girl.

626
00:28:11,557 --> 00:28:13,252
Drink the Jim Jones,
baby, come on.

627
00:28:16,356 --> 00:28:20,619
Hey, baby? Tell me something.
You ever fucked on heroin?

628
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:21,748
Yeah, right.

629
00:28:21,824 --> 00:28:23,415
I could fuck forever
on that shit.

630
00:28:25,024 --> 00:28:27,014
I'll eat your pussy
for hours, girl. Ew!

631
00:28:27,091 --> 00:28:28,682
Get the fuck over here.

632
00:28:29,423 --> 00:28:31,447
Fuck that fool, he's
crazy, he's tripping.

633
00:28:32,257 --> 00:28:35,485
You're my fucking lady.
I'll buy you shit.

634
00:28:36,191 --> 00:28:37,487
You see this shit right here?

635
00:28:38,757 --> 00:28:41,088
It's fucking money.
Real shit.

636
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:42,587
What you like?

637
00:28:42,824 --> 00:28:45,121
Come here.
Okay.

638
00:28:46,857 --> 00:28:50,881
<i>Any Newton unit. 5-0-7 party.

<i>X 13, roger.</i>

645
00:29:20,924 --> 00:29:24,914
Keep your eyes wide, this
place is assholed up. Clear the car.

646
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,257
Put that shit away.

647
00:29:40,124 --> 00:29:41,455
Put that down, bro.

648
00:29:47,824 --> 00:29:49,689
What's the occasion?

649
00:29:55,591 --> 00:29:57,784
Can you turn down the music?

650
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:08,324
Have some respect, La La.
Don't light up in front of us.

651
00:30:08,624 --> 00:30:10,920
Why don't you take a hit, <i>mija?
</i> It'll chill you out.

652
00:30:11,024 --> 00:30:13,753
It'll be like back
in the days. Remember?

653
00:30:13,824 --> 00:30:16,121
I don't remember shit. I don't
know what you're talking about.

654
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:17,851
I said put it out.

655
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,948
You know you want this, pig.

656
00:30:21,591 --> 00:30:24,752
I wouldn't fucking touch that if
you were the last bitch on Earth.

657
00:30:25,191 --> 00:30:26,658
Fuck you.
No, fuck you.

658
00:30:26,725 --> 00:30:27,918
Why don't you take a seat?

659
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,480
You look in the mirror...
Lock it up, Orozco.

660
00:30:29,558 --> 00:30:31,218
...you're just a common gangster
bitch like all the rest.

661
00:30:31,291 --> 00:30:32,588
Why don't you
sit your ass down?

662
00:30:32,658 --> 00:30:34,318
Why don't you do
what they tell you, puppet?

663
00:30:34,391 --> 00:30:35,982
Want me to make you?
Lock it up, partner.

664
00:30:37,924 --> 00:30:39,186
You know what?

665
00:30:40,157 --> 00:30:41,818
I'll fucking sit down now.

666
00:30:41,891 --> 00:30:43,551
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

667
00:30:54,257 --> 00:30:56,156
So, Mr. Big Evil,

668
00:30:56,958 --> 00:30:58,948
why do they call you Big Evil?

669
00:31:00,357 --> 00:31:01,756
Because,

670
00:31:02,858 --> 00:31:05,256
my evil is big.

671
00:31:23,458 --> 00:31:26,948
Can you turn down the music? We got
a noise complaint or some shit.

672
00:31:57,058 --> 00:31:58,615
Then you go faster.

673
00:32:03,092 --> 00:32:05,991
I am nailing this.
Oh, my...

674
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:17,786
Come on, baby.

675
00:32:23,158 --> 00:32:24,522
Hey, bro.
Hey.

676
00:32:25,691 --> 00:32:27,283
- Hi, baby.
- Cindy, what's up?

677
00:32:27,357 --> 00:32:28,756
I wanted to
introduce you to Janet.

678
00:32:28,825 --> 00:32:31,088
Hi. It's so nice to
meet you. Happy birthday.

679
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:32,181
Thank you.

680
00:32:32,258 --> 00:32:33,281
You look beautiful.

681
00:32:33,725 --> 00:32:35,124
Pick up your dress so
you don't step on it.

682
00:32:35,325 --> 00:32:37,189
You look beautiful.
I gotta go. Bye!

683
00:32:37,258 --> 00:32:39,157
- All grown up.
- He spoils her.

684
00:32:39,225 --> 00:32:40,623
But I want to
give you the lowdown.

685
00:32:40,691 --> 00:32:42,124
I'm listening.
I'm listening.

686
00:32:42,225 --> 00:32:44,385
So, everybody here is pretty much family.
Like somehow.

687
00:32:44,458 --> 00:32:46,652
They're all Mexican family.

688
00:32:46,725 --> 00:32:48,090
You got cousins and you
got aunts and uncles,

689
00:32:48,158 --> 00:32:49,988
just like everything else, and
then you got cousins' cousins.

690
00:32:50,058 --> 00:32:52,287
And then you have Brian.

691
00:32:52,524 --> 00:32:54,548
You stick around, you're
gonna see somebody throw up.

692
00:32:54,658 --> 00:32:56,784
Couple fights.
It's fun. It's fun.

693
00:32:56,858 --> 00:32:58,950
Enough, enough. I'm sorry.

694
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:01,092
Well, I'm Irish,
so it's the same thing.

695
00:33:01,158 --> 00:33:03,681
Big families, and nobody
ever gets divorced.

696
00:33:03,791 --> 00:33:05,258
And they all wear purple.
Well, less purple,

697
00:33:05,325 --> 00:33:06,951
but just as much beer.

698
00:33:07,025 --> 00:33:08,117
She's funny.

699
00:33:08,192 --> 00:33:10,386
They get way too drunk
and get in fistfights.

700
00:33:10,459 --> 00:33:11,448
Yeah, same here.

701
00:33:11,524 --> 00:33:13,616
But you mess with one person, you
have the whole family after you.

702
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:14,885
That's the way to do it.

703
00:33:14,958 --> 00:33:16,754
- There you go. 
- You just described Mexican people.

704
00:33:17,092 --> 00:33:18,354
Can I feel it?
Is that okay?

705
00:33:18,425 --> 00:33:20,221
Yeah, he's actually kicking
a lot right now. Here.

706
00:33:20,392 --> 00:33:21,756
And I think his feet
are right there.

707
00:33:23,425 --> 00:33:25,392
Do you feel it?
 Wow.

708
00:33:25,725 --> 00:33:27,124
Oh, my God.

709
00:33:27,192 --> 00:33:28,658
I like her, Brian.

710
00:33:29,025 --> 00:33:30,821
- Buddy. 
- How long have you known Brian?

711
00:33:30,891 --> 00:33:33,824
Three years. He and Mike
went to the Academy together, so...

712
00:33:33,891 --> 00:33:35,290
Right.

713
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:27,082
Brian, it's you.

714
00:34:41,092 --> 00:34:42,559
Hi.

715
00:34:45,225 --> 00:34:47,215
I'm gonna try
not to wake you up.

716
00:34:52,358 --> 00:34:54,655
I can't believe
that I stayed over.

717
00:34:57,459 --> 00:35:02,222
This, this is interesting.
I have never shot one before.

718
00:35:04,092 --> 00:35:06,559
Maybe that could
be our next date.

719
00:35:09,826 --> 00:35:12,884
I did go through your wallet.
I'm sorry.

720
00:35:12,959 --> 00:35:15,118
I am naturally curious.

721
00:35:15,192 --> 00:35:17,056
I hope that's okay.

722
00:35:18,192 --> 00:35:22,751
Gotta love a guy who has a picture
of his mom in his wallet.

723
00:35:26,092 --> 00:35:29,082
This? Yeah.

724
00:35:29,158 --> 00:35:32,853
Kristin, Mia, Raquel,
etcetera, etcetera...

725
00:35:33,459 --> 00:35:35,358
You won't be
needing this anymore.

726
00:35:44,525 --> 00:35:45,753
You were drooling.

727
00:36:02,392 --> 00:36:03,757
What are
we looking for again?

728
00:36:04,392 --> 00:36:06,518
All the food groups,
dope, money and guns.

729
00:36:06,592 --> 00:36:08,616
The ghetto will provide, bro.

730
00:36:15,859 --> 00:36:17,621
Fucking Sarge.
Sarge!

731
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:20,651
We're staking out Curbside.
They're gonna spot your unit.

732
00:36:20,726 --> 00:36:23,386
What, you think they
don't know you're here?

733
00:36:23,459 --> 00:36:25,392
Van Hauser wants to file
a complaint on you, Taylor.

734
00:36:25,692 --> 00:36:27,750
Oh, the <i>USS Van Hauser?</i>

735
00:36:27,859 --> 00:36:29,292
The LAPD's
stealthiest submarine,

736
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:30,723
only surfaces at
the end of watch?

737
00:36:30,926 --> 00:36:32,756
He said you were
videotaping him.

738
00:36:32,826 --> 00:36:34,918
What did I tell you
about that shit?

739
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:36,592
Why is he such a bitter dude?

740
00:36:36,659 --> 00:36:38,183
If he hates pushing
the black and white so much,

741
00:36:38,259 --> 00:36:40,521
why doesn't he just leave his badge
on the watch commander's desk

742
00:36:40,592 --> 00:36:42,287
and go home and
eat a bowl of dicks?

743
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:44,053
Have some
empathy for this man.

744
00:36:44,959 --> 00:36:46,324
Taylor, I gotta put in my log

745
00:36:46,392 --> 00:36:48,484
that I verbally counseled you
about this fucking camera.

746
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:50,753
What? I was documenting
a crime scene.

747
00:36:50,926 --> 00:36:52,120
Have a good day, ladies.

748
00:36:52,193 --> 00:36:53,887
Yeah.
Take it easy.

749
00:37:10,093 --> 00:37:11,957
God, is that Big
Evil's mom right there?

750
00:37:12,059 --> 00:37:13,992
His mom?
Yeah, that's Mrs. Evil.

751
00:37:15,326 --> 00:37:16,384
Who's the cowboy?

752
00:37:16,926 --> 00:37:20,052
I don't know. He's got
money, look at his truck.

753
00:37:20,792 --> 00:37:21,815
I'm gonna run him.

754
00:37:21,892 --> 00:37:22,915
You want to jam this fool?

755
00:37:22,992 --> 00:37:24,220
Yes, I do.

756
00:37:27,059 --> 00:37:29,322
Plate's clean. Shit.

757
00:37:30,259 --> 00:37:31,691
What's our PC, though?

758
00:37:31,759 --> 00:37:34,056
That stupid CD hanging
from his rearview mirror,

759
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:36,184
obstructing his vision.

760
00:37:36,259 --> 00:37:37,725
Let's do this.
All right.

761
00:37:49,293 --> 00:37:50,725
Come on, fucker.

762
00:37:51,026 --> 00:37:52,425
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

763
00:37:54,526 --> 00:37:55,924
Light them up.

764
00:37:56,026 --> 00:37:57,323
13 X-ray 13,
we're Code 6

A cell.

Liberace's AK.

What?

802
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:22,260
Holy shit.

803
00:40:23,526 --> 00:40:27,892
Here we have two of the
major food groups, money and guns.

804
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:32,018
This is the lifeblood of our
organization. Paperwork.

805
00:40:32,827 --> 00:40:35,623
The way red corpuscles carry
oxygen through the body,

806
00:40:36,693 --> 00:40:38,887
paperwork carries information
through the department.

807
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:40,918
What are corpuscles?

808
00:40:40,993 --> 00:40:42,482
Evening, guys.

809
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,618
Evening. How you doing, Captain?
Sir.

810
00:40:44,693 --> 00:40:46,785
So this is it? These are the
guns you took off the cowboy?

811
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:47,883
Yup.
Yes, sir.

812
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,722
Mind if I pick them up?

813
00:40:51,526 --> 00:40:52,549
Fancy.

814
00:40:52,626 --> 00:40:53,752
That's some nice hardware.

815
00:40:54,227 --> 00:40:55,955
Yeah, I heard he took a shot at you.
You okay?

816
00:40:56,027 --> 00:40:57,891
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm good.
He's good.

817
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,325
Liberace's AK.

818
00:40:59,393 --> 00:41:01,122
This looks
like Liberace's AK.

819
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:05,421
Keep up the good work, guys. I
really appreciate it. Carry on.

820
00:41:05,493 --> 00:41:06,790
Thank you.
Good evening, sir.

821
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:07,952
Good night, Van Hauser.

822
00:41:08,027 --> 00:41:09,187
Evening, sir.

823
00:41:10,294 --> 00:41:11,590
Why do you get nervous?

824
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,593
Women want him, men want to be him, man.
He's just...

825
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,127
Yeah, I know.
But you want him.

826
00:41:15,194 --> 00:41:17,286
Dude, I'm not gay, but I'd
go down on him if he asked.

827
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,452
Sometimes I don't know
when you're kidding.

828
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,988
And I have to know
when you're kidding.

829
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,489
I'm not kidding. I gotta
know when you're kidding.

830
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,187
I'm not kidding.

831
00:41:32,693 --> 00:41:33,955
Oh! Dude. I gotta go.

832
00:41:34,394 --> 00:41:35,917
I'm taking Janet
to the Philharmonic.

833
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:38,426
Enjoy your white people shit.

834
00:41:38,494 --> 00:41:40,051
Oh, thanks, I'll bring
you back a burrito.

835

Dude! Stop.
Stop, man, fuck.

"when ours hasn't
even been born yet."

929
00:47:46,562 --> 00:47:48,961
She's like,
"You're not a fireman."

930
00:47:49,029 --> 00:47:50,290
Janet said the same thing.

931
00:47:50,361 --> 00:47:51,589
Yeah?

932
00:47:53,862 --> 00:47:55,988
I don't think I could go in
another burning building.

933
00:47:56,062 --> 00:48:00,791
I only went in because you did.
Just put that shit out there.

934
00:48:11,361 --> 00:48:13,090
All right,
dickhead, what is it?

935
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:22,293
You remember that cowboy
with the blinged-out AK?

936
00:48:22,361 --> 00:48:23,658
Yeah, he's probably my cousin.

937
00:48:23,729 --> 00:48:25,252
All right, I crisscrossed
some numbers on his cell.

938
00:48:25,328 --> 00:48:27,192
Couple addresses
come up in our basic area.

939
00:48:27,261 --> 00:48:28,284
You're not a detective.

940
00:48:28,361 --> 00:48:30,056
That guy is something.
He's into something.

941
00:48:30,129 --> 00:48:31,789
Oh, really? You think?

942
00:48:31,862 --> 00:48:35,091
Dude, DA didn't buy the ADW,
only filed on the weapons beef.

943
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:36,355
Gang Unit says
they'll get to him,

944
00:48:36,428 --> 00:48:37,588
but they're too busy
or some shit.

945
00:48:37,662 --> 00:48:40,561
And Narco's not interested
because we didn't find dope.

946
00:48:40,628 --> 00:48:42,061
Yeah, but you're
not a detective.

947
00:48:42,129 --> 00:48:43,891
You're not a fireman.
Fuck you.

948
00:48:44,428 --> 00:48:46,191
Follow me into the house, dude.

949
00:48:47,196 --> 00:48:48,355
I said you're not a detective.

950
00:48:48,428 --> 00:48:49,520
I want to be a detective.

951
00:48:49,628 --> 00:48:51,492
You wanna be? Follow me
into the house, dude.

952
00:48:51,729 --> 00:48:53,753
Follow me into the house.

953
00:48:54,862 --> 00:48:57,261
Follow me into the house, dude.

954
00:49:06,862 --> 00:49:11,693

955

956
00:49:30,129 --> 00:49:32,891
The fuck?
What the fuck?

957
00:49:35,196 --> 00:49:36,719
This is weird.

958
00:49:47,062 --> 00:49:50,052
13 X-ray 13, you need to
send us additional unit.

959

It's okay. Goodbye.

963

Fuck this guy.

964
00:50:18,096 --> 00:50:20,086
Get that shit out of here.

965
00:50:26,029 --> 00:50:27,428
I know
what that means.

966
00:50:28,929 --> 00:50:30,328
Shut the fuck up, man.

967
00:50:31,396 --> 00:50:32,488
Spread your legs.

968
00:50:34,463 --> 00:50:36,225
Spread your fucking legs.

969

Put your fucking head back.

970
00:50:42,096 --> 00:50:43,892
- Gun, partner.
- Oh, yeah?

971
00:50:50,296 --> 00:50:51,887
Get your
fucking head back.

972
00:50:56,262 --> 00:50:57,888
- Another gun, partner.
- Two, huh?

973
00:51:03,062 --> 00:51:04,892
Wads of cash.

974
00:51:04,962 --> 00:51:06,554
All right, tell him
to get on his knees.

975
00:51:10,029 --> 00:51:11,724
Get the fuck over here.

976

979
00:51:30,496 --> 00:51:31,690
What do we got?

980
00:51:33,463 --> 00:51:34,930
Check it out, partner.

981
00:51:35,696 --> 00:51:37,925
I got this motherfucker.

982
00:51:45,663 --> 00:51:47,857
Oh, my God.

983
00:52:12,476 --> 00:52:13,567
Take my buddy.

984
00:52:13,642 --> 00:52:15,303
What the fuck, Zavala?
You catch 'em, I clean 'em?

985
00:52:15,376 --> 00:52:16,899
Take him.

986
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:19,805
I don't know,
we got like...

987
00:52:20,642 --> 00:52:22,109
I'm gonna go outside.
Yo, Z, you good?

988
00:52:22,176 --> 00:52:23,302
I'm good, bro.
Z?

989
00:52:23,409 --> 00:52:24,898
I'm good!

990
00:52:30,709 --> 00:52:33,199
What the fuck? Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

991
00:52:33,309 --> 00:52:36,605
Federal agents. Who's in charge here?
Are you in charge?

992
00:52:36,675 --> 00:52:38,665
What the fuck? I need
to know who's in charge here.

993
00:52:38,742 --> 00:52:40,039
Is this man under arrest?

994
00:52:40,109 --> 00:52:41,132
Yes, sir.

995
00:52:41,209 --> 00:52:42,335
What are the charges
against this man?

996
00:52:42,675 --> 00:52:44,438
Turn that fucking camera off.
It's off. It's off.

997
00:52:44,509 --> 00:52:45,600
The fucking camera's off, man.

998
00:52:45,675 --> 00:52:46,801
You guys fucked up.

999
00:52:47,042 --> 00:52:49,339
Just lost a POI
because of you guys.

1000
00:52:49,409 --> 00:52:51,308
Are we clear in there?
Clear.

1001
00:52:52,476 --> 00:52:53,703
What the fuck, bro?

1002
00:52:53,775 --> 00:52:55,799
What did we fuck up?
I don't fucking know, dude.

1003
00:52:55,875 --> 00:52:57,001
Who the fuck is this guy?

1004
00:52:57,076 --> 00:52:58,168
I don't fucking know.

1005
00:53:22,443 --> 00:53:24,205
We have one POI.

1006
00:53:24,775 --> 00:53:26,106
Dude, I just want to
fucking talk to this guy.

1007
00:53:26,176 --> 00:53:27,199
Let's just get out of here.

1008
00:53:27,276 --> 00:53:29,674
I just want to fucking talk
to him just for a second.

1009
00:53:29,775 --> 00:53:31,639
Come on, let's go.
Go ahead.

1010
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:35,169
Sir, I don't want to
cause any trouble here,

1011
00:53:35,242 --> 00:53:36,902
but we just fucking...
We rolled up here...

1012
00:53:36,976 --> 00:53:38,068
I don't know what's going on.

1013
00:53:38,176 --> 00:53:40,336
It's the second cowboy like
this we've run into in a week.

1014
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:44,636
Watch out for these guys. They
operate by a different set of rules.

1015
00:53:44,709 --> 00:53:45,971
I know I'm just
a ghetto street cop,

1016
00:53:46,042 --> 00:53:47,236
but you gotta give me
something here.

1017
00:53:47,309 --> 00:53:50,333
We've got indicators he's a
runner for the Sinaloa cartel.

1018
00:53:50,409 --> 00:53:52,069
Yeah, well, we ran him,
he came up clean, dude.

1019
00:53:52,142 --> 00:53:54,575
You guys don't have the proper
clearance for any of this information,

1020
00:53:54,643 --> 00:53:56,507
but I'm gonna throw you a bone.

1021
00:53:56,610 --> 00:54:00,168
Cartels are operating here.
We're on it. Be careful.

1022
00:54:00,242 --> 00:54:01,436
What does that mean, though?

1023
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:04,701
It means you and your
homeboy need to power down.

1024
00:54:04,775 --> 00:54:06,765
You just tugged on
the tail of the snake

1025
00:54:06,842 --> 00:54:08,537
and it's gonna turn around
and bite you back.

1026
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:09,871
I'm throwing you a bone here.

1027
00:54:09,942 --> 00:54:12,535
Be grateful for what I'm giving you.
I'm giving you a warning.

1028
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:13,599
Lay low.

1029
00:54:13,676 --> 00:54:14,698
All right, yeah.

1030
00:54:14,775 --> 00:54:15,867
Can I get your name for my log?

1031
00:54:15,942 --> 00:54:17,341
Negative, move along.

1032
00:54:18,543 --> 00:54:19,601
Yeah, all right.

1033
00:54:21,409 --> 00:54:23,603
Sir, you know that there's
five-year-old kids in there?

1034
00:54:23,709 --> 00:54:25,176
All right, dude. Z.
For six months?

1035
00:54:25,309 --> 00:54:27,969
Goodbye. Get off
the crime scene. Go home.

1036
00:54:28,042 --> 00:54:29,031
Bye. Yeah.

1037
00:54:29,109 --> 00:54:30,098
Have a nice night.

1038
00:54:30,209 --> 00:54:31,937
- Fucking feds.
- Z, what the fuck, man?

1039
00:54:32,009 --> 00:54:33,533
Fuck them.

1040
00:54:47,209 --> 00:54:49,642
I didn't think that
shit came over here, bro.

1041
00:54:50,509 --> 00:54:53,771
Kids, women. Did you see that fucking toilet?
Filled up with shit.

1042
00:54:56,009 --> 00:54:57,704
Dude, we had no fucking
business being there.

1043
00:54:57,775 --> 00:54:58,867
We didn't even
have a call there.

1044
00:54:58,942 --> 00:55:00,841
Dude, I didn't know what we
were fucking rolling up on.

1045
00:55:00,942 --> 00:55:02,273
You think I knew what
we were rolling up on?

1046
00:55:11,042 --> 00:55:12,634
Human trafficking.

1047
00:55:41,443 --> 00:55:44,433
He's so cute.
You did so good, baby.

1048
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:47,399
I love this smell.

1049
00:55:48,909 --> 00:55:50,308
Just hold his
head a little bit.

1050
00:55:50,376 --> 00:55:51,741
I am. He's fine.

1051
00:55:51,809 --> 00:55:56,175
You gotta hold him like
this, like a football.

1052
00:55:56,242 --> 00:55:58,106
I know how to hold a baby.

1053
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,265
Babe, please.
Like that.

1054
00:56:04,576 --> 00:56:06,133
- Hey.
- Hi.

1055
00:56:06,209 --> 00:56:08,039
Oh! Hey, partner,
what's up?

1056
00:56:08,942 --> 00:56:10,569
Come here, dude.
Oh!

1057
00:56:14,242 --> 00:56:15,709
Look who's here.

1058
00:56:15,776 --> 00:56:17,174
How's Mama doing?

1059
00:56:17,242 --> 00:56:20,505
Mama's tired and cranky.
Just like baby.

1060
00:56:20,909 --> 00:56:22,308
Mama wants to choke Daddy.

1061
00:56:22,376 --> 00:56:23,570
Oh, come on, babe.

1062
00:56:23,676 --> 00:56:24,937
Did you name him Brian?

1063
00:56:25,409 --> 00:56:27,137
Sorry, bro.

1064
00:56:27,576 --> 00:56:29,974
He's a junior. I named
him after his daddy.

1065
00:56:30,076 --> 00:56:31,975
So what's his name?

1066
00:56:33,976 --> 00:56:35,739
Fuck you, dude.

1067
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:37,742
Can I hold him?

1068
00:56:38,443 --> 00:56:39,637
Yeah.

1069
00:56:49,643 --> 00:56:51,234
So sweet.

1070
00:56:52,142 --> 00:56:54,234
You're so done, bro.
Mmm-hmm.

1071
00:57:07,643 --> 00:57:11,098
Hey, baby.
What are you wearing?

1072
00:57:12,743 --> 00:57:14,334
I can say it.
What are you wearing?

1073
00:57:16,343 --> 00:57:17,934
I don't care.
You still look good.

1074
00:57:19,276 --> 00:57:21,038
Yeah, Brian's right here.

1075
00:57:21,676 --> 00:57:25,575
Okay. All right, sorry.
Okay, I love you. Bye.

1076
00:57:26,643 --> 00:57:28,200
You didn't even say hi, man.

1077
00:57:28,276 --> 00:57:30,266
She was pissed, dude.

1078
00:57:33,076 --> 00:57:34,771
How'd you know you were
gonna marry Gabby?

1079
00:57:34,843 --> 00:57:36,673
She told me.
I was just some stoner

1080
00:57:36,743 --> 00:57:38,209
working at my
uncle's muffler shop,

1081
00:57:38,276 --> 00:57:40,470
and one day she grabbed me
by the shoulders and says,

1082
00:57:40,543 --> 00:57:42,669
"We're getting married and
you're joining the department,

1083
00:57:42,743 --> 00:57:44,676
"because you can make a lot of
money without a college degree."

1084
00:57:44,743 --> 00:57:46,369
And I was like,
"Fuck, yeah."

1085
00:57:46,443 --> 00:57:50,069
I mean, you love her. You
guys, like, you never fight.

1086
00:57:50,476 --> 00:57:51,670
You're happy together.

1087
00:57:51,743 --> 00:57:53,403
She's my bitch for sure, dude.

1088
00:57:54,076 --> 00:57:56,066
I'm just telling you
the way it went down.

1089
00:57:56,610 --> 00:57:58,270
I popped her cherry
in high school.

1090
00:57:58,409 --> 00:58:00,103
She's never been
with anybody else.

1091
00:58:00,176 --> 00:58:01,837
I've never wanted to
be with anybody else.

1092
00:58:02,476 --> 00:58:04,466
You know, it's easy.

1093
00:58:04,543 --> 00:58:06,908
Things are getting super
serious with Janet and me.

1094
00:58:06,976 --> 00:58:08,500
What, you just found that out?

1095
00:58:08,576 --> 00:58:10,406
Did you read that in the paper
or something?

1096
00:58:10,509 --> 00:58:12,408
Homegirl owns your ass, dude.

1097
00:58:12,476 --> 00:58:13,636
Dude, she wants to move in.

1098
00:58:14,610 --> 00:58:17,372
She's always over, you know. Why
spend the money on two apartments?

1099
00:58:17,443 --> 00:58:19,137
It's not about the money.

1100
00:58:19,209 --> 00:58:21,699
No, her parents are
so traditional, dude.

1101
00:58:22,076 --> 00:58:24,066
Oh, yeah?
They will go ballistic.

1102
00:58:24,610 --> 00:58:26,509
But at least we can tell them
we're engaged, you know.

1103
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:29,873
Oh, whoa! Hold up, bro.
Don't play with that shit.

1104
00:58:30,276 --> 00:58:31,868
You don't ask
a broad to marry you

1105
00:58:31,943 --> 00:58:33,500
because her folks
are old-school.

1106
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:35,099
No, dude, you
don't understand, man.

1107
00:58:35,176 --> 00:58:36,609
No, dude, you
don't do that shit.

1108
00:58:37,109 --> 00:58:38,576
Think about it, man.

1109
00:58:38,976 --> 00:58:42,603
Dude, after you think about it,
think about it again. Jesus.

1110
00:58:43,176 --> 00:58:45,507
Marriage is forever.
Just realize that.

1111
00:58:46,509 --> 00:58:47,998
It's a promise before God.

1112
00:58:50,643 --> 00:58:54,508
My grandma was
really deep, dude.

1113
00:58:55,509 --> 00:58:58,374
She's seen it all.
You know what I'm saying?

1114
00:58:59,176 --> 00:59:01,643
When me and Gabby got engaged,
bro, she asked me one thing.

1115
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:02,904
Do you want to hear it?

1116
00:59:02,977 --> 00:59:04,238
Fine, let's hear it.

1117
00:59:05,076 --> 00:59:07,669
She said, "Can you
live without her?

1118
00:59:10,076 --> 00:59:13,669
"And if the answer is yes,
man up and forget her.

1119
00:59:13,776 --> 00:59:15,265
"Don't string her along."

1120
00:59:16,343 --> 00:59:17,366
Think about it, bro.

1121
00:59:18,943 --> 00:59:20,603
I did.

1122
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:33,238
<i>13X-ray 43.</i>
<i>Officer needs help.</i>

1123
00:59:33,309 --> 00:59:34,332
Where?

1124
00:59:34,409 --> 00:59:36,603
<i>Newton units, stand by.

1125
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:38,540
<i>13X 43, what's your location?</i>

1126
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:40,076
<i>I don't know.</i>
What?

1127
00:59:40,142 --> 00:59:42,132
That's Van Hauser's car.
Come on, Boot!

1128
00:59:42,209 --> 00:59:43,642
Just book it south.
Go, go, go.

1129
00:59:44,843 --> 00:59:46,503
Find a street sign, put it out.

1130
00:59:46,576 --> 00:59:49,043
<i>I don't see any!</i>

1131
00:59:49,509 --> 00:59:51,703
Is there a number on a house?
A building number?

1132
00:59:51,776 --> 00:59:54,436
<i>The house is 3-1-7-7.
Sir, back up!</i>

1133
00:59:55,910 --> 00:59:58,036
Holy shit. Bro, hook a left on Maple.

1134
00:59:59,142 --> 01:00:01,905
13 X-ray 13, show us responding

Responding Code 3 Maple and 3-0.</i>

1136
01:00:06,343 --> 01:00:08,776
Right there! Right there!
Bro, right there! Go.

1137
01:00:08,843 --> 01:00:12,833
13 X-ray 13, show us Code 6
at Compton and 3-1 street.

1138
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:14,843
Who is that?
Taylor and Zavala.

1139
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:17,499
13 X-ray 13, send me an
airship to set up a perimeter.

1140
01:00:17,610 --> 01:00:18,633
Oh, shit.

1141
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:19,972
Taylor, would you
call for a rescue?

1142
01:00:20,077 --> 01:00:22,100
Do not move. What did he look like?
Where'd he go?

1143
01:00:22,242 --> 01:00:23,641
Northbound through the houses.

1144
01:00:24,776 --> 01:00:27,971
Hispanic male,
blue checkered shirt.

1145
01:00:28,176 --> 01:00:30,200
Zero-head, he's a parolee,
he's fucking huge.

1146
01:00:30,276 --> 01:00:32,073
13 X-ray 13,
suspect headed northbound,

1147
01:00:32,142 --> 01:00:33,905
heavyset male Hispanic,
shaved head.

1148
01:00:33,977 --> 01:00:35,739
Weapon used
was a knife. KMA.

1149
01:00:36,776 --> 01:00:37,834
Let's do this shit.

1150
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:40,570
Careful, men. On your left.
He's fucking huge.

1151
01:00:42,343 --> 01:00:43,640
- It's clear over here.
- Crossing.

1152
01:00:44,476 --> 01:00:45,636
The windows?
You got left?

1153
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:46,802
I got right.

1154
01:00:47,109 --> 01:00:48,940
Push, push, push.

1155
01:00:49,576 --> 01:00:52,668
You're on my elbow. You call it out.
You call it out if you see it.

1156
01:00:54,409 --> 01:00:57,104
Dude, I see him. On the left. On the left.
Ready, go, go, split.

1157
01:00:57,176 --> 01:00:58,700
Take it, you bitch. Fuck you!

1158
01:00:58,776 --> 01:01:00,004
On the left.
I've got him, you ready?

1159
01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:02,804
Fucking bitch. Fucking whore.
Try to fuck with me? Fuck you!

1160
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:05,172
Get the fuck off her or I will
blow your fucking head off!

1161
01:01:05,242 --> 01:01:06,732
I'm done. I ain't
resisting, Officer.

1162
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:07,970
Don't
fucking look at me!

1163
01:01:08,043 --> 01:01:09,805
I ain't resisting, sir.
Shut the fuck up!

1164
01:01:09,876 --> 01:01:12,809
Get up! Put your hands over your head!
Get up.

1165
01:01:13,309 --> 01:01:15,139
Put your hands over your head.

1166
01:01:15,209 --> 01:01:17,369
Back up towards me
till I tell you to stop.

1167
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:20,242
Move. Move. Move.

1168
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:23,833
Move. Stop!
Get on your fucking knees.

1169
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:26,002
And cross your goddamn feet
together, you hear me?

1170
01:01:26,077 --> 01:01:27,703
Cross your legs.

1171
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:28,936
If I hear a fucking
word out of you,

1172
01:01:29,010 --> 01:01:30,840
I will blow you out
of your fucking socks.

1173
01:01:30,910 --> 01:01:32,240
Hook him, Z.

1174
01:01:38,810 --> 01:01:41,834
13 X-ray 13, show a Code 4.
Suspect's in custody.

1175
01:01:42,077 --> 01:01:43,941
You good, Z?
I'm good. Are you good?

1176
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:47,172
God damn it.

1177
01:01:47,509 --> 01:01:48,999
All right, you're
gonna be all right.

1178
01:01:49,077 --> 01:01:50,634
You're gonna be all right.
You're gonna be all right.

1179
01:01:50,876 --> 01:01:53,308
Fuck, man, her face is
all fucking broken in.

1180
01:01:53,476 --> 01:01:55,602
13 X-ray 13 requesting
an additional RA.

1181
01:01:55,676 --> 01:01:57,575
<i>13X 13, roger on the RA.
</i> You're gonna be okay.

1182
01:01:57,643 --> 01:01:59,371
You're gonna be all right.
We're here for you, all right?

1183
01:01:59,443 --> 01:02:00,967
Dude, we got
the cavalry coming.

1184
01:02:01,043 --> 01:02:03,010
That motherfucker's gonna pay
for what he did, you hear me?

1185
01:02:03,476 --> 01:02:05,204
Boot, you hear me?
Boot?

1186
01:02:05,276 --> 01:02:06,334
Don't call her Boot, bro.

1187
01:02:06,409 --> 01:02:08,001
Well, I don't know
what her fucking name is!

1188
01:02:08,077 --> 01:02:09,407
Is there a tag anywhere?
Do you see a tag?

1189
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:10,568
No.

1190
01:02:11,776 --> 01:02:13,800
You hearing me? She's nodding,
dude, she's nodding, she hears me.

1191
01:02:13,876 --> 01:02:16,036
You're gonna be okay, all right?
Do you hear me?

1192
01:02:17,242 --> 01:02:18,937
It's all good.
It's all good.

1193
01:02:24,476 --> 01:02:25,807
You're gonna be okay, brother.

1194
01:02:25,876 --> 01:02:28,604
Fucking cut my vest off.
God damn it, Taylor.

1195
01:02:28,676 --> 01:02:32,768
I tell you one fucking thing!
Fucking cut my vest off!

1196
01:02:32,843 --> 01:02:34,140
All right, bro,
we got your back.

1197
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:36,369
Jesus Christ!
God damn it.

1198
01:02:36,443 --> 01:02:39,569
Get back, brother, all right. You're good, bro.
We got your back.

1199
01:02:39,643 --> 01:02:42,439
They cut my fucking vest.
They cut my fucking vest.

1200
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:45,207
What's up? You okay?

1201
01:02:45,610 --> 01:02:47,668
Taylor, I'm really tired, dude.

1202
01:02:48,110 --> 01:02:51,634
Why didn't you shoot that son of a bitch?
You had him dead to rights.

1203
01:02:52,343 --> 01:02:54,276
I just didn't feel like killing
anyone tonight, Sarge.

1204
01:02:54,376 --> 01:02:55,707
You feel like
writing this up?

1205
01:02:56,276 --> 01:02:58,573
Brass is gonna want clean paper,
make sure all the logs match.

1206
01:02:58,643 --> 01:02:59,940
Sarge, did you see that?

1207
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:02,602
Van H had a fucking Ginsu
sticking out of his eye.

1208
01:03:02,676 --> 01:03:04,109
His eye
was cut in half.

1209
01:03:04,177 --> 01:03:05,404
The lens was hanging out.

1210
01:03:05,676 --> 01:03:07,007
He's not coming back.

1211
01:03:07,576 --> 01:03:08,668
Rookie, too.

1212
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:10,176
She ain't coming back.
What?

1213
01:03:10,243 --> 01:03:11,937
She gave me this to give
to the watch commander.

1214
01:03:12,010 --> 01:03:13,170
On the spot?

1215
01:03:13,243 --> 01:03:14,368
Yeah.

1216
01:03:14,443 --> 01:03:16,410
Oh, well. She wouldn't have
made probation anyway.

1217
01:03:16,476 --> 01:03:17,499
Hell, no.

1218
01:03:17,576 --> 01:03:18,634
What, because her
daddy's not a captain?

1219
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:20,472
You know she wasn't
cut out for this shit.

1220
01:03:20,543 --> 01:03:22,238
Why is that?
The evidence.

1221
01:03:22,509 --> 01:03:23,999
She almost
got Van Hauser killed.

1222
01:03:24,077 --> 01:03:26,976
You guys are cold, man. You
got cold, dead eyes. You know that?

1223
01:03:27,110 --> 01:03:28,236
Yeah, both of us.

1224
01:03:28,309 --> 01:03:29,571
Yeah, both of you.
You have a soul?

1225
01:03:29,643 --> 01:03:31,371
Yes, we just
leave it at home.

1226
01:03:31,443 --> 01:03:34,172
Yo, we gonna sit around yapping
or we gonna get this done?

1227
01:03:34,243 --> 01:03:36,073
Dude, you guys saved
that rookie's life.

1228
01:03:36,143 --> 01:03:38,076
That was one big
fucking fat <i>ese.</i>

1229
01:03:38,143 --> 01:03:40,042
Can we
clear the scene?

1230
01:03:40,110 --> 01:03:41,736
Division's fucking
falling apart over here.

1231
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:43,902
We good? You good?
Good, good, good?

1232
01:03:43,977 --> 01:03:44,966
We're all good.

1233
01:03:45,043 --> 01:03:46,032
Yes?
Go back to work.

1234
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:47,236
Good night, ladies.

1235
01:03:52,743 --> 01:03:55,233
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
introducing Officer and Mrs. Taylor.</i>

1236
01:04:06,243 --> 01:04:07,732
Go, Brian!

1237
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:09,768
What's up, guys?

1238
01:05:05,776 --> 01:05:07,606
How's
the cake? Good?

1239
01:05:20,143 --> 01:05:21,507
Cheers!

1240
01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:39,776
Fuck.

1241
01:05:40,443 --> 01:05:41,842
All right.

1242
01:05:42,843 --> 01:05:47,503
Janet, you got a lot of heart
hooking up with a cop.

1243
01:05:48,476 --> 01:05:50,500
Because it takes
a strong person,

1244
01:05:50,576 --> 01:05:52,907
and I see like a lot
of cops' wives in here,

1245
01:05:52,977 --> 01:05:54,410
they're all
nodding their heads.

1246
01:05:55,843 --> 01:05:57,333
You gotta take
care of her, bro.

1247
01:05:58,243 --> 01:05:59,539
'Cause I'm her big brother now.

1248
01:05:59,910 --> 01:06:01,706
And every cop in here,

1249
01:06:03,143 --> 01:06:04,666
we're all her family now, too.

1250
01:06:08,910 --> 01:06:10,809
I'm going to cry,
baby, shut up.

1251
01:06:12,743 --> 01:06:14,074
And Janet,

1252
01:06:14,676 --> 01:06:16,540
we're all hoping that you can
make a man out of Brian,

1253
01:06:16,610 --> 01:06:18,839
because we've all given up.

1254
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:20,400
So here we go.

1255
01:06:23,110 --> 01:06:24,270
To Brian and Janet.

1256
01:06:25,676 --> 01:06:27,075
Cheers!

1257
01:06:33,277 --> 01:06:34,766
Can I ask
you something?

1258
01:06:35,243 --> 01:06:38,835
Why the fuck did you get
married in your dress blues?

1259
01:06:38,910 --> 01:06:40,343
If you worked at Best Buy,

1260
01:06:40,410 --> 01:06:42,036
would you wear that fucking
stupid polo shirt?

1261
01:06:43,110 --> 01:06:44,441
I like
that polo shirt.

1262
01:06:44,509 --> 01:06:46,272
I'm representing, man.

1263
01:06:48,843 --> 01:06:50,105
You know I love you, man?

1264
01:06:50,177 --> 01:06:51,235
Oh, Jesus.

1265
01:06:51,444 --> 01:06:52,637
Here they go again.

1266
01:06:52,743 --> 01:06:54,267
I love you,
too, bro.

1267
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:57,302
- I would lay down my life for you, dude.
- "I love you, man."

1268
01:06:57,377 --> 01:06:59,173
I would take
a fucking bullet for you.

1269
01:06:59,243 --> 01:07:00,266
"I love you, man."

1270
01:07:00,344 --> 01:07:02,901
Get married to
each other because...

1271
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:05,410
All right, shut up.
Everybody take a shot.

1272
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:16,970
Cheers!

1273
01:07:18,444 --> 01:07:19,637
Ah!

1274
01:07:22,876 --> 01:07:24,104
My boy Garcia?

1275
01:07:24,743 --> 01:07:27,176
He's a fucking beast, man.
Right?

1276
01:07:27,277 --> 01:07:31,005
I've seen this motherfucker knock
an asshole out with one punch.

1277
01:07:31,310 --> 01:07:33,606
Yoked assholes, man.
Yoked assholes

1278
01:07:33,676 --> 01:07:35,200
from the joint when
they had weight piles.

1279
01:07:35,277 --> 01:07:36,335
You know what
I'm talking about?

1280
01:07:36,410 --> 01:07:38,899
You don't know what I'm talking
about, you're fucking 12 years old.

1281
01:07:39,243 --> 01:07:40,709
Cops like him...

1282
01:07:42,643 --> 01:07:44,270
Like soldiers.

1283
01:07:46,043 --> 01:07:47,873
He took a bullet for me.

1284
01:07:49,344 --> 01:07:52,573
My bullet, man.
He took my bullet.

1285
01:07:56,977 --> 01:08:01,570
He took my bullet. That's what he was.
That's what he was to me.

1286
01:08:02,143 --> 01:08:04,939
It should have been me.
'Cause he was a good guy.

1287
01:08:06,410 --> 01:08:08,240
I was shit.

1288
01:08:10,910 --> 01:08:12,309
Fuck it, man.

1289
01:08:21,843 --> 01:08:22,866
<i>Give me a kiss.</i>

1290
01:08:24,077 --> 01:08:25,339
You'll learn this.
You'll learn.

1291
01:08:25,943 --> 01:08:29,001
Marriage is really basic.

1292
01:08:29,077 --> 01:08:32,169
Right? There's just,
like, a couple guidelines.

1293
01:08:32,444 --> 01:08:34,274
One, you gotta give
it up all the time.

1294
01:08:36,077 --> 01:08:38,067
All the time.
You love that.

1295
01:08:38,477 --> 01:08:40,670
I don't hate that idea.

1296
01:08:40,743 --> 01:08:42,233
It's not a bad thing.
It's not a bad idea.

1297
01:08:42,310 --> 01:08:45,368
No, seriously,
girls throw it at cops.

1298
01:08:45,510 --> 01:08:46,669
Throw what exactly?

1299
01:08:46,776 --> 01:08:49,505
Their pussy.
Girls throw it.

1300
01:08:49,743 --> 01:08:51,540
So you can't give him
an excuse, girlfriend.

1301
01:08:51,611 --> 01:08:52,838
You cannot give him an excuse.

1302
01:08:52,910 --> 01:08:54,774
I've actually seen that before.

1303
01:08:54,843 --> 01:08:56,867
It's called assault
on a peace officer.

1304
01:08:56,977 --> 01:08:58,501
- I'll give you another one. You ready?
- Hell, yeah.

1305
01:08:58,577 --> 01:08:59,770
Be a freak.
Try new things.

1306
01:08:59,843 --> 01:09:00,969
Part two. Baby...

1307
01:09:01,043 --> 01:09:02,907
Like, you know, the gooch.

1308
01:09:02,977 --> 01:09:04,171
The what?
No, no, no, no.

1309
01:09:04,243 --> 01:09:05,403
The gooch?

1310
01:09:05,611 --> 01:09:07,237
Texas twister.

1311
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:10,300
No, that's something that's made up.
The Internet made that up.

1312
01:09:10,510 --> 01:09:11,737
You want to know
what Mike likes?

1313
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:12,970
No!

1314
01:09:17,310 --> 01:09:19,243
Babe! No! Babe, I
love you so much.

1315
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:21,908
The western, you know?
Open to explore, right?

1316
01:09:21,977 --> 01:09:23,410
Gabby!
It's our wedding!

1317
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:24,874
Cup him. Suck him.
This is way too much.

1318
01:09:24,943 --> 01:09:26,535
Cup him and suck him.
You're cut off.

1319
01:09:26,611 --> 01:09:27,907
You just rub it
a bit and then...

1320
01:09:27,977 --> 01:09:29,035
What the fuck?
Gabby!

1321
01:09:29,110 --> 01:09:30,441
Venture off a little bit more.

1322
01:09:30,510 --> 01:09:31,703
- No, no, no!
- Venture off?

1323
01:09:31,776 --> 01:09:33,641
They swear they
don't like it, but...

1324
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:35,507
Shit. Dude, really?

1325
01:09:39,277 --> 01:09:41,005
I'm happy, man.

1326
01:09:42,177 --> 01:09:44,973
I'm happy, bro.
Janet's dope, dude.

1327
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:56,004
You're my brother and everything,
dude, but you're a piece of shit.

1328
01:09:57,177 --> 01:09:58,610
Does she know that?

1329
01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:03,240
Yeah, she knows who I am.

1330
01:10:06,644 --> 01:10:09,634
I mean, you can't get into
something with somebody without...

1331
01:10:11,077 --> 01:10:12,476
She knows who I am.

1332
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:17,175
Yeah. I know who you are.
You're a piece of shit.

1333
01:10:19,510 --> 01:10:22,136
If you break her heart,
I'm gonna fuck you up.

1334
01:10:24,077 --> 01:10:25,839
Good to know.

1335
01:10:35,677 --> 01:10:38,576
If anything happened to you, I
would take care of your kids.

1336
01:10:38,644 --> 01:10:41,940
If you had any. And I
would take care of her.

1337
01:10:45,143 --> 01:10:47,007
I would take care of Janet.

1338
01:11:01,143 --> 01:11:04,577
<i>13-80-41, vicious
animal, Trinity and Jefferson.</i>

1339
01:11:04,644 --> 01:11:07,042
<i>Large pit bull running up</i>
<i>and down on location...</i>

1340
01:11:07,110 --> 01:11:08,702
What's in the stack?
Anything good?

1341
01:11:08,943 --> 01:11:10,910
Let's see here.

1342
01:11:11,410 --> 01:11:13,309
Business dispute.
Request police mediation.

1343
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:14,536
One neighbor
threw a cup of water

1344
01:11:14,611 --> 01:11:15,703
on the other neighbor's window.

1345
01:11:15,777 --> 01:11:17,539
Yeah, we're not buying that.

1346
01:11:17,711 --> 01:11:19,769
3-90 male. Intoxicated person
outside a liquor store.

1347
01:11:20,177 --> 01:11:21,303
Get the fuck out of here.

1348
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:24,037
There's a drunk man
outside the liquor store?

1349
01:11:25,677 --> 01:11:29,201
Welfare check. Woman requests
PD contact her elderly mother.

1350
01:11:29,277 --> 01:11:30,937
Yeah, buy that one.
You serious?

1351
01:11:31,010 --> 01:11:32,204
Yeah, if we buy
a couple of these,

1352
01:11:32,277 --> 01:11:33,403
maybe they'll send us
a Code 3 call.

1353
01:11:34,010 --> 01:11:35,272
All right. Cool.

1354
01:11:35,577 --> 01:11:36,941
I'll hit her up for
the next hotshots.

1355
01:11:37,010 --> 01:11:38,909
"On this episode,
we're rolling to a call.

1356
01:11:39,143 --> 01:11:42,201
"A woman called the station to
check on her elderly mother.

1357
01:11:42,377 --> 01:11:44,003
"So we're gonna go."

1358
01:11:44,077 --> 01:11:46,044
Yeah, these are the calls most
agencies deal with, you know?

1359
01:11:46,444 --> 01:11:48,502
Not every call's a foot
pursuit or a car chase.

1360
01:11:48,811 --> 01:11:50,141
Some guys at other agencies

1361
01:11:50,210 --> 01:11:52,109
have never even drawn their
weapon or been in a gunfight.

1362
01:11:52,177 --> 01:11:53,769
Yeah, but here, that's
just half your shift.

1363
01:11:53,876 --> 01:11:54,968
In the south end,

1364
01:11:55,043 --> 01:11:57,272
we'll get involved in more
capers in one deployment period

1365
01:11:57,344 --> 01:11:59,368
than most cops see
their entire career.

1366
01:11:59,611 --> 01:12:01,009
Hell, yeah.

1367
01:12:03,943 --> 01:12:05,137
Mrs. Williams!

1368
01:12:10,510 --> 01:12:13,067
Mrs. Williams!
Police officers!

1369
01:12:13,910 --> 01:12:15,207
Go around the back,
check it out.

1370
01:12:15,277 --> 01:12:16,868
All right. Here we go.

1371
01:12:18,243 --> 01:12:20,403
<i>I'm gonna wait for my partner.
He's gonna check the back</i>

1372
01:12:20,844 --> 01:12:22,538
to see if she's around
the back over there.

1373
01:12:22,844 --> 01:12:25,675
Oftentimes, a lot of these
people, they're very old people.

1374
01:12:26,143 --> 01:12:29,940
They can't hear us. You know,
they can't hear the...

1375
01:12:30,043 --> 01:12:31,203
Hearing aids,
you know. So...

1376
01:12:31,277 --> 01:12:32,403
Nothing.

1377
01:12:32,544 --> 01:12:34,738
All right, so the owner
of this house is actually

1378
01:12:34,811 --> 01:12:36,437
the daughter of the
woman who lives in it.

1379
01:12:36,510 --> 01:12:39,908
She gave us permission for the
welfare check, so we're gonna...

1380
01:12:40,677 --> 01:12:42,610
We're gonna boot the door.

1381
01:12:43,744 --> 01:12:46,370
Officer Zavala specializes
in booting doors.

1382
01:12:46,444 --> 01:12:47,672
I kick doors down.

1383
01:12:47,744 --> 01:12:48,937
There you go.

1384
01:12:49,010 --> 01:12:50,477
I kick doors down.

1385
01:12:51,377 --> 01:12:52,742
Say it in English now, bro.

1386
01:12:52,811 --> 01:12:53,970
I kick doors down.

1387
01:12:54,043 --> 01:12:55,408
Wait, did you check
if it was unlocked?

1388
01:12:56,943 --> 01:13:00,377
Ladies and gentlemen, always a good
idea to make sure a door is locked

1389
01:13:00,911 --> 01:13:02,070
before you boot it.

1390
01:13:02,143 --> 01:13:03,804
Are you gonna cut that out?
Yeah, sorry.

1391
01:13:03,877 --> 01:13:06,434
It was always locked. Clearly
my partner always knew that.

1392
01:13:06,510 --> 01:13:08,841
Oh, man. You know what's
gonna happen, right?

1393
01:13:08,943 --> 01:13:10,171
What?

1394
01:13:10,243 --> 01:13:13,608
She's gonna roll through, come from
church or the store or whatever.

1395
01:13:13,677 --> 01:13:15,109
And then she's gonna
see property damage

1396
01:13:15,177 --> 01:13:16,769
and what's gonna happen?
What's gonna happen?

1397
01:13:16,844 --> 01:13:18,105
We're gonna be the bad guys.

1398
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:25,341
Oh, shit! We got
a dead body, man.

1399
01:13:39,777 --> 01:13:41,038

You good?
Clear.

1404
01:14:12,377 --> 01:14:13,742
That is wrong. Dude,
I said it was clear.

1405
01:14:13,844 --> 01:14:16,174
All right. I'm just

Dude, that's not
fucking grandma.

Don't fucking play on them.
No, look.

That's what that means.

Yeah.

Oh, shit.

Let's get out of here.

Fuck. Sick motherfuckers, man.
Who would do shit like that?

No, I don't.

at one of the largest
narcotics seizures this year.

1448
01:17:34,277 --> 01:17:36,540
In addition to the drugs,
officials are telling us

1449
01:17:36,611 --> 01:17:38,601
there was a very
gruesome discovery.

1450
01:17:38,677 --> 01:17:41,838
An unknown number of bodies
showing evidence of torture.

1451
01:17:41,944 --> 01:17:44,240
A police official familiar
with the investigation

1452
01:17:44,310 --> 01:17:46,277
denied rumors
Mexican drug cartels

1453
01:17:46,344 --> 01:17:48,277
are responsible
for the murders.

want to roll to the Dodgers
game with us tonight.

you know what I'm saying?

you and I had?

You kept it G.

1470
01:19:14,278 --> 01:19:16,710

1475

Hey, I'm just telling you
what they're saying, man.

1476
01:19:29,844 --> 01:19:32,038
No, you know what, we
appreciate the info, man,

1477
01:19:32,111 --> 01:19:34,634
but this don't mean you get a
pass if we catch you slipping.

for no fucking pass.

you know what I'm saying?

All right, what you

Why do you have an investigation
report on here, dude?

I don't have an investigation
report on there.

It's your handwriting.
Don't be an idiot.

you drop it or something?

Fuck, no.
What do you mean, no?

1505
01:20:37,211 --> 01:20:39,837
We should get 'em when they go
to lunch at that Chinese place.

That Chinese place

Don't fucking rank out.

1537
01:21:39,677 --> 01:21:41,338
Fuck you!
Fuck you!

1538
01:21:41,411 --> 01:21:43,570
When the fuck have I ever
backed out from shit, huh?

1539
01:21:44,544 --> 01:21:46,307
Get that fucking
camera out of my face!

1540
01:21:46,378 --> 01:21:49,572
I'm saying, we just
can't fuck this shit up.

1541
01:21:50,644 --> 01:21:53,134
I don't give a fuck, man.
You know me.

1542
01:21:53,311 --> 01:21:54,971
I'll do the motherfucking time.

1543
01:21:55,044 --> 01:21:57,443
I just don't want the big
homies fucking whacking me.

1544
01:21:58,311 --> 01:22:00,675
Fucking whacking me
for fucking up.

1545
01:22:02,178 --> 01:22:04,576
We need a fucking plan. And
you fucking know it, homie.

1546
01:22:05,378 --> 01:22:08,606
Think about it.
That's all I'm saying.

1547
01:22:14,011 --> 01:22:15,841
Okay, head back.

1548
01:22:15,911 --> 01:22:18,378
I'll get some fucking big guns
from the Border Brothers.

1549
01:22:27,078 --> 01:22:29,102
Never fall asleep
in a room full of cops.

1550
01:22:31,411 --> 01:22:32,741
What...

1551
01:22:34,478 --> 01:22:36,671
Zavala, that shit
ain't even fucking funny!

1552
01:22:37,677 --> 01:22:39,076
Just 'cause you
won the fucking award

1553
01:22:39,144 --> 01:22:41,077
doesn't give you license
to be a fucking asshole!

1554
01:22:41,144 --> 01:22:42,610
You got shit
on your face, man.

1555
01:22:42,677 --> 01:22:46,111
Hey! Hey! What is this? What are
we, in the third fucking grade?

1556
01:22:46,178 --> 01:22:48,974
Keep it up, it's gonna earn
you a risk management case.

1557
01:22:49,044 --> 01:22:50,238
Give me this fucking camera.

1558
01:22:50,311 --> 01:22:51,403
He had
something...

1559
01:22:51,478 --> 01:22:53,206
I'm serious, man. This
department built you up,

1560
01:22:53,278 --> 01:22:55,074
they will
fucking tear you down.

1561
01:22:55,144 --> 01:22:56,133
You know it's fucking funny.

1562
01:22:56,211 --> 01:22:57,575
Laugh, you fucking idiot.

1563
01:22:57,644 --> 01:22:59,941
Who left their shaving
cream on the table?

1564
01:23:06,311 --> 01:23:07,709
How was Santa Barbara?

1565
01:23:10,478 --> 01:23:11,671
Awesome.

1566
01:23:16,345 --> 01:23:17,505
Janet's pregnant.

1567
01:23:17,711 --> 01:23:19,178
What?

1568
01:23:19,978 --> 01:23:21,945
Get out of here, bro.
Are you serious?

1569
01:23:22,345 --> 01:23:24,937
Already?
She's not even Mexican.

1570
01:23:25,677 --> 01:23:27,803
Yeah, she's going
for the ultrasound tomorrow,

1571
01:23:27,877 --> 01:23:29,071
but three of those
piss stick things...

1572
01:23:29,144 --> 01:23:30,270
Yeah, yeah, EPTs, yeah.

1573
01:23:30,345 --> 01:23:31,811
Positive, positive, positive.

1574
01:23:31,877 --> 01:23:33,276
Whoa! Dude.

1575
01:23:33,345 --> 01:23:35,971
Congrats, bro. Congrats.

1576
01:23:38,311 --> 01:23:39,777
That's when we
fucking graduate.

1577
01:23:39,844 --> 01:23:41,436
We fucking get
the upgrade right now.

1578
01:23:41,511 --> 01:23:43,909
Not fucking gonna be little
fucking <i>paisas</i> no fucking more.

1579
01:23:43,978 --> 01:23:45,808
- Right? That's what we're gonna do.
- I'm with you.

1580
01:23:46,144 --> 01:23:47,167
Okay?

1581
01:23:47,345 --> 01:23:49,868
They want to come into our fucking
hood and fucking talk shit to us?

1582
01:23:49,944 --> 01:23:51,740
You fucking do this shit right?
It's our fucking hood.

1583
01:23:51,811 --> 01:23:52,834
They don't
fucking disrespect us.

1584
01:23:52,911 --> 01:23:54,276
You guys want to
fucking collect?

1585
01:23:54,345 --> 01:23:55,539
You guys got to fucking put up.

1586
01:23:55,612 --> 01:23:57,476
This time we're gonna do it right.
Yeah, we're doing this.

1587
01:23:57,545 --> 01:23:59,512
Fucking guys
have some fucking balls.

1588
01:23:59,612 --> 01:24:02,772
Hey, trip though, E, after
we get these motherfuckers,

1589
01:24:03,545 --> 01:24:05,637
you know,

1590
01:24:05,711 --> 01:24:08,110
it's gonna be a little hot in
the hood, though. Right, La La?

1591
01:24:08,178 --> 01:24:09,838
We're gonna get the
fuck out of here after that.

1592
01:24:09,911 --> 01:24:12,572
I'm gonna fucking take you
guys to fucking Vegas.

1593
01:24:12,645 --> 01:24:15,168
You guys fucking do this shit
right, I'm gonna treat you right.

1594
01:24:15,345 --> 01:24:16,642
But if we don't
fucking do this,

1595
01:24:16,711 --> 01:24:19,543
we can never fucking come back,
that's the fucking thing.

1596
01:24:22,378 --> 01:24:23,572
Wouldn't it be
crazy if our kids

1597
01:24:23,645 --> 01:24:25,134
were pushing a black and
white together one day?

1598
01:24:25,511 --> 01:24:28,875
Screw that. I want my kid
to have an honest job.

1599
01:24:29,612 --> 01:24:30,771
Like a politician.

1600
01:24:36,244 --> 01:24:37,904
Whoa.
Oh, idiot.

1601
01:24:38,111 --> 01:24:39,271
Light 'em up.

Dude. Is it bad? Fuck.

1694

Wait, wait.
Let me see. Let me see.

1695
01:30:45,278 --> 01:30:46,643
Fuck, dude.

1696
01:30:49,144 --> 01:30:51,270
It's bad. It's bad.
You know what?

1697
01:30:51,345 --> 01:30:53,972
But I've seen guys
way worse make it.

1698
01:30:57,778 --> 01:30:59,176
Dude, what are you
fucking doing?

1699
01:30:59,244 --> 01:31:00,302
Don't fucking do that to me!

1700
01:31:00,378 --> 01:31:01,401
Stay right there!

1701
01:31:01,478 --> 01:31:04,934
Stay the fuck down! Stay down, I
need to put pressure on your wound.

die here, dude.

1704

You're not gonna die here.

1705
01:31:14,912 --> 01:31:17,378
You're not gonna die.
God loves cops.

1706
01:31:19,778 --> 01:31:22,109
I fucked up, dude.
I fucked up.

1707
01:31:23,812 --> 01:31:26,006
Don't tell Janet I fucked up.

1708
01:31:37,778 --> 01:31:39,301
I'm gonna
stay right here, bro.

1709
01:31:39,378 --> 01:31:42,709
I'm gonna stay right here, okay?
It's okay. It's okay.

1710
01:31:42,778 --> 01:31:44,506
Do it, dude. It's okay.

1711
01:31:45,945 --> 01:31:47,935
It's okay to do it
right now, bro.

1712
01:31:49,045 --> 01:31:50,807
I fucking love you, bro.

Uh...

1763
01:37:47,512 --> 01:37:49,308
He was my brother.

1764
01:39:15,245 --> 01:39:17,405
Yo, if your kid was a girl,
would you let her be a cop?

1765
01:39:18,379 --> 01:39:20,811
Bro, would I want my daughter
packing a burner

1766
01:39:20,878 --> 01:39:22,936
so she could protect herself
from the assholes of the world?

1767
01:39:23,012 --> 01:39:24,377
Hell, yeah.

1768
01:39:24,446 --> 01:39:26,606
I want to have a daughter, man.
That would be so cool.

1769
01:39:26,678 --> 01:39:28,043
Just don't let her date cops.

1770
01:39:28,112 --> 01:39:29,772
She's not dating anyone. Okay.

1771
01:39:29,845 --> 01:39:31,744
Ever.
 All right.

1772
01:39:34,112 --> 01:39:36,738
Did I ever tell you about the first
time I spent the night with Gabby?

1773
01:39:36,812 --> 01:39:38,643
I don't want to
hear that, dude.

1774
01:39:39,145 --> 01:39:40,736
Dude, I got a hella
big family, right?

1775
01:39:40,812 --> 01:39:42,541
See? Fuck, dude, I don't want
to hear that.

1776
01:39:42,613 --> 01:39:44,307
I got a hella big family, bro.

1777
01:39:44,379 --> 01:39:45,868
Someone's always
at my house, right?

1778
01:39:45,945 --> 01:39:47,912
But one time, Gabby's
parents bounced to Ensenada

1779
01:39:47,979 --> 01:39:49,173
and her brother
crashed at his girlfriend's.

1780
01:39:49,245 --> 01:39:51,109
So I spent the night at her house.
Hmm!

1781
01:39:51,312 --> 01:39:53,472
And this was gonna be
the night, dude. Hmm.

1782
01:39:53,546 --> 01:39:56,035
It was gonna be the night,
do you know what I'm saying?

1783
01:39:56,112 --> 01:39:57,477
No, what are you talking about?

1784
01:39:57,546 --> 01:39:58,876
Well, I'll tell you
what I'm talking about.

1785
01:39:58,945 --> 01:39:59,968
Okay, cool.

1786
01:40:00,045 --> 01:40:01,103
So we're in her
parents' bed, right?

1787
01:40:01,179 --> 01:40:02,168
Yeah.

1788
01:40:02,245 --> 01:40:03,905
And it's on.
It's about to go down.

1789
01:40:03,979 --> 01:40:05,241
I'm taking off
her <i>chones,</i> I'm...

1790
01:40:05,312 --> 01:40:06,540
<i>Chones?</i> What are...

1791
01:40:06,613 --> 01:40:07,874
Her skivvies, dawg,
come on, bro.

1792
01:40:07,945 --> 01:40:09,139
Oh, right.

1793
01:40:09,379 --> 01:40:12,005
And I'm like finally, right?
Fucking finally!

1794
01:40:12,346 --> 01:40:14,938
But then we hear this noise.
Dude, someone's in the pad.

1795
01:40:15,179 --> 01:40:18,476
So I hide underneath the bed. And
then I hear people coming up.

1796
01:40:18,778 --> 01:40:20,268
And it's her parents.

1797
01:40:20,878 --> 01:40:22,106
This is the second floor, bro.

1798
01:40:22,346 --> 01:40:23,404
What?

1799
01:40:23,479 --> 01:40:24,502
I got nowhere to go.

1800
01:40:24,579 --> 01:40:26,943
Homegirl's trying to distract them,
but it ain't happening, right?

1801
01:40:27,012 --> 01:40:28,377
And the footsteps grow louder.

1802
01:40:28,546 --> 01:40:30,842
Louder and louder.
Then the door opens...

1803
01:40:30,945 --> 01:40:34,106
Oh, my God, bro, I'm naked
underneath the bed.

1804
01:40:34,212 --> 01:40:36,145
And then all I can
see is little footsteps.

1805
01:40:36,212 --> 01:40:38,769
I see his hairy feet and I
see her nails all painted,

1806
01:40:38,845 --> 01:40:41,244
and they're right there yapping,
they're doing their thing.

1807
01:40:41,446 --> 01:40:44,504
And they crash. And this is the
part that I never told Gabby.

1808
01:40:45,279 --> 01:40:47,542
I hear a little smoochie
smooch, and I hear some shit,

1809
01:40:47,646 --> 01:40:49,476
and I'm like praying,
"Please, no."

1810
01:40:50,045 --> 01:40:51,740
And they did it, bro.
What?

1811
01:40:51,979 --> 01:40:53,002
They got down, dude!

1812
01:40:53,079 --> 01:40:54,068
What!

1813
01:40:54,479 --> 01:40:57,275
I'm talking Gabby's
parents fucking, dude!

1814
01:40:57,346 --> 01:40:59,108
All right, I got it.
No!

1815
01:40:59,512 --> 01:41:01,741
That shit was
so traumatic, man.

1816
01:41:01,912 --> 01:41:03,879
You must
have been a little uncomfortable

1817
01:41:03,945 --> 01:41:05,935
around her folks after that.

1818
01:41:06,646 --> 01:41:09,477
Yeah, bro, 'cause her
father is a freak.

1819
01:41:09,945 --> 01:41:11,809
Dude, I guess when
you've been married that long,

1820
01:41:11,878 --> 01:41:13,072
you gotta mix it
up a little bit.

1821
01:41:13,479 --> 01:41:15,275
I tried rolling like that
with Gabby and she was like,

1822
01:41:15,346 --> 01:41:17,835
"Hell, no, you're
not touching me there."

1823
01:41:20,179 --> 01:41:21,941
It makes me fucking
uncomfortable, man.

1824
01:41:22,012 --> 01:41:24,502
I know, I know, you know why?
'Cause you're a freak, too.

1825
01:41:24,579 --> 01:41:26,512
Don't go there, bro,
just don't go there.

1826
01:41:27,845 --> 01:41:31,142
I fucking can't breathe.
Holy shit.

1827
01:41:32,646 --> 01:41:34,135
<i>Any Newton unit...</i>
