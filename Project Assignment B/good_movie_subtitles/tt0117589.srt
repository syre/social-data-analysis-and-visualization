at the time she gave you up for adoption...

would probably never see you again.

Oh. I don't know anythin'

Some new mate.
They've been out a few times.

Anybody else

1452
01:48:55,412 --> 01:48:57,312
This is Jane,
my lovely assistant.

Oh, one of the few
pleasures in life, Monica.

around behind the camera.

1470

Oi. Mind your language,

- Yeah, especiallyin the winter.
- That's right.

1481
01:50:15,125 --> 01:50:18,891
- I wanted to give it a Mediterranean feel.
- It's a lovely kitchen.

- And this is-- Oops.
- Oh, it's a big lavatory.

1483
01:50:21,965 --> 01:50:25,628
- This is the downstairs toilet.
- That's handy, isn't it?
'Cause ifyou're in the garden--

1484
01:50:25,735 --> 01:50:28,101
Exactly.
It's really convenient.

1485
01:50:28,205 --> 01:50:32,164
- And I think the peach tones
make it quite tranquil.
- Yeah.

1486
01:50:32,275 --> 01:50:34,709
So, you know where it is
ifyou need it.

1487
01:50:34,811 --> 01:50:36,711
Now--
Excuse me,Jane.

1488
01:50:36,813 --> 01:50:40,112
- This is the garage.
- [ Laughs ] I thought it was the cupboard.

1489
01:50:40,217 --> 01:50:42,742
- Is that a new car?
- Yes. That's my car.

1490
01:50:42,853 --> 01:50:46,186
- What was the matterwith your other one?
- Nothing.

1491
01:50:46,289 --> 01:50:48,849
I'll showyou upstairs.

1492
01:50:52,929 --> 01:50:55,227
Ah. We'll start with this.

1493
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:00,561
- There's the tank.
- That's where I keep my towels and bed linen.

1494
01:51:00,670 --> 01:51:04,128
-Justyour ironing cupboard.
- Mm. It's not very capacious.

1495
01:51:04,241 --> 01:51:06,368
And this is Maurice's bathroom.

1496
01:51:06,476 --> 01:51:08,569
It's green.
Matches your tank.

1497
01:51:08,678 --> 01:51:12,444
- These all new carpets, are they, sweetheart?
- Oh, yes.

1498
01:51:13,717 --> 01:51:15,878
And this
is the masterbedroom.

1499
01:51:15,986 --> 01:51:18,648
Coo! It's more like
the bridal suite.

1500
01:51:18,755 --> 01:51:22,589
- It's beautiful.
- I've always wanted a four-poster.

1501
01:51:22,692 --> 01:51:26,492
- I can see Maurice thrashing about in there.
- It is a king-size.

1502
01:51:26,596 --> 01:51:28,564
It's like somethin'
out ofa fairy tale.

1503
01:51:28,665 --> 01:51:31,998
- I bet this cost a bob or two.
- It certainlywasn't cheap.

1504
01:51:32,102 --> 01:51:34,229
And here's another lavatory.

1505
01:51:34,337 --> 01:51:36,567
Oh, that bathroom's mine,
the en suite.

1506

1508
01:51:43,113 --> 01:51:45,240
Ah, you got everything, Monica.

01:52:05,435 --> 01:52:07,403
She's a dark horse,

1622
01:57:10,273 --> 01:57:12,332

1623
01:57:12,442 --> 01:57:16,845
- Doyou still live at home then?
- No chance.

1624
01:57:16,946 --> 01:57:19,244
So, doyou two

1625
01:57:19,349 --> 01:57:23,251

1626
01:57:26,222 --> 01:57:29,191
- Doyou chooseyour own

- Optometry.

1630
01:57:39,102 --> 01:57:41,468

- It's to do with the eye, isn't it?

1631
01:57:41,571 --> 01:57:43,539
- That's right.
- Testing.

1632
01:57:43,640 --> 01:57:47,736
- And you've given that all up now, haveyou?

1637
01:58:00,757 --> 01:58:03,385
Take no notice.

1638
01:58:03,493 --> 01:58:05,484
There's nothing wrong
with her head.

1639
01:58:05,595 --> 01:58:07,654
- Did you go to university?
- Yeah.

1640
01:58:07,764 --> 01:58:09,664
- Did you do a degree?
- Yes, I did.

1641
01:58:09,766 --> 01:58:13,031
- She just looks at our eyes, don'tyou?
- Yes, I do.

1642
01:58:13,136 --> 01:58:15,036
What for?

1643
01:58:15,138 --> 01:58:17,971
Oh, you can tell a lot about people
from lookin' at their eyes.

1644
01:58:18,074 --> 01:58:19,974
- That's true.
- Can you?

1645
