"I must shoot straighter than my enemy,
who is trying to kill me.

160
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,797
"I must shoot him before he shoots me.

161
00:11:46,067 --> 00:11:47,056
"I will.

162
00:11:47,702 --> 00:11:50,296
"Before God I swear this creed.

163
00:11:50,571 --> 00:11:54,098
"My rifle and myself are defenders
of my country.

164
00:11:54,442 --> 00:11:56,569
"We are the masters of our enemy.

165
00:11:56,878 --> 00:11:59,108
"We are the saviors of my life.

166
00:11:59,547 --> 00:12:00,673
"So be it...

167
00:12:00,748 --> 00:12:03,615
"...until there is no enemy, but peace.

168
00:12:03,951 --> 00:12:04,940
"Amen."

169
00:12:11,826 --> 00:12:12,815
At ease!

170
00:12:14,395 --> 00:12:15,885
Good night, ladies!

171
00:12:19,133 --> 00:12:20,191
Hit it!

172
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,774
This is not your daddy's shotgun,
Cowboy!

173
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:43,823
Move the rifle around your head,
not your head around the rifle!

174
00:12:50,731 --> 00:12:53,097
Four inches from your chest, Pyle!

175
00:12:53,367 --> 00:12:54,527
Four inches!

176
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,498
"This is my rifle! This is my gun!

177
00:12:58,606 --> 00:13:00,972
"This is for fighting!
This is for fun!

178
00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:03,769
"This is my rifle! This is my gun!

179
00:13:03,878 --> 00:13:06,506
"This is for fighting!
This is for fun! "

180
00:13:27,502 --> 00:13:28,901
You're bouncing!

181
00:13:45,052 --> 00:13:46,246
Ten fucking seconds!

182
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,814
It should take you ten seconds
to negotiate this obstacle!

183
00:13:51,392 --> 00:13:52,916
Quickly, move it out!

184
00:13:53,194 --> 00:13:56,595
No swinging-dick private
in this platoon's gonna graduate...

185
00:13:56,898 --> 00:14:00,925
...until they get this obstacle down
to less than ten fucking seconds!

186
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:26,459
Next two! Quickly!

187
00:14:26,827 --> 00:14:29,295
Get over that goddamn obstacle!
Move it!

188
00:14:33,501 --> 00:14:35,492
Private Joker, are you a killer?

189
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,065
Let me hear your war cry!

190
00:14:42,376 --> 00:14:44,367
Get your fat ass over there!

191
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:46,479
That's right, Private Pyle...

192
00:14:46,547 --> 00:14:49,948
...don't make any fucking effort
to get up to the top!

193
00:14:50,585 --> 00:14:55,045
If God wanted you up there,
He'd have miracled your ass up there!

194
00:14:55,923 --> 00:14:58,050
Get your fat ass up there!

195
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:00,218
What the hell's wrong with you?

196
00:15:00,328 --> 00:15:05,664
If there was some pussy up there,
you could get up there, couldn't you?

197
00:15:06,701 --> 00:15:10,603
Your ass looks like about 150 pounds
of chewed bubble gum, Pyle.

198
00:15:14,976 --> 00:15:16,603
One for the commandant!

199
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:19,678
One for the Corps!

200
00:15:21,048 --> 00:15:22,310
Get up there!

201
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,539
Pull!

202
00:15:24,685 --> 00:15:27,677
The Corps don't get theirs!
Get up there, Pyle!

203
00:15:28,489 --> 00:15:29,421
Pull!

204
00:15:29,757 --> 00:15:31,247
Pull, Pyle, pull!

205
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,193
One pull-up, Pyle! Come on, pull!

206
00:15:34,295 --> 00:15:37,696
You've got to be shitting me!
Get your ass up there!

207
00:15:38,232 --> 00:15:41,724
Do you mean to tell me you cannot do
one single pull-up?

208
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:46,005
You are a worthless piece of shit, Pyle!
Get out of my face!

209
00:15:46,574 --> 00:15:48,201
Get up there, Snowball.

210
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,307
Get up here, fatboy!

211
00:15:51,579 --> 00:15:54,343
Quickly! Move it up, Pyle! Move it up!

212
00:15:54,849 --> 00:15:59,081
You climb obstacles like old people fuck.
Do you know that, Private Pyle?

213
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,084
Get up here! You're too slow! Move it!

214
00:16:02,823 --> 00:16:06,418
Private Pyle, whatever you do,
don't fall down!

215
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,687
That would break my fucking heart!

216
00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:11,354
Quickly! Up and over! Up and over!

217
00:16:12,366 --> 00:16:15,858
What in the fuck are you waiting for,
Private Pyle?

218
00:16:16,237 --> 00:16:17,431
Get up and over!

219
00:16:17,505 --> 00:16:19,302
Move it, move it!

220
00:16:20,174 --> 00:16:21,937
Are you quitting on me?

221
00:16:22,843 --> 00:16:24,333
Well, are you?

222
00:16:25,046 --> 00:16:28,948
Then quit, you slimy, fucking,
walrus-looking piece of shit!

223
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,848
Get the fuck off of my obstacle!

224
00:16:32,186 --> 00:16:34,552
Get the fuck off of my obstacle!

225
00:16:35,122 --> 00:16:36,987
Now! Move it!

226
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:42,555
I'm going to rip your balls off so you
can't contaminate the rest of the world!

227
00:16:42,997 --> 00:16:45,488
I will motivate you, Private Pyle...

228
00:16:45,766 --> 00:16:49,793
...if it short-dicks every cannibal
on the Congo!

229
00:16:51,405 --> 00:16:53,566
Pick 'em up and set 'em down, Pyle!

230
00:16:54,175 --> 00:16:55,870
Quickly! Move it up!

231
00:16:56,711 --> 00:17:00,909
Were you born a fat, slimy scumbag,
you piece of shit, Private Pyle?

232
00:17:01,048 --> 00:17:03,243
Or did you have to work on it?

233
00:17:03,517 --> 00:17:04,677
Move it up!

234
00:17:04,752 --> 00:17:07,118
Quickly! Hustle up!

235
00:17:07,254 --> 00:17:11,748
The fucking war will be over by the time
we get out there, Private Pyle!

236
00:17:14,095 --> 00:17:17,997
Are you going to fucking die?
Are you going to die on me?

237
00:17:18,265 --> 00:17:19,459
Do it now!

238
00:17:20,267 --> 00:17:21,393
Move it up!

239
00:17:21,469 --> 00:17:23,801
Hustle it up! Quickly!

240
00:17:24,972 --> 00:17:26,439
Feel dizzy?

241
00:17:27,675 --> 00:17:29,040
Faint?

242
00:17:30,878 --> 00:17:34,780
Jesus H. Christ,
I think you've got a hard-on!

243
00:17:37,451 --> 00:17:41,080
Quickly, ladies! Assholes and elbows!
Move it out!

244
00:17:41,455 --> 00:17:42,683
Get up!

245
00:18:06,947 --> 00:18:09,074
Reveille! Reveille!

246
00:18:09,483 --> 00:18:11,417
Drop your cocks and grab your socks!

247
00:18:11,485 --> 00:18:14,283
Today is Sunday!
Divine worship is 0800.

248
00:18:14,622 --> 00:18:17,022
Get your bunks made
and your uniforms on.

249
00:18:17,191 --> 00:18:19,489
Police call in two minutes.

250
00:18:20,327 --> 00:18:22,295
Private Cowboy, Private Joker.

251
00:18:24,298 --> 00:18:27,267
Finish your bunks, then you two turds
clean the head.

252
00:18:28,402 --> 00:18:30,836
I want that head so sanitary...

253
00:18:30,905 --> 00:18:34,773
...that the Virgin Mary could go
in there and take a dump!

254
00:18:35,976 --> 00:18:38,171
Do you believe in the Virgin Mary?

255
00:18:38,646 --> 00:18:39,874
Sir, no, sir!

256
00:18:44,018 --> 00:18:46,987
Private Joker, I don't believe
I heard you correctly!

257
00:18:47,555 --> 00:18:49,716
Sir, the private said "No, sir," sir!

258
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:52,486
You little maggot!
You make me want to vomit!

259
00:18:53,227 --> 00:18:57,357
You communist heathen, sound off
that you love the Virgin Mary...

260
00:18:57,631 --> 00:18:59,656
...or I'll stomp your guts out!

261
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,400
You love the Virgin Mary, don't you?

262
00:19:02,503 --> 00:19:03,868
Negative, sir!

263
00:19:03,938 --> 00:19:06,668
Are you trying to offend me?

264
00:19:08,042 --> 00:19:11,170
Sir, the private believes that
any answer he gives will be wrong!

265
00:19:11,245 --> 00:19:15,147
And that you will beat him harder
if he reverses himself, sir!

266
00:19:15,382 --> 00:19:17,077
Who's your squad leader?

267
00:19:17,151 --> 00:19:20,086
The private's squad leader
is Private Snowball, sir!

268
00:19:22,256 --> 00:19:24,850
Private Snowball reporting, sir!

269
00:19:24,925 --> 00:19:28,759
You're fired! Private Joker is promoted
to squad leader!

270
00:19:30,097 --> 00:19:31,564
Disappear, scumbag!

271
00:19:34,401 --> 00:19:35,993
Reporting as ordered, sir!

272
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:40,632
From now on Private Joker is your new
squad leader and you bunk with him.

273
00:19:40,975 --> 00:19:42,135
He'll teach you!

274
00:19:42,209 --> 00:19:44,006
He'll teach you how to pee!

275
00:19:44,812 --> 00:19:48,771
Private Joker is ignorant
but he's got guts, and guts is enough.

276
00:19:49,049 --> 00:19:50,744
Now you ladies carry on.

277
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,151
The bolt. The bolt goes in the receiver.

278
00:20:06,634 --> 00:20:08,124
Operating rod handle.

279
00:20:08,802 --> 00:20:10,429
Operating rod guide.

280
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:14,239
And the left one over the right.

281
00:20:15,476 --> 00:20:17,171
Right one over the left.

282
00:20:19,747 --> 00:20:21,476
Left one over the right.

283
00:20:22,249 --> 00:20:24,012
Right one over the left.

284
00:20:28,322 --> 00:20:30,313
Just throw your other leg over.

285
00:20:39,199 --> 00:20:41,895
Pull the next one over
and you're home free.

286
00:20:50,611 --> 00:20:52,078
Just throw it over.

287
00:20:59,887 --> 00:21:02,287
That'a boy. Just set it down.

288
00:21:12,199 --> 00:21:13,928
Congratulations, Leonard.

289
00:21:14,635 --> 00:21:15,761
You did it.

290
00:21:17,171 --> 00:21:19,605
Fold the blanket and sheet back together.

291
00:21:20,474 --> 00:21:22,066
Make a four-inch fold.

292
00:21:23,978 --> 00:21:24,967
Got it?

293
00:21:25,512 --> 00:21:26,604
You do it.

294
00:21:29,316 --> 00:21:31,113
Right shoulder, hut!

295
00:21:37,024 --> 00:21:38,457
Port, hut!

296
00:21:43,263 --> 00:21:44,924
Order, hut!

297
00:22:14,995 --> 00:22:16,690
Square these weapons away.

298
00:22:22,436 --> 00:22:24,631
The deadliest weapon in the world...

299
00:22:25,205 --> 00:22:27,935
...is a Marine, and his rifle.

300
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:32,403
It is your killer instinct
that must be harnessed...

301
00:22:32,946 --> 00:22:35,779
...if you expect to survive in combat.

302
00:22:37,184 --> 00:22:38,412
Your rifle...

303
00:22:38,619 --> 00:22:40,109
...is only a tool.

304
00:22:40,921 --> 00:22:42,946
It is a hard heart that kills.

305
00:22:44,258 --> 00:22:48,456
If your killer instincts
are not clean and strong...

306
00:22:49,263 --> 00:22:51,788
...you will hesitate
at the moment of truth.

307
00:22:52,499 --> 00:22:54,160
You will not kill.

308
00:22:54,635 --> 00:22:56,535
You will become dead Marines.

309
00:22:57,171 --> 00:22:59,969
And then you will be in a world of shit.

310
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:03,836
Because Marines are not allowed...

311
00:23:03,944 --> 00:23:05,844
...to die without permission!

312
00:23:06,346 --> 00:23:08,075
Do you maggots understand?

313
00:23:11,285 --> 00:23:14,015
"I love working for Uncle Sam !

314
00:23:17,191 --> 00:23:19,853
"Lets me know just who I am !

315
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:26,122
"One, two, three, four!
United States Marine Corps!

316
00:23:29,069 --> 00:23:32,095
"One, two, three, four!
I love the Marine Corps!

317
00:23:35,075 --> 00:23:36,702
"My Corps! Your Corps!

318
00:23:38,078 --> 00:23:40,342
"Our Corps! Marine Corps!

319
00:23:41,181 --> 00:23:44,014
"I don't know, but I've been told...

320
00:23:47,221 --> 00:23:49,883
"...Eskimo pussy is mighty cold!

321
00:23:53,193 --> 00:23:55,423
"Mmm, good! Feels good!

322
00:23:56,196 --> 00:23:58,323
"Is good! Real good!

323
00:23:59,199 --> 00:24:01,292
"Tastes good! Mighty good!

324
00:24:02,202 --> 00:24:04,329
"Good for you! Good for me! "

325
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:08,697
Trim 'em !

326
00:24:12,146 --> 00:24:13,340
Toe-jam !

327
00:24:16,817 --> 00:24:18,182
Pop that blister!

328
00:24:27,361 --> 00:24:29,022
Jesus H. Christ!

329
00:24:32,566 --> 00:24:35,660
-Why is your footlocker unlocked?
-Sir, I don't know, sir!

330
00:24:35,736 --> 00:24:39,228
If there is one thing
in this world I hate...

331
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:42,998
...it is an unlocked footlocker!
You know that, right?

332
00:24:43,877 --> 00:24:48,280
Without dickheads like you,
there'd be no thievery in the world!

333
00:24:49,283 --> 00:24:50,272
Get down!

334
00:24:54,855 --> 00:24:57,619
Now let's just see
if there's anything missing!

335
00:25:01,261 --> 00:25:02,660
Holy Jesus!

336
00:25:03,664 --> 00:25:05,097
What is that?

337
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:07,533
What the fuck is that?

338
00:25:08,368 --> 00:25:10,165
What is that, Private Pyle?

339
00:25:10,237 --> 00:25:12,034
Sir, a jelly doughnut, sir!

340
00:25:14,174 --> 00:25:16,870
-Where did you get it?
-From the mess hall, sir!

341
00:25:17,244 --> 00:25:19,542
Is chow allowed in the barracks, Pyle?

342
00:25:20,547 --> 00:25:23,607
Are you allowed to eat
jelly doughnuts, Private?

343
00:25:24,551 --> 00:25:27,884
-Why not, Private?
-Sir, because I'm too heavy, sir!

344
00:25:28,021 --> 00:25:32,014
Because you are a disgusting fatbody,
Private Pyle!

345
00:25:33,227 --> 00:25:36,856
Then why did you hide a jelly doughnut
in your footlocker?

346
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,898
Because I was hungry, sir!

347
00:25:39,099 --> 00:25:41,067
Because you were hungry?

348
00:25:45,606 --> 00:25:47,130
Private Pyle...

349
00:25:47,341 --> 00:25:51,437
...has dishonored himself
and dishonored the platoon!

350
00:25:52,412 --> 00:25:55,711
I have tried to help him,
but I have failed!

351
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:00,443
I have failed because
you have not helped me!

352
00:26:01,588 --> 00:26:02,919
You people...

353
00:26:03,023 --> 00:26:07,687
...have not given Private Pyle
the proper motivation!

354
00:26:09,763 --> 00:26:13,426
From now on,
whenever Private Pyle fucks up...

355
00:26:13,901 --> 00:26:15,892
...I will not punish him.

356
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,500
I will punish all of you!

357
00:26:18,939 --> 00:26:21,100
And the way I see it, ladies...

358
00:26:21,208 --> 00:26:24,041
...you owe me for one jelly doughnut!

359
00:26:24,478 --> 00:26:26,139
Get on your faces!

360
00:26:28,582 --> 00:26:29,947
Open your mouth!

361
00:26:30,484 --> 00:26:32,577
They're paying for it, you eat it!

362
00:26:33,153 --> 00:26:35,383
Ready, exercise!

363
00:26:35,656 --> 00:26:38,318
"One, two, three, four!

364
00:26:38,425 --> 00:26:40,893
"I love the Marine Corps! "

365
00:27:00,147 --> 00:27:02,172
You really look like shit today.

366
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,221
Everybody hates me now.

367
00:27:18,832 --> 00:27:19,856
Even you.

368
00:27:23,704 --> 00:27:25,433
Nobody hates you, Leonard.

369
00:27:26,606 --> 00:27:30,201
You just keep making mistakes,
getting everybody in trouble.

370
00:27:34,181 --> 00:27:35,910
I can't do anything right.

371
00:27:39,286 --> 00:27:40,446
I need help.

372
00:27:44,624 --> 00:27:46,216
I'm trying to help you.

373
00:27:48,795 --> 00:27:50,194
I'm really trying.

374
00:27:53,033 --> 00:27:54,523
Tuck your shirt in.

375
00:29:51,685 --> 00:29:52,674
Do it.

376
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:06,230
Remember, it's just a bad dream, fatboy.

377
00:30:54,648 --> 00:30:57,208
Do we love our beloved Corps, ladies?

378
00:30:57,684 --> 00:30:59,652
Semper fi, do or die!

379
00:30:59,719 --> 00:31:02,017
Gung ho, gung ho!

380
00:31:02,222 --> 00:31:04,383
What makes the grass grow?

381
00:31:04,658 --> 00:31:06,455
Blood, blood, blood.

382
00:31:06,693 --> 00:31:09,287
What do we do for a living, ladies?

383
00:31:09,629 --> 00:31:11,290
Kill, kill, kill!

384
00:31:11,464 --> 00:31:12,988
I can't hear you!

385
00:31:13,166 --> 00:31:14,895
Kill, kill, kill!

386
00:31:15,101 --> 00:31:17,865
Bullshit! I still can't hear you!

387
00:31:18,305 --> 00:31:19,966
Kill, kill, kill!

388
00:31:20,874 --> 00:31:23,707
Do any of you know
who Charles Whitman was?

389
00:31:26,213 --> 00:31:28,113
None of you dumbasses knows?

390
00:31:31,151 --> 00:31:35,520
Sir, he shot all those people
from that tower in Austin, Texas, sir!

391
00:31:35,789 --> 00:31:38,280
Charles Whitman killed 12 people...

392
00:31:38,358 --> 00:31:42,317
...from a 28-story observation tower
at the University of Texas...

393
00:31:43,129 --> 00:31:45,654
...from distances of up to 400 yards.

394
00:31:46,733 --> 00:31:49,031
Anybody know
who Lee Harvey Oswald was?

395
00:31:51,905 --> 00:31:53,668
Sir, he shot Kennedy, sir!

396
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,502
And do you know how far away he was?

397
00:31:56,843 --> 00:32:00,404
Sir, it was far! From that
book suppository building, sir!

398
00:32:01,448 --> 00:32:02,676
Knock it off!

399
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,108
250 feet!

400
00:32:05,652 --> 00:32:09,247
He was 250 feet away and shooting
at a moving target.

401
00:32:10,023 --> 00:32:11,581
He got off three rounds...

402
00:32:11,658 --> 00:32:14,991
...with an Italian bolt-action rifle
in six seconds...

403
00:32:15,729 --> 00:32:18,357
...and scored two hits,
including a head shot!

404
00:32:19,199 --> 00:32:20,564
Do any of you know where...

405
00:32:20,634 --> 00:32:22,966
...these individuals learned to shoot?

406
00:32:26,206 --> 00:32:28,071
Sir, in the Marines, sir!

407
00:32:28,241 --> 00:32:32,075
In the Marines! Outstanding!
Those individuals...

408
00:32:32,178 --> 00:32:35,443
...showed what one motivated Marine
and his rifle can do!

409
00:32:36,216 --> 00:32:38,707
Before you ladies leave my island...

410
00:32:38,985 --> 00:32:41,579
...you will all be able
to do the same thing!

411
00:32:42,422 --> 00:32:46,415
"Happy birthday to you

412
00:32:51,097 --> 00:32:55,830
"Happy birthday, dear Jesus"

413
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:03,433
Today...

414
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:05,575
...is Christmas!

415
00:33:06,579 --> 00:33:10,413
There will be a magic show at 0930!

416
00:33:12,152 --> 00:33:15,144
Chaplain Charlie will tell you...

417
00:33:15,889 --> 00:33:19,450
...about how the free world
will conquer Communism...

418
00:33:20,593 --> 00:33:24,051
...with the aid of God and a few Marines!

419
00:33:25,832 --> 00:33:28,824
God has a hard-on for Marines...

420
00:33:29,903 --> 00:33:33,532
...because we kill everything we see!

421
00:33:34,741 --> 00:33:36,368
He plays His games...

422
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,777
...we play ours!

423
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:44,207
To show our appreciation
for so much power...

424
00:33:45,185 --> 00:33:47,380
...we keep heaven packed...

425
00:33:47,954 --> 00:33:49,819
...with fresh souls!

426
00:33:51,191 --> 00:33:54,627
God was here before the Marine Corps!

427
00:33:55,462 --> 00:33:57,930
So you can give your heart to Jesus...

428
00:33:58,631 --> 00:34:01,964
...but your ass belongs to the Corps!

429
00:34:02,569 --> 00:34:04,366
Do you ladies understand?

430
00:34:05,972 --> 00:34:07,564
I can't hear you!

431
00:34:15,415 --> 00:34:17,883
It's been swabbed and brushed.

432
00:34:20,086 --> 00:34:21,314
Everything...

433
00:34:22,756 --> 00:34:23,916
...is clean.

434
00:34:28,528 --> 00:34:29,620
Beautiful.

435
00:34:31,798 --> 00:34:34,028
So that it slides perfectly.

436
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:37,959
Nice.

437
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,964
Everything cleaned...

438
00:34:43,476 --> 00:34:44,465
...oiled.

439
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,575
So that your action is beautiful.

440
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,653
Smooth, Charlene.

441
00:35:18,711 --> 00:35:20,611
Leonard talks to his rifle.

442
00:35:32,492 --> 00:35:34,983
I don't think Leonard can hack it anymore.

443
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,764
I think Leonard's a Section 8.

444
00:35:43,136 --> 00:35:44,626
It don't surprise me.

445
00:35:55,648 --> 00:35:58,242
I want to slip my tubesteak
into your sister.

446
00:36:01,988 --> 00:36:03,819
What will you take in trade?

447
00:36:06,392 --> 00:36:07,950
What do you got?

448
00:36:22,942 --> 00:36:24,170
Outstanding!

449
00:36:24,677 --> 00:36:27,339
We've finally found something you do well!

450
00:36:32,852 --> 00:36:34,843
What is your 6th general order?

451
00:36:34,921 --> 00:36:38,948
Sir, to receive, obey and pass on
to the sentry who relieves me...

452
00:36:40,026 --> 00:36:41,516
...all orders....

453
00:36:41,995 --> 00:36:43,690
Sir, the 6th general....

454
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:46,362
The private does not know, sir!

455
00:36:46,466 --> 00:36:49,765
You slimy scumbag,
get down and give me 25!

456
00:36:56,309 --> 00:36:58,607
How many counts in that movement?

457
00:36:58,778 --> 00:36:59,972
Sir, four, sir!

458
00:37:00,046 --> 00:37:01,946
Why look down in the chamber?

459
00:37:02,115 --> 00:37:06,245
Sir, to be sure the inspecting officer
is not given a loaded weapon, sir!

460
00:37:06,419 --> 00:37:07,681
What's your 5th general order?

461
00:37:07,754 --> 00:37:11,781
Sir, to quit my post
only when properly relieved, sir!

462
00:37:12,492 --> 00:37:14,221
What's this weapon's name?

463
00:37:14,394 --> 00:37:17,227
Sir, the private's weapon's name
is Charlene, sir!

464
00:37:17,397 --> 00:37:20,230
Private, you are definitely
born again hard.

465
00:37:20,366 --> 00:37:23,961
I may even let you serve as a rifleman
in my beloved Corps.

00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,854
<i>You are part of a brotherhood.</i>

484
00:38:50,923 --> 00:38:54,518
<i>From now on, until the day you die...</i>

485
00:38:55,361 --> 00:38:56,988
<i>...wherever you are...</i>

486
00:38:57,664 --> 00:38:59,996
<i>...every Marine is your brother.</i>

487
00:39:02,268 --> 00:39:04,600
<i>Most of you will go to Vietnam.</i>

488
00:39:05,605 --> 00:39:07,937
<i>Some of you will not come back.</i>

489
00:39:08,941 --> 00:39:10,670
<i>But always remember this.:</i>

490
00:39:11,344 --> 00:39:12,743
<i>Marines die.</i>

491
00:39:13,312 --> 00:39:15,109
<i>That's what we're here for!</i>

492
00:39:16,015 --> 00:39:18,506
<i>But the Marine Corps lives forever.</i>

493
00:39:19,352 --> 00:39:23,015
<i>And that means you live forever!</i>

494
00:39:29,762 --> 00:39:31,423
0300, Infantry.

495
00:39:33,399 --> 00:39:35,128
0300, Infantry.

496
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:40,398
1800, Engineers.
You go out and find mines.

497
00:39:40,807 --> 00:39:41,796
Cowboy!

498
00:39:42,809 --> 00:39:44,572
0300, Infantry.

499
00:39:46,446 --> 00:39:48,073
0300, Infantry.

500
00:39:48,347 --> 00:39:49,371
Joker!

501
00:39:50,149 --> 00:39:51,241
4212...

502
00:39:51,317 --> 00:39:53,217
...Basic Military Journalism.

503
00:39:53,453 --> 00:39:55,114
You must be shitting me!

504
00:39:55,488 --> 00:39:57,251
You think you're Mickey Spillane?

505
00:39:57,323 --> 00:39:59,518
You think you're some kind
of fucking writer?

506
00:39:59,592 --> 00:40:02,152
Sir, I wrote for
my high-school newspaper, sir!

507
00:40:02,228 --> 00:40:05,823
Christ, you're not a writer,
you're a killer!

508
00:40:05,932 --> 00:40:07,297
A killer, yes, sir!

509
00:40:07,366 --> 00:40:08,492
Gomer Pyle!

510
00:40:11,904 --> 00:40:15,806
You forget your fucking name?
0300, Infantry. You made it.

511
00:40:22,348 --> 00:40:24,248
<i>Our last night on the island.</i>

512
00:40:25,384 --> 00:40:26,783
<i>I draw fire watch.</i>

513
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:32,777
Hi, Joker.

514
00:41:55,808 --> 00:41:57,139
Are those...

515
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:58,607
...live rounds?

516
00:42:05,384 --> 00:42:08,376
7.62 millimeter.

517
00:42:10,823 --> 00:42:13,053
Full metal jacket.

518
00:42:25,037 --> 00:42:28,200
Leonard, if Hartman comes in here
and catches us...

519
00:42:29,942 --> 00:42:32,206
...we'll both be in a world of shit.

520
00:42:36,282 --> 00:42:37,510
I am...

521
00:42:39,852 --> 00:42:41,319
...in a world...

522
00:42:43,823 --> 00:42:45,188
...of shit!

523
00:42:49,562 --> 00:42:51,553
Left shoulder, hut!

524
00:42:53,399 --> 00:42:55,299
Right shoulder, hut!

525
00:42:57,970 --> 00:42:59,301
Lock and load.

526
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:05,136
Order, hut!

527
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,807
"This is my rifle!

528
00:43:10,149 --> 00:43:12,743
"There are many like it,
but this one is mine."

529
00:43:17,623 --> 00:43:19,420
Get back in your bunks!

530
00:43:20,293 --> 00:43:22,386
What is this Mickey Mouse shit?

531
00:43:23,329 --> 00:43:27,390
What in the name of Jesus H. Christ
are you animals doing in my head?

532
00:43:27,767 --> 00:43:30,759
Why is Pyle out of his bunk
after lights out?

533
00:43:31,203 --> 00:43:33,865
Why is Pyle holding that weapon?

534
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,403
Why aren't you stomping
Private Pyle's guts out?

535
00:43:37,877 --> 00:43:40,846
Sir, it is the private's duty
to inform you...

536
00:43:40,947 --> 00:43:44,940
...that Private Pyle has a full magazine
and has locked and loaded, sir!

537
00:43:53,459 --> 00:43:56,223
Now listen to me, Private Pyle...

538
00:43:57,330 --> 00:43:59,093
...and listen good.

539
00:44:00,566 --> 00:44:02,090
I want that weapon...

540
00:44:03,035 --> 00:44:04,559
...and I want it now!

541
00:44:06,539 --> 00:44:09,406
Place that rifle on the deck
at your feet...

542
00:44:10,643 --> 00:44:12,577
...and step back away from it.

543
00:44:20,853 --> 00:44:24,152
What is your major malfunction,
numb-nuts?

544
00:44:24,523 --> 00:44:28,653
Didn't Mommy and Daddy show you
enough attention when you were a child?

545
00:44:54,353 --> 00:44:55,615
Easy, Leonard.

546
00:44:59,959 --> 00:45:01,358
Go easy, man.

547
00:46:29,348 --> 00:46:30,679
Hey, baby.

548
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:33,377
You got girlfriend Vietnam?

549
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:35,978
Not just this minute.

550
00:46:37,256 --> 00:46:39,986
Well, baby, me so horny.

551
00:46:40,759 --> 00:46:42,192
Me so horny.

552
00:46:43,028 --> 00:46:44,859
Me love you long time.

553
00:46:46,132 --> 00:46:47,429
You party?

554
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,058
Yeah, we might party.

555
00:46:49,902 --> 00:46:51,870
-How much?
-$15.

556
00:46:52,771 --> 00:46:54,170
$15 for both of us?

557
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,174
No. Each you $15.

558
00:46:57,009 --> 00:46:58,909
Me love you long time.

559
00:46:59,111 --> 00:47:00,510
Me so horny.

560
00:47:01,947 --> 00:47:03,574
$15 too beaucoup.

561
00:47:04,416 --> 00:47:05,610
$5 each.

562
00:47:05,684 --> 00:47:07,151
Me suckee-suckee.

563
00:47:07,753 --> 00:47:09,516
Me love you too much.

564
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:14,554
$5 is all my mom allows me to spend.

565
00:47:15,294 --> 00:47:17,455
Okay! $10 each.

566
00:47:18,464 --> 00:47:20,091
What do we get for $10?

567
00:47:21,033 --> 00:47:23,160
Everything you want.

568
00:47:24,003 --> 00:47:25,163
Everything?

569
00:47:28,207 --> 00:47:32,075
Buddy, you feel like spending some
of your hard-earned money?

570
00:47:34,713 --> 00:47:38,205
Half of these gook whores are officers
in the Viet Cong.

571
00:47:39,051 --> 00:47:40,712
The other half have TB.

572
00:47:41,654 --> 00:47:44,054
Be sure you only fuck
the ones who cough.

573
00:48:32,871 --> 00:48:35,339
That sucker really had some moves on him.

574
00:48:39,845 --> 00:48:42,541
You know what pisses me off
about these people?

575
00:48:44,483 --> 00:48:47,646
We're helping them
and they shit all over us.

576
00:48:48,087 --> 00:48:49,816
I just can't feature that.

577
00:48:50,222 --> 00:48:52,816
Don't take it too hard.
It's just business.

578
00:48:55,561 --> 00:48:58,291
I hate Da Nang.
I want to go out into the field.

579
00:48:59,131 --> 00:49:03,534
I'm here three months and all I do is take
handshake shots at award ceremonies.

580
00:49:04,069 --> 00:49:07,197
You'd get wasted the first day
and it would be my fault.

581
00:49:07,339 --> 00:49:09,637
A high-school girl could do my job.

582
00:49:09,808 --> 00:49:11,639
I want to get into the shit.

583
00:49:11,744 --> 00:49:13,473
I want some trigger time.

584
00:49:15,481 --> 00:49:19,918
If you get killed, your mom will find me
and beat the shit out of me.

585
00:49:20,986 --> 00:49:22,385
That's a negative.

586
00:49:26,025 --> 00:49:29,722
Let's keep it short and sweet.
Anybody got anything new?

587
00:49:32,431 --> 00:49:35,730
Rumor has it that the Tet ceasefire
will be cancelled.

588
00:49:36,435 --> 00:49:38,096
Rear echelon paranoia.

589
00:49:38,404 --> 00:49:42,363
Intelligence says Charlie might try
something big during Tet.

590
00:49:42,574 --> 00:49:45,065
They say the same thing every year.

591
00:49:45,277 --> 00:49:47,142
There's a lot of talk about it.

592
00:49:47,212 --> 00:49:49,112
Don't lose any sleep over it.

593
00:49:49,248 --> 00:49:53,082
The Tet holiday is like July Fourth,
Christmas and New Year in one.

594
00:49:53,585 --> 00:49:57,043
Every zipperhead in the North and South,
will bang gongs...

595
00:49:57,222 --> 00:49:59,190
...and bark at the moon.

596
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:03,785
Ann-Margret and entourage
are due next week.

597
00:50:03,929 --> 00:50:07,023
I want someone to stick
with her for a few days.

598
00:50:07,099 --> 00:50:08,726
Rafterman, you take it.

599
00:50:09,968 --> 00:50:11,833
Get some good low-angle stuff.

600
00:50:11,904 --> 00:50:15,772
Don't be obvious, but I want to see fur
and early morning dew.

601
00:50:17,042 --> 00:50:22,105
"Diplomats in Dungarees. Marine
engineers rebuild Dong Phuc villages...."

602
00:50:22,348 --> 00:50:25,681
Chili, if we move Vietnamese,
they are evacuees.

603
00:50:25,918 --> 00:50:28,853
If they come to us to be evacuated,
they are refugees.

604
00:50:28,921 --> 00:50:30,821
I'll make a note of it, sir.

605
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:34,218
"N.V.A. Soldier Deserts
After Reading Pamphlets."

606
00:50:34,293 --> 00:50:38,286
"An N.V.A. regular, who realized
his side would lose...

607
00:50:38,397 --> 00:50:40,957
"...deserted after reading
Open Arms pamphlets."

608
00:50:41,033 --> 00:50:44,366
That's good, Dave.
But why say, "N.V.A. regular"?

609
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:46,203
Is there an irregular?

610
00:50:46,271 --> 00:50:48,262
How about N.V.A. soldier?

611
00:50:48,607 --> 00:50:49,767
I'll fix it.

612
00:50:50,142 --> 00:50:55,307
"The Lawrence Welk Show" will be on TV
in two weeks. Dave, do 100 words on it.

613
00:50:56,382 --> 00:50:58,111
"Not While We're Eating."

614
00:50:58,283 --> 00:51:02,913
"N.V.A. learned not to interrupt meals of
Marines on a search-and-destroy mission."

615
00:51:03,389 --> 00:51:07,291
We have a new directive from M.A.F.
on search and destroy.

616
00:51:07,793 --> 00:51:12,526
Substitute "sweep and clear"
in place of "search and destroy."

617
00:51:12,598 --> 00:51:13,587
Got it?

618
00:51:13,766 --> 00:51:15,495
Got it. Very catchy.

619
00:51:16,468 --> 00:51:18,459
And, Joker, where's the weenie?

620
00:51:21,006 --> 00:51:24,498
The kill. The grunts
must have hit something.

621
00:51:25,244 --> 00:51:26,734
Didn't see them.

622
00:51:27,479 --> 00:51:30,448
I've told you,
we run two basic stories here.

623
00:51:31,083 --> 00:51:34,541
Grunts who buy toothbrushes
and deodorant for gooks:

624
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,654
"Winning of Hearts And Minds."

625
00:51:37,122 --> 00:51:40,319
And combat action resulting in a kill:
"Winning the War."

626
00:51:40,893 --> 00:51:44,090
You must have seen blood trails,
drag marks?

627
00:51:44,897 --> 00:51:46,558
It was raining, sir.

628
00:51:46,932 --> 00:51:49,628
That's why God passed
the law of probability.

629
00:51:49,935 --> 00:51:52,768
Rewrite it with a happy ending,
say, one kill.

630
00:51:53,172 --> 00:51:55,402
A sapper or an officer. Which?

631
00:51:55,874 --> 00:51:57,273
Whichever you say.

632
00:51:57,676 --> 00:52:00,076
Grunts like reading about dead officers.

633
00:52:00,245 --> 00:52:02,611
Okay, an officer. How about a general?

634
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:08,251
You'd like our guys to read
the paper and feel bad?

635
00:52:08,954 --> 00:52:12,321
In case you didn't know,
this is not a popular war.

636
00:52:12,391 --> 00:52:14,859
Our job is to report the news that the...

637
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,451
..."why-are-we-here"
civilian newsmen ignore.

638
00:52:18,363 --> 00:52:21,093
Maybe you should go out
on some ops yourself.

639
00:52:22,201 --> 00:52:25,193
You could find more blood trails
and drag marks.

640
00:52:26,472 --> 00:52:30,135
I've had my ass in the grass.
Can't say I liked it much.

641
00:52:30,809 --> 00:52:33,300
Lots of bugs and too dangerous.

642
00:52:33,979 --> 00:52:36,846
My present duties keep me where I belong:

643
00:52:37,182 --> 00:52:38,877
In the rear with the gear.

644
00:52:47,092 --> 00:52:49,026
<i>Tet. The Year of the Monkey.</i>

645
00:52:50,095 --> 00:52:52,256
<i>Vietnamese Lunar New Year's Eve.</i>

646
00:52:53,398 --> 00:52:57,562
<i>Down in Dogpatch, the gooks are
shooting off fireworks to celebrate.</i>

647
00:53:07,179 --> 00:53:09,977
I am fucking bored to death, man.

648
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:13,441
I have to get back in the shit.

649
00:53:14,052 --> 00:53:16,646
I ain't heard a shot fired
in anger in weeks.

650
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:21,926
Joker's so tough, he'd eat the boogers
out of a dead man's nose...

651
00:53:23,161 --> 00:53:24,822
...then ask for seconds.

652
00:53:25,564 --> 00:53:27,031
Listen up, pilgrim.

653
00:53:27,799 --> 00:53:31,792
A day without blood is like
a day without sunshine!

654
00:53:34,039 --> 00:53:37,668
Joker thinks the bad bush is
between old mama-san's legs.

655
00:53:38,176 --> 00:53:40,201
He's never been in the shit.

656
00:53:40,379 --> 00:53:42,870
Hard to talk about. Like on Hastings.

657
00:53:43,181 --> 00:53:46,947
You weren't on Operation Hastings.
You weren't even in country.

658
00:53:47,052 --> 00:53:51,455
Eat shit and die, you fucking
Spanish-American poge!

659
00:53:51,857 --> 00:53:54,985
I was there! I was in the shit
with the grunts.

660
00:53:55,394 --> 00:53:58,886
Don't listen to Payback's bullshit,
Rafterman.

661
00:53:59,431 --> 00:54:02,298
Sometimes he thinks he's John Wayne.

662
00:54:03,402 --> 00:54:04,994
You listen to Joker.

663
00:54:05,203 --> 00:54:06,636
<i>He knows ti ti.</i>

664
00:54:06,872 --> 00:54:08,032
Very little.

665
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:11,871
He's never been in the shit
'cause he ain't got the stare.

666
00:54:12,678 --> 00:54:14,305
The 1,000-yard stare.

667
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,374
A Marine gets it after he's been
in the shit too long.

668
00:54:18,483 --> 00:54:21,748
It's like, it's like you've
really seen beyond.

669
00:54:22,988 --> 00:54:24,114
I got it.

670
00:54:24,389 --> 00:54:27,324
All field Marines got it.
And you'll have it, too.

671
00:54:28,026 --> 00:54:29,015
I will?

672
00:54:31,263 --> 00:54:34,528
How do you stop five blacks
from raping a white chick?

673
00:54:34,933 --> 00:54:36,161
Fuck you.

674
00:54:36,234 --> 00:54:38,065
Throw them a basketball.

675
00:54:42,908 --> 00:54:43,932
Incoming.

676
00:54:46,612 --> 00:54:47,977
They're outgoing!

677
00:54:50,248 --> 00:54:52,478
-That ain't outgoing!
-That ain't outgoing!

678
00:54:52,551 --> 00:54:54,143
Now what'd I just say?

679
00:55:33,625 --> 00:55:35,957
I hope they're just fucking with us.

680
00:55:36,061 --> 00:55:37,961
I ain't ready for this shit.

681
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:33,310
Cease fire!

682
00:56:43,962 --> 00:56:45,156
Cease fire!

683
00:56:56,975 --> 00:56:58,135
<i>The enemy...</i>

684
00:56:59,111 --> 00:57:00,908
<i>...has very deceitfully...</i>

685
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:04,044
<i>...taken advantage of the ceasefire...</i>

686
00:57:04,816 --> 00:57:07,580
<i>...to launch an offensive
all over the country.</i>

687
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:11,284
<i>So far, we've had it pretty easy here.</i>

688
00:57:12,324 --> 00:57:14,383
<i>But we seem to be the exception.</i>

689
00:57:15,327 --> 00:57:19,457
Charlie has hit every military target
in Vietnam and hit them hard.

690
00:57:20,232 --> 00:57:21,392
In Saigon...

691
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:25,998
...the United States Embassy has been
overrun by suicide squads.

692
00:57:28,406 --> 00:57:31,204
Khe Sanh is standing by to be overrun.

693
00:57:33,211 --> 00:57:35,873
We have reports that a division of N.V.A....

694
00:57:36,014 --> 00:57:39,745
...has occupied all of the city of Hue
south of the Perfume River.

695
00:57:41,052 --> 00:57:44,180
In strategic terms,
Charlie's cut the country in half...

696
00:57:44,256 --> 00:57:46,986
...the civilian press are
wetting their pants...

697
00:57:47,192 --> 00:57:51,094
...and even Cronkite is going to say
the war is now unwinnable.

698
00:57:52,764 --> 00:57:54,129
In other words...

699
00:57:54,666 --> 00:57:58,534
...it's a huge shit sandwich
and we all have to take a bite.

700
00:58:04,442 --> 00:58:06,808
Does this mean Ann-Margret's
not coming?

701
00:58:13,285 --> 00:58:15,515
You go straight up to Phu Bai.

702
00:58:16,855 --> 00:58:18,914
Captain January will need you.

703
00:58:22,694 --> 00:58:24,821
And you take off that damn button.

704
00:58:25,864 --> 00:58:28,458
You can't get killed
wearing a peace symbol.

705
00:58:31,136 --> 00:58:32,967
Permission to go with Joker.

706
00:58:33,972 --> 00:58:35,132
Granted.

707
00:58:36,174 --> 00:58:38,574
Sir, permission not to take Rafterman.

708
00:58:39,277 --> 00:58:40,574
You still here?

709
00:58:41,513 --> 00:58:44,505
<i>Vanish ricky-tick
and take Rafterman with you.</i>

710
00:58:45,317 --> 00:58:47,114
You're responsible for him.

711
00:59:30,262 --> 00:59:31,729
Get some! Get some!

712
00:59:51,049 --> 00:59:52,311
Get some, baby!

713
01:00:02,527 --> 01:00:04,051
I've got you, mother!

714
01:00:09,501 --> 01:00:12,402
Anyone who runs is a VC.

715
01:00:13,204 --> 01:00:15,229
Anyone who stands still...

716
01:00:16,041 --> 01:00:18,100
...is a well-disciplined VC.

717
01:00:20,812 --> 01:00:23,747
You guys ought to do a story about me.

718
01:00:25,550 --> 01:00:28,246
Why should we do a story about you?

719
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:30,817
'Cause I'm so fucking good!

720
01:00:31,289 --> 01:00:33,086
That ain't no shit neither.

721
01:00:33,625 --> 01:00:37,561
I've done got me 157 dead gooks killed.

722
01:00:38,263 --> 01:00:40,197
And 50 water buffaloes, too.

723
01:00:41,199 --> 01:00:42,826
Them are all certified.

724
01:00:44,135 --> 01:00:46,660
Any women or children?

725
01:00:47,539 --> 01:00:48,631
Sometimes.

726
01:00:50,208 --> 01:00:52,904
How can you kill women and children?

727
01:00:54,546 --> 01:00:55,444
Easy.

728
01:00:55,914 --> 01:00:58,007
You just don't lead them so much.

729
01:00:59,985 --> 01:01:01,282
Ain't war hell?

730
01:01:38,523 --> 01:01:40,582
We want to get in the shit.

731
01:01:40,792 --> 01:01:42,453
Down the road. Two-five.

732
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:44,324
Outstanding! Thanks.

733
01:02:13,391 --> 01:02:16,189
We're looking for First Platoon,
Hotel two-five.

734
01:02:16,628 --> 01:02:18,186
I got a bro named Cowboy.

735
01:02:18,263 --> 01:02:19,696
You people one-one?

736
01:02:19,764 --> 01:02:22,597
No, sir. We're reporters
for "Stars and Stripes."

737
01:02:24,269 --> 01:02:26,260
I'm Cowboy's platoon commander.

738
01:02:26,504 --> 01:02:29,029
He's just down the road
in the platoon area.

739
01:02:29,274 --> 01:02:30,798
May we tag along, sir?

740
01:02:30,875 --> 01:02:32,706
No problem. Welcome aboard.

741
01:02:33,244 --> 01:02:36,008
I'm Schinoski. Walter J. Schinoski.

742
01:02:36,714 --> 01:02:38,614
They call me Mr. Touchdown.

743
01:02:39,084 --> 01:02:41,143
I played ball for Notre Dame.

744
01:02:42,854 --> 01:02:44,845
You here to make Cowboy famous?

745
01:02:45,156 --> 01:02:46,589
Never happen, sir.

746
01:02:46,958 --> 01:02:50,485
If you came looking for a story,
this is your lucky day.

747
01:02:51,329 --> 01:02:54,059
We got Condition Red and we expect rain.

748
01:02:54,699 --> 01:02:57,167
Outstanding. We taking care of business?

749
01:02:57,569 --> 01:02:59,264
The N.V.A. are dug in deep.

750
01:02:59,337 --> 01:03:03,740
Hotel Company is working this side
of the river, house by house.

751
01:03:04,309 --> 01:03:08,609
Charles has his shit together,
but we're still getting some decent kills.

752
01:03:08,813 --> 01:03:12,510
We heard the N.V.A. executed
a lot of gook civilians.

753
01:03:13,351 --> 01:03:14,579
Affirmative.

754
01:03:14,953 --> 01:03:18,582
I saw bodies half a klick
this side of the canal.

755
01:03:18,923 --> 01:03:20,515
Can you show me where?

756
01:03:47,986 --> 01:03:50,250
<i>The dead have been covered with lime.</i>

757
01:03:52,323 --> 01:03:54,223
<i>The dead know only one thing.:</i>

758
01:03:55,693 --> 01:03:57,422
<i>It is better to be alive.</i>

759
01:04:08,773 --> 01:04:11,640
I make it 20.
Is that the official body count, sir?

760
01:04:12,243 --> 01:04:13,733
What outfit are you with?

761
01:04:13,811 --> 01:04:15,779
We're from "Stars and Stripes."

762
01:04:17,148 --> 01:04:20,174
I'm Sergeant Joker
and this photographer is Rafterman.

763
01:04:20,685 --> 01:04:23,051
I'm Lt. Cleves. Hartford, Connecticut.

764
01:04:23,188 --> 01:04:24,985
Have you got a body count, sir?

765
01:04:25,056 --> 01:04:26,045
Twenty.

766
01:04:26,591 --> 01:04:28,218
How did it happen, sir?

767
01:04:29,027 --> 01:04:31,655
The N.V.A. came in
with a list of gook names:

768
01:04:32,931 --> 01:04:36,662
Government officials, policemen,
ARVN officers, teachers.

769
01:04:37,735 --> 01:04:42,035
They asked them, real polite, to report
the next day for political re-education.

770
01:04:43,741 --> 01:04:45,834
Everybody who turned up got shot.

771
01:04:46,144 --> 01:04:47,771
Some they buried alive.

772
01:04:53,818 --> 01:04:56,184
What is that button on your body armor?

773
01:04:56,921 --> 01:04:58,115
A peace symbol, sir.

774
01:04:58,189 --> 01:05:00,817
-Where did you get it?
-I don't remember, sir.

775
01:05:01,259 --> 01:05:03,193
What is written on your helmet?

776
01:05:03,261 --> 01:05:04,751
"Born to Kill," sir.

777
01:05:04,862 --> 01:05:07,990
You put "Born to Kill" on your helmet
and wear a peace button.

778
01:05:08,066 --> 01:05:10,057
Is that some kind of sick joke?

779
01:05:11,269 --> 01:05:12,964
Well, what does it mean?

780
01:05:13,338 --> 01:05:16,239
-I don't know, sir.
-You don't know very much.

781
01:05:16,341 --> 01:05:19,868
Get your head and your ass wired together
or I will shit on you!

782
01:05:20,645 --> 01:05:23,705
Answer my question
or you'll stand tall before the Man.

783
01:05:24,382 --> 01:05:27,374
I was referring to the duality of man, sir.

784
01:05:28,253 --> 01:05:30,744
The duality of man.
The Jungian thing, sir.

785
01:05:32,323 --> 01:05:34,416
-Whose side are you on?
-Our side, sir.

786
01:05:34,492 --> 01:05:36,426
-Don't you love your country?
-Yes, sir.

787
01:05:36,494 --> 01:05:40,487
Then get with the program. Jump on
the team and come in for the big win.

788
01:05:41,933 --> 01:05:45,994
I ask that my Marines obey my orders
as they would the word of God.

789
01:05:46,704 --> 01:05:49,798
We are helping the Vietnamese,
because inside every gook...

790
01:05:49,874 --> 01:05:52,069
...is an American trying to get out.

791
01:05:52,744 --> 01:05:54,541
It's a hardball world, son.

792
01:05:54,646 --> 01:05:57,843
We must keep our heads
until this peace craze blows over.

793
01:06:11,129 --> 01:06:13,597
We're looking for First Platoon,
Hotel two-five.

794
01:06:13,665 --> 01:06:15,030
Around the back.

795
01:06:24,142 --> 01:06:26,167
-First Platoon?
-Through there.

796
01:06:50,902 --> 01:06:52,267
Hey, Lone Ranger.

797
01:06:57,075 --> 01:06:58,133
Holy shit!

798
01:07:05,817 --> 01:07:09,947
I hoped I'd never see you again,
you piece of shit!

799
01:07:11,289 --> 01:07:12,654
What's happening?

800
01:07:12,990 --> 01:07:16,926
Just waiting to get back
to the land of the big PX.

801
01:07:17,028 --> 01:07:18,393
Why go back?

802
01:07:18,696 --> 01:07:20,220
Here or there, samey-same.

803
01:07:20,298 --> 01:07:22,163
-Been getting any?
-Only your sister.

804
01:07:22,233 --> 01:07:25,669
Better my sister than my mom,
though my mom's not bad.

805
01:07:27,038 --> 01:07:28,767
Hey, you hogs, listen up!

806
01:07:29,774 --> 01:07:32,834
This is my bro, Joker, from the island.
And this is....

807
01:07:35,213 --> 01:07:38,080
They're from "Stars and Stripes."
You'll be famous.

808
01:07:39,684 --> 01:07:43,415
We're the Lusthog squad.
We're lifetakers and heartbreakers.

809
01:07:44,455 --> 01:07:47,151
We shoot holes in them
and fill them with lead.

810
01:07:52,463 --> 01:07:54,192
Are you a photographer?

811
01:07:56,734 --> 01:07:58,565
I'm a combat correspondent.

812
01:08:00,204 --> 01:08:02,138
You seen much combat?

813
01:08:05,376 --> 01:08:07,571
I've seen a little on TV.

814
01:08:12,116 --> 01:08:13,947
You're a real comedian.

815
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:18,020
Well, they call me the Joker.

816
01:08:20,158 --> 01:08:22,092
Well, I've got a joke for you.

817
01:08:22,827 --> 01:08:25,091
I'm going to tear you a new asshole.

818
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:30,665
Well, pilgrim...

819
01:08:31,335 --> 01:08:35,704
...only after you eat the peanuts
out of my shit!

820
01:08:42,113 --> 01:08:43,512
You talk the talk.

821
01:08:45,149 --> 01:08:46,776
Do you walk the walk?

822
01:08:52,390 --> 01:08:54,187
You might not believe it...

823
01:08:54,292 --> 01:08:58,319
...but under fire, Animal Mother
is a truly fine human being.

824
01:08:59,497 --> 01:09:02,694
He just needs grenades thrown
at him the rest of his life.

825
01:09:11,676 --> 01:09:15,112
Jungle bunny. Thank God
for the sickle cell, huh?

826
01:09:16,113 --> 01:09:17,341
Yeah, Mother.

827
01:09:19,083 --> 01:09:20,448
Hey, photographer!

828
01:09:22,386 --> 01:09:24,217
Want to take a good picture?

829
01:09:27,525 --> 01:09:28,617
Take this.

830
01:09:37,902 --> 01:09:39,563
This...is my bro.

831
01:09:50,281 --> 01:09:51,680
This is his party.

832
01:09:52,583 --> 01:09:54,278
He's the guest of honor.

833
01:09:55,653 --> 01:09:57,484
Today is his birthday.

834
01:09:58,890 --> 01:10:00,755
Happy birthday, zipperhead!

835
01:10:02,727 --> 01:10:04,627
I will never forget this day.

836
01:10:05,429 --> 01:10:09,297
The day I came to Hue city
and fought one million N.V.A. gooks.

837
01:10:11,068 --> 01:10:13,536
I really love the little Commie bastards.

838
01:10:14,906 --> 01:10:18,364
These enemy grunts are as hard
as slant-eyed drill instructors.

839
01:10:20,077 --> 01:10:22,204
These are great days we're living!

840
01:10:24,181 --> 01:10:27,241
We are jolly green giants,
walking the earth with guns.

841
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:31,215
These people we wasted here today...

842
01:10:31,822 --> 01:10:34,347
...are the finest people we will ever know.

843
01:10:36,661 --> 01:10:40,859
Once we rotate back to the world, we'll
miss not having anyone worth shooting.

844
01:12:17,662 --> 01:12:20,290
Delta 6 Actual, this is Murphy. Over.

845
01:12:29,907 --> 01:12:32,603
<i>We are receiving incoming fire
from the ville.</i>

846
01:12:33,044 --> 01:12:34,739
The lieutenant is down.

847
01:12:34,845 --> 01:12:37,473
We'll stop and check out
what's in front of us.

848
01:12:43,187 --> 01:12:45,314
Okay, Lusthog squad, listen up!

849
01:12:46,424 --> 01:12:48,324
We'll move up these two roads.

850
01:12:48,392 --> 01:12:50,553
I want the third team up this road.

851
01:12:51,228 --> 01:12:54,163
First and second team behind me
up this other road.

852
01:12:55,533 --> 01:12:57,467
Let's go! Let's get it done!

853
01:17:25,669 --> 01:17:28,536
Is that you, John Wayne? Is this me?

854
01:17:28,872 --> 01:17:31,864
Start the cameras.
This is "Vietnam: The Movie"!

855
01:17:32,176 --> 01:17:34,303
If Joker is John Wayne, I'm a horse!

856
01:17:34,378 --> 01:17:37,142
-T.H.E. Rock can be a rock!
-I'll be Ann-Margret!

857
01:17:37,247 --> 01:17:39,238
Animal Mother can be a rabid buffalo!

858
01:17:39,316 --> 01:17:41,978
-I'll be General Custer!
-Who'll be the Indian?

859
01:17:42,052 --> 01:17:44,577
We'll let the gooks play the Indians!

860
01:18:23,193 --> 01:18:24,785
You're going home now.

861
01:18:29,199 --> 01:18:30,291
Semper fi.

862
01:18:34,004 --> 01:18:35,699
We're mean Marines, sir.

863
01:18:39,977 --> 01:18:41,239
Go easy, bros.

864
01:18:46,216 --> 01:18:47,683
Better you than me.

865
01:18:52,022 --> 01:18:54,217
At least they died for a good cause.

866
01:18:55,492 --> 01:18:56,982
What cause was that?

867
01:18:59,296 --> 01:19:00,285
Freedom.

868
01:19:01,632 --> 01:19:03,759
Flush out your head gear, New Guy.

869
01:19:06,336 --> 01:19:08,600
You think we waste gooks for freedom?

870
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:11,937
This is a slaughter.

871
01:19:13,644 --> 01:19:16,204
If I get my balls blown off for a word...

872
01:19:18,315 --> 01:19:20,146
...my word is "poontang."

873
01:19:23,954 --> 01:19:25,717
Tough break for Hand Job.

874
01:19:27,591 --> 01:19:30,185
He was set to get shipped out
on a medical.

875
01:19:32,563 --> 01:19:34,258
What was wrong with him?

876
01:19:36,733 --> 01:19:38,997
He was jerking off ten times a day.

877
01:19:41,371 --> 01:19:44,101
It's no shit. At least ten times a day.

878
01:19:46,643 --> 01:19:51,012
Last week he was sent to Da Nang
to see the Navy head shrinker.

879
01:19:52,483 --> 01:19:55,543
The crazy fucker jerks off
in the waiting room.

880
01:19:57,054 --> 01:19:58,715
Instant Section 8.

881
01:20:00,390 --> 01:20:03,120
He was waiting for his papers
to clear division.

882
01:20:06,338 --> 01:20:07,362
Ready?

883
01:20:07,639 --> 01:20:08,697
Turnover.

884
01:20:10,743 --> 01:20:12,973
Hue city interviews. Roll 34.

885
01:20:17,116 --> 01:20:20,415
This is a major city,
so we have to assault with...

886
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:23,220
...tanks in the streets.

887
01:20:23,589 --> 01:20:25,523
They send us in first squad...

888
01:20:25,591 --> 01:20:28,458
...to make sure there are no little, uh...

889
01:20:30,429 --> 01:20:33,489
...Vietnamese waiting with B-40 rockets
to blow the tanks away.

890
01:20:33,565 --> 01:20:38,195
So we roll the tanks in and basically,
blow the place to hell.

891
01:20:39,605 --> 01:20:42,073
When we're in Hue, in Hue city...

892
01:20:43,308 --> 01:20:45,208
...it's like a war, you know.

893
01:20:47,446 --> 01:20:51,109
Like what I thought about, what I
thought a war was supposed to be.

894
01:20:54,353 --> 01:20:56,253
There's the enemy, kill them.

895
01:20:57,089 --> 01:20:59,785
There's no question about it.
We're the best.

896
01:21:00,359 --> 01:21:04,728
It's bullshit about Air Cav. When
the shit hits the fan, who do they call?

897
01:21:04,963 --> 01:21:07,659
They call Mother Green
and her killing machine!

898
01:21:08,667 --> 01:21:10,965
Do I think America belongs in Vietnam?

899
01:21:12,171 --> 01:21:15,231
I don't know. I belong in Vietnam,
I'll tell you that.

900
01:21:16,408 --> 01:21:17,875
Can I quote L.B.J.?

901
01:21:20,045 --> 01:21:21,774
"I will not send...

902
01:21:22,181 --> 01:21:26,117
"...American boys 10,000 miles
around the world...

903
01:21:26,218 --> 01:21:29,449
"...to do a job Asian boys
should be doing for themselves."

904
01:21:32,257 --> 01:21:33,849
Personally, I think...

905
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:37,188
...they don't want to be involved
in this war.

906
01:21:37,963 --> 01:21:39,590
I think they sort of...

907
01:21:41,066 --> 01:21:45,400
...took away our freedom and gave it
to the gooks. They don't want it.

908
01:21:46,438 --> 01:21:48,531
They'd rather be alive than free.

909
01:21:48,707 --> 01:21:50,265
Poor dumb bastards.

910
01:21:51,877 --> 01:21:54,812
The ones I'm fighting at are some pretty...

911
01:21:55,614 --> 01:21:58,082
...pretty bad boys. I'm not real, uh....

912
01:21:59,718 --> 01:22:01,345
I'm not real keen on...

913
01:22:01,987 --> 01:22:05,150
...these fellows that are supposedly
on our side.

914
01:22:06,325 --> 01:22:08,725
I keep meeting them
coming the other way.

915
01:22:12,865 --> 01:22:16,426
We get killed for these people
and they don't even appreciate it.

916
01:22:18,103 --> 01:22:19,900
They think it's a big joke.

917
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:22,004
If you ask me...

918
01:22:23,075 --> 01:22:25,202
...we're shooting the wrong gooks.

919
01:22:25,577 --> 01:22:28,512
It depends. I'm here
to take combat photos.

920
01:22:29,348 --> 01:22:32,317
But if the shit gets too thick,
I'll go to the rifle.

921
01:22:33,886 --> 01:22:36,787
What do I think of America's involvement
in the war?

922
01:22:36,855 --> 01:22:38,447
I think we should win.

923
01:22:39,258 --> 01:22:40,555
I hate Vietnam.

924
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:44,887
There's not one horse
in the whole country.

925
01:22:45,898 --> 01:22:48,366
There's something wrong with that.

926
01:22:50,035 --> 01:22:52,060
If they'd send us more guys maybe...

927
01:22:52,137 --> 01:22:55,368
...and bomb the hell out of the North,
they might give up.

928
01:22:56,808 --> 01:22:59,208
I wanted to see exotic Vietnam...

929
01:22:59,745 --> 01:23:01,736
...the jewel of Southeast Asia.

930
01:23:02,381 --> 01:23:03,609
I wanted to meet...

931
01:23:03,682 --> 01:23:07,049
...interesting people of an ancient culture
and kill them.

932
01:23:09,221 --> 01:23:13,123
I wanted to be the first kid on my block
to get a confirmed kill.

933
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:40,514
'Morning, little schoolgirl.

934
01:23:41,119 --> 01:23:43,178
I'm a little schoolboy, too.

935
01:23:45,824 --> 01:23:48,952
-What you got there?
-Do you want No. 1 fuckee?

936
01:23:50,395 --> 01:23:52,989
Any of you boys want
No. 1 fuckee?

937
01:23:53,365 --> 01:23:55,663
I'm so horny I can't even get
a piece of hand!

938
01:23:55,734 --> 01:23:56,758
Me want suckee.

939
01:23:56,835 --> 01:24:01,670
Suckee, fuckee, she give you everything
you want. Long time.

940
01:24:02,007 --> 01:24:04,567
Everything you want! All right!

941
01:24:04,810 --> 01:24:06,004
How much, chief?

942
01:24:06,078 --> 01:24:07,340
$15 each.

943
01:24:10,682 --> 01:24:12,650
$15 beaucoup money.

944
01:24:13,552 --> 01:24:14,576
$5 each.

945
01:24:15,087 --> 01:24:16,884
Come on, she love you good.

946
01:24:16,989 --> 01:24:19,219
Boom-boom long time. $10.

947
01:24:19,458 --> 01:24:20,356
$5.

948
01:24:20,525 --> 01:24:21,753
No, $10.

949
01:24:22,194 --> 01:24:24,128
Trade you some ARVN rifles.

950
01:24:24,429 --> 01:24:26,795
Never been fired and only dropped once.

951
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:29,927
Okay, $5. You give me.

952
01:24:33,939 --> 01:24:35,497
Let's get mounted.

953
01:24:40,579 --> 01:24:42,206
Something wrong, chief?

954
01:24:42,347 --> 01:24:44,372
She says no boom-boom with you.

955
01:24:44,549 --> 01:24:46,039
What the motherfuck?

956
01:24:46,284 --> 01:24:48,445
She says soul brother too beaucoup.

957
01:24:50,555 --> 01:24:54,218
He's saying you black boys
pack too much meat!

958
01:25:01,366 --> 01:25:04,733
She looks like she could suck
the chrome off a trailer hitch.

959
01:25:05,303 --> 01:25:07,498
She say too beaucoup. Too beaucoup.

960
01:25:08,373 --> 01:25:09,738
Excuse me, ma'am.

961
01:25:10,876 --> 01:25:14,471
What we have here is a magnificent...

962
01:25:14,579 --> 01:25:17,275
...specimen of pure Alabama blacksnake.

963
01:25:17,883 --> 01:25:20,010
But it ain't too goddamn beaucoup.

964
01:25:21,319 --> 01:25:22,650
Okay. Okay.

965
01:25:29,594 --> 01:25:31,994
-We need a batting order.
-I'm going first.

966
01:25:32,064 --> 01:25:35,363
Back off, white bread.
Don't get between a dog and his meat.

967
01:25:35,634 --> 01:25:38,967
All fucking niggers must fucking hang.

968
01:25:42,374 --> 01:25:45,673
Hey, I won't be long.
I'll skip the foreplay.

969
01:25:46,645 --> 01:25:49,136
-I don't want it after you, man!
-Fuck you!

970
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:24,512
<i>Intelligence passed the word down...</i>

971
01:26:24,683 --> 01:26:28,244
<i>...that during the night the N. V.A.
pulled out of our area...</i>

972
01:26:28,353 --> 01:26:30,821
<i>...to positions across the Perfume River.</i>

973
01:26:31,523 --> 01:26:35,289
<i>Our squad is sent on patrol
to check out the report.</i>

974
01:27:07,425 --> 01:27:10,155
Face outboard and take cover! Do it!

975
01:27:33,752 --> 01:27:35,481
He ain't going to make it.

976
01:27:46,765 --> 01:27:48,995
Hotel One Actual, this is Cowboy.

977
01:27:51,469 --> 01:27:53,835
Hotel One Actual, this is Cowboy.

978
01:27:57,509 --> 01:27:59,136
Murph, this is Cowboy.

979
01:27:59,711 --> 01:28:02,009
Crazy's hit. Booby trap.

980
01:28:04,216 --> 01:28:05,205
<i>Wait one.</i>

981
01:28:08,253 --> 01:28:13,122
<i>You're senior NCO. Take charge
and continue with the patrol.</i>

982
01:28:13,391 --> 01:28:15,689
<i>Call in at the next checkpoint. Over.</i>

983
01:28:16,127 --> 01:28:17,719
<i>Roger. Understand.</i>

984
01:28:25,237 --> 01:28:26,727
I'm squad leader.

985
01:28:30,108 --> 01:28:32,235
I'll follow you anywhere, scumbag.

986
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:36,972
He's dead.

987
01:29:26,831 --> 01:29:27,923
What's up?

988
01:29:28,466 --> 01:29:30,957
We made a mistake at the last checkpoint.

989
01:29:31,903 --> 01:29:33,564
See what you think.

990
01:29:36,474 --> 01:29:38,442
I think we're here...

991
01:29:40,045 --> 01:29:42,036
...and we should be here.

992
01:29:44,549 --> 01:29:45,675
We're here?

993
01:29:46,918 --> 01:29:48,317
We should be here?

994
01:30:03,268 --> 01:30:04,667
What do you think?

995
01:30:06,571 --> 01:30:08,732
I think we should change direction.

996
01:30:25,523 --> 01:30:27,150
We'll change direction.

997
01:30:38,136 --> 01:30:39,194
What's up?

998
01:30:39,971 --> 01:30:41,461
Change in direction.

999
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:43,834
Are we lost?

1000
01:30:43,975 --> 01:30:45,943
Joker, shut the fuck up!

1001
01:30:47,379 --> 01:30:48,846
Okay, listen up!

1002
01:30:49,681 --> 01:30:51,046
Can you hear me?

1003
01:30:51,950 --> 01:30:53,679
We're changing direction.

1004
01:30:53,952 --> 01:30:55,783
We're heading over that way.

1005
01:30:55,887 --> 01:30:58,321
Eightball's going to find a way through.

1006
01:30:59,557 --> 01:31:00,581
Got it?

1007
01:31:02,627 --> 01:31:04,618
Eightball, let's dance.

1008
01:31:06,231 --> 01:31:08,256
Put a nigger behind the trigger.

1009
01:32:26,878 --> 01:32:28,175
Cease fire!

1010
01:32:28,446 --> 01:32:30,107
Cease fire, goddamn it!

1011
01:32:30,448 --> 01:32:32,780
Cool it, goddamn it! Cease fire!

1012
01:32:36,254 --> 01:32:40,088
Listen up! Did anybody see a sniper?
Did anybody see anything?

1013
01:32:42,327 --> 01:32:43,487
Negative!

1014
01:32:43,561 --> 01:32:46,394
Save your ammo!
Nobody fire till I tell you!

1015
01:32:49,767 --> 01:32:51,997
No! Cease fire! Cease fire!

1016
01:32:52,403 --> 01:32:53,961
Animal, cease fire!

1017
01:32:54,239 --> 01:32:55,900
It's Sergeant Murphy.

1018
01:32:56,608 --> 01:32:58,098
Cowboy. Over.

1019
01:32:58,209 --> 01:33:01,372
<i>Murphy. What is your present position?
Over.</i>

1020
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:03,939
Receiving enemy sniper fire.

1021
01:33:04,382 --> 01:33:05,679
Eightball is down.

1022
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:08,583
We're half a klick north
of checkpoint No. 4.

1023
01:33:08,887 --> 01:33:12,379
Possible strong enemy forces in front of us.

1024
01:33:12,724 --> 01:33:15,215
Request immediate tank support. Over.

1025
01:33:16,594 --> 01:33:18,221
<i>Roger. Understand.</i>

1026
01:33:18,296 --> 01:33:20,560
<i>I'll see what I can do. Over.</i>

1027
01:33:23,434 --> 01:33:24,560
Stay close.

1028
01:33:26,437 --> 01:33:30,203
Listen up! I think we're being
set up for an ambush.

1029
01:33:30,642 --> 01:33:33,975
There may be strong enemy forces
in those buildings.

1030
01:33:34,379 --> 01:33:36,370
I've requested tank support.

1031
01:33:36,447 --> 01:33:37,880
We'll sit tight...

1032
01:33:38,249 --> 01:33:41,116
...but keep our eyes open.
If they hit us...

1033
01:33:41,286 --> 01:33:43,277
...we'll have to pull back fast.

1034
01:33:44,789 --> 01:33:47,519
Goddamn it! Cease your fire, Mother!

1035
01:33:47,792 --> 01:33:49,453
Cease your fucking fire!

1036
01:33:50,461 --> 01:33:51,860
We can't leave him !

1037
01:33:51,930 --> 01:33:54,592
We'll get him when the tank comes up.

1038
01:33:54,732 --> 01:33:57,132
He's hit three times! He can't wait!

1039
01:33:57,569 --> 01:34:02,165
That sniper's just trying
to suck us in one at a time.

1040
01:34:05,143 --> 01:34:07,168
Goddamn it! No!

1041
01:34:08,313 --> 01:34:09,940
Goddamn it, cease fire!

1042
01:34:11,382 --> 01:34:13,441
Fuck this shit!
I'm going in to bring him out!

1043
01:34:13,518 --> 01:34:16,009
Sit the fuck down, goddamn it!

1044
01:34:32,870 --> 01:34:35,338
Okay, cease fire! He's there!

1045
01:34:51,189 --> 01:34:52,656
Hold your fire!

1046
01:34:52,857 --> 01:34:54,188
Hold your fire!

1047
01:34:55,093 --> 01:34:57,425
You can't see the sniper!

1048
01:34:57,829 --> 01:35:01,287
Save the ammo! Nobody fire
till I tell you! Nobody!

1049
01:35:07,605 --> 01:35:08,936
Hold your fire!

1050
01:35:10,108 --> 01:35:11,905
What the fuck do we do now?

1051
01:35:13,845 --> 01:35:15,642
Give me that fucking radio.

1052
01:35:20,051 --> 01:35:21,985
Murph? This is Cowboy. Over.

1053
01:35:24,555 --> 01:35:28,855
We're in deep shit. Two men down.
What's the story on the tank? Over.

1054
01:35:30,962 --> 01:35:32,122
<i>Sorry, Cowboy.</i>

1055
01:35:32,196 --> 01:35:34,130
<i>No luck so far with the tank.</i>

1056
01:35:34,365 --> 01:35:36,094
<i>Will advise. Over.</i>

1057
01:35:40,271 --> 01:35:41,932
Numb-nut bastards.

1058
01:35:42,707 --> 01:35:44,072
Okay, listen up!

1059
01:35:46,711 --> 01:35:48,406
Can't wait for the tank.

1060
01:35:48,980 --> 01:35:50,914
They're going to hit us any minute.

1061
01:35:50,982 --> 01:35:53,075
When they do, we won't have time.

1062
01:35:53,384 --> 01:35:55,909
We have to pull out now. Get ready.

1063
01:35:57,455 --> 01:35:58,820
Wait! Hold it!

1064
01:35:59,290 --> 01:36:00,848
Nobody's pulling out!

1065
01:36:01,125 --> 01:36:03,116
There's only one fucking sniper!

1066
01:36:03,194 --> 01:36:04,218
Back off!

1067
01:36:04,662 --> 01:36:07,460
I'm calling the plays and I say we pull out!

1068
01:36:07,665 --> 01:36:09,565
What about Doc Jay and Eightball?

1069
01:36:09,634 --> 01:36:13,365
It's shitty, but we can't refuse
to accept the situation.

1070
01:36:13,538 --> 01:36:16,029
We're not leaving them out there!

1071
01:36:16,140 --> 01:36:17,801
They're wasted!

1072
01:36:18,209 --> 01:36:19,540
You know that!

1073
01:36:19,944 --> 01:36:22,105
Come on, we gotta bring them back.

1074
01:36:22,313 --> 01:36:23,575
Let's do it!

1075
01:36:23,815 --> 01:36:25,942
Stand down! That's a direct order.

1076
01:36:30,254 --> 01:36:33,155
Fuck you, Cowboy!
Fuck all you assholes!

1077
01:36:36,494 --> 01:36:37,586
Goddamn it!

1078
01:36:37,662 --> 01:36:39,323
Fucking son of a bitch!

1079
01:36:39,731 --> 01:36:41,323
You motherfucker!

1080
01:37:02,653 --> 01:37:04,120
Where's the sniper?

1081
01:37:07,592 --> 01:37:09,958
Doc, where's the sniper?

1082
01:37:19,403 --> 01:37:20,335
Shit!

1083
01:37:22,740 --> 01:37:24,469
Shit! Fuck!

1084
01:38:17,995 --> 01:38:20,429
Doc Jay and Eightball are wasted!

1085
01:38:22,133 --> 01:38:24,397
There's only one sniper!

1086
01:38:26,003 --> 01:38:28,836
Move up the squad!
You're clear up to here!

1087
01:38:34,712 --> 01:38:36,202
Son of a bitch.

1088
01:38:44,388 --> 01:38:48,222
No-Doze, Stutten, Donlon, Rock,
come with me. We'll take a look.

1089
01:38:48,993 --> 01:38:51,257
You stay put and cover our ass!

1090
01:38:51,629 --> 01:38:53,654
We may come back in a big hurry!

1091
01:38:55,433 --> 01:38:57,663
-I'm going with you.
-I'm coming, too.

1092
01:38:59,770 --> 01:39:00,759
All set?

1093
01:39:01,505 --> 01:39:02,494
Let's move!

1094
01:39:43,814 --> 01:39:46,112
Top of the building, round the corner.

1095
01:40:06,003 --> 01:40:07,766
Give me that radio.

1096
01:40:11,342 --> 01:40:12,934
This is Cowboy. Over.

1097
01:40:24,155 --> 01:40:27,352
Holy shit! The sniper has a clean shot
through the hole!

1098
01:40:41,772 --> 01:40:43,103
That son of a bitch!

1099
01:40:43,174 --> 01:40:44,641
You'll be all right.

1100
01:40:44,709 --> 01:40:47,041
Don't shit me, Joker!

1101
01:40:48,546 --> 01:40:50,844
I'm not. You're my favorite turd.

1102
01:40:58,656 --> 01:41:00,283
Hang on, man! Hang on!

1103
01:41:04,528 --> 01:41:05,825
I can hack it.

1104
01:41:13,637 --> 01:41:15,127
I can hack it.

1105
01:42:13,164 --> 01:42:14,893
Let's go get some payback.

1106
01:42:21,672 --> 01:42:22,639
Okay.

1107
01:42:38,522 --> 01:42:40,217
Watch that fucking hole.

1108
01:42:41,859 --> 01:42:43,383
Give them some smoke.

1109
01:42:59,710 --> 01:43:00,870
Ready?

1110
01:43:42,419 --> 01:43:45,115
Donlon, Rock, that way.
You two, with me.

1111
01:43:51,262 --> 01:43:53,253
Joker, in there! New Guy!

1112
01:45:58,022 --> 01:46:00,422
We got the sniper!

1113
01:46:38,495 --> 01:46:39,587
What's up?

1114
01:46:41,565 --> 01:46:43,089
We got the sniper.

1115
01:46:56,280 --> 01:46:57,770
I saved Joker's ass.

1116
01:46:58,349 --> 01:46:59,714
I got the sniper.

1117
01:47:00,484 --> 01:47:02,611
I fucking blew her away!

1118
01:47:03,954 --> 01:47:05,649
Am I bad?

1119
01:47:06,457 --> 01:47:09,392
Am I a life-taker?
Am I a heartbreaker?

1120
01:47:28,078 --> 01:47:29,477
What's she saying?

1121
01:47:33,784 --> 01:47:35,046
She's praying.

1122
01:47:39,623 --> 01:47:41,818
No more boom-boom for this baby-san.

1123
01:47:45,829 --> 01:47:47,956
There's nothing we can do for her.

1124
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,365
She's dead meat.

1125
01:47:59,009 --> 01:48:01,000
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1126
01:48:05,749 --> 01:48:07,046
What about her?

1127
01:48:11,422 --> 01:48:12,480
Fuck her.

1128
01:48:14,358 --> 01:48:15,518
Let her rot.

1129
01:48:32,509 --> 01:48:34,409
We can't just leave her here.

1130
01:48:37,915 --> 01:48:39,212
Hey, asshole...

1131
01:48:40,317 --> 01:48:41,784
...Cowboy's wasted.

1132
01:48:43,086 --> 01:48:44,917
You're fresh out of friends.

1133
01:48:46,757 --> 01:48:48,554
I'm running this squad now.

1134
01:48:48,725 --> 01:48:51,785
And I say we leave the gook
for the mother-loving rats.

1135
01:48:56,733 --> 01:48:58,826
I'm not trying to run this squad.

1136
01:49:01,905 --> 01:49:04,533
I'm just saying we can't leave her like this.

1137
01:49:15,152 --> 01:49:17,450
Shoot...me.

1138
01:49:20,057 --> 01:49:21,251
Shoot...

1139
01:49:22,392 --> 01:49:23,416
...me.

1140
01:49:35,906 --> 01:49:38,238
If you want to waste her, go on...

1141
01:49:41,278 --> 01:49:42,472
...waste her.

1142
01:50:07,070 --> 01:50:08,230
Shoot.

1143
01:50:59,957 --> 01:51:03,893
We'll have to put you up
for the Congressional Medal of...Ugly!

1144
01:51:08,332 --> 01:51:09,822
Hardcore, man.

1145
01:51:12,669 --> 01:51:14,296
Fucking hardcore.

1146
01:51:32,189 --> 01:51:36,285
<i>We have nailed our names
in the pages of history enough for today.</i>

1147
