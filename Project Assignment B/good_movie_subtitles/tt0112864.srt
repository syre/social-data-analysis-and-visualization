1
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,828
# Hot town,
summer in the city #

2
00:00:56,936 --> 00:00:59,302
# Back of my neck
gettin' dirt and gritty #

3
00:00:59,406 --> 00:01:01,203
# Been down,
isn't it a pity? #

4
00:01:01,307 --> 00:01:03,673
# Doesn't seem to be
a shadow in the city #

5
00:01:03,777 --> 00:01:05,574
#All around,
people lookin' half-dead #

6
00:01:05,678 --> 00:01:09,011
#Walkin' on the sidewalk
hotter than a match-head #

7
00:01:09,115 --> 00:01:11,276
# Come night,
it's a different world #

8
00:01:11,384 --> 00:01:13,080
# Goin' off to find a girl #

9
00:01:13,187 --> 00:01:15,314
# Come on, come on,
and dance all night #

10
00:01:15,423 --> 00:01:17,050
# Despite the heat
it'll be all right #

11
00:01:17,158 --> 00:01:18,921
#And, babe, don't you know
it's a pity #

12
00:01:19,026 --> 00:01:21,392
#That the days
can't be like the nights #

13
00:01:21,495 --> 00:01:23,486
# In the summer
in the city #

14
00:01:23,597 --> 00:01:25,997
# In the summer
in the city #

15
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,000
# Cool town,
meetin' in the city #

16
00:01:28,102 --> 00:01:30,229
# Dressed so fine
and lookin' so pretty #

17
00:01:30,337 --> 00:01:32,396
# Cool cat
lookin' for a kitty #

18
00:01:32,506 --> 00:01:34,667
# Gonna look in every
corner of the city #

19
00:01:34,775 --> 00:01:36,072
#Turn round,
wheezing at the bus stop #

20
00:01:36,177 --> 00:01:37,075
# Runnin- ##

21
00:01:54,362 --> 00:01:56,193
Alan, Bomb Squad,
Special Services,

22
00:01:56,298 --> 00:01:59,131
State Police,
and the FBI.

23
00:01:59,234 --> 00:02:00,633
LieutenantJurgensen,
Plummer,

24
00:02:00,735 --> 00:02:02,134
Go to St. John's emergency

25
00:02:02,237 --> 00:02:05,638
in case we got any walk-ins
from the street.

26
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,640
Kramer,
get the city engineer.

27
00:02:07,742 --> 00:02:10,142
I got to find out
our damage report.

28
00:02:10,245 --> 00:02:11,644
Bonwit Teller.

29
00:02:11,746 --> 00:02:14,647
Who would want to blow up
a department store?

30
00:02:14,749 --> 00:02:17,650
Ever see a woman
miss a shoe sale?

31
00:02:17,752 --> 00:02:19,151
Ricky, you and Joe

32
00:02:19,254 --> 00:02:22,155
make sure the uniforms
get it cordoned off there

33
00:02:22,257 --> 00:02:25,159
and don't let
the damn TV crews in.

34
00:02:25,261 --> 00:02:26,159
Inspector, phone.

35
00:02:26,262 --> 00:02:27,661
Not now. Benson, traffic!

36
00:02:27,763 --> 00:02:30,129
Get 5th avenue
cleared up by 3:00,

37
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,633
or we got
the traffic jam from hell.

38
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:33,633
Walter.

39
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:34,634
Yeah.

40
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,796
I think you'd
better take this.

41
00:02:39,775 --> 00:02:41,675
Major Case Unit.
Inspector Cobb.

42
00:02:41,777 --> 00:02:45,679
Said Simple Simon to the pie man
going to the fair,

43
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:47,180
"Give me your pies...

44
00:02:47,283 --> 00:02:49,183
or I'll cave
your head in. "

45
00:02:49,285 --> 00:02:53,688
You see, Bonwit's was just to
make sure I had your attention.

46
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:56,121
Is there a detective
named McClane there?

47
00:02:56,292 --> 00:02:57,623
He's on suspension.

48
00:02:57,727 --> 00:02:59,627
No, Walter. He's not.

49
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:00,627
Not today.

50
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:02,130
Who is this?

51
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:03,631
Call me Simon.

52
00:03:03,734 --> 00:03:05,133
What do you want?

53
00:03:05,235 --> 00:03:07,635
I want to play
a game.

54
00:03:07,738 --> 00:03:09,137
What kind of game?

55
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:10,638
Simon says.

56
00:03:10,741 --> 00:03:14,142
Simon's going to tell
Lieutenant McClane what to do,

57
00:03:14,244 --> 00:03:17,645
and Lieutenant McClane
is going to do it.

58
00:03:17,748 --> 00:03:20,649
Noncompliance will
result in a penalty.

59
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:22,651
What penalty?

60
00:03:22,753 --> 00:03:25,813
Another big bang
in a very public place.

61
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:31,660
What is it that you want
Lieutenant McClane to do?

62
00:03:31,762 --> 00:03:33,662
Simon says
Lieutenant McClane

63
00:03:33,764 --> 00:03:37,166
is to go to the corner of 138th street
und Amsterdam,

64
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:40,260
which is in Harlem,
if I'm not mistaken.

65
00:03:40,371 --> 00:03:41,269
Kowalski!

66
00:03:41,372 --> 00:03:43,340
Lambert! You know
where to find McClane?

67
00:03:43,441 --> 00:03:46,137
I kind of doubt
you'll find him in church.

68
00:03:46,244 --> 00:03:49,680
Well, you better find out
what rock he's under...

69
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:51,180
and kick it over.

70
00:04:02,594 --> 00:04:03,720
John.

71
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:06,924
Thanks.

72
00:04:13,738 --> 00:04:15,331
A few more.

73
00:04:17,943 --> 00:04:20,912
Jesus,John.
You look like shit.

74
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,151
Where did we leave off
with that roster?

75
00:04:28,253 --> 00:04:31,654
We got three killings
in Redhook the past two nights.

76
00:04:31,757 --> 00:04:34,021
Put Minor on it.
And Genetti.

77
00:04:34,126 --> 00:04:37,027
The Mayor's Office will call
before the day's out.

78
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:40,656
Next-14 dump trucks stolen from a yard
in Staten Island.

79
00:04:40,766 --> 00:04:42,666
14-Jesus!

80
00:04:42,768 --> 00:04:44,668
Are they starting
a construction company?

81
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,101
No, it was
John's landlady

82
00:04:46,205 --> 00:04:47,968
going to clean
his apartment.

83
00:04:49,776 --> 00:04:51,175
Insurance fraud.

84
00:04:51,276 --> 00:04:53,677
That's a priority
out in California.

85
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,613
Contractor splits the money
with the thieves.

86
00:04:56,716 --> 00:05:00,618
We had that out in Jersey
a couple of years ago,Joe.

87
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,120
See what Kelly
can do with it.

88
00:05:03,223 --> 00:05:06,192
Hey, what was the lottery number
last night?

89
00:05:06,292 --> 00:05:08,157
4667. 4667. 4667.

90
00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:12,197
You still betting
your badge, Rick?

91
00:05:12,298 --> 00:05:13,629
Yeah.

92
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:16,133
6991 every week.

93
00:05:16,236 --> 00:05:18,136
6991. Lucky number.

94
00:05:18,238 --> 00:05:21,230
Half the cops in New York
play their badges.

95
00:05:21,341 --> 00:05:23,309
How are the kids,John?

96
00:05:25,245 --> 00:05:26,644
They're O.K.

97
00:05:26,746 --> 00:05:27,644
Ahem.

98
00:05:27,748 --> 00:05:29,875
Did you talk
with Holly?

99
00:05:32,753 --> 00:05:34,812
No, I didn't talk
to Holly.

100
00:05:34,922 --> 00:05:37,015
Coming up on it,
Inspector.

101
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:41,160
Hot in here,
or am I just scared to death?

102
00:05:41,262 --> 00:05:43,389
Make sure
the gun's secure.

103
00:05:43,497 --> 00:05:45,192
Yeah. It's good.

104
00:05:53,074 --> 00:05:55,042
You're the first woman
since Holly

105
00:05:55,142 --> 00:05:56,473
to see me do this.

106
00:05:56,577 --> 00:05:58,442
I'm honored.

107
00:05:58,546 --> 00:05:59,604
Yeah...

108
00:05:59,714 --> 00:06:00,909
So was she.

109
00:06:04,051 --> 00:06:07,488
So... where's the backup
going to be?

110
00:06:10,726 --> 00:06:13,820
We're going to draw back
to 128th street.

111
00:06:13,929 --> 00:06:15,021
What?

112
00:06:16,264 --> 00:06:18,630
10 blocks?
You fucking kidding me?

113
00:06:18,734 --> 00:06:20,634
Oh, man.
That's just great.

114
00:06:20,736 --> 00:06:23,500
Walter, what is
all this about, huh?

115
00:06:23,605 --> 00:06:26,130
If we don't do
what this guy says,

116
00:06:26,241 --> 00:06:27,640
he'll blow up
another place.

117
00:06:27,743 --> 00:06:29,176
Well, why me?

118
00:06:29,277 --> 00:06:33,145
I have no idea.
He just said it had to be you.

119
00:06:33,248 --> 00:06:35,148
It's nice
to be needed.

120
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,774
Frankly,John-

121
00:06:36,885 --> 00:06:39,649
Hey, Walter, how about you mind
your fucking business

122
00:06:39,755 --> 00:06:41,053
about Holly, huh?

123
00:06:41,157 --> 00:06:44,649
This Simon is fucking up
a perfectly good hangover.

124
00:06:47,263 --> 00:06:48,662
O.K.

125
00:06:57,707 --> 00:07:00,107
We'll be back
to pick you up

126
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:01,608
in 15 minutes.

127
00:07:01,711 --> 00:07:03,110
Take your time.

128
00:07:03,212 --> 00:07:06,010
I expect to be dead
in four.

129
00:07:06,115 --> 00:07:07,412
Let's go, Billy!

130
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,935
Hey, yo, Uncle!

131
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:01,938
Come look at this!

132
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,941
It's 10 after 9:00.
Why aren't you in school?

133
00:08:05,043 --> 00:08:06,738
Tony wants to
sell you this.

134
00:08:06,845 --> 00:08:09,575
Tony. That no-neck dude
they call Bad T?

135
00:08:09,681 --> 00:08:12,946
He says he found it
in a dumpster.

136
00:08:13,051 --> 00:08:15,986
He keeps stealing,
he'll be found in a dumpster.

137
00:08:16,087 --> 00:08:19,022
He didn't steal it.
Says his uncle gave it to him.

138
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,717
Mm-hmm. Hand me
that newspaper over there.

139
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,695
Don't ever let
people use you.

140
00:08:25,798 --> 00:08:28,698
You're running all over town
with stolen property.

141
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,995
If you get caught,

142
00:08:30,102 --> 00:08:33,003
you're in trouble while he denies
the whole thing.

143
00:08:33,105 --> 00:08:35,903
You mean you want us
to take it back to Tony?

144
00:08:36,008 --> 00:08:38,636
No. I'll take it
back to Tony...

145
00:08:38,744 --> 00:08:40,644
with a message.

146
00:08:40,746 --> 00:08:42,145
Now, where you going?

147
00:08:42,248 --> 00:08:43,510
- Why?
- School.

148
00:08:43,616 --> 00:08:44,810
- Why?
- To get educated.

149
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:46,976
So we can go
to college.

150
00:08:47,086 --> 00:08:48,485
And why is that
important?

151
00:08:48,587 --> 00:08:49,645
To get 'espect.

152
00:08:49,755 --> 00:08:51,416
Respect.
Who's the bad guys?

153
00:08:51,523 --> 00:08:52,820
Guys who sell drugs.

154
00:08:52,925 --> 00:08:53,983
Guys who have guns.

155
00:08:54,093 --> 00:08:55,151
Who are the good guys?

156
00:08:55,261 --> 00:08:56,228
We're the good guys.

157
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:57,386
Who's going to help you?

158
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:58,394
Nobody.

159
00:08:58,497 --> 00:08:59,759
Who's going to help you?

160
00:08:59,865 --> 00:09:00,832
We'll help ourselves.

161
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:03,402
Who do we not want
to help us?

162
00:09:03,503 --> 00:09:05,403
- White people.
- White people.

163
00:09:05,505 --> 00:09:08,941
That's right. Get on out of here.
Go to school.

164
00:09:12,212 --> 00:09:14,874
Uncle, you better
come look at this.

165
00:09:14,981 --> 00:09:15,879
What?

166
00:09:15,982 --> 00:09:17,950
A white man
in the street.

167
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:19,018
I've seen one.

168
00:09:19,119 --> 00:09:20,882
Not like this.

169
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:31,628
Dial 911.

170
00:09:31,731 --> 00:09:34,632
Tell the police
to get up here quick.

171
00:09:34,734 --> 00:09:36,599
Somebody's about
to get killed.

172
00:09:36,703 --> 00:09:39,696
And get your butts to school.
You hear me?

173
00:09:39,807 --> 00:09:40,705
Yeah.

174
00:09:40,808 --> 00:09:41,775
All right.

175
00:09:45,746 --> 00:09:47,407
Back off, man.

176
00:10:05,766 --> 00:10:06,960
Morning.

177
00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:09,827
Good morning.

178
00:10:09,937 --> 00:10:12,667
You having
a nice day, sir?

179
00:10:12,773 --> 00:10:14,001
You feeling all right?

180
00:10:14,108 --> 00:10:15,508
Not to get too personal,

181
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,510
but a white man in Harlem

182
00:10:17,612 --> 00:10:20,012
wearing a sign that says,
"I hate niggers"

183
00:10:20,115 --> 00:10:22,174
has either got serious
personal issues,

184
00:10:22,284 --> 00:10:24,775
or not all his dogs
are barking.

185
00:10:24,886 --> 00:10:27,013
Hey, I'm talking to you!

186
00:10:27,122 --> 00:10:28,851
You got about 10 seconds

187
00:10:28,957 --> 00:10:30,356
before those guys
see you,

188
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:32,859
and when they do,
they will kill you.

189
00:10:32,961 --> 00:10:33,859
You understand?

190
00:10:33,962 --> 00:10:37,193
You are about to have
a very bad day.

191
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:38,698
Tell me about it.

192
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,133
Sir, this is a police matter.
For your own safety-

193
00:10:42,237 --> 00:10:44,137
Damn right
it's a police matter.

194
00:10:44,239 --> 00:10:46,639
I suggest you hide
your butt in my shop

195
00:10:46,742 --> 00:10:47,868
till the police
get here.

196
00:10:47,976 --> 00:10:49,375
What the fuck?

197
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,839
Oh, shit.

198
00:10:59,756 --> 00:11:02,657
Listen, I'm a cop.
I'm on a case.

199
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:04,624
Somebody blew up Bonwit Teller's
an hour ago.

200
00:11:04,727 --> 00:11:06,160
Did you hear
about that?

201
00:11:06,262 --> 00:11:09,925
Same asshole that did that
said I got to do this

202
00:11:10,033 --> 00:11:12,001
or he's going to blow up
something else.

203
00:11:12,101 --> 00:11:14,001
You should get
across the street.

204
00:11:14,103 --> 00:11:15,661
Start acting crazy,
like loony tunes,

205
00:11:15,772 --> 00:11:16,670
like Bellevue.

206
00:11:16,773 --> 00:11:18,968
Hey, Zeus.
This your friend?

207
00:11:19,075 --> 00:11:21,509
He look like
a friend of mine?

208
00:11:21,611 --> 00:11:24,341
I think the dude just escaped
from some hospital,

209
00:11:24,447 --> 00:11:25,846
you know,
like Bellevue?

210
00:11:29,787 --> 00:11:33,052
I am the...

211
00:11:33,157 --> 00:11:34,419
voice of my own God.

212
00:11:34,525 --> 00:11:37,688
I told the librarian
that I had a bad headache,

213
00:11:37,795 --> 00:11:39,194
but she didn't
believe me.

214
00:11:39,296 --> 00:11:42,197
I really do have a bad headache,
a very bad headache!

215
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:43,425
My head does not-

216
00:11:43,534 --> 00:11:44,432
Shut the fuck up!

217
00:11:45,803 --> 00:11:47,771
You've made
a very bad mistake.

218
00:11:47,871 --> 00:11:49,202
Bouya his ass.

219
00:11:49,306 --> 00:11:51,206
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha!

220
00:11:51,308 --> 00:11:52,707
Cut that shit off.

221
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,209
Fellas, fellas!

222
00:11:54,311 --> 00:11:55,710
Nature boy here
hates niggers.

223
00:11:55,813 --> 00:11:58,111
What are we going
to do about that?

224
00:11:58,215 --> 00:12:00,149
Hold up, hold up,
hold up!

225
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,444
Oh, shit!

226
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,384
Back! Back up!

227
00:12:08,493 --> 00:12:10,654
Back the fuck up!

228
00:12:10,762 --> 00:12:11,660
Now!

229
00:12:13,231 --> 00:12:14,459
Come on, man,
get up.

230
00:12:14,566 --> 00:12:16,431
Get out of here!

231
00:12:18,002 --> 00:12:20,095
Stop the cab-
stop the goddamn cab!

232
00:12:20,205 --> 00:12:21,638
Don't shoot me!

233
00:12:21,739 --> 00:12:24,173
Get up! Come on, get up!

234
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:25,674
Back off.
I mean it!

235
00:12:25,777 --> 00:12:28,439
I don't want to,
but I will.

236
00:12:28,546 --> 00:12:30,173
Go, go!

237
00:12:30,281 --> 00:12:32,681
Get the fuck
out of here!

238
00:12:32,784 --> 00:12:35,685
Don't stop. Don't stop.
Just keep driving.

239
00:12:35,787 --> 00:12:37,186
Run the red light!

240
00:12:37,288 --> 00:12:39,188
Here, man.
That's all I got.

241
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,191
Put that fucking
money away.

242
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,193
Just run all the lights.
Drive.

243
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:44,694
You got it, boss.

244
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,196
That cut deep?

245
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:48,198
How the hell
would I know?

246
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,665
Just keep pressure
on it.

247
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:50,700
Oh, fuck!

248
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:54,204
Jesus, right?
John McClane. I owe you.

249
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:55,705
Damn right you owe me!

250
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,140
Know what they're doing
to my shop right now?

251
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,211
Chill out.

252
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:01,142
Chill out?
Are you trying to relate to me?

253
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:02,407
Talk like a white man.

254
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:03,641
Look,Jesus,
I'm sorry-

255
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:06,684
Why you keep calling meJesus?
I look Puerto Rican?

256
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:08,650
Guy back there
called you Jesus.

257
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:11,154
He said, " Hey, Zeus. "
My name is Zeus.

258
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,155
Zeus?

259
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:14,658
As in father of Apollo,
Mount Olympus?

260
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,160
Don't-fuck-with-me-

261
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:20,029
or-I'll-shove- a-lightning-bolt-
up-your-ass Zeus!

262
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,896
You got a problem
with that?

263
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:24,163
No. I don't have
a problem with that.

264
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:25,670
Downtown. Police Plaza.

265
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:27,364
Oh, ho. Oh.
That's just great.

266
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:33,979
Record of all callers...

267
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:40,177
Textbook megalomania.

268
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:41,686
It's a pathological state

269
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:44,689
in which fantasies of control
or omnipotence predominate.

270
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,281
He wants control
over him,

271
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:49,294
over his actions, over his thoughts,
even his emotions.

272
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:51,193
Sounds like
a secret admirer,John.

273
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:53,199
Yeah. Maybe he'll
send me flowers.

274
00:13:53,301 --> 00:13:55,201
Everybody knows
you like pansies.

275
00:13:55,303 --> 00:13:56,668
It's not that kind
of emotion.

276
00:13:56,771 --> 00:13:57,897
This guy is ugly.

277
00:13:58,005 --> 00:13:59,063
How is that?

278
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:02,006
Nothing wrong with him
a shower wouldn't cure.

279
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:04,168
Beer's normally taken internally,
John.

280
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:06,644
Just give me some aspirins,
will you?

281
00:14:06,747 --> 00:14:08,044
O.K. Hold this here.

282
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:10,083
This is Fred Schiller,John,

283
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:11,651
and he's a-

284
00:14:11,752 --> 00:14:13,151
Shrink.
Yeah, I got it.

285
00:14:13,254 --> 00:14:14,915
Yes. I was saying that

286
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:16,819
we're dealing
with a megalomaniacal personality

287
00:14:16,924 --> 00:14:18,152
with possible paranoid
schizophrenic-

288
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:20,659
Skip to the part
where you tell me

289
00:14:20,761 --> 00:14:23,662
what the fuck this
has to do with me.

290
00:14:23,764 --> 00:14:24,992
I don't know,

291
00:14:25,099 --> 00:14:27,499
but it does have specifically
to do with you.

292
00:14:27,602 --> 00:14:30,504
This guy wants to pound you
till you crumble,

293
00:14:30,606 --> 00:14:32,506
dance to his tune,
then-

294
00:14:32,608 --> 00:14:34,576
Put on a dress
and fuck me?

295
00:14:34,676 --> 00:14:37,577
I was going to say
kill you.

296
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:40,580
He's sitting on
an awful lot of rage,

297
00:14:40,682 --> 00:14:43,913
and it could be manifested physically
if he's stressed.

298
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:46,487
Somebody he arrested,
somebody he pissed off?

299
00:14:46,588 --> 00:14:48,681
That could be
one long list.

300
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,189
Fuck you,Joe.

301
00:14:50,292 --> 00:14:52,192
These people don't like
to work anonymously.

302
00:14:52,294 --> 00:14:55,695
They want you to know
who's doing it.

303
00:14:55,797 --> 00:14:57,424
This name Simon is probably
not an alias.

304
00:14:57,532 --> 00:14:59,466
It's probably Simon
or some variation.

305
00:14:59,568 --> 00:15:01,229
"Simon, Robert E.
Busted in '86.

306
00:15:01,336 --> 00:15:02,735
Extortion. Kidnapping.
10 to 15.

307
00:15:02,838 --> 00:15:04,636
Did seven years
for good behavior.

308
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,177
Released on a state work furlough
two months ago. "

309
00:15:08,278 --> 00:15:10,644
Thanks. Bob Simon
was a bankrupt businessman

310
00:15:10,747 --> 00:15:12,146
who kidnapped
his partner's daughter.

311
00:15:12,248 --> 00:15:14,148
He's a fuckup,
not a psycho.

312
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,217
The other guy's nuts.

313
00:15:15,318 --> 00:15:18,219
A nut who knows
a lot about bombs.

314
00:15:18,321 --> 00:15:20,152
We found this
in a playground.

315
00:15:20,256 --> 00:15:22,156
Professional.
Very cool stuff.

316
00:15:22,258 --> 00:15:23,657
You know, boom.

317
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,661
Think you should slam it around
like that, Charlie?

318
00:15:26,763 --> 00:15:28,390
It's unmixed.
Can't hurt it.

319
00:15:28,498 --> 00:15:31,058
This stuff is cutting edge,
a binary liquid.

320
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:32,225
A what?

321
00:15:32,335 --> 00:15:33,962
Like epoxy.

322
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,537
Two liquids.

323
00:15:35,638 --> 00:15:38,732
Either one
by itself...

324
00:15:40,243 --> 00:15:41,677
you got nothing.

325
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:43,508
But mix them...

326
00:15:54,758 --> 00:15:55,986
Ricky.

327
00:15:59,363 --> 00:16:00,455
Aah!

328
00:16:00,564 --> 00:16:03,362
Charlie, you'll be wearing that chair
up your ass!

329
00:16:03,467 --> 00:16:05,298
Christ almighty, Charlie!

330
00:16:05,402 --> 00:16:07,302
Like I said,
very cool stuff.

331
00:16:07,404 --> 00:16:08,803
With a package
like this,

332
00:16:08,906 --> 00:16:10,134
you get a warning.

333
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,140
The bomb
has to arm itself.

334
00:16:12,242 --> 00:16:14,642
The red liquid
pumps into the clear

335
00:16:14,745 --> 00:16:15,973
before it detonates.

336
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,480
How long before?

337
00:16:17,582 --> 00:16:19,379
10 seconds, 2 minutes.

338
00:16:19,484 --> 00:16:20,883
Could be anything.

339
00:16:20,985 --> 00:16:23,112
But once it's mixed...

340
00:16:23,221 --> 00:16:24,483
be somewhere else.

341
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:26,989
This stuff has got
to be pretty rare.

342
00:16:27,092 --> 00:16:29,822
Find out if any of it's
missing someplace.

343
00:16:29,928 --> 00:16:32,158
Livermore labs-
theft over the weekend.

344
00:16:32,263 --> 00:16:34,527
Got enough to make
another one,Joe?

345
00:16:34,632 --> 00:16:36,463
About 2,000 pounds.

346
00:16:36,568 --> 00:16:37,796
Of that?

347
00:16:37,902 --> 00:16:39,961
The detonating mechanism
can be anything-

348
00:16:40,071 --> 00:16:41,299
radio, electrical.

349
00:16:41,406 --> 00:16:44,307
You could use a beeper
and phone it in.

350
00:16:44,409 --> 00:16:45,467
Inspector!
It's him.

351
00:16:45,577 --> 00:16:47,807
He's got a feedback
loop on it.

352
00:16:47,912 --> 00:16:49,140
A nasty
little trick-

353
00:16:49,247 --> 00:16:50,680
Charlie. Charlie.

354
00:16:50,782 --> 00:16:51,840
What?

355
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,885
Want to start the trace?

356
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,260
Simon.

357
00:17:03,362 --> 00:17:06,593
He bought a board, walked the street,
and survived.

358
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,100
Where are my pigeons now?

359
00:17:10,202 --> 00:17:11,931
Pigeons?

360
00:17:12,037 --> 00:17:14,437
I had two pigeons,
bright and gay,

361
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,939
fly from me the other day.

362
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,736
Why was it
that they did go?

363
00:17:17,843 --> 00:17:19,401
You cannot tell.
You do not know.

364
00:17:19,512 --> 00:17:21,070
You mean McClane.

365
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,740
No. I mean Santa Claus.

366
00:17:25,684 --> 00:17:27,083
Yeah, I'm here.

367
00:17:27,186 --> 00:17:28,585
Ah. There after all.

368
00:17:28,687 --> 00:17:30,086
And your friend?

369
00:17:30,189 --> 00:17:32,919
Come on.
We need you in the other room.

370
00:17:33,025 --> 00:17:34,425
Let's go. Come on.

371
00:17:34,528 --> 00:17:36,428
They need you. Go.

372
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:37,827
Yeah, he's here, too.

373
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,364
May I speak with him?

374
00:17:41,301 --> 00:17:43,701
Well, is the ebony samaritan
there now?

375
00:17:43,804 --> 00:17:45,704
You got a problem
with ebony?

376
00:17:45,806 --> 00:17:47,706
No, no. My only problem is

377
00:17:47,808 --> 00:17:49,708
that I went
to some trouble

378
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,209
preparing that game
for McClane.

379
00:17:51,311 --> 00:17:53,541
You interfered
with a well-laid plan.

380
00:17:53,647 --> 00:17:55,706
You can stick
your well-laid plan

381
00:17:55,816 --> 00:17:57,147
up your well-laid ass.

382
00:17:59,753 --> 00:18:01,152
That was not smart.

383
00:18:01,254 --> 00:18:03,484
There are lives
at stake here.

384
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,217
Not enough time,
Inspector.

385
00:18:05,325 --> 00:18:07,486
You better hope
he calls back.

386
00:18:07,595 --> 00:18:09,119
He will.

387
00:18:10,498 --> 00:18:11,726
Ricky, tell those people

388
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:14,427
to shut the hell up
out there!

389
00:18:14,535 --> 00:18:15,934
Hey! Keep it down here!

390
00:18:25,446 --> 00:18:27,175
Simon.

391
00:18:27,281 --> 00:18:29,511
He wasn't speaking
for all of us.

392
00:18:29,617 --> 00:18:30,845
That was unpleasant.

393
00:18:30,952 --> 00:18:32,351
Don't let it
happen again.

394
00:18:32,453 --> 00:18:34,182
So what's your name,
boy?

395
00:18:34,288 --> 00:18:35,687
Don't call me boy.

396
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:39,021
I'm sorry.
It was a poor attempt at humor.

397
00:18:39,126 --> 00:18:41,526
I would send you home
with a chiding,

398
00:18:41,629 --> 00:18:43,860
but now I think
you should join the game.

399
00:18:43,966 --> 00:18:46,230
We got him.
A pay phone in Oslo.

400
00:18:46,335 --> 00:18:47,632
Wait. They say it's Mexico.

401
00:18:47,736 --> 00:18:48,634
Norway?

402
00:18:48,737 --> 00:18:50,967
Now they're saying
it's Juarez, Mexico.

403
00:18:51,073 --> 00:18:52,097
Forget it.

404
00:18:52,207 --> 00:18:53,606
He's scrambling up
the system.

405
00:18:53,709 --> 00:18:55,142
They don't know
where he is.

406
00:18:55,244 --> 00:18:58,077
Having fun with the phone company,
are we?

407
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,410
Simon says McClane
and the samaritan

408
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:02,416
will go to
the subway station

409
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:03,746
at 72nd and Broadway.

410
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:05,752
I'll call you
in 15 minutes

411
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:08,084
on the pay phone
outside the station.

412
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,282
No police.

413
00:19:09,391 --> 00:19:11,450
Failure to answer will constitute
noncompliance.

414
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,790
Do you understand me,John?

415
00:19:13,896 --> 00:19:15,454
Oh, yes, I understand.

416
00:19:15,564 --> 00:19:17,464
I understand
you're a fucking wacko

417
00:19:17,566 --> 00:19:19,466
who likes to play
kid's games.

418
00:19:19,568 --> 00:19:20,467
Hardly.

419
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:21,537
Hardly?

420
00:19:21,638 --> 00:19:24,038
Then who are you,
somebody I sent up?

421
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:27,200
What did you do, shoplifting,
purse snatching...

422
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,538
cross-dressing, what?

423
00:19:28,645 --> 00:19:30,545
You c-c-couldn't
catch me

424
00:19:30,647 --> 00:19:33,707
if I stole your ch-chair
with you in it.

425
00:19:33,816 --> 00:19:36,546
My ch-ch-chair
with me in it?

426
00:19:36,653 --> 00:19:39,053
Let me ask you
a question, bonehead-

427
00:19:39,155 --> 00:19:41,555
Why are you trying
to k-k-k-kill me?

428
00:19:41,658 --> 00:19:43,387
John,John,
calm yourself.

429
00:19:43,493 --> 00:19:45,393
Why don't you
come down here

430
00:19:45,495 --> 00:19:48,055
and we'll figure this out
like men?

431
00:19:48,164 --> 00:19:50,394
If killing you
was all I wanted,

432
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,899
you'd be dead by now.

433
00:19:52,001 --> 00:19:53,559
Simon, this is Inspector Cobb.

434
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,900
I can appreciate your feelings
for McClane,

435
00:19:56,005 --> 00:19:58,406
but believe me,
the jerk isn't worth it.

436
00:19:58,509 --> 00:20:01,410
He stepped on so many toes
in this department,

437
00:20:01,512 --> 00:20:03,742
next month he'll be
a security guard.

438
00:20:03,847 --> 00:20:06,247
His wife wants nothing
to do with him,

439
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:09,251
and he's two steps shy
of becoming an alcoholic.

440
00:20:09,353 --> 00:20:11,685
One step, one step.

441
00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:13,518
Now listen to me.

442
00:20:13,624 --> 00:20:16,024
You sound like a real smart guy.

443
00:20:16,126 --> 00:20:17,684
What is it you want?

444
00:20:17,795 --> 00:20:19,695
Are you talking
about money?

445
00:20:19,797 --> 00:20:22,357
Well, whatever, whatever.

446
00:20:22,466 --> 00:20:24,559
McClane is a toilet bug.

447
00:20:24,668 --> 00:20:26,397
Now what would it take

448
00:20:26,503 --> 00:20:29,404
just to forget him
and live happily ever after?

449
00:20:29,506 --> 00:20:30,905
Money is shit to me.

450
00:20:31,008 --> 00:20:32,909
I would not give up McClane

451
00:20:33,011 --> 00:20:35,411
for all the gold
in your Fort Knox.

452
00:20:35,513 --> 00:20:38,277
72nd street subway, pay phone,
15 minutes.

453
00:20:38,383 --> 00:20:39,782
McClane and the samaritan.

454
00:20:39,884 --> 00:20:41,784
If you're competent
in the least,

455
00:20:41,886 --> 00:20:43,114
you've found the briefcase,

456
00:20:43,221 --> 00:20:46,622
so you know what
I mean by penalty.

457
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,060
I want to thank you for that vote
of confidence.

458
00:20:51,162 --> 00:20:53,392
I thought it was
worth a try.

459
00:20:53,498 --> 00:20:54,965
This guy's a raving maniac.

460
00:20:55,066 --> 00:20:56,465
He couldn't be any clearer.

461
00:20:56,568 --> 00:20:59,128
He gave you clues
to his identity,

462
00:20:59,237 --> 00:21:00,465
he spoke German,

463
00:21:00,572 --> 00:21:02,631
he called it
your Fort Knox,

464
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:05,141
and he stammered when McClane
pushed him.

465
00:21:05,243 --> 00:21:07,939
You believe this guy
really can't be bought?

466
00:21:08,046 --> 00:21:10,948
The very mention of money only
enraged him further.

467
00:21:18,891 --> 00:21:20,290
What's that?

468
00:21:20,393 --> 00:21:22,293
It's your shield.

469
00:21:22,395 --> 00:21:25,296
You asking me
to be a cop again?

470
00:21:25,398 --> 00:21:26,956
Ricky, get him his gun.

471
00:21:27,066 --> 00:21:28,795
Hey!

472
00:21:28,901 --> 00:21:31,995
You didn't answer
my question, Walter.

473
00:21:32,104 --> 00:21:34,004
Are you done, Lieutenant?

474
00:21:35,107 --> 00:21:36,506
You two better get going

475
00:21:36,609 --> 00:21:38,804
to get to 72nd street
on time.

476
00:21:38,911 --> 00:21:40,344
Joe, they go with backup.

477
00:21:40,446 --> 00:21:41,674
You got it.

478
00:21:41,781 --> 00:21:44,181
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm not going anywhere.

479
00:21:44,283 --> 00:21:46,184
Simon says you got to go.

480
00:21:46,286 --> 00:21:48,686
I'm not jumping through
hoops for some psycho.

481
00:21:48,789 --> 00:21:51,189
That's a white man
with white problems.

482
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,691
Call me when he crosses
11 Oth street.

483
00:21:53,794 --> 00:21:55,022
Hey.

484
00:21:55,128 --> 00:21:56,493
Why'd you save my ass?

485
00:21:56,596 --> 00:21:57,563
I didn't.

486
00:21:57,664 --> 00:21:59,063
I stopped a white cop

487
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:00,565
from getting killed in Harlem.

488
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:02,396
One white cop
gets killed today,

489
00:22:02,502 --> 00:22:04,402
tomorrow we got
1,000 white cops,

490
00:22:04,504 --> 00:22:07,405
all of them with itchy trigger fingers,
got it?

491
00:22:09,309 --> 00:22:10,901
Get him back.

492
00:22:12,512 --> 00:22:14,002
Where'd you find
that bomb?

493
00:22:14,114 --> 00:22:15,547
Chinatown.

494
00:22:15,649 --> 00:22:17,640
Shit.

495
00:22:17,751 --> 00:22:20,584
Yo. Yo, partner.
Wait up.

496
00:22:20,687 --> 00:22:22,588
Hey, hey,
I ain't your partner,

497
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:25,557
your neighbor, your brother,
or your friend.

498
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,059
I'm your total stranger.

499
00:22:27,161 --> 00:22:29,561
O.K., stranger.

500
00:22:29,664 --> 00:22:31,564
You know where that park is

501
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:33,327
at 115th street
and St. Nicholas?

502
00:22:35,436 --> 00:22:36,767
Yeah. That's in Harlem.

503
00:22:36,871 --> 00:22:39,271
Where do you think
we found that bomb?

504
00:22:39,373 --> 00:22:40,601
Listen,

505
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:43,438
this guy doesn't care
about skin color,

506
00:22:43,544 --> 00:22:45,011
even if you do.

507
00:22:47,215 --> 00:22:48,443
What am I doing?

508
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:50,608
Cheer up. Things could be worse.

509
00:22:50,718 --> 00:22:53,118
I was working
on a nice fat suspension,

510
00:22:53,221 --> 00:22:55,621
smoking cigarettes and watching
Captain Kangaroo.

511
00:22:55,757 --> 00:22:57,054
Come on.

512
00:23:06,335 --> 00:23:08,360
O.K. They made it
to the phone,

513
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,698
but there's a problem.

514
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,033
How big a problem?

515
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,199
Oh, about 300 pounds.

516
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:15,538
Excuse me, ma'am.
We need this phone

517
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,872
for official
police business.

518
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:19,379
Honey, I'm a cop.
I need the phone.

519
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,881
Get off the damn phone, lady.
Police business.

520
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:23,212
Well, I never.

521
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,218
I can get used to this.

522
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,379
Find a phone across the street.

523
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:28,888
I'm the only one here

524
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:30,219
on official police business.

525
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:31,724
Don't do that shit again.

526
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,226
Let's get something
else straight-

527
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:35,889
you need me
more than I need you.

528
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:39,400
You don't like the way
I do things? I quit.

529
00:23:46,409 --> 00:23:48,741
All right, I need you.

530
00:23:54,684 --> 00:23:57,175
I need you more
than you need me.

531
00:24:01,391 --> 00:24:02,619
Hello.

532
00:24:02,725 --> 00:24:04,454
Birds of a feather
flock together.

533
00:24:04,561 --> 00:24:05,960
So do pigs and swine.

534
00:24:06,062 --> 00:24:08,257
Rats and mice
have their chance,

535
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:09,763
as will I have mine.

536
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:10,925
Nice. Rhymes.

537
00:24:11,035 --> 00:24:13,595
Why was the phone busy?
Who were you calling?

538
00:24:13,704 --> 00:24:14,932
The psychic hot line.

539
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,439
I'd advise you
to take this more seriously.

540
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:18,769
What should I say?

541
00:24:18,876 --> 00:24:21,538
Simply say there was
a fat woman on it,

542
00:24:21,645 --> 00:24:24,546
and it took a minute
to get her off.

543
00:24:24,648 --> 00:24:28,049
Now,John, there's a significant amount
of explosive

544
00:24:28,152 --> 00:24:31,553
in the trash receptacle
next to you.

545
00:24:31,655 --> 00:24:34,055
Try to run,
and it goes off now.

546
00:24:34,158 --> 00:24:36,718
I got a hundred
people out here.

547
00:24:36,827 --> 00:24:38,226
That's the point.

548
00:24:38,329 --> 00:24:40,388
Now do I
have your attention?

549
00:24:40,497 --> 00:24:42,055
As I was going to St. Ives,

550
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:43,394
I met a man
with seven wives.

551
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,900
Every wife had seven sacks.
Every sack had seven cats.

552
00:24:46,003 --> 00:24:47,403
Every cat
had seven kittens.

553
00:24:47,505 --> 00:24:49,234
Kittens, cats,
sacks, and wives.

554
00:24:49,341 --> 00:24:50,899
How many were going
to St. Ives?

555
00:24:51,009 --> 00:24:52,237
My phone number is 555-

556
00:24:52,344 --> 00:24:54,574
I didn't get that!
Say it again!

557
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:55,907
Not a chance.

558
00:24:56,014 --> 00:24:57,003
But I didn't-

559
00:24:57,115 --> 00:24:59,345
My phone number
is 555 and the answer.

560
00:24:59,451 --> 00:25:01,681
Call me in 30 seconds
or die.

561
00:25:02,988 --> 00:25:05,218
All right, seven guys
with seven wives-

562
00:25:05,323 --> 00:25:06,551
Shut up, McClane.

563
00:25:06,658 --> 00:25:08,023
Seven guys
with seven wives-

564
00:25:08,126 --> 00:25:10,356
He said seven wives
with seven sacks.

565
00:25:10,462 --> 00:25:13,363
7 times 7 is 49.
Tell me the rest.

566
00:25:13,465 --> 00:25:14,864
A sack with-
seven sacks-

567
00:25:14,966 --> 00:25:17,196
Weren't you listening?
What's wrong with you?

568
00:25:17,302 --> 00:25:18,929
A bad hangover, for one!

569
00:25:19,037 --> 00:25:21,597
All right.
7 wives times 7-49,

570
00:25:21,706 --> 00:25:23,106
with seven cats-

571
00:25:23,209 --> 00:25:24,767
7 times 49 is 343, right?

572
00:25:24,877 --> 00:25:26,105
Asking me
or telling me?

573
00:25:26,212 --> 00:25:29,113
I'm telling you.
343 times 7 is...

574
00:25:29,215 --> 00:25:30,614
21 and a 0... 24.

575
00:25:30,716 --> 00:25:32,115
2,401.
What you got, right?

576
00:25:32,218 --> 00:25:33,276
Yeah.

577
00:25:33,386 --> 00:25:34,614
Is that it? 2401?

578
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,121
That's it. Dial 555-2401.

579
00:25:39,558 --> 00:25:41,617
No, wait, wait!
It's a trick.

580
00:25:41,727 --> 00:25:43,251
I forgot about the man.

581
00:25:43,362 --> 00:25:45,592
Fuck the man!
We got 10 seconds!

582
00:25:45,698 --> 00:25:48,599
He said how many
were going to St. Ives.

583
00:25:48,701 --> 00:25:51,829
The riddle begins,
"as I was going to St. Ives. "

584
00:25:51,938 --> 00:25:53,337
The wives aren't
going anywhere.

585
00:25:53,439 --> 00:25:54,667
What are they doing?

586
00:25:54,774 --> 00:25:56,605
How the hell
should I know?

587
00:25:56,709 --> 00:25:58,609
Well, who's going to St. Ives?

588
00:25:58,711 --> 00:25:59,610
The guy.

589
00:25:59,713 --> 00:26:01,112
Just one guy?

590
00:26:01,214 --> 00:26:02,613
The answer's 1.

591
00:26:02,716 --> 00:26:04,115
How do you dial 1?

592
00:26:04,217 --> 00:26:05,241
555-0001.

593
00:26:05,352 --> 00:26:07,252
001.Just one guy's going.

594
00:26:07,354 --> 00:26:08,252
Hello,John.

595
00:26:08,355 --> 00:26:09,583
Yeah, piece of cake.

596
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,590
Give us something
harder next time.

597
00:26:11,692 --> 00:26:13,091
But you're 10 seconds late.

598
00:26:13,193 --> 00:26:14,888
No, no!
The answer is 1!

599
00:26:14,995 --> 00:26:17,987
There's a bomb in the trash can!
Get down!

600
00:26:22,703 --> 00:26:24,933
Get down! There's a bomb!

601
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:29,599
Welcome to New York.

602
00:26:34,548 --> 00:26:36,278
Yeah. Get up. Come on.

603
00:26:36,384 --> 00:26:37,612
Come on. Let's go.

604
00:26:41,456 --> 00:26:43,515
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

605
00:26:52,467 --> 00:26:53,695
Bomb.

606
00:26:56,137 --> 00:26:58,970
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

607
00:26:59,073 --> 00:27:00,301
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

608
00:27:00,408 --> 00:27:01,466
Yeah.

609
00:27:01,576 --> 00:27:03,806
I didn't say Simon says.

610
00:27:03,911 --> 00:27:05,811
It's 9:50,John.

611
00:27:05,913 --> 00:27:09,007
The number three train
is arriving now.

612
00:27:09,117 --> 00:27:12,519
I left something provocative
on that train,John.

613
00:27:12,621 --> 00:27:15,021
Simon says
get to the pay phone

614
00:27:15,124 --> 00:27:18,025
next to the news kiosk
in Wall Street station

615
00:27:18,127 --> 00:27:19,253
by 10:20,

616
00:27:19,361 --> 00:27:22,194
or the number three train
and its passengers vaporize.

617
00:27:22,297 --> 00:27:24,697
Use any means of travel
other than civilian,

618
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,858
I blow the train.

619
00:27:25,968 --> 00:27:27,367
Attempt to evacuate
the subway,

620
00:27:27,469 --> 00:27:28,697
I blow the train.

621
00:27:28,804 --> 00:27:31,364
I call you in 30 minutes.
be there.

622
00:27:31,473 --> 00:27:32,804
Fuck.

623
00:27:32,908 --> 00:27:36,810
90 blocks in 30 minutes
in New York traffic?

624
00:27:36,912 --> 00:27:38,504
It could be double that.

625
00:27:38,614 --> 00:27:41,014
We don't even have a car!

626
00:27:41,116 --> 00:27:43,175
Hey, hey, sir!
I'm a cop.

627
00:27:43,285 --> 00:27:45,845
I'm requisitioning this car
for official police business.

628
00:27:45,954 --> 00:27:47,752
Thanks very much. Get in.

629
00:27:47,857 --> 00:27:50,257
Pretty slick.
I used to drive a cab.

630
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,590
The fastest way south is-aah!

631
00:27:52,695 --> 00:27:54,595
What the fuck
are you doing?

632
00:27:59,836 --> 00:28:00,768
You were saying?

633
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,771
I was saying
I used to drive a cab,

634
00:28:03,873 --> 00:28:06,273
and 9th avenue is
the fastest way south.

635
00:28:06,376 --> 00:28:08,367
We seem to be going east.

636
00:28:13,783 --> 00:28:15,648
Where the hell
are you going?

637
00:28:15,752 --> 00:28:17,117
9th avenue's
the quickest way-

638
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,778
I know what I'm doing.

639
00:28:18,888 --> 00:28:21,413
Not even God knows
what you're doing!

640
00:28:21,524 --> 00:28:24,187
They're headed east
on 72nd towards the park.

641
00:28:24,295 --> 00:28:25,523
Wall Street is south!

642
00:28:25,629 --> 00:28:27,529
Stop yelling.
I got a headache.

643
00:28:27,631 --> 00:28:30,031
The best way south
is not 9th.

644
00:28:30,134 --> 00:28:31,692
It's through the park.

645
00:28:31,802 --> 00:28:33,565
Oh, dear.

646
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:37,269
I told you Park Drive's
always jammed.

647
00:28:37,374 --> 00:28:39,137
I didn't say Park Drive.

648
00:28:41,745 --> 00:28:43,872
I said through the park.

649
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:49,483
Shit! We lost them
in the park headed south.

650
00:28:50,921 --> 00:28:52,479
Get out of here!

651
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:54,148
What are you, cr-

652
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:02,466
I got him, Connie.
He's taking the scenic route.

653
00:29:03,568 --> 00:29:05,001
Out of the way!

654
00:29:07,939 --> 00:29:09,839
Get out of there!

655
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,180
Watch it, watch it,
watch it, watch it.

656
00:29:17,282 --> 00:29:19,182
Are you aiming
for these people?

657
00:29:19,284 --> 00:29:20,182
No.

658
00:29:20,285 --> 00:29:21,411
Maybe that mime.

659
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,784
Whoa!

660
00:29:23,889 --> 00:29:24,787
Tree! Tree!

661
00:29:30,061 --> 00:29:31,756
What's going on here, man?

662
00:29:37,203 --> 00:29:38,602
Tree! Tree!

663
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:41,529
Hang on.

664
00:29:41,641 --> 00:29:43,199
Rock! Rock! Rock!

665
00:29:58,925 --> 00:30:03,021
McClane!

666
00:30:08,301 --> 00:30:10,792
How do Catholics
do their thing?

667
00:30:10,903 --> 00:30:12,370
North, South, West, East.

668
00:30:12,471 --> 00:30:14,030
How much time?

669
00:30:14,141 --> 00:30:15,335
27 minutes.

670
00:30:15,442 --> 00:30:17,740
Ha! 72nd and Broadway
to Central Park South

671
00:30:17,844 --> 00:30:18,902
in three minutes.

672
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,512
It's got to be
a fucking record.

673
00:30:22,616 --> 00:30:24,015
Come on, get out-

674
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:26,713
Yeah.

675
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,219
Now what?

676
00:30:34,695 --> 00:30:36,128
We need a fire truck.

677
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:37,128
What?

678
00:30:37,231 --> 00:30:38,220
To follow.

679
00:30:42,336 --> 00:30:43,234
911.

680
00:30:43,337 --> 00:30:44,736
<i>LieutenantJohn McClane,
N.Y.P.D..</i>

681
00:30:44,838 --> 00:30:46,066
Access number 7479.

682
00:30:46,173 --> 00:30:47,572
Calling from a civilian
transmitter.

683
00:30:47,674 --> 00:30:49,905
Get me an emergency
dispatcher right away.

684
00:30:50,011 --> 00:30:51,410
Dispatch. Go ahead.

685
00:30:51,512 --> 00:30:52,911
I got two officers down

686
00:30:53,014 --> 00:30:56,506
at 14th street and 9th avenue!
Need an ambulance! Over!

687
00:30:56,618 --> 00:30:59,587
The Roosevelt Hospital
is two blocks from there.

688
00:31:26,815 --> 00:31:28,806
Slow the fuck down,
McClane!

689
00:31:28,917 --> 00:31:30,316
It's like football.

690
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:33,616
Get yourself a blocker
and head for the end zone.

691
00:31:36,191 --> 00:31:38,091
If you'd said
Wall Street,

692
00:31:38,193 --> 00:31:40,593
we could have followed
him all the way.

693
00:31:40,696 --> 00:31:43,221
Wrong. South of 14th street
is a different hospital.

694
00:31:43,332 --> 00:31:44,492
Hang on.

695
00:31:53,509 --> 00:31:55,238
Time?

696
00:31:55,344 --> 00:31:56,868
10:02.

697
00:31:56,979 --> 00:31:59,379
We're halfway there,
with 18 minutes to go.

698
00:31:59,481 --> 00:32:01,506
Fuck this!
Hang on.

699
00:32:14,297 --> 00:32:15,525
Hang on!

700
00:32:15,665 --> 00:32:17,030
Get out of here!

701
00:32:17,133 --> 00:32:18,532
Take the wheel!

702
00:32:18,635 --> 00:32:21,001
We should be ahead
of that train, right?

703
00:32:21,104 --> 00:32:23,004
I'm getting on
that train.

704
00:32:23,106 --> 00:32:26,007
You got to get to
that phone by 10:20.

705
00:32:26,109 --> 00:32:28,009
You fail,
I cover your ass.

706
00:32:28,111 --> 00:32:30,011
I fail,
you cover my ass.

707
00:32:30,113 --> 00:32:31,512
If we both fail?

708
00:32:31,614 --> 00:32:33,013
Then we're both fucked.

709
00:32:33,116 --> 00:32:35,710
Go, now! Get to that
phone booth by 10:20!

710
00:32:35,819 --> 00:32:37,719
My lucky fucking day.

711
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:42,991
Shit!

712
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:44,356
Look out, ma'am!

713
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:48,725
Look out! Look out!

714
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:51,233
Look out!
Get out of the way!

715
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:58,401
This is a bad idea.

716
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:19,624
Whoa!

717
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,368
Excuse me.

718
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:27,369
Excuse me!

719
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:29,906
Get out of
the way, please.

720
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:45,221
112 Wall Street.

721
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:47,723
This isn't a taxi.
You don't understand.

722
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:50,226
Your light's on.
I'll make it simple.

723
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:53,730
112 Wall Street or I'll have
your medallion suspended.

724
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:56,666
What, you don't like
white people?

725
00:33:56,769 --> 00:33:58,669
112 Wall Street.

726
00:33:59,939 --> 00:34:01,702
You got it.

727
00:34:12,785 --> 00:34:15,185
Move your legs!
Get your legs out of the way!

728
00:34:15,288 --> 00:34:16,312
Sorry. Sorry.

729
00:34:28,302 --> 00:34:30,327
Hey! Excuse me.

730
00:34:41,181 --> 00:34:42,079
Hey!

731
00:34:58,866 --> 00:35:00,060
Shit!

732
00:35:00,167 --> 00:35:01,065
Excuse me.

733
00:35:01,168 --> 00:35:02,567
Watch out!

734
00:35:02,669 --> 00:35:05,161
Excuse me, sir.
Pardon me, please. Excuse-

735
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:09,176
Would you step out?

736
00:35:09,277 --> 00:35:12,178
I'm a cop.
step out for a minute.

737
00:35:40,409 --> 00:35:41,808
Excuse me, please.

738
00:35:41,911 --> 00:35:43,811
Can I get
through here, please?

739
00:35:43,913 --> 00:35:44,971
Excuse me.

740
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,139
Excuse me, please.
Pardon me.

741
00:35:47,249 --> 00:35:50,343
Excuse me, but I'm expecting a call.
I need that phone.

742
00:35:50,452 --> 00:35:52,113
Use the other phone.

743
00:35:57,259 --> 00:35:58,658
Sir, please.

744
00:35:58,761 --> 00:36:00,661
I need to use
that phone.

745
00:36:00,763 --> 00:36:03,163
Hey, listen, bro,
I was here first.

746
00:36:03,265 --> 00:36:05,165
Bro?

747
00:36:05,267 --> 00:36:07,667
Get away from
the goddamn phone!

748
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,169
Put your hands up!

749
00:36:25,789 --> 00:36:27,723
I have to answer
that phone.

750
00:36:27,824 --> 00:36:30,384
Shut up and
get 'em in the air!

751
00:36:30,493 --> 00:36:31,892
Excuse me!
Pardon me!

752
00:36:31,995 --> 00:36:33,690
Watch your back!
Watch it!

753
00:36:33,797 --> 00:36:36,527
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm a New York police officer.

754
00:36:36,633 --> 00:36:39,124
I'm going to ask you
to calmly and quietly

755
00:36:39,235 --> 00:36:42,534
start moving toward
the other end of the car.

756
00:36:44,307 --> 00:36:45,365
- Aah!
- Aah!

757
00:36:45,475 --> 00:36:47,067
Go! Watch out!

758
00:36:47,177 --> 00:36:48,576
Watch it! Watch it!

759
00:36:48,678 --> 00:36:49,872
Go!

760
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:54,714
I have to answer

761
00:36:54,819 --> 00:36:56,150
that phone.

762
00:36:56,253 --> 00:36:57,720
Get 'em up!

763
00:36:57,888 --> 00:37:01,881
Look, if you have to shoot me,

764
00:37:01,993 --> 00:37:05,053
then you go ahead
and you shoot me!

765
00:37:05,162 --> 00:37:08,290
But I have to answer
this phone!

766
00:37:08,399 --> 00:37:09,957
All right?

767
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:16,238
I'm here.

768
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,739
And McClane?

769
00:37:17,842 --> 00:37:19,241
He's on his way.

770
00:37:19,343 --> 00:37:22,244
Uh, he's a little slow.
He's out of shape.

771
00:37:22,346 --> 00:37:24,746
The rules applied
to both of you.

772
00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:27,910
I'm afraid this is noncompliance.
Goodbye.

773
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,260
Trust me, guys...

774
00:37:39,731 --> 00:37:40,629
duck.

775
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:20,230
Get out of there!
Get out of there!

776
00:39:11,325 --> 00:39:12,724
McClane?

777
00:39:14,328 --> 00:39:16,228
Hee hee hee hee.

778
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:18,231
Ha ha ha ha ha.

779
00:39:19,834 --> 00:39:21,233
Wha-

780
00:39:21,336 --> 00:39:22,735
Ha ha ha.

781
00:39:22,837 --> 00:39:25,362
Ha ha ha ha ha.

782
00:39:25,473 --> 00:39:27,873
You can see right down
into the subway.

783
00:39:27,976 --> 00:39:29,603
How many fire trucks?

784
00:39:29,711 --> 00:39:30,609
You guys.
You guys.

785
00:39:30,712 --> 00:39:32,646
How can you see
from up here?

786
00:39:32,747 --> 00:39:34,408
Get in there.

787
00:39:34,516 --> 00:39:37,747
Officer, tell those people
to get the hell back!

788
00:39:37,852 --> 00:39:40,252
We got a shitload
of cuts and bruises,

789
00:39:40,355 --> 00:39:41,754
a couple of concussions,

790
00:39:41,856 --> 00:39:43,756
some old guy's
pacemaker stopped,

791
00:39:43,858 --> 00:39:46,759
and a pregnant girl's water broke,
and that's all.

792
00:39:46,861 --> 00:39:47,759
How you doing,John?

793
00:39:47,862 --> 00:39:49,762
Still can't hear too good.

794
00:39:49,864 --> 00:39:51,764
It's a miracle
you're still alive.

795
00:39:51,866 --> 00:39:53,767
Yeah, that's the problem,Joe.

796
00:39:53,869 --> 00:39:54,927
What?

797
00:39:55,037 --> 00:39:56,334
The miracle part.

798
00:39:56,438 --> 00:40:00,272
What are the odds of us
making it here on time?

799
00:40:00,376 --> 00:40:01,274
Zip.

800
00:40:01,377 --> 00:40:04,278
That bomb was going off
no matter what.

801
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:07,611
He wanted it to go off
right down here.

802
00:40:07,716 --> 00:40:09,308
What's so special
about this place?

803
00:40:09,418 --> 00:40:11,818
I don't know.
Something just doesn't add up.

804
00:40:11,921 --> 00:40:13,411
Lieutenant McClane?

805
00:40:13,522 --> 00:40:15,649
They're asking for you
and Mr. Carver.

806
00:40:17,393 --> 00:40:18,587
Where?

807
00:40:18,694 --> 00:40:19,888
John.

808
00:40:21,397 --> 00:40:25,800
John, this is Andy Cross
with the FBI.

809
00:40:25,901 --> 00:40:27,801
Mr. Jarvis. He's, uh-

810
00:40:27,903 --> 00:40:30,532
I'm, uh,
with another agency.

811
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,540
It's good to meet you.

812
00:40:32,642 --> 00:40:34,303
This is Lieutenant McClane.

813
00:40:34,411 --> 00:40:36,038
This is Mr. Carver.

814
00:40:36,146 --> 00:40:39,343
Uh, we got a couple of questions.
First...

815
00:40:39,449 --> 00:40:41,349
do you recognize this guy?

816
00:40:45,822 --> 00:40:46,880
No.

817
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:49,288
How about this one?

818
00:40:53,096 --> 00:40:54,154
Mm-mm.

819
00:40:54,264 --> 00:40:55,856
How about you?

820
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,361
Did you recognize
the voice on the phone?

821
00:40:59,469 --> 00:41:01,266
No.

822
00:41:01,371 --> 00:41:02,838
Did you, uh,

823
00:41:02,939 --> 00:41:06,637
notice any cars
following you?

824
00:41:08,112 --> 00:41:09,238
No.

825
00:41:09,347 --> 00:41:11,247
Anybody following
you at all?

826
00:41:11,349 --> 00:41:12,509
Any kind
of surveillance-

827
00:41:12,617 --> 00:41:15,279
telephone, house,
anything unusual at all?

828
00:41:16,554 --> 00:41:19,114
Well, now that
you mention it,

829
00:41:19,223 --> 00:41:20,781
I have experienced a...

830
00:41:20,892 --> 00:41:22,792
you know,
like a burning sensation

831
00:41:22,894 --> 00:41:24,327
between my toes.

832
00:41:24,428 --> 00:41:26,828
I thought it was just some
athlete's foot

833
00:41:26,931 --> 00:41:28,159
or something.

834
00:41:29,901 --> 00:41:31,801
We read your jacket,
Lieutenant.

835
00:41:31,903 --> 00:41:34,804
We were told you
would be cooperative.

836
00:41:34,906 --> 00:41:36,305
Cooperate with what?

837
00:41:36,407 --> 00:41:37,806
We're wasting time here.

838
00:41:37,909 --> 00:41:39,376
You want to share
information,

839
00:41:39,477 --> 00:41:41,946
how about sending
a little our way?

840
00:41:42,047 --> 00:41:44,379
We want to hear
what he knows first.

841
00:41:44,483 --> 00:41:46,576
We want to hear
what he knows first.

842
00:41:46,685 --> 00:41:49,586
I know as much as you know,
all right?

843
00:41:49,688 --> 00:41:52,589
There's a guy out there
setting off bombs.

844
00:41:52,691 --> 00:41:54,090
He calls himself Simon.

845
00:41:54,192 --> 00:41:56,524
He speaks with
a German accent.

846
00:41:56,628 --> 00:41:59,358
For some reason,
he's very angry with me.

847
00:41:59,464 --> 00:42:02,365
Maybe you can tell me why,
fellas, huh?

848
00:42:07,372 --> 00:42:10,068
The first man there
is Mathias Targo.

849
00:42:10,175 --> 00:42:12,268
Was Hungarian army,
explosives expert.

850
00:42:12,377 --> 00:42:14,777
Now we believe he's working
for the Iranians.

851
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,778
Working?

852
00:42:15,881 --> 00:42:17,075
Freelance terrorism,

853
00:42:17,182 --> 00:42:18,912
by contract.

854
00:42:19,018 --> 00:42:20,781
Who's the girl?

855
00:42:20,887 --> 00:42:22,286
Targo's other half.

856
00:42:22,388 --> 00:42:24,788
Rumor is the Israelis
slipped a bomb

857
00:42:24,891 --> 00:42:25,789
in between their sheets.

858
00:42:25,892 --> 00:42:26,916
He wasn't at home,

859
00:42:27,026 --> 00:42:28,926
but they think they got her.

860
00:42:29,028 --> 00:42:31,428
The second man
was an obscure colonel

861
00:42:31,531 --> 00:42:33,431
in the East German army.

862
00:42:33,533 --> 00:42:34,795
Ran an infiltration unit,

863
00:42:34,901 --> 00:42:38,302
the thing the Nazis did
at the Battle of the Bulge-

864
00:42:38,404 --> 00:42:39,632
English-speaking troops.

865
00:42:39,739 --> 00:42:40,967
I saw the movie.

866
00:42:41,074 --> 00:42:43,235
All we know of him is

867
00:42:43,343 --> 00:42:47,245
the GDR medical records show he suffers
from migraines.

868
00:42:47,347 --> 00:42:49,076
His name is Peter...

869
00:42:49,182 --> 00:42:50,376
Kreig.

870
00:42:51,617 --> 00:42:55,019
Well, that is an exceptional report,
fellas.

871
00:42:55,122 --> 00:42:57,955
What does this
have to do with me?

872
00:42:58,058 --> 00:43:01,653
The name Gruber mean anything to you,
Lieutenant?

873
00:43:06,066 --> 00:43:07,966
It rings a bell, yeah.

874
00:43:08,068 --> 00:43:08,966
L.A.

875
00:43:09,069 --> 00:43:10,058
What?

876
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:13,071
That thing in the building
in L.A.

877
00:43:14,375 --> 00:43:16,275
Peter Kreig

878
00:43:16,377 --> 00:43:19,710
was born Simon Peter...

879
00:43:19,813 --> 00:43:20,780
Gruber.

880
00:43:20,881 --> 00:43:25,113
He's Hans Gruber's brother.

881
00:43:29,156 --> 00:43:30,282
So...

882
00:43:30,391 --> 00:43:32,792
Yeah. It's that thing in L.A.

883
00:43:32,894 --> 00:43:36,295
We figured he's got you fitted up
for a toe tag,

884
00:43:36,398 --> 00:43:38,298
and he's going
to do anything

885
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,799
to get it tied.

886
00:43:39,901 --> 00:43:41,459
Inspector!

887
00:43:41,569 --> 00:43:42,536
Inspector, it's him.

888
00:43:43,905 --> 00:43:46,499
Don't let him know
we're here.

889
00:43:49,044 --> 00:43:50,636
Simon.

890
00:43:50,745 --> 00:43:51,939
Inspector.

891
00:43:52,047 --> 00:43:55,448
Now, who from the FBI
is in the van?

892
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,381
Let's see,
almost certainly Cross.

893
00:43:57,485 --> 00:43:59,385
Come on, Andrew,
say hello.

894
00:43:59,487 --> 00:44:00,511
Hello.

895
00:44:00,622 --> 00:44:02,522
And I know
you never run alone,

896
00:44:02,624 --> 00:44:04,023
so say hello, Bill.

897
00:44:04,125 --> 00:44:07,027
Still trying to butch up
by chewing on your glasses?

898
00:44:07,129 --> 00:44:08,756
Ha ha ha ha.

899
00:44:08,864 --> 00:44:11,264
This, gentlemen, as they say,

900
00:44:11,367 --> 00:44:14,393
is where the plot thickens.

901
00:44:14,503 --> 00:44:16,903
I have put 2,400 pounds
of explosives

902
00:44:17,006 --> 00:44:19,907
in one of the 1,446 schools
in greater New York.

903
00:44:20,009 --> 00:44:21,909
It is fitted with a timer

904
00:44:22,011 --> 00:44:24,912
set to explode
at exactly 3 p. m.

905
00:44:25,014 --> 00:44:26,879
Thank you.

906
00:44:26,982 --> 00:44:28,779
Your silence says
I'm understood.

907
00:44:28,884 --> 00:44:31,284
Did you say
2,400 pounds?

908
00:44:31,387 --> 00:44:33,287
Yes, but please
don't interrupt again.

909
00:44:33,389 --> 00:44:36,722
Simon says, if you attempt
to evacuate schools,

910
00:44:36,826 --> 00:44:39,226
the bomb will be detonated
by radio.

911
00:44:39,328 --> 00:44:41,228
Gentlemen,
someone will be watching.

912
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:44,232
Repeat-one school
will be dismissed at 3 p. m.

913
00:44:44,334 --> 00:44:45,232
permanently, unless-

914
00:44:45,335 --> 00:44:46,563
Unless what?

915
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:48,797
Unless John McClane
and his new best friend

916
00:44:48,905 --> 00:44:50,805
complete the tasks
I set them.

917
00:44:50,907 --> 00:44:52,772
John, are you listening?

918
00:44:54,377 --> 00:44:55,969
Yeah.

919
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:57,910
There's a pay phone
beyond hope,

920
00:44:58,014 --> 00:44:58,912
Tompkins Square Park.

921
00:44:59,015 --> 00:45:01,609
20 minutes, go by foot.
No rush.

922
00:45:01,718 --> 00:45:03,413
If you're really clever,

923
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,216
you'll learn the location of the bomb
and the disarming code.

924
00:45:06,323 --> 00:45:07,847
By the way, gentlemen,

925
00:45:07,958 --> 00:45:11,257
we got something of a bargain
on radio detonators.

926
00:45:11,361 --> 00:45:12,760
The only problem is

927
00:45:12,863 --> 00:45:15,764
the darn things respond
to police and FBI frequencies.

928
00:45:15,866 --> 00:45:19,564
If I were you,
I'd keep off your radios.

929
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:20,762
Simon, wait-

930
00:45:25,376 --> 00:45:29,779
2,400 pounds of that liquid stuff.
My God!

931
00:45:29,881 --> 00:45:32,179
Get me the commissioner.

932
00:45:32,283 --> 00:45:34,183
He's doing
a press conference.

933
00:45:34,285 --> 00:45:35,980
He'll be here
in 30 minutes.

934
00:45:36,087 --> 00:45:38,988
Get every senior officer
on the site right away.

935
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:40,785
Don't give me
any jurisdictional nonsense.

936
00:45:40,892 --> 00:45:43,986
I got two kids in the school
on 64th street.

937
00:45:44,095 --> 00:45:45,619
How can I help?

938
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:47,630
How many men
have you got?

939
00:45:47,732 --> 00:45:50,496
75. I push the panic button,
I can get 500.

940
00:45:50,601 --> 00:45:51,499
When?

941
00:45:51,602 --> 00:45:52,500
2:30, 3:00.

942
00:45:52,603 --> 00:45:54,503
Between now and then...

943
00:45:54,605 --> 00:45:57,439
we're going to have to
do this all by ourselves.

944
00:45:57,543 --> 00:45:59,511
Let's go.

945
00:45:59,611 --> 00:46:02,011
Tompkins Square Park
is more than 2 miles away.

946
00:46:02,114 --> 00:46:04,514
Get running. No radios.
Take my telephone.

947
00:46:04,616 --> 00:46:07,517
You get anything,
call me through the switchboard.

948
00:46:07,619 --> 00:46:08,677
Good luck.

949
00:46:08,787 --> 00:46:10,687
Thanks.
Find that bomb.

950
00:46:10,789 --> 00:46:12,256
Ricky, where are they?

951
00:46:12,357 --> 00:46:14,484
Right over here.

952
00:46:14,626 --> 00:46:16,992
The senior man present
is Chief Allen.

953
00:46:17,095 --> 00:46:18,494
- Chief of what?
- Transit.

954
00:46:18,597 --> 00:46:19,495
Thanks, Ricky.

955
00:46:19,598 --> 00:46:21,998
Gentlemen,
we have a decision to make.

956
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:24,500
Chief Allen,
the man who has done this

957
00:46:24,603 --> 00:46:27,504
has told us he's planted
a very large bomb

958
00:46:27,606 --> 00:46:29,506
in a New York school.

959
00:46:29,608 --> 00:46:31,508
He's told us
we cannot evacuate,

960
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:34,478
but he has not said
we cannot search.

961
00:46:34,581 --> 00:46:37,482
I recommend we get everybody,
and I mean everybody-

962
00:46:37,584 --> 00:46:40,485
police, transit,
sanitation, fire,

963
00:46:40,587 --> 00:46:41,986
even the goddamn
librarians-

964
00:46:42,088 --> 00:46:43,783
and we start
searching schools,

965
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:45,517
and I mean right now.

966
00:46:45,625 --> 00:46:48,025
I'm talking about
a thousand buildings,

967
00:46:48,127 --> 00:46:51,221
and we have 3 hours and 15 minutes
to do it.

968
00:46:51,331 --> 00:46:54,232
I'd like to keep the media
out of this

969
00:46:54,334 --> 00:46:57,167
because if they get in,
we've got a panic.

970
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:59,170
Are we in agreement?

971
00:46:59,272 --> 00:47:01,172
Come on, guys, let's go!

972
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:18,757
They bought it.

973
00:47:20,427 --> 00:47:22,361
You can begin.

974
00:47:37,211 --> 00:47:38,371
Hook...

975
00:47:38,479 --> 00:47:39,946
line...

976
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:44,946
and sinker.

977
00:47:49,824 --> 00:47:52,418
You heard the man.
Let's go, let's go.

978
00:47:53,928 --> 00:47:55,327
Come on.

979
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:56,897
Go. Let's go.

980
00:48:07,809 --> 00:48:09,208
O.K. Hold on.

981
00:48:09,311 --> 00:48:11,245
Darlene, honey, it's me.

982
00:48:26,195 --> 00:48:27,856
Sergeant Turley.

983
00:48:27,963 --> 00:48:29,294
Sergeant Turley!

984
00:48:29,398 --> 00:48:32,390
In five minutes,
the volume in calls has tripled.

985
00:48:32,501 --> 00:48:33,866
What the hell's going on?

986
00:48:33,969 --> 00:48:35,937
Stop. Let me explain.

987
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:37,938
For the rest of the day,

988
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,974
we're handling the department's
communications.

989
00:48:40,076 --> 00:48:41,873
What do you mean, handle?

990
00:48:41,977 --> 00:48:43,842
They're shutting down
the police band.

991
00:48:43,946 --> 00:48:46,312
All calls will be coming through
this switchboard.

992
00:48:46,415 --> 00:48:48,645
And I'm going to marry
Donald Trump.

993
00:48:48,751 --> 00:48:50,776
Walsh, what's going on?

994
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:53,252
Why did everybody
tear out of here?

995
00:48:53,356 --> 00:48:54,789
Pamela, look at your watch.

996
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,687
It's coming up
on shift change.

997
00:48:56,792 --> 00:48:59,193
The bean counters
are worried about overtime.

998
00:48:59,296 --> 00:49:00,695
Everybody went
to punch out.

999
00:49:00,797 --> 00:49:03,163
The next shift
will be here soon.

1000
00:49:03,266 --> 00:49:05,564
You are so full of shit, Walsh!

1001
00:49:05,669 --> 00:49:07,796
Thank you.

1002
00:49:14,711 --> 00:49:16,338
What the hell?

1003
00:49:26,223 --> 00:49:27,815
Hey. Whoa. Whoa.

1004
00:49:27,924 --> 00:49:28,822
Whoa.

1005
00:49:28,925 --> 00:49:30,290
Detective.

1006
00:49:30,394 --> 00:49:31,952
Bob Thompson...

1007
00:49:32,062 --> 00:49:34,554
City Engineer's Office.

1008
00:49:34,665 --> 00:49:37,566
We'd like to get an idea
of the damage.

1009
00:49:39,303 --> 00:49:42,500
Man, you guys
really got here fast.

1010
00:49:43,708 --> 00:49:45,335
Well...

1011
00:49:45,443 --> 00:49:47,411
it's Wall Street, sir.

1012
00:49:47,512 --> 00:49:49,639
A lot of money here.

1013
00:49:49,747 --> 00:49:51,977
A lot of opinion-makers...

1014
00:49:52,083 --> 00:49:56,019
the mayor doesn't want to piss off,
you know?

1015
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,519
Is this it?

1016
00:50:00,658 --> 00:50:03,821
Holy Toledo!

1017
00:50:03,928 --> 00:50:06,021
Somebody had fun.

1018
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:07,529
I'd appreciate it

1019
00:50:07,632 --> 00:50:10,932
if you'd show my associates
the way down.

1020
00:50:12,905 --> 00:50:14,304
Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

1021
00:50:14,406 --> 00:50:17,307
Jimmy, you got the flashlight?

1022
00:50:17,409 --> 00:50:19,673
Murphy, come on. You, too.

1023
00:50:19,778 --> 00:50:20,938
Rick Walsh.

1024
00:50:21,046 --> 00:50:22,070
John Thompson.

1025
00:50:22,181 --> 00:50:24,081
Come on, gentlemen.
Let's go.

1026
00:50:27,653 --> 00:50:29,052
You were at World Trade's.

1027
00:50:29,154 --> 00:50:30,951
You know what
that mess was.

1028
00:51:03,823 --> 00:51:05,222
Please inform Mr. Little

1029
00:51:05,325 --> 00:51:07,350
that Mr. Vanderfluge is here.

1030
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:09,360
Mr. Vanderfluge.

1031
00:51:11,197 --> 00:51:14,166
There's a Mr. Vanderfluge
for Mr. Little.

1032
00:51:28,716 --> 00:51:31,116
Go down 20 meters.

1033
00:51:31,218 --> 00:51:32,150
Come on.

1034
00:51:32,253 --> 00:51:33,652
A lot of steam.

1035
00:51:33,754 --> 00:51:35,153
We snapped
some steam pipes.

1036
00:51:35,256 --> 00:51:36,655
It's like a sauna.

1037
00:51:36,757 --> 00:51:39,317
The subway guys shut
down the third rail.

1038
00:51:39,426 --> 00:51:40,324
Emergency lighting?

1039
00:51:40,427 --> 00:51:41,826
Emergency lights
and there's some-

1040
00:51:41,929 --> 00:51:42,827
Hey!

1041
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:44,488
No shooting!

1042
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:46,566
Speak English!

1043
00:51:46,667 --> 00:51:49,033
Otto doesn't speak English.
do you, Otto?

1044
00:51:49,136 --> 00:51:51,127
Where did we
get this guy?

1045
00:51:51,238 --> 00:51:52,637
One ofTargo's thugs.

1046
00:51:54,775 --> 00:51:56,174
Go all the way up.

1047
00:51:56,277 --> 00:51:57,938
All the way.

1048
00:52:04,753 --> 00:52:06,653
So what's up with
this L.A. thing?

1049
00:52:06,755 --> 00:52:08,154
You famous or something?

1050
00:52:08,256 --> 00:52:09,621
Yeah. For about five minutes.

1051
00:52:09,724 --> 00:52:11,453
Don't tell me.
Rodney King, right?

1052
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,458
Fuck you.

1053
00:52:12,561 --> 00:52:14,028
You know this guy Simon?

1054
00:52:14,129 --> 00:52:15,153
Yeah.

1055
00:52:15,263 --> 00:52:18,130
I threw his little brother
off the 32nd floor

1056
00:52:18,233 --> 00:52:20,133
of Nakatomi Towers
out in L.A.

1057
00:52:20,235 --> 00:52:21,634
I guess he's pissed off.

1058
00:52:21,736 --> 00:52:24,569
Wait. I'm in this shit
'cause some white cop

1059
00:52:24,673 --> 00:52:27,073
threw some white asshole's
brother off a roof?

1060
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,179
Mr. Vanderfluge.
Felix Little,

1061
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:15,189
Corporate relations.

1062
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:16,691
Sorry you had to wait,

1063
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:18,693
but there was
a subway explosion.

1064
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:20,558
It's played hell
with our alarms.

1065
00:53:20,664 --> 00:53:22,063
I trust there's
nothing wrong?

1066
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:23,564
No. Good Lord, no.

1067
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:25,066
Safe and secure.

1068
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:27,796
You were concerned
about a currency exchange.

1069
00:53:27,904 --> 00:53:31,305
We are not a commercial bank
in the normal sense.

1070
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:34,241
We're... we're
primarily, uh...

1071
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:35,242
governments, central banks,

1072
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:36,710
that sort of thing.

1073
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:38,974
Apart from the depository,
of course.

1074
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:40,242
Of course.

1075
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:43,251
And you are in the flower business,
Mr. Vanderfluge?

1076
00:53:47,091 --> 00:53:48,149
Back! Back!

1077
00:53:48,259 --> 00:53:49,157
Come on!

1078
00:54:13,885 --> 00:54:14,943
Come on.

1079
00:54:29,234 --> 00:54:30,633
Oh, no,
Mr. Vanderfluge.

1080
00:54:30,736 --> 00:54:33,227
That's the vault
elevator.

1081
00:54:33,338 --> 00:54:34,532
I'm sorry.

1082
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,972
Our alarms are
sonic and seismic.

1083
00:54:37,076 --> 00:54:40,239
Two things which do not react well
to explosions.

1084
00:54:40,345 --> 00:54:43,781
This subway business has knocked out
all of our systems.

1085
00:54:43,882 --> 00:54:46,817
In fact, we gave up
and pulled the plug.

1086
00:54:46,919 --> 00:54:48,784
The repair people
are downstairs now.

1087
00:54:48,887 --> 00:54:49,785
Good Lord.

1088
00:54:49,888 --> 00:54:50,912
Yeah.

1089
00:54:51,023 --> 00:54:54,424
Heavens to Betsy!
If anyone knew. Ha ha ha.

1090
00:54:56,762 --> 00:55:00,927
But... I thought this
was a currency exchange.

1091
00:55:01,034 --> 00:55:04,401
Oh, I think we go straight
to the withdrawal.

1092
00:55:52,586 --> 00:55:53,484
Hey, Captain,

1093
00:55:53,587 --> 00:55:55,282
come and take
a look at this.

1094
00:55:55,389 --> 00:55:56,720
Something's going on.

1095
00:55:57,825 --> 00:55:59,759
You think you
can fix that?

1096
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:00,827
Just a minute now.

1097
00:56:05,499 --> 00:56:06,761
O.K.
I'll be right back.

1098
00:56:06,867 --> 00:56:07,765
Down!

1099
00:56:12,733 --> 00:56:14,894
Stay back!

1100
00:56:15,002 --> 00:56:16,128
Stay back!

1101
00:56:49,771 --> 00:56:52,501
Come on. Come on!

1102
00:57:02,584 --> 00:57:03,516
Front desk.

1103
00:57:03,619 --> 00:57:06,850
Get your ass down here!
I'm under attack!

1104
00:57:06,955 --> 00:57:10,118
Just relax.
Maybe you'll live through this.

1105
00:57:10,292 --> 00:57:11,725
Shit!

1106
00:57:15,564 --> 00:57:16,462
Aah!

1107
00:57:16,565 --> 00:57:17,589
Aah!

1108
00:57:17,699 --> 00:57:18,597
Aah!

1109
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:19,598
Aah!

1110
00:57:19,701 --> 00:57:20,599
Aah!

1111
00:57:20,702 --> 00:57:22,192
Aah!

1112
00:57:22,304 --> 00:57:23,202
Aah!

1113
00:57:24,306 --> 00:57:25,535
Aah!

1114
00:57:25,642 --> 00:57:27,166
Aah!

1115
00:57:33,149 --> 00:57:36,312
I think he's dead,
my dear.

1116
00:57:39,255 --> 00:57:41,621
All right.
Let's see to the office workers.

1117
00:57:41,724 --> 00:57:43,919
Being done,
Herr Oberst.

1118
00:57:46,763 --> 00:57:48,162
Is this where...

1119
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:51,290
Perimeter secure,
Herr Oberst.

1120
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:29,631
$140 billion!

1121
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:32,641
10 times
what's in Kentucky!

1122
00:58:32,743 --> 00:58:35,143
Fort Knox. Hah!

1123
00:58:35,245 --> 00:58:36,712
It's for tourists!

1124
00:58:50,261 --> 00:58:51,159
Yeah?

1125
00:58:51,262 --> 00:58:52,160
McClane.

1126
00:58:52,263 --> 00:58:54,163
John,
you're out of shape.

1127
00:58:54,265 --> 00:58:55,664
You barely made it.

1128
00:58:55,767 --> 00:58:57,166
We'll barely make it.

1129
00:58:57,268 --> 00:58:59,668
What do you want us
to do?

1130
00:58:59,771 --> 00:59:01,068
What has four legs

1131
00:59:01,172 --> 00:59:03,197
and is always ready
to travel?

1132
00:59:03,308 --> 00:59:04,206
Huh?

1133
00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:06,709
What did he say?

1134
00:59:06,811 --> 00:59:09,712
What has four legs
and is always ready to travel?

1135
00:59:09,814 --> 00:59:11,111
Don't you have kids?

1136
00:59:11,216 --> 00:59:12,649
That's an elephant joke.

1137
00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:19,614
Whoa.

1138
00:59:19,725 --> 00:59:21,124
That a bomb?

1139
00:59:21,227 --> 00:59:23,127
Yeah. Go ahead and grab it.

1140
00:59:23,229 --> 00:59:24,628
No. You're the cop.

1141
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:27,130
You're supposed to be
helping with this.

1142
00:59:27,233 --> 00:59:28,131
I'm helping.

1143
00:59:28,234 --> 00:59:29,633
When you going
to start helping?

1144
00:59:29,735 --> 00:59:31,862
After you get the bomb.

1145
00:59:49,255 --> 00:59:50,154
Careful.

1146
00:59:50,257 --> 00:59:51,451
I'm being careful.

1147
00:59:51,558 --> 00:59:52,718
Don't open it.

1148
00:59:52,826 --> 00:59:53,724
What?

1149
00:59:53,827 --> 00:59:55,727
I got to open it.

1150
00:59:55,829 --> 00:59:58,957
It's going to be
all right.

1151
01:00:09,276 --> 01:00:10,106
Shit!

1152
01:00:10,277 --> 01:00:11,107
Shit!

1153
01:00:11,211 --> 01:00:13,406
I told you
not to open it!

1154
01:00:17,751 --> 01:00:20,151
I trust you see
the message.

1155
01:00:20,253 --> 01:00:22,153
It has a proximity circuit,

1156
01:00:22,255 --> 01:00:23,654
so please don't run.

1157
01:00:23,757 --> 01:00:25,156
We're not going to run.

1158
01:00:25,258 --> 01:00:27,159
How do we turn
this off?

1159
01:00:27,261 --> 01:00:29,229
On the fountain
are two jugs.

1160
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:32,299
Do you see them?
A 5 gallon and a 3 gallon.

1161
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:36,803
Fill one jug with exactly
4 gallons of water.

1162
01:00:36,904 --> 01:00:40,601
Place it on the scale,
and the timer will stop.

1163
01:00:40,708 --> 01:00:41,936
You must be precise.

1164
01:00:42,043 --> 01:00:43,943
1 ounce or more or less

1165
01:00:44,045 --> 01:00:45,569
will result in detonation.

1166
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:48,308
- If you're still alive in
five minutes- - Wait a second!

1167
01:00:51,752 --> 01:00:54,152
I don't get it.
Do you get it?

1168
01:00:54,255 --> 01:00:55,153
No.

1169
01:00:56,757 --> 01:00:58,691
Get the jugs.

1170
01:01:00,261 --> 01:01:04,790
Obviously, we can't fill the 3-gallon
jug with 4 gallons, right?

1171
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:06,800
I know. Here we go.

1172
01:01:06,902 --> 01:01:09,666
We fill the 3-gallon jug
exactly to the top, right?

1173
01:01:09,771 --> 01:01:10,669
Uh-huh.

1174
01:01:10,772 --> 01:01:13,206
We pour that 3 gallons
into the 5-gallon jug,

1175
01:01:13,308 --> 01:01:16,106
giving us 3 gallons
in a 5-gallon jug.

1176
01:01:16,211 --> 01:01:17,178
Then what?

1177
01:01:17,279 --> 01:01:20,180
We take the 3-gallon jug,
fill it a third-

1178
01:01:20,282 --> 01:01:22,477
He said be precise.
Exactly 4 gallons.

1179
01:01:22,584 --> 01:01:23,778
Every cop's running
his ass off,

1180
01:01:23,886 --> 01:01:26,787
and I'm out here playing kid's games
in the park.

1181
01:01:26,889 --> 01:01:31,121
Hey! You want to focus
on the problem at hand?

1182
01:01:47,343 --> 01:01:50,244
You said, don't say anything
if you don't know!

1183
01:01:50,346 --> 01:01:52,644
Give me the fucking jug!
We're starting over!

1184
01:01:52,749 --> 01:01:54,148
We can't start over!

1185
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:56,445
I'll put my foot
up your ass,

1186
01:01:56,553 --> 01:01:57,747
you dumb mother-

1187
01:01:57,854 --> 01:01:59,048
Say it! Say it!

1188
01:01:59,155 --> 01:02:02,056
You were going to call me a nigger,
weren't you?

1189
01:02:02,158 --> 01:02:04,058
I wasn't!
Yes, you were!

1190
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:05,388
Asshole! How's that? Asshole!

1191
01:02:05,495 --> 01:02:07,827
You got some fucking problem
because I'm white?

1192
01:02:07,931 --> 01:02:09,159
Have I oppressed you?

1193
01:02:09,265 --> 01:02:11,597
Have I oppressed
your people somehow?

1194
01:02:11,701 --> 01:02:14,603
You don't like me
'cause you're a racist!

1195
01:02:14,705 --> 01:02:15,831
What?

1196
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:18,170
You don't like me
'cause I'm white!

1197
01:02:18,275 --> 01:02:21,176
I don't like you because you're going
to get me killed!

1198
01:02:21,278 --> 01:02:24,179
Shit! We got
less than a minute.

1199
01:02:24,281 --> 01:02:25,680
Throw this thing away.

1200
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:27,410
We can't!
It'll detonate!

1201
01:02:27,518 --> 01:02:30,112
Wait a second!
Wait a second!

1202
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:33,121
I got it!
Exactly 2 gallons in here, right?

1203
01:02:33,223 --> 01:02:35,123
Leaving 1 gallon
of empty space.

1204
01:02:35,225 --> 01:02:36,214
Yeah.

1205
01:02:36,327 --> 01:02:38,227
A full 5 gallons here,
right?

1206
01:02:38,329 --> 01:02:41,628
pour 1 gallon out of 5 gallons
into there, we have exactly...

1207
01:02:41,732 --> 01:02:43,529
4 gallons!
4 gallons!

1208
01:02:43,634 --> 01:02:44,532
Come on!

1209
01:02:45,736 --> 01:02:48,136
Don't spill-
Don't spill it.

1210
01:02:48,238 --> 01:02:49,136
Good. Good.

1211
01:02:49,239 --> 01:02:50,798
We got 4 gallons.

1212
01:02:50,909 --> 01:02:52,308
You did it, McClane!

1213
01:02:52,410 --> 01:02:55,311
Put it on the thing!
Get it down there!

1214
01:02:55,413 --> 01:02:58,143
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1215
01:03:02,087 --> 01:03:04,920
Congratulations.
You're still alive.

1216
01:03:05,023 --> 01:03:05,921
Huh?

1217
01:03:06,024 --> 01:03:06,922
Congratulations.

1218
01:03:07,025 --> 01:03:08,720
Yeah, we did it.

1219
01:03:08,827 --> 01:03:10,658
You surprise me again,
John.

1220
01:03:10,762 --> 01:03:13,287
This is becoming
an ugly habit.

1221
01:03:13,398 --> 01:03:16,299
I don't have the time right now,
Simon.

1222
01:03:16,401 --> 01:03:17,800
A deal's a deal.

1223
01:03:17,902 --> 01:03:18,960
Where's the school bomb?

1224
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:21,971
On the contrary,
you have lots of time.

1225
01:03:22,073 --> 01:03:24,098
You have...

1226
01:03:24,209 --> 01:03:27,611
2 hours and 47 minutes
precisely.

1227
01:03:27,713 --> 01:03:31,274
Plenty of time to test
those wits of yours.

1228
01:03:31,384 --> 01:03:32,783
Listen,jerk-off,

1229
01:03:32,885 --> 01:03:35,285
I got a bad
fucking hangover!

1230
01:03:35,388 --> 01:03:37,618
Now, where is
the school bomb?

1231
01:03:37,723 --> 01:03:39,714
Temper,John.

1232
01:03:39,825 --> 01:03:42,726
The road to truth
has many turns.

1233
01:03:42,828 --> 01:03:46,730
You'll find an envelope
under the rim of the fountain.

1234
01:03:46,832 --> 01:03:49,232
When you undertake
the trip it suggests,

1235
01:03:49,335 --> 01:03:50,734
ask yourself
this question-

1236
01:03:50,836 --> 01:03:54,499
What is 21 out of 42?

1237
01:03:56,409 --> 01:03:57,569
We're behind.

1238
01:03:57,677 --> 01:03:59,872
We should abandon
the rest and go.

1239
01:03:59,979 --> 01:04:02,447
Relax, Targo.
There's not a cop for 20 blocks.

1240
01:04:02,548 --> 01:04:06,952
He's sending us to the home team dugout
at Yankee Stadium.

1241
01:04:07,054 --> 01:04:09,454
We supposed to find
something there?

1242
01:04:09,556 --> 01:04:11,387
What's 21 out of 42?

1243
01:04:11,491 --> 01:04:13,391
21 again.
Half of 42.

1244
01:04:13,493 --> 01:04:14,425
42 what?

1245
01:04:14,528 --> 01:04:17,395
How many players
on the Yankees ball club?

1246
01:04:17,497 --> 01:04:18,395
25.

1247
01:04:18,498 --> 01:04:19,897
What else is 21?

1248
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:20,898
Blackjack.

1249
01:04:21,001 --> 01:04:21,899
It's a club.

1250
01:04:22,002 --> 01:04:24,903
It's a wild goose chase
is what it is.

1251
01:04:28,208 --> 01:04:30,608
Where's the nearest
"A" train?

1252
01:04:30,711 --> 01:04:32,110
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1253
01:04:32,212 --> 01:04:36,046
You know,
some kid might find that.

1254
01:04:36,149 --> 01:04:37,639
You're right.

1255
01:04:42,724 --> 01:04:43,918
Come back here,

1256
01:04:44,058 --> 01:04:46,117
you little sons of bitches!

1257
01:04:46,227 --> 01:04:48,127
Hey, you!
I remember you!

1258
01:04:48,229 --> 01:04:50,129
Ha ha.

1259
01:04:50,231 --> 01:04:52,096
Hey, where you going?

1260
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:53,428
What are you doing?

1261
01:04:53,534 --> 01:04:54,728
Let me go, dickhead!

1262
01:04:54,836 --> 01:04:56,235
Watch your mouth.

1263
01:04:56,337 --> 01:04:59,238
You going to juvenile hall
for a Butterfinger?

1264
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:02,138
Look around.
All the cops are into something.

1265
01:05:02,243 --> 01:05:05,144
It's Christmas!
You could steal City Hall!

1266
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:13,518
Come on.

1267
01:05:13,621 --> 01:05:15,020
My bike.

1268
01:05:15,123 --> 01:05:16,523
That's my bike!

1269
01:05:16,625 --> 01:05:18,593
Hey! Hey!
Where you going?

1270
01:05:18,694 --> 01:05:20,093
Yankee Stadium's that way!

1271
01:05:20,195 --> 01:05:21,127
You asshole!

1272
01:05:27,703 --> 01:05:31,537
Why don't you run over
everybody in the street?

1273
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:34,040
What the fuck
are we doing?

1274
01:05:34,143 --> 01:05:37,044
What is it that Wall Street
doesn't have?

1275
01:05:37,146 --> 01:05:38,374
You're talking in riddles.

1276
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,971
What is it that Wall Street
does not have?

1277
01:05:41,083 --> 01:05:41,981
What? Schools.

1278
01:05:42,084 --> 01:05:43,813
And what do they have
a shitload of?

1279
01:05:43,919 --> 01:05:45,147
What?

1280
01:05:52,996 --> 01:05:55,157
I'll be back in a minute.

1281
01:05:55,265 --> 01:05:58,132
What am I supposed to do
with this?

1282
01:05:58,234 --> 01:06:00,725
Give it to those guys
over there.

1283
01:06:00,837 --> 01:06:02,065
He's here.

1284
01:06:02,172 --> 01:06:04,163
Perhaps you could be
more specific.

1285
01:06:04,274 --> 01:06:05,673
McClane is here.

1286
01:06:05,775 --> 01:06:08,141
He's walking toward
the bank.

1287
01:06:09,245 --> 01:06:12,180
The black man
is coming toward me.

1288
01:06:12,282 --> 01:06:17,185
And after we've gone
to all that trouble at the stadium.

1289
01:06:17,287 --> 01:06:18,652
Simon...

1290
01:06:18,755 --> 01:06:19,983
kill him.

1291
01:06:20,089 --> 01:06:23,149
Stop toying with him
and kill him now.

1292
01:06:23,259 --> 01:06:26,023
O.K. So be it.

1293
01:06:26,129 --> 01:06:28,029
May he rest in peace.

1294
01:06:28,131 --> 01:06:30,532
I'll inform Karl
in the lobby.

1295
01:06:30,634 --> 01:06:33,159
Pack up your team
and get out.

1296
01:06:33,270 --> 01:06:34,202
And this one?

1297
01:06:34,305 --> 01:06:35,772
Officer...

1298
01:06:38,776 --> 01:06:42,041
I'm going to need an answer
on that issue.

1299
01:06:47,284 --> 01:06:48,717
Let him go.

1300
01:06:48,819 --> 01:06:49,717
Understood.

1301
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:51,117
Yes, sir?

1302
01:06:51,222 --> 01:06:54,191
John McClane says
to give you this.

1303
01:06:54,291 --> 01:06:55,690
Jesus, don't open it.

1304
01:06:55,793 --> 01:06:57,192
It's a bomb.

1305
01:06:57,294 --> 01:06:58,192
Another?

1306
01:06:58,295 --> 01:06:59,694
Yeah.

1307
01:06:59,797 --> 01:07:01,196
Oh, I see.

1308
01:07:01,298 --> 01:07:03,198
We'd better move now.

1309
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:05,201
Thank you for your assistance.

1310
01:07:05,303 --> 01:07:06,702
We really appreciate it.

1311
01:07:06,805 --> 01:07:07,794
Thank you.

1312
01:07:27,325 --> 01:07:31,159
Hey, y'all leaving
this place unguarded?

1313
01:07:51,784 --> 01:07:53,183
How you doing?

1314
01:07:53,286 --> 01:07:55,049
All right.

1315
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:56,052
John McClane...

1316
01:07:56,155 --> 01:07:57,782
<i>N.Y.P.D..</i>

1317
01:07:57,890 --> 01:07:59,881
Are you all right?

1318
01:07:59,992 --> 01:08:01,186
Yes...

1319
01:08:01,294 --> 01:08:02,591
laundry day.

1320
01:08:02,695 --> 01:08:05,596
What can I do for you,
Lieutenant?

1321
01:08:05,698 --> 01:08:08,098
It's been quiet
all morning here?

1322
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:09,098
Well-

1323
01:08:09,201 --> 01:08:10,634
Except for
that big explosion

1324
01:08:10,736 --> 01:08:12,135
a couple of hours ago.

1325
01:08:12,238 --> 01:08:14,604
Seen anything strange
happen in the last hour?

1326
01:08:14,707 --> 01:08:17,609
No. We've had cops
in here pretty steady

1327
01:08:17,711 --> 01:08:19,110
since the subway thing.

1328
01:08:19,212 --> 01:08:22,147
We were going to make a round
on the vault floor

1329
01:08:22,249 --> 01:08:24,149
if you want
to tag along.

1330
01:08:24,251 --> 01:08:26,151
Sure. Think I will.

1331
01:08:26,253 --> 01:08:28,653
What do you think
of this heat?

1332
01:08:28,755 --> 01:08:30,154
Indian summer, huh?

1333
01:08:30,257 --> 01:08:33,158
Feels like it's going to rain
like dogs and cats later.

1334
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:35,160
Here's one of your guys.

1335
01:08:35,262 --> 01:08:37,662
Detective, uh, Otto, isn't it?

1336
01:08:37,764 --> 01:08:39,425
John McClane.

1337
01:08:42,970 --> 01:08:44,631
Mike, how you doing?

1338
01:08:46,606 --> 01:08:47,834
I keep telling myself

1339
01:08:47,941 --> 01:08:49,841
I'm going to
take the stairs

1340
01:08:49,943 --> 01:08:50,841
just for the exercise...

1341
01:08:50,944 --> 01:08:53,174
but on a hot day like this,

1342
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:56,182
it seems I always end up
riding the lift.

1343
01:09:23,111 --> 01:09:26,012
What was the lottery number
last night?

1344
01:09:26,114 --> 01:09:27,513
You play the lottery?

1345
01:09:27,615 --> 01:09:28,513
No?

1346
01:09:28,616 --> 01:09:31,518
My wife buys me two tickets
every week.

1347
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:33,815
Plays the same two numbers
all the time.

1348
01:09:33,922 --> 01:09:36,823
I say, "Why don't you play
a different number?"

1349
01:09:36,925 --> 01:09:39,155
She goes,
"Those are my lucky numbers. "

1350
01:09:39,261 --> 01:09:41,252
I got the tickets
right here-

1351
01:09:43,932 --> 01:09:45,832
Put that fucking gun down!

1352
01:09:45,934 --> 01:09:47,526
Put it down now!

1353
01:09:53,409 --> 01:09:54,637
Put it down!

1354
01:10:00,682 --> 01:10:02,809
Hello!

1355
01:10:02,918 --> 01:10:04,943
Anybody down here?

1356
01:10:15,231 --> 01:10:17,392
Freeze! Put your fucking hands
in the air!

1357
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:18,899
No,John! No! No!

1358
01:10:19,002 --> 01:10:19,991
It's me!

1359
01:10:21,738 --> 01:10:24,138
You almost gave me
a heart attack.

1360
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:25,434
You all right?

1361
01:10:25,542 --> 01:10:26,440
Huh?

1362
01:10:26,543 --> 01:10:27,737
You all right!

1363
01:10:27,844 --> 01:10:29,141
Yeah. It's not my blood.

1364
01:10:29,245 --> 01:10:30,439
What's going on
down here?

1365
01:10:30,547 --> 01:10:31,741
Go take a look.

1366
01:10:54,438 --> 01:10:55,700
Hey, McClane.

1367
01:10:55,806 --> 01:10:57,364
Where the hell
is everybody?

1368
01:10:57,475 --> 01:11:00,171
Simon fuckin' says!

1369
01:11:00,277 --> 01:11:02,677
I should've seen it coming
a mile away.

1370
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:04,338
This was never
about revenge.

1371
01:11:04,448 --> 01:11:06,006
It's about a goddamn heist.

1372
01:11:06,117 --> 01:11:07,675
What was in the room?

1373
01:11:07,785 --> 01:11:09,343
This.

1374
01:11:09,453 --> 01:11:11,444
What is this?

1375
01:11:11,555 --> 01:11:13,113
Oh, shit!
Is this gold?

1376
01:11:13,224 --> 01:11:14,623
Yeah, it's gold.

1377
01:11:14,725 --> 01:11:15,953
Damn, this is heavy!

1378
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:18,461
They cleaned out
a whole room of this?

1379
01:11:18,563 --> 01:11:19,461
Yeah.

1380
01:11:19,564 --> 01:11:21,464
That would take
a tank or...

1381
01:11:21,566 --> 01:11:22,760
A dump truck.

1382
01:11:23,902 --> 01:11:25,460
14 great big
dump trucks.

1383
01:11:25,570 --> 01:11:28,232
We almost got hit
by a dump truck.

1384
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:29,739
Damn! Slow down! Shit!

1385
01:11:29,841 --> 01:11:31,240
Put that shit down.

1386
01:11:31,343 --> 01:11:32,571
No fuckin' way.

1387
01:11:32,677 --> 01:11:35,077
They ain't going to
let you keep it.

1388
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:36,647
We'll need a car.

1389
01:11:42,921 --> 01:11:44,149
Can you hot-wire this?

1390
01:11:44,256 --> 01:11:46,656
Of course I can.
I'm an electrician.

1391
01:11:46,758 --> 01:11:48,851
Only problem is...

1392
01:11:51,930 --> 01:11:54,296
Takes too fuckin' long.

1393
01:12:06,245 --> 01:12:07,644
Not on the bridge!

1394
01:12:07,747 --> 01:12:10,409
Down there, McClane!
the FDR!

1395
01:12:13,619 --> 01:12:16,782
Let's go! Let's go!
Come on!

1396
01:12:16,889 --> 01:12:18,049
Oh, shit!

1397
01:12:18,157 --> 01:12:19,124
What?

1398
01:12:19,225 --> 01:12:20,453
Shot the phone.

1399
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:23,688
Aw, too bad.
What's 21 out of 42?

1400
01:12:23,796 --> 01:12:25,354
I don't have a clue.

1401
01:12:25,464 --> 01:12:26,624
What about Yankee Stadium?

1402
01:12:26,732 --> 01:12:28,723
We'll get there,
after we stop him.

1403
01:12:28,834 --> 01:12:30,734
Oh,Jesus Christ!

1404
01:12:30,836 --> 01:12:33,362
Who do you think you are, lady,
Hillary Clinton?

1405
01:12:33,473 --> 01:12:36,033
That's it! Hillary Clinton.
the 42nd president.

1406
01:12:36,143 --> 01:12:37,701
She'd be the 43rd president.

1407
01:12:37,811 --> 01:12:40,211
All right, all right,
but who's the 21 st?

1408
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:42,214
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

1409
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:43,544
No! Do you know?

1410
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:44,548
No!

1411
01:12:44,651 --> 01:12:45,913
Well?

1412
01:12:46,019 --> 01:12:47,577
This engine's shit.
Step on it!

1413
01:12:47,688 --> 01:12:50,418
It's a Yugo.
It's built for economy, not speed.

1414
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:54,918
Whoa! What are you doing?

1415
01:12:55,028 --> 01:12:56,427
Getting us
another phone.

1416
01:12:59,266 --> 01:13:00,233
Wait, Wait!

1417
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:02,063
Wait, wait, wait!

1418
01:13:02,169 --> 01:13:03,727
Who was the 21 st president?

1419
01:13:03,837 --> 01:13:05,270
Go fuck yourself!

1420
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:08,903
That guy was pissed.

1421
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:11,501
He'll feel better when he looks
in the backseat.

1422
01:13:11,613 --> 01:13:13,513
Shit, that was
my gold bar!

1423
01:13:13,615 --> 01:13:16,345
This is McClane.
Get me Inspector Walter Cobb.

1424
01:13:16,451 --> 01:13:18,009
Where the hell are you?

1425
01:13:18,119 --> 01:13:20,019
It's not revenge.
It's a heist.

1426
01:13:20,121 --> 01:13:22,021
There's gold
in the Federal Reserve.

1427
01:13:22,123 --> 01:13:24,114
They took a shitload of it.

1428
01:13:24,225 --> 01:13:25,590
They're headed north
in dump trucks.

1429
01:13:25,693 --> 01:13:26,717
Have you been drinking?

1430
01:13:26,828 --> 01:13:28,295
Not since this morning.

1431
01:13:28,396 --> 01:13:30,762
There's a lot of
dump trucks northbound

1432
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:32,594
on the FDR
at about 7 Oth.

1433
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:34,930
Close the bridge.
Get some helicopters over there.

1434
01:13:35,036 --> 01:13:36,936
I couldn't close
a hot dog stand now.

1435
01:13:37,038 --> 01:13:37,936
I'm spread all over.

1436
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:39,631
What about this damn bomb?

1437
01:13:39,741 --> 01:13:42,938
It's got something to do
with the 21 st president.

1438
01:13:43,044 --> 01:13:44,876
John,John, the 21 st what?

1439
01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:45,878
Walter!

1440
01:13:45,981 --> 01:13:48,950
Shit. Goddamn cellular fuckin' phones!

1441
01:13:49,051 --> 01:13:50,609
Reach Munsen
On the Triborough.

1442
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:53,119
Tell him to close
all the East River bridges

1443
01:13:53,222 --> 01:13:54,154
north of 59th street.

1444
01:13:54,256 --> 01:13:55,484
Looking for dump trucks.

1445
01:13:55,591 --> 01:13:56,489
Dump trucks?

1446
01:13:56,592 --> 01:13:58,492
McClane says
there are dump trucks

1447
01:13:58,594 --> 01:14:01,461
headed up the FDR
loaded with gold.

1448
01:14:01,563 --> 01:14:04,396
They don't allow dump trucks
on the FDR!

1449
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:05,899
- Connie!
- All right!

1450
01:14:06,001 --> 01:14:08,435
I won't argue,
no matter how stupid it is.

1451
01:14:08,537 --> 01:14:11,370
K-9. Check out
the boiler room.

1452
01:14:11,473 --> 01:14:12,872
Find anything, Charlie?

1453
01:14:12,975 --> 01:14:15,375
I could spend a week here
with an X-ray machine

1454
01:14:15,477 --> 01:14:17,377
and still not find it.

1455
01:14:17,479 --> 01:14:20,779
You've got five minutes.
Then we're moving up to 86th street.

1456
01:14:20,884 --> 01:14:22,784
Going as fast as we can.

1457
01:14:22,886 --> 01:14:23,944
What's up?

1458
01:14:24,054 --> 01:14:25,612
McClane was mentioning something

1459
01:14:25,722 --> 01:14:27,952
about the Federal Reserve building.

1460
01:14:28,058 --> 01:14:30,618
Isn't that near that
Wall Street bomb site?

1461
01:14:30,727 --> 01:14:31,625
Yeah.

1462
01:14:37,901 --> 01:14:40,165
How long do you want us
to stay here?

1463
01:14:40,270 --> 01:14:42,830
The men at the stadium.
Stay or go?

1464
01:14:42,939 --> 01:14:45,339
Karl should've
checked in by now.

1465
01:14:45,442 --> 01:14:46,340
Moment.

1466
01:14:53,983 --> 01:14:55,382
Come on, come on.

1467
01:14:57,922 --> 01:15:00,288
Stay where you are.
McClane may still turn up.

1468
01:15:01,392 --> 01:15:04,020
Relax, Targo.
If he is still alive...

1469
01:15:05,129 --> 01:15:08,155
he won't be talking
to anyone.

1470
01:15:08,265 --> 01:15:10,130
It's the next turnoff.

1471
01:15:10,234 --> 01:15:13,067
Hi. It's Elvis Duran.
You're on the air. What's up?

1472
01:15:13,170 --> 01:15:16,571
First I want to tell you what
a great show you got.

1473
01:15:16,674 --> 01:15:19,074
I listen to you
all the time.

1474
01:15:19,176 --> 01:15:20,734
Thanks. What's on your mind?

1475
01:15:20,845 --> 01:15:22,745
Those cop cars speeding
around everywhere-

1476
01:15:22,847 --> 01:15:24,212
you know what
they're up to?

1477
01:15:24,315 --> 01:15:26,681
There's a bomb
in a school.

1478
01:15:26,784 --> 01:15:28,183
My cousin's a cop.

1479
01:15:28,285 --> 01:15:31,584
Somebody put a big bomb
in a school somewhere.

1480
01:15:31,689 --> 01:15:33,590
Only they don't know
which one.

1481
01:15:33,692 --> 01:15:35,592
so they're searching
all of them.

1482
01:15:35,694 --> 01:15:37,093
Shh! Shh!

1483
01:15:37,195 --> 01:15:39,595
Every school
in the metropolitan area.

1484
01:15:39,698 --> 01:15:41,723
Holy shit.

1485
01:15:41,833 --> 01:15:42,731
Doris. Annie?

1486
01:15:42,834 --> 01:15:44,859
Doris, can you reach my wife?

1487
01:15:44,970 --> 01:15:47,962
Turley! Half the goddamn city

1488
01:15:48,073 --> 01:15:49,973
just called 911!

1489
01:15:52,577 --> 01:15:53,475
They're gone.

1490
01:15:53,578 --> 01:15:54,476
What?

1491
01:15:54,579 --> 01:15:55,671
They're gone!

1492
01:15:55,781 --> 01:15:57,339
Who is this guy,
Houdini?

1493
01:15:57,449 --> 01:15:59,076
Down there!
Down there!

1494
01:16:00,252 --> 01:16:01,844
This thing got air bags?

1495
01:16:01,953 --> 01:16:04,547
Your side does.
I don't know about mi-

1496
01:16:05,657 --> 01:16:07,648
McClane!

1497
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:30,181
In the truck!
Let me see the hands!

1498
01:16:30,283 --> 01:16:32,012
Put them on the door!

1499
01:16:36,689 --> 01:16:37,951
Don't kill me!

1500
01:16:38,057 --> 01:16:39,456
Don't shoot me.

1501
01:16:40,626 --> 01:16:41,786
Truck driver?

1502
01:16:41,894 --> 01:16:45,160
No, I'm a beautician.
Of course I'm a truck driver!

1503
01:16:45,265 --> 01:16:47,233
Where you taking
this truck?

1504
01:16:47,334 --> 01:16:49,063
The aqueduct.

1505
01:16:49,169 --> 01:16:51,899
Why you taking this
to the race track?

1506
01:16:52,005 --> 01:16:55,338
No, the aqueduct!
The-the water aqueduct!

1507
01:16:55,442 --> 01:16:56,409
Aqueduct?

1508
01:16:58,645 --> 01:17:00,545
See? Goes from here

1509
01:17:00,647 --> 01:17:03,309
all the way up
to the Catskill Mountains!

1510
01:17:03,417 --> 01:17:04,406
What does?

1511
01:17:04,518 --> 01:17:07,813
That! The water pipe!
Goes for about 60 miles!

1512
01:17:14,795 --> 01:17:16,387
- Hey, you the foreman?
- Yeah.

1513
01:17:16,497 --> 01:17:18,397
N.Y.P.D.!
Any extra dump trucks

1514
01:17:18,499 --> 01:17:20,899
come through here
the last couple minutes?

1515
01:17:21,002 --> 01:17:23,129
I'm writing
those fuckin' clowns up!

1516
01:17:23,238 --> 01:17:25,502
They better start paying attention
to work orders.

1517
01:17:25,607 --> 01:17:26,699
What happened?

1518
01:17:26,808 --> 01:17:29,208
A dozen idiots
tore ass up the tube.

1519
01:17:29,310 --> 01:17:32,211
We're not loading up there anymore.
We're loading over here.

1520
01:17:32,313 --> 01:17:34,213
So much for bridges
and helicopters.

1521
01:17:34,315 --> 01:17:36,715
Got a map showing
where this tunnel goes?

1522
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:38,217
Yeah, right here.

1523
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:41,379
We run pretty much
up under the saw mill

1524
01:17:41,489 --> 01:17:43,889
till you get up
to the coffer dam.

1525
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:46,825
After that, we've already brought
the reservoir water down.

1526
01:17:46,928 --> 01:17:49,192
Any way in or out
of there?

1527
01:17:49,297 --> 01:17:51,231
There's vent shafts
every 2 miles.

1528
01:17:51,332 --> 01:17:52,890
I mean with a truck.

1529
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:55,902
At the coffer dam.
You can get a truck in there.

1530
01:17:56,004 --> 01:17:58,769
Follow saw mill parkway up there.
It's about 20 miles.

1531
01:17:58,874 --> 01:18:00,774
I'll meet you right there,
O.K.?

1532
01:18:00,876 --> 01:18:02,503
What am I doing?

1533
01:18:02,611 --> 01:18:04,374
You're going up
to Yankee Stadium!

1534
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:05,674
McClane!

1535
01:18:05,781 --> 01:18:07,715
Go. We got less
than two hours!

1536
01:18:07,816 --> 01:18:09,215
Goddamn it!

1537
01:18:14,623 --> 01:18:16,853
Hey! Is something wrong?

1538
01:18:16,959 --> 01:18:19,360
480 yards of rock
moved so far.

1539
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:21,861
Now, that's 10 times
the Hoover Dam.

1540
01:18:21,964 --> 01:18:25,456
Right now, there's 560 feet of rock
above our head.

1541
01:18:25,568 --> 01:18:28,196
This part is phase three
of tunnel three.

1542
01:18:28,304 --> 01:18:31,205
Planning for it
began back in 1954,

1543
01:18:31,307 --> 01:18:33,708
But construction didn't begin
tillJune of 1970.

1544
01:18:33,810 --> 01:18:37,211
You know what the most interesting part
of tunnel three is?

1545
01:18:37,314 --> 01:18:38,542
What's that,Jerry?

1546
01:18:38,648 --> 01:18:40,206
The valves. Each one...

1547
01:18:47,023 --> 01:18:50,720
Main departure
from tunnels one and two.

1548
01:18:51,828 --> 01:18:52,886
Come on!

1549
01:18:52,996 --> 01:18:55,556
What a hell of a place
to break down.

1550
01:18:55,665 --> 01:18:58,725
Hold it. Let me have your hard hat.
Got a jacket?

1551
01:18:58,835 --> 01:19:00,393
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Here.

1552
01:19:00,503 --> 01:19:02,471
Wait here a minute.

1553
01:19:02,572 --> 01:19:05,973
Wait until he gets
alongside the door.

1554
01:19:06,076 --> 01:19:07,008
Hey! Fellas!

1555
01:19:07,110 --> 01:19:08,338
Mickey O'Brien,
aqueduct security.

1556
01:19:08,445 --> 01:19:11,279
We got a report
of a guy coming through here

1557
01:19:11,382 --> 01:19:12,610
with eight reindeer.

1558
01:19:20,124 --> 01:19:23,025
Yeah, they said he was
a jolly old fat guy

1559
01:19:23,127 --> 01:19:24,685
with a snowy white beard.

1560
01:19:24,795 --> 01:19:26,353
Cute red and white suit.

1561
01:19:26,464 --> 01:19:28,364
I'm surprised
you didn't see him.

1562
01:19:30,968 --> 01:19:33,368
What's with you guys
and these phones?

1563
01:19:35,239 --> 01:19:36,137
Give me something.

1564
01:19:37,808 --> 01:19:41,039
Holy shit.
Is that guy dead?

1565
01:19:41,145 --> 01:19:43,204
Yes,Jerry.
I'm afraid he is.

1566
01:19:43,314 --> 01:19:44,645
Jesus Christ.

1567
01:19:44,749 --> 01:19:49,153
I want you to get ahold
of a guy named Cobb.

1568
01:19:49,254 --> 01:19:52,223
walter Cobb. C-O-B-B.
He's the head of my police unit.

1569
01:19:52,324 --> 01:19:55,225
Get him down here.
Tell him you were with John McClane.

1570
01:19:55,327 --> 01:19:58,490
Tell him to find out
who the 21 st president was.

1571
01:19:58,597 --> 01:20:00,030
Chester A. Arthur.

1572
01:20:00,132 --> 01:20:01,030
What?

1573
01:20:01,133 --> 01:20:02,794
Chester A. Arthur.

1574
01:20:02,901 --> 01:20:04,391
1881 to 1885.

1575
01:20:04,503 --> 01:20:06,232
Nominated vice president
in 1880.

1576
01:20:06,338 --> 01:20:10,172
Did you know he was
Collector of Customs here in New York?

1577
01:20:10,342 --> 01:20:12,674
No, I didn't know that,Jerry.

1578
01:20:12,778 --> 01:20:14,177
Take care of yourself.

1579
01:21:17,978 --> 01:21:20,378
We got to release
these traffic guys.

1580
01:21:20,481 --> 01:21:23,041
No. Traffic jams
we can take care of later.

1581
01:21:23,150 --> 01:21:24,515
What's wrong with this?

1582
01:21:24,618 --> 01:21:25,983
Frequencies are jammed.

1583
01:21:26,086 --> 01:21:27,348
What about Ricky?

1584
01:21:27,454 --> 01:21:29,251
Can't reach him. Walter.
Federal Reserve.

1585
01:21:29,356 --> 01:21:30,254
Yeah?

1586
01:21:30,357 --> 01:21:32,382
Biggest gold storage
in the world.

1587
01:21:33,627 --> 01:21:35,528
Get a unit
back down there.

1588
01:21:35,630 --> 01:21:38,929
Find Ricky. Find out
what the hell is going on.

1589
01:21:39,033 --> 01:21:41,297
Walter! You got to hear this!

1590
01:21:45,974 --> 01:21:48,875
I thought we were
going in the back way.

1591
01:21:48,977 --> 01:21:50,535
This is the back way.

1592
01:21:50,645 --> 01:21:54,046
You're about to have
a riot at every school in the city.

1593
01:21:59,821 --> 01:22:02,813
Start at the top floor,
20 men per floor.

1594
01:22:02,924 --> 01:22:06,325
Send the other 50 men to the basement
with us. What about McClane?

1595
01:22:06,427 --> 01:22:08,827
Not a word. I'm getting nothing.
Busy signal.

1596
01:22:08,930 --> 01:22:12,264
This is kind of putting all our eggs
in one basket, isn't it?

1597
01:22:12,368 --> 01:22:13,596
What if McClane's wrong?

1598
01:22:13,702 --> 01:22:15,670
Walter. This is Principal Martinez.

1599
01:22:15,771 --> 01:22:16,669
Inspector Cobb.

1600
01:22:16,772 --> 01:22:18,330
How do you do, inspector?

1601
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:20,840
Principal, I don't want to alarm
your children.

1602
01:22:20,943 --> 01:22:24,276
Move them all into the auditorium
and keep them calm.

1603
01:22:42,264 --> 01:22:44,164
We're coming to the dam.

1604
01:22:44,266 --> 01:22:46,166
You can call the rear guard.

1605
01:22:51,308 --> 01:22:53,868
Rear guard.
You can close up now.

1606
01:22:55,312 --> 01:22:58,042
We've reached the dam.
You can come up now.

1607
01:22:59,316 --> 01:23:00,248
Nils.

1608
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:02,045
You can close in now.

1609
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:04,309
Nils.

1610
01:23:04,421 --> 01:23:06,912
Attention, attention.
Nils is dead.

1611
01:23:07,023 --> 01:23:09,082
I repeat-
Nils is dead, fuckhead.

1612
01:23:09,192 --> 01:23:11,524
So's his pal...
and those four guys

1613
01:23:11,628 --> 01:23:14,859
from the East German all-stars-
your boys at the bank-

1614
01:23:14,965 --> 01:23:16,398
They'll be a little late.

1615
01:23:16,499 --> 01:23:17,989
John.

1616
01:23:19,269 --> 01:23:21,669
In the back of the truck
you're driving,

1617
01:23:21,771 --> 01:23:24,172
there's $13 billion
worth in gold bullion.

1618
01:23:24,275 --> 01:23:26,675
Would a deal be out
of the question?

1619
01:23:26,777 --> 01:23:28,870
I got a deal for you.

1620
01:23:28,980 --> 01:23:32,677
Come out of hiding,
and I'll drive this truck up your ass.

1621
01:23:33,951 --> 01:23:35,213
How colorful.

1622
01:23:41,292 --> 01:23:43,692
I told you not to toy with him!

1623
01:23:43,794 --> 01:23:45,694
Thank you.
That's very helpful.

1624
01:23:48,799 --> 01:23:51,859
You jeopardized the mission
and the contract.

1625
01:23:51,969 --> 01:23:52,867
Ivan.

1626
01:23:53,971 --> 01:23:56,371
Herr Vogle will help me
reach the ship.

1627
01:23:56,474 --> 01:23:58,874
I'm going to put
an end to this.

1628
01:24:00,312 --> 01:24:01,836
Stop!

1629
01:24:04,983 --> 01:24:06,041
Targo!

1630
01:24:06,151 --> 01:24:07,049
Targo!

1631
01:24:07,152 --> 01:24:08,551
Here! Come here!

1632
01:24:10,322 --> 01:24:11,653
We blow the dam.

1633
01:24:11,757 --> 01:24:12,655
What?

1634
01:24:12,758 --> 01:24:14,225
We drown him.

1635
01:24:21,233 --> 01:24:24,134
Up there!

1636
01:24:26,104 --> 01:24:27,571
Walter!

1637
01:24:27,673 --> 01:24:29,231
Take a look at this.

1638
01:24:29,341 --> 01:24:32,970
Janitor said it was delivered
this morning. About 10:30, right?

1639
01:24:33,078 --> 01:24:34,477
Not hooked up.

1640
01:24:34,579 --> 01:24:35,477
Yeah?

1641
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:37,981
O.K. Now take a look
at the front.

1642
01:24:40,453 --> 01:24:42,978
We drill the hinges.
Get everybody out.

1643
01:25:09,582 --> 01:25:10,412
Unh!

1644
01:25:17,291 --> 01:25:18,815
Unh...

1645
01:25:18,926 --> 01:25:19,858
Unh!

1646
01:26:41,410 --> 01:26:43,139
Whoa...

1647
01:26:43,245 --> 01:26:44,507
Whoa!

1648
01:26:57,393 --> 01:26:58,690
Aah!

1649
01:27:04,701 --> 01:27:06,293
Aah!

1650
01:27:06,403 --> 01:27:07,301
Uhh!

1651
01:27:13,810 --> 01:27:14,799
McClane!

1652
01:27:16,913 --> 01:27:18,608
McClane!

1653
01:27:18,715 --> 01:27:20,046
Where are you?

1654
01:27:20,150 --> 01:27:21,117
Over here!

1655
01:27:21,218 --> 01:27:24,813
Hell of a way of flagging
somebody down.

1656
01:27:24,921 --> 01:27:26,047
Did you go to Yankee Stadium?

1657
01:27:26,156 --> 01:27:27,623
Yeah. There's nobody there.

1658
01:27:27,724 --> 01:27:29,123
You didn't see nobody?

1659
01:27:29,226 --> 01:27:31,091
Nobody was following you?

1660
01:27:31,194 --> 01:27:32,422
He's jerking us around.

1661
01:27:34,965 --> 01:27:36,432
Come on! Come on!

1662
01:27:36,533 --> 01:27:38,126
Holy shit!

1663
01:27:38,236 --> 01:27:39,225
Go! Go! Go!

1664
01:27:43,808 --> 01:27:45,742
It's not rigged.

1665
01:27:45,843 --> 01:27:46,901
Pull it.

1666
01:27:58,189 --> 01:28:01,249
Well, I'd say you could
call off your search.

1667
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:02,986
Can you stop it?

1668
01:28:03,094 --> 01:28:05,221
I shouldn't even touch it.

1669
01:28:05,329 --> 01:28:07,991
Who knows what booby traps
this thing's got?

1670
01:28:08,099 --> 01:28:09,396
What about the code?

1671
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:10,524
No word.

1672
01:28:10,635 --> 01:28:12,034
When do we evacuate?

1673
01:28:12,136 --> 01:28:15,368
Simon says he sees one kid
leave the building-boom.

1674
01:28:15,474 --> 01:28:18,375
We can't stand here
with our thumb up our ass

1675
01:28:18,477 --> 01:28:21,037
waiting for this
freaking thing to blow up!

1676
01:28:27,586 --> 01:28:28,518
Shit!

1677
01:28:28,620 --> 01:28:30,713
Keep your head down!

1678
01:28:30,822 --> 01:28:32,414
Hold it steady!

1679
01:28:36,495 --> 01:28:37,587
Go! Go!

1680
01:28:37,696 --> 01:28:38,993
They're in our way!

1681
01:28:39,097 --> 01:28:40,564
Go around them!

1682
01:28:53,379 --> 01:28:56,075
I found out who's
the 21 st president-

1683
01:28:56,182 --> 01:28:57,547
some guy named Arthur.

1684
01:28:57,650 --> 01:28:59,049
Chester A. Arthur?

1685
01:28:59,152 --> 01:29:00,915
Chester A. Arthur
elementary school?

1686
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:01,918
That's it.

1687
01:29:02,021 --> 01:29:05,457
# Gently down the stream #

1688
01:29:05,558 --> 01:29:08,254
# Merrily, merrily,
merrily, merrily #

1689
01:29:08,361 --> 01:29:10,693
# Life is but a dream... ##

1690
01:29:25,979 --> 01:29:27,140
Hi, kids.

1691
01:29:27,248 --> 01:29:30,217
I know you usually have
assembly on Fridays,

1692
01:29:30,317 --> 01:29:31,716
but today is special.

1693
01:29:31,819 --> 01:29:34,720
Mr. Lambert here
is from the Fire Department.

1694
01:29:34,822 --> 01:29:36,722
Today he wants us to practice

1695
01:29:36,824 --> 01:29:39,292
a brand-new fire drill.

1696
01:29:39,393 --> 01:29:41,827
I want you to divide in half.

1697
01:29:41,929 --> 01:29:43,829
Half of you go over here

1698
01:29:43,931 --> 01:29:46,331
and line up against the wall.

1699
01:29:46,433 --> 01:29:48,765
The other half go
in this direction.

1700
01:29:48,869 --> 01:29:51,565
Do it very quietly
and very quickly.

1701
01:29:51,672 --> 01:29:52,900
Everybody up, please.

1702
01:29:53,007 --> 01:29:54,406
Teachers, please help them.

1703
01:29:54,508 --> 01:29:55,805
Fire drill, my ass.

1704
01:29:55,909 --> 01:29:57,171
The Fire Department...

1705
01:29:57,278 --> 01:29:59,940
Maybe it's because of the radio.

1706
01:30:00,047 --> 01:30:03,074
You mean,
like they're after us?

1707
01:30:03,218 --> 01:30:04,583
Tommy squealed on us.

1708
01:30:04,686 --> 01:30:06,085
No, he didn't.

1709
01:30:06,187 --> 01:30:07,245
Come on.

1710
01:30:08,523 --> 01:30:09,990
Where you going?

1711
01:30:12,727 --> 01:30:14,126
Let me drive!

1712
01:30:14,229 --> 01:30:15,127
Go! Go!

1713
01:30:15,230 --> 01:30:16,788
Goddamn it!

1714
01:30:16,898 --> 01:30:20,800
Of course he put the bomb
up in that school.

1715
01:30:20,902 --> 01:30:22,699
Why would he do that?

1716
01:30:22,804 --> 01:30:24,533
To get your complete attention.

1717
01:30:28,943 --> 01:30:31,036
Find the fuse panel.

1718
01:30:31,146 --> 01:30:32,204
What?

1719
01:30:32,314 --> 01:30:33,713
Where's the fuse panel?

1720
01:30:33,815 --> 01:30:35,715
Pull out the antilock-brakes fuse.

1721
01:30:35,817 --> 01:30:37,011
Which one is it?

1722
01:30:37,118 --> 01:30:38,449
Yank them all out.

1723
01:30:38,553 --> 01:30:40,545
Put your head down.

1724
01:30:40,656 --> 01:30:43,318
Put your head fucking down.

1725
01:30:43,426 --> 01:30:44,825
Listen to me.

1726
01:30:44,927 --> 01:30:48,090
Hang the fuck on,
all right?

1727
01:31:13,489 --> 01:31:15,856
What the fuck happened?

1728
01:31:15,959 --> 01:31:18,484
You got a "Triple-A" card?

1729
01:31:18,595 --> 01:31:20,028
Keep moving.
Keep moving.

1730
01:31:20,130 --> 01:31:23,531
I've got the janitors
making a last sweep of the building.

1731
01:31:23,633 --> 01:31:25,362
Thank you, Miss Martinez.

1732
01:31:41,985 --> 01:31:43,213
Come on.

1733
01:31:44,721 --> 01:31:48,088
All right.
3s and 9s are wild.

1734
01:31:48,191 --> 01:31:49,624
Stay down.
Stay low.

1735
01:31:58,669 --> 01:32:01,263
Oh, man.

1736
01:32:03,674 --> 01:32:05,301
What are you doing?

1737
01:32:05,410 --> 01:32:06,468
Interrogating him.

1738
01:32:06,577 --> 01:32:08,511
What's he going
to tell you?

1739
01:32:08,613 --> 01:32:10,945
I won't know
till I ask him.

1740
01:32:11,048 --> 01:32:13,778
See if there's aspirin
in that glove box.

1741
01:32:13,885 --> 01:32:16,115
No way. You do it.

1742
01:32:21,626 --> 01:32:22,684
10 quarters.

1743
01:32:22,794 --> 01:32:25,695
The guy in the dump truck
had 10 quarters.

1744
01:32:25,797 --> 01:32:27,128
Exactly 10 quarters.

1745
01:32:27,231 --> 01:32:30,201
Maybe they were making
long-distance phone calls.

1746
01:32:30,302 --> 01:32:31,360
No.

1747
01:32:31,470 --> 01:32:32,869
They're for the bridge,

1748
01:32:32,971 --> 01:32:35,872
it's for the toll
on the bridge.

1749
01:32:37,643 --> 01:32:38,701
There! There!

1750
01:32:38,811 --> 01:32:41,211
Down on the wharf-
dump trucks.

1751
01:32:41,313 --> 01:32:43,213
Right there.
Right there.

1752
01:32:44,817 --> 01:32:48,719
They got it loaded
on a ship already.

1753
01:32:48,821 --> 01:32:50,152
Shit!

1754
01:32:50,255 --> 01:32:52,155
How about the Coast Guard?

1755
01:32:52,257 --> 01:32:53,656
Take them an hour
to get here.

1756
01:32:53,759 --> 01:32:55,556
Shit!

1757
01:32:55,661 --> 01:32:56,992
We can jump.

1758
01:32:57,095 --> 01:32:57,993
What?

1759
01:32:58,096 --> 01:33:00,564
It's 100 feet
down to the deck.

1760
01:33:00,666 --> 01:33:02,691
But not to the crane.

1761
01:33:02,801 --> 01:33:05,236
The cables would
cut you in half.

1762
01:33:05,338 --> 01:33:07,101
I can make it.

1763
01:33:07,207 --> 01:33:10,176
Get down.
Look in the car for some gloves.

1764
01:33:13,213 --> 01:33:14,840
Six booby traps,

1765
01:33:14,948 --> 01:33:16,381
four dead ends,

1766
01:33:16,483 --> 01:33:19,043
#And a partridge
in a pear tree ##

1767
01:33:23,289 --> 01:33:25,689
O.K., honey...

1768
01:33:25,792 --> 01:33:27,783
let's dance.

1769
01:33:27,894 --> 01:33:29,691
We're going to have a race.

1770
01:33:29,796 --> 01:33:32,196
When I say "go,"
run like crazy.

1771
01:33:32,298 --> 01:33:34,698
Follow the police officer
and the firemen.

1772
01:33:34,801 --> 01:33:37,702
Walter, I think we're cutting this
a little thin.

1773
01:33:37,804 --> 01:33:39,704
No. We're going to wait.

1774
01:33:39,806 --> 01:33:42,139
McClane still
may get the code.

1775
01:33:44,445 --> 01:33:46,072
Line me up
with that crane.

1776
01:33:46,180 --> 01:33:47,442
Right there.

1777
01:33:47,548 --> 01:33:49,311
You're O.K.

1778
01:33:51,085 --> 01:33:53,053
This will take a miracle.

1779
01:33:53,153 --> 01:33:54,677
Keep your fingers crossed.

1780
01:33:55,789 --> 01:33:57,416
You almost got it.

1781
01:33:57,525 --> 01:33:59,322
Yeah! All right.

1782
01:33:59,426 --> 01:34:01,894
Where you going?
You in a hurry?

1783
01:34:01,996 --> 01:34:03,588
I'm going first this time.

1784
01:34:03,697 --> 01:34:06,222
We have the intercom rigged, sir.

1785
01:34:06,333 --> 01:34:08,733
Walter, the kids may be fine,

1786
01:34:08,836 --> 01:34:10,428
But you wait much longer

1787
01:34:10,538 --> 01:34:12,233
and I'll pee
in my pants.

1788
01:34:12,339 --> 01:34:14,330
We're going to wait,
Connie.

1789
01:34:14,441 --> 01:34:16,433
Six more minutes.

1790
01:34:30,792 --> 01:34:31,759
Yo.

1791
01:34:31,860 --> 01:34:32,918
McClane.

1792
01:34:33,028 --> 01:34:34,757
Down there.

1793
01:34:44,306 --> 01:34:45,204
Oh, shit.

1794
01:34:45,307 --> 01:34:47,400
Go, man.
Go. Go. Go.

1795
01:34:56,886 --> 01:34:59,912
Aah!

1796
01:35:08,164 --> 01:35:11,065
Aah!
Whoa!

1797
01:35:13,235 --> 01:35:14,361
Ohh...

1798
01:35:14,470 --> 01:35:15,869
Boy, am I glad

1799
01:35:15,972 --> 01:35:18,702
you talked me
out of jumping.

1800
01:35:44,468 --> 01:35:45,765
Fuck.

1801
01:35:46,970 --> 01:35:48,369
Get his feet.

1802
01:36:28,846 --> 01:36:30,313
You go find Simon

1803
01:36:30,415 --> 01:36:33,509
and beat the fucking
code out of him.

1804
01:36:33,618 --> 01:36:35,017
Here. Take this.

1805
01:36:35,119 --> 01:36:36,518
How's it work?

1806
01:36:36,621 --> 01:36:38,987
You don't know how
to shoot a gun?

1807
01:36:39,090 --> 01:36:41,423
All brothers don't know
how to shoot guns.

1808
01:36:41,527 --> 01:36:44,428
Yank back on that,
pull the trigger.

1809
01:36:44,530 --> 01:36:45,588
That's it?

1810
01:36:45,698 --> 01:36:47,097
Just don't shoot yourself.

1811
01:36:47,199 --> 01:36:49,099
Hey. Don't be no hero.

1812
01:36:49,201 --> 01:36:51,465
You find him, come get me.

1813
01:37:17,529 --> 01:37:19,225
Stupid!

1814
01:37:19,332 --> 01:37:20,299
Stupid!

1815
01:38:02,376 --> 01:38:04,003
You have the autopilot set?

1816
01:38:04,111 --> 01:38:05,169
Yes, sir.

1817
01:38:05,279 --> 01:38:06,576
Good.

1818
01:38:11,986 --> 01:38:13,920
Don't fucking move.

1819
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:22,322
Oh, the samaritan.

1820
01:38:22,429 --> 01:38:23,919
Give me the goddamn code.

1821
01:38:24,031 --> 01:38:25,055
Code?

1822
01:38:25,166 --> 01:38:26,224
Oh.

1823
01:38:26,333 --> 01:38:28,233
You mean for the school.

1824
01:38:28,335 --> 01:38:29,393
I'm sorry.

1825
01:38:29,503 --> 01:38:30,664
I can't do that.

1826
01:38:30,772 --> 01:38:33,240
You call in that code
right now,

1827
01:38:33,341 --> 01:38:36,742
or I blow your sick ass
into the next world.

1828
01:38:36,845 --> 01:38:39,507
If that's what
you got to do...

1829
01:38:52,027 --> 01:38:53,722
You've got to take
the safety catch off.

1830
01:38:53,829 --> 01:38:54,727
Ugh!

1831
01:38:54,830 --> 01:38:55,762
God!

1832
01:38:55,864 --> 01:38:57,331
See? That works.

1833
01:38:57,432 --> 01:38:59,491
Now where's McClane?

1834
01:39:11,981 --> 01:39:12,970
Nicht schiessen!

1835
01:39:15,818 --> 01:39:17,752
What was that?

1836
01:39:22,325 --> 01:39:24,816
He said, " Don't shoot. "

1837
01:39:24,961 --> 01:39:28,988
O.K., Charlie, we'll have to go
with the evacuation.

1838
01:39:29,098 --> 01:39:30,190
We're going to go.

1839
01:39:30,299 --> 01:39:31,857
You heard the man!
Let's go!

1840
01:39:31,968 --> 01:39:33,367
We're going to go.

1841
01:39:33,469 --> 01:39:34,868
On my mark...

1842
01:39:34,971 --> 01:39:37,565
5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

1843
01:39:37,673 --> 01:39:38,571
go!

1844
01:39:38,674 --> 01:39:41,234
Go! Go! Go! Go!

1845
01:39:41,344 --> 01:39:42,869
Let's do it.

1846
01:39:42,980 --> 01:39:45,244
O.K., gang. Let's go!

1847
01:39:45,349 --> 01:39:46,748
Go! Go! Go!

1848
01:39:46,850 --> 01:39:48,511
Hip-hop! Hip-hop!

1849
01:39:48,619 --> 01:39:50,450
Run! Run! Run! Run!

1850
01:39:50,554 --> 01:39:51,851
We're going to win!

1851
01:39:51,955 --> 01:39:53,946
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1852
01:39:54,057 --> 01:39:55,422
Let's go! Keep moving!

1853
01:39:55,525 --> 01:39:56,423
Hurry up!

1854
01:39:58,128 --> 01:39:59,152
Ugh!

1855
01:40:06,036 --> 01:40:07,628
Keep going!

1856
01:40:07,738 --> 01:40:09,569
Look what they doing.

1857
01:40:11,308 --> 01:40:13,367
Yo! Where you going?

1858
01:40:13,477 --> 01:40:15,468
- What's going on?
- Where you going?

1859
01:40:15,579 --> 01:40:17,979
I see you all day,
little man,

1860
01:40:18,081 --> 01:40:19,106
policeman...

1861
01:40:20,485 --> 01:40:22,544
and you don't go away.

1862
01:40:22,654 --> 01:40:25,521
I'm like that fucking
Energizer bunny.

1863
01:40:27,825 --> 01:40:29,520
Where you going now, huh?

1864
01:40:32,897 --> 01:40:35,388
Going to arrest me, bunny?

1865
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:37,559
Huh?

1866
01:40:37,669 --> 01:40:40,729
I think I'm going rest.

1867
01:40:40,838 --> 01:40:42,271
I'm kind of weak.

1868
01:40:52,850 --> 01:40:54,750
I knew it was bullshit.

1869
01:40:54,852 --> 01:40:56,252
There's nobody watching.

1870
01:40:56,355 --> 01:40:57,754
Time to get Charlie out.

1871
01:40:57,856 --> 01:40:58,948
Time's up.

1872
01:40:59,058 --> 01:41:00,958
Give me another 30 seconds.

1873
01:41:01,060 --> 01:41:03,790
It takes a minute 15
if you're a kid.

1874
01:41:03,896 --> 01:41:07,457
Last I looked,
you weren't too light on your feet.

1875
01:41:07,566 --> 01:41:09,557
Oh, my God!

1876
01:41:11,870 --> 01:41:13,770
Get them out of there!

1877
01:41:13,872 --> 01:41:15,271
The rooms are locked.

1878
01:41:15,374 --> 01:41:16,773
Out of my way!

1879
01:41:16,875 --> 01:41:18,968
Hey!

1880
01:41:19,078 --> 01:41:20,909
Any one marked "4."

1881
01:41:22,147 --> 01:41:23,546
What's going on, Walter?

1882
01:41:23,649 --> 01:41:26,049
We still have kids
in the building.

1883
01:41:31,323 --> 01:41:32,382
I'm staying.

1884
01:41:32,492 --> 01:41:34,892
No, Charlie.
Get out of there.

1885
01:41:36,396 --> 01:41:38,728
Ever see that show
The Addams Family?

1886
01:41:38,832 --> 01:41:41,300
They got a motherfucker
on there called Lurch.

1887
01:41:41,401 --> 01:41:44,461
You don't think I'm going to let you
get to that gun?

1888
01:41:45,839 --> 01:41:46,771
Oh.

1889
01:41:49,542 --> 01:41:50,474
Fuck!

1890
01:42:11,799 --> 01:42:12,697
Four... four...

1891
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:14,495
Get out of the way!

1892
01:42:25,980 --> 01:42:27,379
Where are they, Walter?

1893
01:42:27,481 --> 01:42:29,244
Still in.

1894
01:42:35,156 --> 01:42:36,714
No guts...

1895
01:42:36,824 --> 01:42:37,882
no glory.

1896
01:42:40,961 --> 01:42:44,125
We can jump
to the next building!

1897
01:42:44,232 --> 01:42:45,221
Shit!

1898
01:42:45,333 --> 01:42:46,732
O.K.

1899
01:42:46,835 --> 01:42:48,735
O.K. Come on.
Come on.

1900
01:42:48,837 --> 01:42:51,806
Come on,
get them up here.

1901
01:42:51,907 --> 01:42:53,135
Come on. Come on.

1902
01:42:53,241 --> 01:42:54,139
Mayday! Mayday!

1903
01:42:54,242 --> 01:42:55,402
Bridgeport Coast Guard!

1904
01:42:55,510 --> 01:42:57,034
Coast Guard, come in.

1905
01:43:10,358 --> 01:43:11,689
Come on, kids!

1906
01:43:16,131 --> 01:43:17,564
Shit! It's too far!

1907
01:43:25,475 --> 01:43:27,170
No guts, no glory.

1908
01:43:28,277 --> 01:43:31,075
It's a big fucking white boat.

1909
01:43:31,180 --> 01:43:32,977
Please stay
on the line.

1910
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:53,330
Pancake syrup?

1911
01:43:53,469 --> 01:43:55,198
Stupid...
stupid...

1912
01:43:58,175 --> 01:44:00,541
Hello,John McClane.

1913
01:44:00,644 --> 01:44:04,045
There was never
any bomb in the school.

1914
01:44:04,148 --> 01:44:05,740
Of course not.

1915
01:44:05,849 --> 01:44:08,249
I'm a soldier,
not a monster,

1916
01:44:08,352 --> 01:44:11,685
even though I sometimes
work for monsters.

1917
01:44:11,788 --> 01:44:13,187
No.

1918
01:44:13,290 --> 01:44:15,690
The real bomb
is on this ship.

1919
01:44:19,296 --> 01:44:21,230
Coast Guard.

1920
01:44:21,331 --> 01:44:25,199
I was telling them
where the boat was.

1921
01:44:25,302 --> 01:44:27,566
Game over, huh?

1922
01:44:27,671 --> 01:44:29,070
Not quite over.

1923
01:44:29,173 --> 01:44:31,664
Bridgeport Coast Guard,

1924
01:44:31,775 --> 01:44:34,074
come in, please.

1925
01:44:34,179 --> 01:44:35,703
They put you on hold?

1926
01:44:35,813 --> 01:44:38,714
She told me
to stay on the line.

1927
01:44:42,987 --> 01:44:45,012
Oh, God,
I love this country.

1928
01:44:45,123 --> 01:44:47,819
You know,
your brother was an asshole.

1929
01:44:47,926 --> 01:44:49,723
He really
was an asshole.

1930
01:44:49,827 --> 01:44:51,226
He was an asshole.

1931
01:44:51,329 --> 01:44:53,229
You got his number.

1932
01:44:54,465 --> 01:44:55,727
Yeah, O.K.

1933
01:44:57,335 --> 01:44:58,768
Forgive me.

1934
01:44:58,870 --> 01:45:01,737
Would you help
Mr. McClane below?

1935
01:45:01,839 --> 01:45:02,897
Ohh.

1936
01:45:03,007 --> 01:45:05,168
Careful now.

1937
01:45:05,276 --> 01:45:08,905
Now, do you have
the communique?

1938
01:45:09,014 --> 01:45:09,912
Bridgeport radio.

1939
01:45:10,015 --> 01:45:11,346
Come in, please,
Bridgeport.

1940
01:45:11,450 --> 01:45:12,508
Coast Guard.

1941
01:45:12,618 --> 01:45:14,017
Oh, you're there, dear.

1942
01:45:14,119 --> 01:45:15,518
Yes, we're here.

1943
01:45:15,621 --> 01:45:18,021
Will you be able
to record a message?

1944
01:45:18,123 --> 01:45:19,021
Yes.

1945
01:45:19,124 --> 01:45:20,955
Then please begin now.

1946
01:45:26,298 --> 01:45:28,698
This is a communiqué
from the CRF.

1947
01:45:28,801 --> 01:45:30,098
For too long,

1948
01:45:30,202 --> 01:45:31,601
the West has conspired

1949
01:45:31,704 --> 01:45:33,934
to steal the wealth
of the world,

1950
01:45:34,039 --> 01:45:35,939
consigning the balance of humanity

1951
01:45:36,041 --> 01:45:38,100
to economic starvation.

1952
01:45:38,210 --> 01:45:40,701
Today, we will level
the playing field.

1953
01:45:40,813 --> 01:45:43,577
In minutes, the contents
of the federal reserve bank-

1954
01:45:43,682 --> 01:45:46,811
the gold your economies
are built on-

1955
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:49,218
will be redistributed
by explosive

1956
01:45:49,322 --> 01:45:53,053
Across the bottom
of the Long Island Sound.

1957
01:45:53,159 --> 01:45:55,218
If you are not
in gridlock,

1958
01:45:55,328 --> 01:45:56,693
come and watch.

1959
01:46:00,967 --> 01:46:03,231
You going
to blow it all up?

1960
01:46:03,336 --> 01:46:04,735
That's the idea.

1961
01:46:04,838 --> 01:46:06,738
Some gentlemen
in the Middle East

1962
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:09,240
think they'll make
lots of money.

1963
01:46:09,342 --> 01:46:11,742
See the men
safely off the ship,

1964
01:46:11,845 --> 01:46:14,245
and I'll see you
on the launch.

1965
01:46:14,347 --> 01:46:16,975
What's this got to do
with killing McClane?

1966
01:46:18,351 --> 01:46:20,251
Life has its little bonuses.

1967
01:46:20,353 --> 01:46:23,255
Didn't you say you didn't
even like your brother?

1968
01:46:23,357 --> 01:46:25,587
There's a difference
between not liking one's brother

1969
01:46:25,693 --> 01:46:28,093
and not caring when
some dumb Irish flatfoot

1970
01:46:28,195 --> 01:46:29,321
drops him out a window.

1971
01:46:29,430 --> 01:46:31,455
I didn't even know
that motherfucker.

1972
01:46:31,565 --> 01:46:33,760
I never invited you
aboard this ship.

1973
01:46:33,868 --> 01:46:36,268
No riddle's going to stop
this motherfucker?

1974
01:46:36,370 --> 01:46:38,770
No code, no riddle,
no fancy countdown.

1975
01:46:38,873 --> 01:46:40,670
Hey, fuckhead.

1976
01:46:40,775 --> 01:46:42,333
Yeah, you-fuckhead.

1977
01:46:42,443 --> 01:46:46,539
Just one thing
I got to know-

1978
01:46:46,647 --> 01:46:48,274
you got any aspirins?

1979
01:46:48,382 --> 01:46:50,782
I've had a bad
fucking headache

1980
01:46:50,885 --> 01:46:52,250
all day long.

1981
01:46:54,889 --> 01:46:56,857
Must be your lucky day.

1982
01:46:58,327 --> 01:46:59,726
Keep the bottle.

1983
01:46:59,828 --> 01:47:00,886
Right.

1984
01:47:12,240 --> 01:47:14,071
Where is the gold?

1985
01:47:15,577 --> 01:47:17,408
He's betrayed us.

1986
01:47:17,512 --> 01:47:20,447
The containers
are filled with that...

1987
01:47:54,050 --> 01:47:56,450
If I hadn't saved
your fucking ass,

1988
01:47:56,552 --> 01:47:59,453
I wouldn't be here about to blow up
with $100 billion.

1989
01:47:59,555 --> 01:48:01,955
You're only going
to blow up with me.

1990
01:48:02,058 --> 01:48:03,787
There's no gold
on this boat.

1991
01:48:03,893 --> 01:48:05,292
How do you know?

1992
01:48:05,395 --> 01:48:06,794
I know the family.

1993
01:48:06,896 --> 01:48:09,797
Only thing better than blowing up
$100 billion

1994
01:48:09,899 --> 01:48:11,731
is making people
think you did.

1995
01:48:11,835 --> 01:48:13,234
Well, where is it?

1996
01:48:13,337 --> 01:48:15,237
He must have
switched it somewhere.

1997
01:48:15,339 --> 01:48:17,739
That supposed to make me
feel better?

1998
01:48:17,841 --> 01:48:18,899
You're wrong.

1999
01:48:19,009 --> 01:48:20,408
You're not
going to die.

2000
01:48:20,511 --> 01:48:23,412
You know some cop trick
about handcuffs to get us out?

2001
01:48:23,514 --> 01:48:24,913
Yeah. Use a key.

2002
01:48:25,015 --> 01:48:27,245
You know how
to pick this lock?

2003
01:48:27,351 --> 01:48:29,751
Is this some
black shit again?

2004
01:48:29,853 --> 01:48:32,253
Are you a fucking locksmith
or not?

2005
01:48:32,356 --> 01:48:34,756
I need something
to do it with.

2006
01:48:34,858 --> 01:48:37,258
How about a splinter
of that cable?

2007
01:48:39,696 --> 01:48:40,754
Hold on.

2008
01:48:40,864 --> 01:48:43,264
What the fuck
are you doing?

2009
01:48:43,367 --> 01:48:45,494
Uh!

2010
01:48:45,602 --> 01:48:47,434
Fuck! Shit!

2011
01:48:47,539 --> 01:48:49,439
How's that?
that big enough?

2012
01:48:49,541 --> 01:48:50,940
Yeah. That might work.

2013
01:48:51,042 --> 01:48:53,442
I'm going to drop it
in your hand.

2014
01:48:53,545 --> 01:48:54,944
Cup your hand.

2015
01:48:55,046 --> 01:48:56,445
Don't drop
this motherfucker.

2016
01:48:56,548 --> 01:48:58,448
Get it in the right.

2017
01:48:58,550 --> 01:48:59,608
You ready?

2018
01:48:59,717 --> 01:49:02,151
1... 2... spit it.

2019
01:49:02,253 --> 01:49:03,311
Yeah!

2020
01:49:03,421 --> 01:49:04,319
Get it?

2021
01:49:04,422 --> 01:49:05,684
Move your hands.

2022
01:49:05,790 --> 01:49:07,280
O.K.

2023
01:49:07,392 --> 01:49:08,450
Damn, McClane,

2024
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:10,892
I was just starting
to like you.

2025
01:49:10,995 --> 01:49:12,394
Don't. I'm an asshole.

2026
01:49:12,497 --> 01:49:14,397
What are you
talking about?

2027
01:49:14,499 --> 01:49:15,898
I lied to you.

2028
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:17,160
About what?

2029
01:49:17,268 --> 01:49:20,897
Remember I said Weiss
found that bomb up in Harlem?

2030
01:49:21,005 --> 01:49:23,406
They found it
down in Chinatown.

2031
01:49:23,509 --> 01:49:26,910
That's low even for a white
motherfucker like you.

2032
01:49:28,247 --> 01:49:30,147
What the fuck was that?

2033
01:49:30,249 --> 01:49:31,648
I don't know.

2034
01:49:31,750 --> 01:49:34,150
Look, it was the only way

2035
01:49:34,253 --> 01:49:36,744
to get you to come with me.

2036
01:49:36,856 --> 01:49:38,323
You got a wife?

2037
01:49:38,424 --> 01:49:40,756
I'm surprised anybody
could stay with you

2038
01:49:40,860 --> 01:49:42,259
long enough to be married.

2039
01:49:42,361 --> 01:49:43,760
She didn't stick around.

2040
01:49:43,863 --> 01:49:45,262
We're sort of separated.

2041
01:49:45,364 --> 01:49:48,265
She was in L.A.,
I was in New York,

2042
01:49:48,367 --> 01:49:50,767
we had a fight
on the phone,

2043
01:49:50,870 --> 01:49:53,771
she hung up,
I didn't call her back.

2044
01:49:53,873 --> 01:49:55,773
How long ago was that?

2045
01:49:55,875 --> 01:49:57,274
About a year ago.

2046
01:49:58,711 --> 01:50:01,112
What the fuck
you laughing about?

2047
01:50:01,214 --> 01:50:03,114
You threw away
your marriage

2048
01:50:03,216 --> 01:50:05,616
because you were
too fucking stupid

2049
01:50:05,719 --> 01:50:07,619
to pick up the phone?

2050
01:50:07,721 --> 01:50:09,120
You think that's funny?

2051
01:50:09,222 --> 01:50:11,554
I bet you blame your wife, too.

2052
01:50:11,658 --> 01:50:14,559
My wife is a very stubborn woman.

2053
01:50:14,661 --> 01:50:16,561
You better stop
fucking laughing

2054
01:50:16,663 --> 01:50:18,062
and undo these cuffs.

2055
01:50:18,164 --> 01:50:19,153
They're almost...

2056
01:50:19,266 --> 01:50:20,164
there!

2057
01:50:20,267 --> 01:50:21,666
How's that
for concentration?

2058
01:50:22,836 --> 01:50:23,894
Oh, shit!

2059
01:50:24,004 --> 01:50:25,938
I dropped the pin.

2060
01:50:26,039 --> 01:50:27,438
Goddamn it!

2061
01:50:27,541 --> 01:50:28,735
Where'd it go?

2062
01:50:28,842 --> 01:50:29,831
Find it!

2063
01:50:29,943 --> 01:50:31,342
I don't see it.

2064
01:50:33,113 --> 01:50:35,548
What the fuck is that?

2065
01:50:35,650 --> 01:50:38,483
I think I made it mad.

2066
01:50:39,587 --> 01:50:42,681
Go, McClane,
get the fuck out of here.

2067
01:50:42,790 --> 01:50:45,953
Goddamn it!
Listen to me!

2068
01:50:46,060 --> 01:50:47,584
Just go.

2069
01:50:47,695 --> 01:50:50,095
It's hard enough
getting through the day

2070
01:50:50,197 --> 01:50:52,631
without your death
on my conscience.

2071
01:50:52,733 --> 01:50:55,201
All right. Tools...
Check the engine room.

2072
01:50:55,303 --> 01:50:56,531
There's no time!

2073
01:50:56,637 --> 01:50:58,764
What the hell's it doing now?

2074
01:50:58,873 --> 01:50:59,771
It's mixing.

2075
01:50:59,874 --> 01:51:01,307
Shit!

2076
01:51:01,409 --> 01:51:03,809
What the hell
are you doing?

2077
01:51:03,911 --> 01:51:05,105
Lean forward.

2078
01:51:05,212 --> 01:51:06,645
Lean forward,
goddamn it!

2079
01:51:06,747 --> 01:51:07,941
What-

2080
01:51:08,049 --> 01:51:10,540
What the fuck
are you doing?

2081
01:51:10,651 --> 01:51:11,880
Lean forward.

2082
01:51:11,987 --> 01:51:12,885
Oh, no!

2083
01:51:12,988 --> 01:51:14,182
Get ready!

2084
01:51:15,757 --> 01:51:17,156
Fucking shit! Shit!

2085
01:51:17,259 --> 01:51:18,726
Oh, goddamn!

2086
01:51:18,827 --> 01:51:19,987
Goddamn!

2087
01:51:20,095 --> 01:51:20,993
Come on!

2088
01:51:21,096 --> 01:51:21,994
Come on!

2089
01:51:22,097 --> 01:51:23,496
My leg. Ow!

2090
01:51:23,599 --> 01:51:25,123
Get up the stairs

2091
01:51:25,233 --> 01:51:26,632
Go! Go! Go! Go!

2092
01:51:26,735 --> 01:51:28,703
Get up the stairs!

2093
01:51:29,972 --> 01:51:31,030
Oh, shit!

2094
01:51:31,139 --> 01:51:32,128
Damn it!

2095
01:51:32,240 --> 01:51:34,037
Let's go!
Let's go!

2096
01:51:34,142 --> 01:51:35,541
Run, damn it!
Run!

2097
01:51:35,644 --> 01:51:37,305
I am!

2098
01:51:37,412 --> 01:51:39,710
Come on!
All right?

2099
01:51:39,815 --> 01:51:42,306
Watch, watch, watch!
Let's go!

2100
01:51:42,417 --> 01:51:44,977
Aah!
Aah!

2101
01:52:11,547 --> 01:52:12,912
How's he doing?

2102
01:52:13,016 --> 01:52:14,415
I'm shot
in the leg.

2103
01:52:14,517 --> 01:52:16,075
How you think
I'm doing?

2104
01:52:16,185 --> 01:52:17,584
He's going
to be just fine.

2105
01:52:17,687 --> 01:52:18,654
And you?

2106
01:52:18,755 --> 01:52:19,813
Fine.

2107
01:52:19,922 --> 01:52:21,719
You get Ricky
out of there?

2108
01:52:21,824 --> 01:52:24,487
Yeah, they found him.

2109
01:52:26,363 --> 01:52:28,263
You going to be
all right?

2110
01:52:28,365 --> 01:52:29,798
Got a bad headache.

2111
01:52:29,900 --> 01:52:31,299
Think they're mad at me?

2112
01:52:31,402 --> 01:52:32,994
I wouldn't worry about them.

2113
01:52:33,103 --> 01:52:34,502
They'll get to you
eventually.

2114
01:52:34,605 --> 01:52:36,664
They're busy with this
salvage operation.

2115
01:52:36,774 --> 01:52:38,708
No. Dredges!

2116
01:52:38,809 --> 01:52:40,071
Dredges!

2117
01:52:40,177 --> 01:52:42,202
There's no gold
out there.

2118
01:52:42,312 --> 01:52:44,280
What do you mean?

2119
01:52:44,381 --> 01:52:45,780
He took it.
He beat me.

2120
01:52:45,883 --> 01:52:47,282
He beat all of us.

2121
01:52:47,384 --> 01:52:48,681
He wasn't playing
against you.

2122
01:52:48,786 --> 01:52:50,185
Fuck that, McClane!

2123
01:52:50,287 --> 01:52:51,777
You're still alive,
aren't you?

2124
01:52:53,323 --> 01:52:54,950
Well, aren't you?

2125
01:52:55,059 --> 01:52:56,651
Yeah.

2126
01:52:56,760 --> 01:52:58,159
So he lost.

2127
01:52:58,262 --> 01:53:01,164
Lambert,
would you give him a quarter?

2128
01:53:02,267 --> 01:53:03,825
Asshole.

2129
01:53:08,273 --> 01:53:10,173
Yeah, it's collect from John.

2130
01:53:17,348 --> 01:53:20,909
Uh, Carmen,just tell them
you'll accept the charges.

2131
01:53:21,019 --> 01:53:23,351
Son of a bitch had aspirin.

2132
01:53:23,455 --> 01:53:24,854
Yeah, it's John.

2133
01:53:24,956 --> 01:53:26,856
I'm hanging in there.
Holly there?

2134
01:53:26,958 --> 01:53:28,323
I'll hold on.

2135
01:53:44,810 --> 01:53:46,903
Zeus, hold up!
Hold up!

2136
01:53:47,012 --> 01:53:48,240
John?

2137
01:53:48,347 --> 01:53:49,405
John?

2138
01:53:49,515 --> 01:53:51,676
John? Goddamn it!

2139
01:54:18,845 --> 01:54:20,403
Yesterday...

2140
01:54:20,514 --> 01:54:24,314
Yesterday we were
an army with no country.

2141
01:54:24,417 --> 01:54:26,180
Tomorrow...

2142
01:54:26,286 --> 01:54:29,687
we have to decide

2143
01:54:29,790 --> 01:54:32,258
which country
we want to buy!

2144
01:54:37,164 --> 01:54:38,222
And remember...

2145
01:54:38,331 --> 01:54:40,697
this is all due

2146
01:54:40,801 --> 01:54:43,702
to the g-g-g-gullibility

2147
01:54:43,804 --> 01:54:46,602
of the New York
Police Department!

2148
01:54:46,706 --> 01:54:48,230
To the police department!

2149
01:54:48,341 --> 01:54:49,400
Yeah!

2150
01:55:01,656 --> 01:55:02,816
Kamerad!

2151
01:55:04,091 --> 01:55:05,183
Kamerad!

2152
01:55:17,638 --> 01:55:19,037
Deitman, take over.

2153
01:55:19,140 --> 01:55:20,937
All right, listen up!

2154
01:55:21,042 --> 01:55:22,441
First squad,
you muster out

2155
01:55:22,543 --> 01:55:25,536
in half an hour
in the school bus!

2156
01:55:25,647 --> 01:55:27,547
You'll be
the lacrosse team!

2157
01:55:38,293 --> 01:55:39,817
No rush.

2158
01:55:39,928 --> 01:55:43,864
Jurgens, you'll be the padre!

2159
01:55:43,966 --> 01:55:45,593
Padre?

2160
01:56:09,325 --> 01:56:10,986
Lights! Douse those lights.

2161
01:56:33,816 --> 01:56:35,283
Hey, dickhead,

2162
01:56:35,385 --> 01:56:38,219
did I come at a bad time?

2163
01:56:41,125 --> 01:56:42,183
Aah!

2164
01:56:43,594 --> 01:56:46,654
Wow! I think she's pissed
at you, McClane.

2165
01:56:56,407 --> 01:56:57,431
Go!

2166
01:56:57,541 --> 01:56:58,906
Go!

2167
01:56:59,009 --> 01:57:00,340
Go!

2168
01:57:07,584 --> 01:57:09,950
He's under us now.
Come back around.

2169
01:57:10,054 --> 01:57:11,715
Zeus, what's on your side?

2170
01:57:11,822 --> 01:57:13,722
Look like roaches
in the lights.

2171
01:57:15,827 --> 01:57:18,227
I'll be going
to Nova Scotia.

2172
01:57:18,330 --> 01:57:20,093
You go with the trucks.

2173
01:57:20,198 --> 01:57:22,598
I have something
personal to finish.

2174
01:57:25,370 --> 01:57:26,769
Let's go to work.

2175
01:57:40,719 --> 01:57:42,118
That's right, run,
motherfuckers!

2176
01:57:42,220 --> 01:57:44,120
The exterminators
are here!

2177
01:57:44,222 --> 01:57:45,587
Whoo!

2178
01:57:55,735 --> 01:57:57,134
What the fuck?

2179
01:57:59,338 --> 01:58:01,238
We got a chopper behind us!

2180
01:58:01,340 --> 01:58:03,001
Got a gun on board?

2181
01:58:03,109 --> 01:58:04,337
What is this?

2182
01:58:08,280 --> 01:58:11,078
Hold it still.
I can't see a thing.

2183
01:58:14,987 --> 01:58:16,386
Oh, shit!

2184
01:58:16,489 --> 01:58:17,717
Oh, shit!

2185
01:58:17,823 --> 01:58:20,155
What do you mean,
"Oh, shit"?

2186
01:58:21,260 --> 01:58:23,888
Hang on. Hang on.
We're going down.

2187
01:58:23,996 --> 01:58:25,054
Cease fire!

2188
01:58:25,164 --> 01:58:27,565
Hey, McClane,
what the fuck?

2189
01:58:29,636 --> 01:58:31,035
Hey, we got smoke!

2190
01:58:31,138 --> 01:58:34,539
We got fucking smoke
and shit flying on me!

2191
01:58:35,942 --> 01:58:36,840
Truck! Truck!

2192
01:58:36,943 --> 01:58:37,841
Hold on.

2193
01:58:44,351 --> 01:58:46,751
We got to get
out of here!

2194
01:58:46,853 --> 01:58:48,582
They'll start
shooting any second.

2195
01:58:48,688 --> 01:58:49,586
Oh, shit!

2196
01:58:49,689 --> 01:58:51,088
I can't get it off!

2197
01:58:51,191 --> 01:58:53,785
Look out!
Here he comes!

2198
01:58:55,996 --> 01:58:57,395
Can't get out, McClane.

2199
01:58:57,497 --> 01:58:58,896
Get him out of here.

2200
01:58:58,999 --> 01:59:00,227
Where you going?

2201
01:59:00,333 --> 01:59:01,664
I'll get his attention.

2202
01:59:20,822 --> 01:59:22,517
Shit.

2203
01:59:22,623 --> 01:59:24,420
This keeps getting
better and better.

2204
01:59:29,564 --> 01:59:30,963
I had no idea

2205
01:59:31,065 --> 01:59:33,499
Canada could be
this much fun.

2206
01:59:37,772 --> 01:59:40,765
Just give me something
to shoot at.

2207
01:59:40,876 --> 01:59:42,275
Come on, hotshot.

2208
01:59:42,377 --> 01:59:44,675
Show me that smiling face.

2209
02:00:06,034 --> 02:00:07,899
Say hello to your brother.

2210
02:00:10,038 --> 02:00:11,630
Get out of here!

2211
02:00:27,824 --> 02:00:30,122
Yippee-ki-yay,
motherfucker.

2212
02:00:33,263 --> 02:00:35,663
Looks like you got
his attention.

2213
02:00:35,765 --> 02:00:37,357
Yeah, looks like it.

2214
02:00:39,269 --> 02:00:41,669
Think we should call
a fire truck?

2215
02:00:41,771 --> 02:00:43,238
Fuck them.
Let him cook.

2216
02:00:45,975 --> 02:00:47,533
Oh, shit!

2217
02:00:47,644 --> 02:00:49,168
What?

2218
02:00:49,279 --> 02:00:50,644
What?

2219
02:00:50,747 --> 02:00:53,148
I left Holly
hanging on hold.

2220
02:00:53,250 --> 02:00:54,649
Aw, call her back.

2221
02:00:54,752 --> 02:00:56,151
I don't know.

2222
02:00:56,253 --> 02:00:58,278
She's going to be pissed.

2223
02:00:58,422 --> 02:01:00,014
She'll get over it.

2224
02:01:00,124 --> 02:01:02,854
I don't know, Zeus.

2225
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:04,359
Like I said,

2226
02:01:04,461 --> 02:01:06,361
she's a very stubborn woman.

2227
02:01:06,463 --> 02:01:09,694
She'd have to be
to stay married to you.

2228
02:01:09,800 --> 02:01:11,700
Ha ha ha! 
