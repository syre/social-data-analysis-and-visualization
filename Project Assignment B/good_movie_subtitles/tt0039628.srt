1
00:01:42,401 --> 00:01:45,063
You've got them mixed up.

2
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:48,335
You're making a mistake.

3
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:52,538
You're making a mistake
with the reindeer.

4
00:01:52,578 --> 00:01:53,806
Tsk tsk tsk.

5
00:01:57,316 --> 00:02:00,285
Would you mind stepping out
for a moment?

6
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,809
Open the door!

7
00:02:06,492 --> 00:02:08,016
I'm sorry.
The store isn't open today.

8
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,527
I don't want
to buy anything...

9
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,530
and I'm sorry
to interrupt your work...

10
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:14,362
but I wanted to tell you
you're making a serious mistake.

11
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,732
- Huh?
- With the reindeer, I mean.

12
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:19,135
You've got Cupid
where Blitzen should be.

13
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:22,732
And Dasher should be
on my right-hand side.

14
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:24,470
He should, huh?

15
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,341
Yes. And another thing...

16
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:29,576
Donner's antlers have got
four points instead of three.

17
00:02:29,615 --> 00:02:32,413
Still, I don't suppose anybody
would notice except myself.

18
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:34,749
No. I don't suppose so.

19
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:36,618
- Well, bye. Thanks.
- Not at all.

20
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,284
Glad to have helped you. Bye.

21
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,451
Yes.

22
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:50,124
Jingle bells,
jingle bells...

23
00:03:12,858 --> 00:03:15,224
You're on float number three.

24
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,729
You're on the Pilgrim float.

25
00:03:17,763 --> 00:03:20,732
You're on the pirate float.
You follow the van.

26
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:22,734
Mrs. Walker,
something's got to be done.

27
00:03:22,768 --> 00:03:24,736
That three-men-in-a-tub float
isn't big enough.

28
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,237
We can get
the butcher and the baker...

29
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:27,796
I'm awfully sorry...

30
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,740
but I've got enough to do
to take care of the people.

31
00:03:29,775 --> 00:03:31,572
I was hoping you could... George!

32
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,392
I beg your pardon, sir.

33
00:03:56,435 --> 00:03:59,268
You seem to have got mixed up
with this whip of yours.

34
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:02,399
Allow me, will you?
It's quite simple, really.

35
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:04,705
- You don't mind if I show you?
- No, sir.

36
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,904
Now, then.

37
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,717
- See? It's all in the wrist.
- Is that so?

38
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,218
Yes, of course.
If you follow through.

39
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:14,719
Is that so?

40
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,722
It's just like
throwing a ball.

41
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:20,214
If you were to...
You've been drinking.

42
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:22,227
Well, it's cold.

43
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:24,752
A man's got to do something
to keep warm.

44
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:26,230
You ought
to be ashamed of yourself.

45
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:29,029
Don't you realize there are
thousands of children...

46
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:31,502
lining the streets
waiting to see you...

47
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:34,233
children who have been dreaming
of this moment for weeks?

48
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:36,241
You're a disgrace to
the tradition of Christmas...

49
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:38,743
and I refuse to have you
malign me in this fashion.

50
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,769
Disgusting.

51
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:42,747
Tell me, who's in charge
of this parade?

52
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,250
When you find out, tell me.

53
00:04:45,284 --> 00:04:48,481
These pants are gonna fall off
in Columbus Circle.

54
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,249
I beg your pardon.
Who's in charge here?

55
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:58,695
Mrs. Walker.
There she is, down there.

56
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:00,699
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

57
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:03,293
You two ought to be
over on 81st Street.

58
00:05:03,335 --> 00:05:06,133
Mrs. Walker,
one of the men in your parade...

59
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:08,197
What are you doing
out of costume?

60
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,265
Get back and get dressed...
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

61
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:12,334
I thought
you were our Santa Claus.

62
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:14,141
Your Santa Claus
is intoxicated.

63
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,375
- Oh, no!
- Yes. It's disgraceful.

64
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:19,111
How can you allow a man
to get into such a position?

65
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:23,683
Jingle bells, jingle bells...

66
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:25,315
Stop that!
What do you mean by drinking?

67
00:05:25,357 --> 00:05:27,257
You know it's not allowed.

68
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:29,557
A man's got to do
something to keep warm.

69
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,927
I'll warm you.
I ought to take this cane...

70
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:35,024
Somebody, Julian,
get some black coffee...

71
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:36,227
plenty of it, too.

72
00:05:36,268 --> 00:05:37,530
Yes, Mrs. Walker.

73
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:40,164
Black with a little cream.

74
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,367
Wake me up
when the parade starts.

75
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:45,377
Jingle bells, jingle bells

76
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:48,346
Jingle all the way

77
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:55,618
Shameful! Absolutely shameful!

78
00:05:55,654 --> 00:05:58,054
Could you be Santa Claus?

79
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,921
Have you had any experience?

80
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,221
Oh, a little.

81
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,490
Oh, please.
You've got to help me out.

82
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,520
I am not in the habit
of substituting...

83
00:06:05,564 --> 00:06:07,555
for spurious Santa Clauses.

84
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,261
- Oh, please.
- No, I...

85
00:06:11,203 --> 00:06:14,172
Well, the children
mustn't be disappointed.

86
00:06:14,206 --> 00:06:15,901
All right, I'll do it.

87
00:06:15,941 --> 00:06:18,671
Oh, good. Thank you.
Come right this way.

88
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,838
Get that costume.

89
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,278
Wonderful!
He's the best we've ever had...

90
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:00,785
and he didn't need any padding.

91
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,946
What?

92
00:07:01,987 --> 00:07:04,285
He didn't need padding.
Where did you find him?

93
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:05,984
I just turned round,
and there he was.

94
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:08,721
I'm glad you turned round.

95
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,922
Just think if Mr. Macy
had seen the other one!

96
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:13,989
Just think if Mr. Gimbel
had seen the other one.

97
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,228
You want to ride
in the motorcycle or a car?

98
00:07:16,268 --> 00:07:18,133
No. I'm going home
and get in a hot tub...

99
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,797
and I might stay there
until next Thanksgiving.

100
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,171
You should see it.
You worked so hard.

101
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,732
If I want to, which I doubt...

102
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,244
I can see it from
the roof of my apartment.

103
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:28,007
That's right,
you live down the...

104
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:29,514
Mrs. Walker!

105
00:08:02,214 --> 00:08:03,374
Susan!

106
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:10,880
Susan?

107
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:17,154
- Hello, Cleo.
- Hello, Mrs. Walker.

108
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,891
What a beauty.
Where's Susan?

109
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,990
She's watching the parade.

110
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:23,001
Where? With whom?

111
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:26,493
With that Mr. Gailey
in the front apartment.

112
00:08:26,538 --> 00:08:28,028
Oh, yes.

113
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:32,134
I've been keeping
an eye on her.

114
00:08:32,177 --> 00:08:34,168
She can see everything
from there.

115
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:35,612
That's the 50 yard line.

116
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:37,809
He's so very fond of Susan.

117
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,825
When he asked me,
I didn't think you'd mind.

118
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,051
Well, I guess it's all right.

119
00:08:42,094 --> 00:08:44,324
I'll go on in a minute.

120
00:08:44,363 --> 00:08:46,957
Looks like they're
having a little trouble...

121
00:08:46,998 --> 00:08:48,363
with the baseball player.

122
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,095
He was a clown last year.

123
00:08:50,135 --> 00:08:52,603
They just changed the head
and painted him different.

124
00:08:52,637 --> 00:08:53,968
My mother told me.

125
00:08:54,005 --> 00:08:57,338
He certainly is a giant,
isn't he?

126
00:08:57,376 --> 00:09:00,209
Not really.
There are no giants, Mr. Gailey.

127
00:09:00,245 --> 00:09:02,907
Maybe not now, Suzie...

128
00:09:02,948 --> 00:09:05,576
but in olden days,
there were a lot of...

129
00:09:08,487 --> 00:09:10,352
What about the giant
that Jack killed?

130
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:13,722
Jack? Jack who?

131
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:14,919
Jack...

132
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:19,729
Jack!

133
00:09:19,765 --> 00:09:21,733
"Jack and the Beanstalk."

134
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:23,735
I never heard of that.

135
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:25,566
You must've heard that.
You've just forgotten.

136
00:09:25,604 --> 00:09:27,265
It's a fairy tale.

137
00:09:27,305 --> 00:09:30,638
Oh, one of those.
I don't know any.

138
00:09:30,675 --> 00:09:35,237
Your mother and father
must have told you a fairy tale.

139
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,407
No. My mother thinks
they're silly.

140
00:09:37,449 --> 00:09:40,247
I don't know whether my father
thinks they're silly or not.

141
00:09:40,285 --> 00:09:42,082
I never met my father.

142
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,351
My father and mother were
divorced when I was a baby.

143
00:09:49,161 --> 00:09:51,959
Well, that baseball player
looks like a giant to me.

144
00:09:51,997 --> 00:09:55,694
People sometimes grow very big,
but that's abnormal.

145
00:09:55,734 --> 00:09:58,328
I'll bet your mother
told you that, too.

146
00:10:06,378 --> 00:10:08,539
Hello.
I'm Susan's mother.

147
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,605
Yes, I know.
Won't you come in?

148
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:13,049
Suzie's told me quite a lot
about you. I'm Fred Gailey.

149
00:10:13,084 --> 00:10:14,210
Yes, I know.

150
00:10:14,252 --> 00:10:16,243
Susan's told me quite
a lot about you, too.

151
00:10:16,288 --> 00:10:19,621
- Hello, Mother!
- Hello, dear.

152
00:10:19,658 --> 00:10:23,321
A cup of coffee?
You must be half frozen.

153
00:10:23,361 --> 00:10:25,921
- Oh, don't bother.
- It's all ready.

154
00:10:25,964 --> 00:10:28,865
In that case, thanks.
What do you think of my parade?

155
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,868
It's much better
than last year's.

156
00:10:30,902 --> 00:10:32,563
Well, I hope
Mr. Macy agrees with you.

157
00:10:32,604 --> 00:10:35,869
Sugar? Cream?
Both? Neither?

158
00:10:35,907 --> 00:10:38,034
Just one sugar, please.

159
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:42,308
This is very kind of you,
Mr. Gailey.

160
00:10:42,347 --> 00:10:43,609
Sit down.

161
00:10:43,648 --> 00:10:45,639
I want to thank you
for being so kind to Susan.

162
00:10:45,684 --> 00:10:48,881
Cleo tells me you took them
to the zoo yesterday.

163
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,047
That's right,
but I must confess.

164
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:53,819
It's part of a deep-dyed plot.

165
00:10:53,859 --> 00:10:59,161
I'm fond of Suzie, very fond,
but I also wanted to meet you.

166
00:10:59,197 --> 00:11:01,757
I read someplace the surest way
to meet the mother...

167
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,529
is to be kind to the child.

168
00:11:03,568 --> 00:11:05,661
What a horrible trick.

169
00:11:05,704 --> 00:11:07,672
It worked.

170
00:11:07,706 --> 00:11:09,833
There goes Santa Claus.

171
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,742
Oh, don't even
mention the name.

172
00:11:12,777 --> 00:11:15,075
He's much better
than last year's.

173
00:11:15,113 --> 00:11:17,479
At least this one
doesn't wear glasses.

174
00:11:17,516 --> 00:11:19,609
This one was
a last-minute substitute.

175
00:11:19,651 --> 00:11:21,619
The one I hired I fired.

176
00:11:21,653 --> 00:11:22,950
Why?

177
00:11:22,988 --> 00:11:25,889
You remember
the janitor last New Year's?

178
00:11:25,924 --> 00:11:28,119
Ohh, yes.

179
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:31,219
Well,
this one was much worse.

180
00:11:31,263 --> 00:11:32,525
Oh.

181
00:11:32,564 --> 00:11:35,226
I see she doesn't
believe in Santa Claus, either.

182
00:11:35,267 --> 00:11:38,065
No Santa Claus,
no fairy tales...

183
00:11:38,103 --> 00:11:41,334
no fantasies of any kind,
is that it?

184
00:11:41,373 --> 00:11:44,137
That's right.
We should be realistic...

185
00:11:44,175 --> 00:11:46,143
and completely truthful
with our children...

186
00:11:46,177 --> 00:11:47,644
and not have them growing up
believing in...

187
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:51,809
a lot of legends and myths
like Santa Claus, for example.

188
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,147
I see.

189
00:11:53,184 --> 00:11:56,585
That's the end.
The acrobats were good.

190
00:11:56,621 --> 00:11:58,646
They ought to be
at those prices.

191
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,487
Thanks for the coffee.

192
00:12:00,525 --> 00:12:02,755
And thank you
for inviting me in.

193
00:12:02,794 --> 00:12:05,194
It was a pleasure, missy.

194
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,720
Mother, I was thinking...

195
00:12:06,765 --> 00:12:08,756
we've got such
a big turkey for dinner...

196
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,768
and there are only two of us.

197
00:12:10,802 --> 00:12:13,930
Couldn't we invite Mr. Gailey?

198
00:12:13,972 --> 00:12:15,837
Oh, don't even
think about it.

199
00:12:15,874 --> 00:12:18,001
I'll have a sandwich
or something.

200
00:12:18,043 --> 00:12:20,011
It's an awful big turkey.

201
00:12:20,045 --> 00:12:21,273
That's not it, dear...

202
00:12:21,313 --> 00:12:23,975
but I'm sure Mr. Gailey
has other plans.

203
00:12:24,015 --> 00:12:26,142
No, he hasn't. Have you?

204
00:12:26,184 --> 00:12:29,517
To be quite honest
and truthful with the child...

205
00:12:29,554 --> 00:12:31,215
I must admit
I haven't any other plans.

206
00:12:31,256 --> 00:12:33,451
Please, Mother!

207
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:35,049
Did I ask all right?

208
00:12:35,093 --> 00:12:36,287
Hmm?

209
00:12:41,099 --> 00:12:43,397
Didn't I ask all right,
Mr. Gailey?

210
00:12:43,435 --> 00:12:46,029
That all depends.

211
00:12:47,706 --> 00:12:49,333
Dinner's at 3:00.

212
00:12:49,374 --> 00:12:51,365
Thanks.

213
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:53,809
Suzie, honey,
you asked just right.

214
00:12:53,845 --> 00:12:55,676
I'll see you at 3:00.

215
00:12:56,681 --> 00:12:59,172
- It worked.
- Yes.

216
00:13:03,622 --> 00:13:06,250
I tell you,
Mrs. Walker, he's stupendous.

217
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,418
Everybody's crazy about him.
So is Mr. Macy.

218
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,360
Well, hire him,
by all means.

219
00:13:10,395 --> 00:13:11,919
It's perfectly
all right with me.

220
00:13:11,963 --> 00:13:15,296
It'll save me a frantic search
in the morning.

221
00:13:17,302 --> 00:13:19,361
Yes. That's right.

222
00:13:19,404 --> 00:13:21,497
I'll take care of it as soon
as he gets through.

223
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:22,665
You'll love him.

224
00:13:22,707 --> 00:13:24,436
I just know that
with that man on the throne...

225
00:13:24,476 --> 00:13:26,501
my department will sell
more toys than it ever has.

226
00:13:26,544 --> 00:13:28,535
He's a born salesman.
I just feel it.

227
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,842
Yes, yes, yes.

228
00:13:29,881 --> 00:13:31,974
We'll talk about it
in the morning. Good-bye.

229
00:13:32,017 --> 00:13:33,177
Good-bye.

230
00:13:34,719 --> 00:13:39,349
And you'll find toys
of all kinds at Macy's.

231
00:13:52,337 --> 00:13:54,635
Gee, that sure is
an elegant costume.

232
00:13:54,673 --> 00:13:59,042
Yes. I've had it
for years and years.

233
00:13:59,077 --> 00:14:01,910
Sure makes a bum
out of the one they gave you.

234
00:14:01,946 --> 00:14:03,937
Even that one's better
than the one I wear.

235
00:14:03,982 --> 00:14:05,244
You, Alfred?

236
00:14:05,283 --> 00:14:08,184
I play Santa Claus
over at the "Y" near our block.

237
00:14:08,219 --> 00:14:09,345
No kidding!

238
00:14:09,387 --> 00:14:11,355
Started about three years ago.

239
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:15,587
They had a costume,
but it didn't have no padding...

240
00:14:15,627 --> 00:14:18,095
and since I carry my own
padding around with me...

241
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:19,687
I got the job, see?

242
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:23,290
You enjoy impersonating me?

243
00:14:23,334 --> 00:14:26,326
- Oh, yeah.
- Why?

244
00:14:26,371 --> 00:14:28,601
I don't know. It's...

245
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,006
When I give packages
to little kids...

246
00:14:31,042 --> 00:14:33,738
I like to watch
their faces get that...

247
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:35,769
that Christmas look
all of a sudden.

248
00:14:35,814 --> 00:14:38,647
It makes me feel
kind of good and important.

249
00:14:43,154 --> 00:14:44,621
Pardon me!

250
00:14:44,656 --> 00:14:46,385
I bought
a 23-pound turkey.

251
00:14:46,424 --> 00:14:49,689
I had my daughter and her kids
over for dinner yesterday.

252
00:14:52,797 --> 00:14:54,822
There you are.

253
00:14:54,866 --> 00:14:55,992
Good morning.

254
00:14:56,034 --> 00:14:58,628
Oh, my,
what a striking costume!

255
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,797
Before you go up on the floor,
I want to give you...

256
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:02,914
a few tips on how to be
a good Santa Claus.

257
00:15:03,047 --> 00:15:04,275
Go right ahead.

258
00:15:04,315 --> 00:15:07,148
Here's a list
of toys that we have to push.

259
00:15:07,185 --> 00:15:09,847
You know, things
that we're overstocked on.

260
00:15:09,887 --> 00:15:11,354
Now, you'll find
that a great many children...

261
00:15:11,389 --> 00:15:13,789
will be undecided as to what
they want for Christmas.

262
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:18,285
When that happens,
you suggest one of these items.

263
00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:19,455
You understand?

264
00:15:19,497 --> 00:15:21,192
I certainly do.

265
00:15:21,232 --> 00:15:24,201
Good.
You memorize that list...

266
00:15:24,235 --> 00:15:26,203
Oh, no. 9:50.

267
00:15:26,237 --> 00:15:28,705
When you've finished,
come up to the seventh floor.

268
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,139
I'll be waiting for you.

269
00:15:32,744 --> 00:15:34,507
Imagine...

270
00:15:34,545 --> 00:15:37,412
making a child take something
it doesn't want...

271
00:15:37,448 --> 00:15:40,542
just because he bought
too many of the wrong toys.

272
00:15:40,585 --> 00:15:43,645
That's what I've been
fighting against for years...

273
00:15:43,688 --> 00:15:45,679
the way they
commercialize Christmas.

274
00:15:45,723 --> 00:15:48,886
A lot of bad "isms"
floating around this world...

275
00:15:48,926 --> 00:15:50,826
but one of the worst
is commercialism.

276
00:15:50,862 --> 00:15:52,557
Make a buck. Make a buck.

277
00:15:52,597 --> 00:15:54,565
Even in Brooklyn,
it's the same.

278
00:15:54,599 --> 00:15:56,760
Don't care what Christmas
stands for.

279
00:15:56,801 --> 00:15:59,269
Just make a buck.

280
00:15:59,303 --> 00:16:01,362
Oh, don't bother.
I'll put it away for you.

281
00:16:01,406 --> 00:16:03,567
Eh?
Oh, thank you, Alfred.

282
00:16:05,543 --> 00:16:06,942
And what should I do
with these?

283
00:16:06,978 --> 00:16:09,003
Throw them on the floor.

284
00:16:09,047 --> 00:16:11,242
I get kind of tired
just sweeping up dust.

285
00:16:11,282 --> 00:16:12,476
Mm-hmm.

286
00:16:13,718 --> 00:16:16,551
- Thanks.
- Well, thank you, Alfred.

287
00:16:23,561 --> 00:16:27,190
Yes, yes, yes.
Peter's a fine name.

288
00:16:27,231 --> 00:16:28,596
What do you want
for Christmas, Peter?

289
00:16:28,633 --> 00:16:32,034
A fire engine, just like
the big ones only smaller...

290
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:34,061
that has a real hose
that squirts real water.

291
00:16:34,105 --> 00:16:36,869
I won't do it in the house,
only in the backyard.

292
00:16:36,908 --> 00:16:38,500
I promise.

293
00:16:38,543 --> 00:16:40,204
Psst! Psst!

294
00:16:40,244 --> 00:16:43,270
Macy's ain't got any.
Nobody's got any.

295
00:16:43,314 --> 00:16:45,874
Well, Peter,
I can tell you're a good boy.

296
00:16:45,917 --> 00:16:47,145
You'll get your fire engine.

297
00:16:47,185 --> 00:16:50,052
Oh, thank you very much!

298
00:16:50,088 --> 00:16:53,319
You see?
I told you he'd get me one.

299
00:16:53,357 --> 00:16:55,325
That's fine.
That's just dandy.

300
00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:56,883
Listen, you wait over there.

301
00:16:56,928 --> 00:17:00,364
Mama wants to thank
Santa Claus, too.

302
00:17:00,398 --> 00:17:02,832
Say, listen,
what's the matter with you?

303
00:17:02,867 --> 00:17:04,357
Don't you understand English?

304
00:17:04,402 --> 00:17:07,394
I tell you nobody's got any.

305
00:17:07,438 --> 00:17:09,736
I've been all over.
My feet are killing me.

306
00:17:09,774 --> 00:17:11,742
A fine thing, promising the kid.

307
00:17:11,776 --> 00:17:15,109
You don't think I would've
said that unless I'm sure?

308
00:17:15,146 --> 00:17:18,946
You can get those fire engines
at Schoenfeld's on Lexington.

309
00:17:18,983 --> 00:17:20,917
Only 8.50. A wonderful bargain.

310
00:17:20,952 --> 00:17:23,318
Schoenfeld's?
I don't get it.

311
00:17:23,354 --> 00:17:26,187
I keep track of
the toy market pretty closely.

312
00:17:26,224 --> 00:17:27,555
Does that surprise you so?

313
00:17:27,592 --> 00:17:29,184
Surprise me?

314
00:17:29,227 --> 00:17:31,718
Macy's sending people
to other stores?

315
00:17:31,762 --> 00:17:33,059
Are you kidding me?

316
00:17:33,097 --> 00:17:36,032
The only important thing
is to make the children happy.

317
00:17:36,067 --> 00:17:39,127
Who sells the toy
doesn't make any difference.

318
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,728
Don't you feel that way?

319
00:17:40,771 --> 00:17:43,239
Who, me? Oh, yeah, sure.

320
00:17:43,274 --> 00:17:45,003
Only I didn't know Macy's did.

321
00:17:45,042 --> 00:17:46,805
As long as I'm here, they do.

322
00:17:46,844 --> 00:17:48,709
I don't get it.

323
00:17:48,746 --> 00:17:52,273
No, I just don't get it.

324
00:18:13,037 --> 00:18:14,504
I quite understand.

325
00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:16,336
Your little girl
would like some skates.

326
00:18:16,374 --> 00:18:17,966
But of course,
you must get her the best...

327
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:20,409
'cause their little ankles
want protecting.

328
00:18:20,444 --> 00:18:23,811
Our skates are very good,
but not quite good enough.

329
00:18:23,848 --> 00:18:25,873
You go to Gimbels.

330
00:18:25,917 --> 00:18:27,441
They'll have exactly what
you're looking for.

331
00:18:27,485 --> 00:18:29,851
There you are, dear.
That's for you.

332
00:18:29,887 --> 00:18:31,013
Merry Christmas.

333
00:18:31,055 --> 00:18:32,215
Gimbels.

334
00:18:32,256 --> 00:18:35,919
Hello, my little girl.
How old are you?

335
00:18:38,095 --> 00:18:40,325
Gimbels.

336
00:18:40,364 --> 00:18:42,525
Gimbels!

337
00:18:42,567 --> 00:18:44,398
Pardon me.
The guard said to speak to you.

338
00:18:44,435 --> 00:18:45,902
You're the head
of the toy department?

339
00:18:45,937 --> 00:18:47,404
Yes, madam...

340
00:18:47,438 --> 00:18:50,134
Listen. I want to
congratulate you and Macy's...

341
00:18:50,174 --> 00:18:52,699
on this wonderful new stunt
you're pulling.

342
00:18:52,743 --> 00:18:55,337
Imagine, sending people
to other stores.

343
00:18:55,379 --> 00:18:57,040
I don't get it. Why, it's...

344
00:18:57,081 --> 00:18:59,641
- It certainly is.
- You said it.

345
00:18:59,684 --> 00:19:01,811
Imagine a big outfit
like Macy's...

346
00:19:01,852 --> 00:19:04,377
putting the spirit of Christmas
ahead of the commercial.

347
00:19:04,422 --> 00:19:06,219
It's wonderful.

348
00:19:06,257 --> 00:19:08,316
I never done
much shopping here before...

349
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:12,557
but from now on, I'm going
to be a regular Macy customer.

350
00:19:12,597 --> 00:19:13,996
All right, dear.

351
00:19:14,031 --> 00:19:15,658
Thank you, madam.

352
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,971
There are six more
women who want to thank you.

353
00:19:22,006 --> 00:19:25,271
Not now. I've got
to think this thing over.

354
00:19:25,309 --> 00:19:28,437
Personally, I think
it's a wonderful idea, too.

355
00:19:28,479 --> 00:19:31,346
You think so.
Those women think so.

356
00:19:31,382 --> 00:19:34,317
The point is,
will Mr. Macy think so?

357
00:19:37,555 --> 00:19:40,683
This seems awfully silly,
Mr. Gailey.

358
00:19:40,725 --> 00:19:43,489
I thought as long
as we're in the store...

359
00:19:43,527 --> 00:19:45,688
you might as well
say hello to Santa Claus.

360
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,197
Why?

361
00:19:47,231 --> 00:19:49,358
Because when
you talk to him...

362
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,493
you might feel
differently about him.

363
00:19:57,074 --> 00:20:00,043
Good-bye, Elmer.
Be a good boy now.

364
00:20:00,077 --> 00:20:01,339
Merry Christmas!

365
00:20:02,413 --> 00:20:03,903
Well, young lady,
what's your name?

366
00:20:03,948 --> 00:20:06,109
Susan Walker.
What's yours?

367
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:08,345
Mine? Kris Kringle.

368
00:20:08,386 --> 00:20:10,354
I'm Santa Claus.

369
00:20:10,388 --> 00:20:13,721
Oh, you don't believe that,
do you?

370
00:20:13,758 --> 00:20:17,819
My mother's Mrs. Walker,
the lady who hired you.

371
00:20:17,862 --> 00:20:19,329
Oh.

372
00:20:19,363 --> 00:20:22,423
But I must say,
you're the best one I've seen.

373
00:20:22,466 --> 00:20:23,728
Really?

374
00:20:23,768 --> 00:20:26,328
Your beard doesn't have
those things over your ears.

375
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:29,533
That's because it's real,
like I'm really Santa Claus.

376
00:20:30,775 --> 00:20:32,743
Oh, go ahead, pull it.

377
00:20:34,045 --> 00:20:35,376
Ouch.

378
00:20:38,115 --> 00:20:40,049
All right, folks,
don't crowd.

379
00:20:40,084 --> 00:20:41,745
You have all day
to see Santa Claus.

380
00:20:41,786 --> 00:20:44,152
Now, children, behave.
This way, please.

381
00:20:44,188 --> 00:20:45,587
Get back in the line there.

382
00:20:45,623 --> 00:20:48,649
What would you like me
to bring you for Christmas?

383
00:20:48,693 --> 00:20:50,593
Nothing, thank you.

384
00:20:50,628 --> 00:20:52,823
Oh, come now.
You must want something.

385
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:55,195
Whatever I want,
my mother will get for me...

386
00:20:55,232 --> 00:20:57,700
if it's sensible and doesn't
cost too much, of course.

387
00:20:57,735 --> 00:20:58,861
Hello, Mother.

388
00:20:58,903 --> 00:21:00,336
Hello, Susan, Mr. Gailey.

389
00:21:00,371 --> 00:21:03,704
I think you've taken up enough
of this gentleman's time.

390
00:21:03,741 --> 00:21:07,040
The explanation for this
is all very simple.

391
00:21:07,078 --> 00:21:08,705
Cleo's mother
sprained her ankle.

392
00:21:08,746 --> 00:21:11,214
She had to go home and asked me
to bring Suzie down to you.

393
00:21:11,248 --> 00:21:13,739
Yes, Cleo called me.
I was wondering where you were.

394
00:21:13,784 --> 00:21:16,446
As long as we're here,
we should say hello to Santa.

395
00:21:16,487 --> 00:21:20,184
He's a nice old man,
and those whiskers are real.

396
00:21:20,224 --> 00:21:23,193
Yes, dear. Many men
have long beards like that.

397
00:21:23,227 --> 00:21:25,058
Susan, would you stand
over here a minute?

398
00:21:25,096 --> 00:21:27,564
I want to talk to Mr. Gailey.

399
00:21:27,598 --> 00:21:30,567
I shouldn't have brought
Suzie to see Santa Claus?

400
00:21:30,601 --> 00:21:33,536
You're making me feel
like the proverbial stepmother.

401
00:21:33,571 --> 00:21:35,732
I'm sorry, but I just
couldn't see any harm...

402
00:21:35,773 --> 00:21:37,673
in just saying hello
to the old fellow.

403
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,573
But I think there is harm.

404
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:42,204
I tell her Santa Claus is
a myth, you bring her here...

405
00:21:42,246 --> 00:21:44,373
and she sees hundreds
of gullible children...

406
00:21:44,415 --> 00:21:47,316
meets a very convincing
old man with real whiskers.

407
00:21:47,351 --> 00:21:50,582
This sets up a very harmful
mental conflict within her.

408
00:21:50,621 --> 00:21:53,283
What is she going to think?
Who is she going to believe?

409
00:21:58,982 --> 00:22:00,472
And by filling them
full of fairy tales...

410
00:22:00,517 --> 00:22:03,918
they grow up considering life
a fantasy instead of a reality.

411
00:22:03,954 --> 00:22:06,923
They keep waiting for
Prince Charming to come along.

412
00:22:06,957 --> 00:22:08,925
And when he does,
he turns out to be a...

413
00:22:08,959 --> 00:22:11,757
We were talking
about Suzie, not about you.

414
00:22:11,795 --> 00:22:13,592
Whether you agree or not...

415
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,861
I must ask you to respect
my wishes regarding Susan.

416
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,697
She's my responsibility...

417
00:22:18,735 --> 00:22:20,600
and I must bring her up
as I see fit.

418
00:22:20,637 --> 00:22:21,797
OK.

419
00:22:29,613 --> 00:22:31,604
- Say "Thank you."
- Thank you.

420
00:22:31,648 --> 00:22:33,343
Bye. Merry Christmas!

421
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,046
Well, young lady,
what's your name?

422
00:22:38,088 --> 00:22:40,181
I'm sorry.
She doesn't speak English.

423
00:22:40,223 --> 00:22:43,021
She's Dutch. She just came over.

424
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,119
She's been living
in an orphans home...

425
00:22:45,162 --> 00:22:47,790
in Rotterdam ever since...

426
00:22:47,831 --> 00:22:49,059
We've adopted her.

427
00:22:49,099 --> 00:22:51,590
I told her you wouldn't
be able to speak to her...

428
00:22:51,635 --> 00:22:53,603
but when she saw you
in the parade yesterday...

429
00:22:53,637 --> 00:22:56,265
she said you were
"Sinter Claes"...

430
00:22:56,306 --> 00:22:58,240
and you could talk to her.

431
00:22:58,275 --> 00:22:59,401
I didn't know what to do.

432
00:22:59,443 --> 00:23:02,412
Hello.

433
00:23:48,658 --> 00:23:50,285
Now do you understand?

434
00:23:50,327 --> 00:23:52,124
Yes, I see what
you mean, Mother.

435
00:23:52,162 --> 00:23:53,390
Good.

436
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:56,831
But when he spoke Dutch
to that girl, he was so...

437
00:23:56,867 --> 00:24:00,325
Susan, I speak French,
but I'm not Joan of Arc.

438
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:03,339
What I'm trying
to explain is... Come in.

439
00:24:03,373 --> 00:24:05,204
They said you wanted
to see me, Mrs. Walker.

440
00:24:05,242 --> 00:24:06,709
Come right in.

441
00:24:06,743 --> 00:24:08,301
Hello there!
Good to see you again.

442
00:24:08,345 --> 00:24:09,710
It's nice to see you.

443
00:24:09,746 --> 00:24:11,145
You're awfully lucky,
Mrs. Walker.

444
00:24:11,181 --> 00:24:12,910
Lovely little girl
you have here.

445
00:24:12,949 --> 00:24:15,884
Thank you. Susan's why
I asked you to drop down.

446
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,216
She's a little confused...

447
00:24:17,254 --> 00:24:18,778
and I thought you could help
straighten her out.

448
00:24:18,822 --> 00:24:20,084
Oh, glad to.

449
00:24:20,123 --> 00:24:23,957
Would you please tell her
you're not really Santa Claus...

450
00:24:23,994 --> 00:24:26,622
that there actually
is no such person?

451
00:24:26,663 --> 00:24:28,597
I'm sorry to disagree
with you, Mrs. Walker.

452
00:24:28,632 --> 00:24:31,465
Not only is there such a person,
but here I am to prove it.

453
00:24:31,501 --> 00:24:33,560
No, you misunderstand.

454
00:24:33,603 --> 00:24:36,572
I want you to tell her
the truth. What's your name?

455
00:24:36,606 --> 00:24:38,631
Kris Kringle. I'll bet
you're in the first grade.

456
00:24:38,675 --> 00:24:39,801
Second.

457
00:24:39,843 --> 00:24:41,470
I mean your real name.

458
00:24:41,511 --> 00:24:43,775
That is my real name.
Second grade?

459
00:24:43,814 --> 00:24:45,213
It's a progressive school.

460
00:24:45,248 --> 00:24:47,910
Oh,
it's a progressive school.

461
00:24:47,951 --> 00:24:50,351
May I have this man's
employment card, please?

462
00:24:50,387 --> 00:24:51,513
Yes, Mrs. Walker.

463
00:24:51,555 --> 00:24:52,988
This dress is very cute.

464
00:24:53,023 --> 00:24:54,888
Where did you get
such a lovely outfit?

465
00:24:54,925 --> 00:24:57,655
Here at Macy's.
We get 10% off.

466
00:24:57,694 --> 00:25:00,663
Please don't feel
you have to pretend for Susan.

467
00:25:00,697 --> 00:25:02,631
She's a very
intelligent child...

468
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:04,759
and always wants to know
the absolute truth.

469
00:25:04,801 --> 00:25:06,701
Good, because I always
tell the absolute truth.

470
00:25:06,736 --> 00:25:09,728
About your school...
What's the name of your teacher?

471
00:25:09,773 --> 00:25:11,866
Mrs. Haley.

472
00:25:11,908 --> 00:25:14,502
- Here it is, Mrs. Walker.
- Thank you.

473
00:25:14,544 --> 00:25:16,910
What else do you do
besides read and play games?

474
00:25:16,947 --> 00:25:20,110
We have rest periods
for one half-hour.

475
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:22,243
I don't suppose
you care for that, eh?

476
00:25:22,285 --> 00:25:25,413
No. We're not allowed
to talk or anything.

477
00:25:25,455 --> 00:25:28,891
Tuesday, Chester Richards
kept talking all the time.

478
00:25:28,925 --> 00:25:30,984
My, that was bad, eh?

479
00:25:31,027 --> 00:25:34,554
Mrs. Haley made him rest
all alone for nearly an hour.

480
00:25:34,598 --> 00:25:38,762
Susan, would you go out
and talk to Miss Adams?

481
00:25:38,802 --> 00:25:40,429
I'll be right with you.

482
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,937
All right. Good-bye.

483
00:25:41,972 --> 00:25:43,769
Good-bye, young lady.
Hope to see you again.

484
00:25:43,807 --> 00:25:46,105
Thank you.
I hope so, too. Bye.

485
00:25:46,143 --> 00:25:47,269
Good-bye.

486
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:50,768
I'm sorry, Mr., uh... Mr...

487
00:25:50,814 --> 00:25:52,111
Kringle.

488
00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:54,117
I'm sorry, but we're
going to have to make a change.

489
00:25:54,151 --> 00:25:55,277
Change?

490
00:25:55,318 --> 00:25:57,445
The Santa Claus
that we had two years ago...

491
00:25:57,487 --> 00:25:59,614
is back in town,
and I feel we owe it to him...

492
00:25:59,656 --> 00:26:01,123
Have I done something wrong?

493
00:26:01,158 --> 00:26:03,217
Oh, no, no.

494
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,887
Well...

495
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:07,656
Yes?

496
00:26:07,697 --> 00:26:10,222
Mr. Macy wants
to see you immediately.

497
00:26:10,267 --> 00:26:11,757
I'll be right up.

498
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,431
Would you sit down...

499
00:26:15,472 --> 00:26:18,566
and I'll be right back
and sign your pay voucher.

500
00:26:20,277 --> 00:26:21,744
Yes, indeed.

501
00:26:21,778 --> 00:26:25,305
Go right in.
Mr. Macy's waiting.

502
00:26:26,816 --> 00:26:29,284
The effect this will
have on the public is...

503
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:30,718
Come in, Mrs. Walker.

504
00:26:30,754 --> 00:26:34,554
- Hello, Mrs. Walker.
- Sit over here.

505
00:26:34,591 --> 00:26:37,719
I've been telling these
gentlemen the new policy...

506
00:26:37,761 --> 00:26:39,422
you and Mr. Shellhammer
initiated.

507
00:26:39,462 --> 00:26:42,226
I can't say that I approve
of your not consulting...

508
00:26:42,265 --> 00:26:44,130
the advertising department
first...

509
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:47,568
but in the face of this
tremendous public response...

510
00:26:47,604 --> 00:26:49,572
I can't be angry with you.

511
00:26:49,606 --> 00:26:51,938
- What's he talking about?
- Tell you later.

512
00:26:51,975 --> 00:26:53,340
Now, to continue, gentlemen.

513
00:26:53,376 --> 00:26:57,142
I admit this plan sounds
idiotic and impossible.

514
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:00,843
Imagine Macy's Santa Claus
sending customers to Gimbels.

515
00:27:00,884 --> 00:27:05,480
Ho ho. But, gentlemen,
you cannot argue with success.

516
00:27:05,522 --> 00:27:07,513
Look at this.

517
00:27:07,557 --> 00:27:09,525
Telegrams,
messages, telephone calls.

518
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:11,550
The governor's wife,
the mayor's wife...

519
00:27:11,595 --> 00:27:13,563
over 500 thankful parents...

520
00:27:13,597 --> 00:27:15,827
expressing
undying gratitude to Macy's.

521
00:27:15,865 --> 00:27:18,299
Never in my entire career...

522
00:27:18,335 --> 00:27:20,701
have I seen such a tremendous
and immediate response...

523
00:27:20,737 --> 00:27:22,466
to a merchandising policy.

524
00:27:22,505 --> 00:27:26,202
And I'm positive, Frank,
if we expand our policy...

525
00:27:26,243 --> 00:27:28,211
we'll expand
our results as well.

526
00:27:28,245 --> 00:27:30,770
Therefore, from now on...

527
00:27:30,814 --> 00:27:33,214
not only will our Santa Claus
continue in this manner...

528
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,980
but I want every salesperson
in this store...

529
00:27:36,019 --> 00:27:37,816
to do precisely the same thing.

530
00:27:37,854 --> 00:27:40,793
If we haven't got exactly
what the customer wants...

531
00:27:40,927 --> 00:27:42,986
we'll send him
where he can get it.

532
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:44,997
No high pressuring
and forcing a customer...

533
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:46,658
to take something
he doesn't really want.

534
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:50,032
We'll be known
as the helpful store...

535
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:52,731
the friendly store,
the store with a heart...

536
00:27:52,772 --> 00:27:56,435
the store that places
public service ahead of profits.

537
00:27:56,476 --> 00:27:59,445
And, consequently, we'll make
more profits than ever before.

538
00:27:59,479 --> 00:28:02,315
Yes, I know it's late,
and we're all tired...

539
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,714
and we want to go to dinner...

540
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,980
so we'll continue first thing
in the morning.

541
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:08,249
In the meantime,
you fellas get together...

542
00:28:08,288 --> 00:28:10,449
and figure out the best way
to promote this thing.

543
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,685
We'll do that. Good night, R.H.

544
00:28:12,725 --> 00:28:13,851
Good night.

545
00:28:13,893 --> 00:28:17,090
I want to thank you two again.

546
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,791
And in your
Christmas envelopes...

547
00:28:18,831 --> 00:28:21,493
you'll find a more practical
expression of my gratitude.

548
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:22,660
Thank you, Mr. Macy.

549
00:28:22,702 --> 00:28:24,693
Tell that Santa
I won't forget him, either.

550
00:28:24,737 --> 00:28:26,637
Yes, Mr. Macy.

551
00:28:30,243 --> 00:28:32,939
Imagine, a bonus!

552
00:28:32,979 --> 00:28:36,210
He just assumed it was our idea.
What's the matter?

553
00:28:36,249 --> 00:28:38,240
- I fired him.
- Who?

554
00:28:38,284 --> 00:28:40,514
- Santa Claus.
- What?

555
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:42,714
He's crazy.
He thinks he is Santa Claus.

556
00:28:42,755 --> 00:28:44,985
I don't care if
he thinks he's the Easter Bunny.

557
00:28:45,024 --> 00:28:46,218
Get him back.

558
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:47,749
He's insane, I tell you.

559
00:28:47,794 --> 00:28:50,228
We'll hire somebody else
and have him do the same thing.

560
00:28:50,263 --> 00:28:52,788
You heard Mr. Macy.
We've got to keep him.

561
00:28:52,832 --> 00:28:54,993
What if he should have
a sudden fit?

562
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:57,229
Oh, no.
I've got to tell Mr. Macy.

563
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:59,738
But maybe
he's only a little crazy...

564
00:28:59,772 --> 00:29:01,740
like painters or composers...

565
00:29:01,774 --> 00:29:03,674
or some of those men
in Washington.

566
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,644
We can't be sure
until he's been examined.

567
00:29:05,678 --> 00:29:09,045
If you fire him, and we find out
he wasn't really crazy...

568
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:12,449
Mr. Macy will have us
examined and fired.

569
00:29:12,485 --> 00:29:14,783
I suppose
we ought to be sure.

570
00:29:14,821 --> 00:29:16,686
We could if Mr. Sawyer
talked to him.

571
00:29:16,723 --> 00:29:18,452
Of course.
He's a psychologist.

572
00:29:18,491 --> 00:29:20,925
He's paid to examine employees.

573
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,758
Until we get his report,
we won't say a word.

574
00:29:23,796 --> 00:29:26,196
I'll get in touch
with him right away.

575
00:29:26,232 --> 00:29:28,029
First,
get that Santa Claus back!

576
00:29:28,067 --> 00:29:30,433
The examination is worthless
without the patient.

577
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:34,467
It was just because
I felt we owed it to him...

578
00:29:34,507 --> 00:29:37,067
but Mr. Macy suggested
that we find something else...

579
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:40,238
for the other Santa Claus
and keep you on by all means.

580
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:43,339
Oh, well, thanks.
That's mighty good news.

581
00:29:43,383 --> 00:29:45,783
You'll be here
in the morning then?

582
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:46,944
Certainly I will.

583
00:29:46,986 --> 00:29:49,784
Mrs. Walker, this is
quite an opportunity for me.

584
00:29:49,822 --> 00:29:51,756
For the past 50 years or so...

585
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:53,986
I've been getting more
worried about Christmas.

586
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:57,723
Seems we're all so busy trying
to beat the other fellow...

587
00:29:57,764 --> 00:30:00,756
in making things go faster,
look shinier, and cost less...

588
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,997
that Christmas and I are sort of
getting lost in the shuffle.

589
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:06,834
I don't think so.
Christmas is still Christmas.

590
00:30:06,873 --> 00:30:09,000
Christmas isn't just a day.

591
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:12,067
It's a frame of mind.
That's what's been changing.

592
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:15,274
That's why I'm glad I'm here.
Maybe I can do something.

593
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:17,009
And I'm glad
I met you and your daughter.

594
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:19,074
You two are a test case for me.

595
00:30:19,118 --> 00:30:20,415
We are?

596
00:30:20,453 --> 00:30:23,013
Yes. You're sort of
the whole thing in miniature.

597
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:26,024
If I can win you over,
there's still hope.

598
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:29,824
If not,
then I guess I'm through.

599
00:30:29,862 --> 00:30:33,059
But I'm warning you,
I don't give up easily.

600
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:34,589
Good night.

601
00:30:34,634 --> 00:30:35,760
Good night.

602
00:30:35,802 --> 00:30:38,134
Oh, Mr. Kringle,
first thing in the morning...

603
00:30:38,171 --> 00:30:40,435
would you report
to Mr. Sawyer's office?

604
00:30:40,473 --> 00:30:43,237
He'll give you
a little examination.

605
00:30:43,276 --> 00:30:46,040
Oh, we do it
with all our employees.

606
00:30:46,078 --> 00:30:47,875
A mental examination?

607
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:51,106
Well...

608
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,846
I don't mind.
I've taken dozens of them.

609
00:30:53,886 --> 00:30:56,946
Never failed one yet.
Know them by heart.

610
00:30:56,989 --> 00:31:00,686
- How many days in the week?
- Seven.

611
00:31:00,726 --> 00:31:03,286
- How many fingers do you see?
- Four.

612
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:05,320
Muscular coordination test.

613
00:31:09,735 --> 00:31:11,498
No damage
to the nervous system.

614
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:13,937
Who was the first president
of the United States?

615
00:31:13,973 --> 00:31:15,304
George Washington.

616
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:18,606
Who was vice president
under John Quincy Adams?

617
00:31:19,612 --> 00:31:21,944
Daniel D. Tompkins.

618
00:31:21,981 --> 00:31:24,313
I'll bet your Mr. Sawyer
doesn't know that.

619
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,510
Good night.

620
00:31:38,631 --> 00:31:40,565
Miss Adams, would you get me...

621
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,831
the Brooks' Memorial Home
in Great Neck?

622
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:46,498
It's a home for old people.
That's right.

623
00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:49,030
I want to talk
to the doctor in charge.

624
00:31:57,717 --> 00:32:00,345
- How many days in the week?
- Seven.

625
00:32:00,386 --> 00:32:02,911
The first president
of the United States?

626
00:32:02,955 --> 00:32:04,081
George Washington.

627
00:32:04,123 --> 00:32:05,420
Three times five?

628
00:32:05,458 --> 00:32:08,086
You asked me that before.
The answer's at the bottom...

629
00:32:08,127 --> 00:32:10,288
I'm conducting this examination.

630
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:12,126
How much is three times five?

631
00:32:12,164 --> 00:32:15,031
Same as before... 15.

632
00:32:18,137 --> 00:32:21,265
You're rather nervous,
aren't you, Mr. Sawyer?

633
00:32:21,307 --> 00:32:22,968
Do you get enough sleep?

634
00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:25,000
My personal habits
are of no concern to you.

635
00:32:25,044 --> 00:32:28,172
Oh, I'm sorry.
I hate to see someone tied up...

636
00:32:28,214 --> 00:32:30,842
- How many fingers do you see?
- Three.

637
00:32:30,883 --> 00:32:33,374
You bite your nails, too.
Tsk tsk tsk.

638
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:36,752
I want you to stand
with your feet together...

639
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:38,814
and your arms extended.
Then I want you to...

640
00:32:38,858 --> 00:32:40,325
Muscular coordination test?

641
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:43,726
Surely. Be glad to. Ha ha.

642
00:32:46,032 --> 00:32:49,490
Sometimes the cause
of nervous habits like yours...

643
00:32:49,535 --> 00:32:51,833
is not obvious. No.

644
00:32:51,871 --> 00:32:54,738
Often they're the result
of an insecurity.

645
00:32:54,774 --> 00:32:56,401
Are you happy at home?

646
00:32:56,442 --> 00:32:57,875
That will be all!

647
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:00,105
The examination's over.
You may go.

648
00:33:00,146 --> 00:33:01,272
Thank you.

649
00:33:01,314 --> 00:33:02,645
You may go out that way.

650
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:07,809
And it may
interest you to know...

651
00:33:07,853 --> 00:33:10,185
that I've been happily
married for 26 years.

652
00:33:10,222 --> 00:33:13,282
Really? Delighted to hear it.

653
00:33:13,326 --> 00:33:14,691
Good-bye.

654
00:33:19,332 --> 00:33:20,458
Get me Mrs. Walker.

655
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:23,229
Yes, sir. Your wife's on 672.

656
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:25,066
She says it's very important.

657
00:33:26,906 --> 00:33:30,808
How many times have I told you
not to bother me at the office?

658
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:33,812
No. Not a penny.
I give you a liberal allowance.

659
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:35,507
It's up to you
to run the house on it.

660
00:33:35,548 --> 00:33:37,516
If your stupid brother
would get a job...

661
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,711
you wouldn't have to
pester me all the time.

662
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:45,690
Mrs. Walker, I'd like to talk
to you about this Kringle.

663
00:33:45,725 --> 00:33:48,819
Oh, yes. Dr. Pierce
from the Brooks' home is here.

664
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:50,726
It would be a good time
to settle the matter.

665
00:33:50,763 --> 00:33:52,822
Sorry, Doctor,
but that was Mr. Sawyer...

666
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:54,856
the gentleman
I was telling you about.

667
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,061
He's just down the hall.

668
00:33:57,103 --> 00:34:00,595
I can't tell you how
we appreciate your time.

669
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,837
Matter of fact,
I was going to call you today.

670
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:07,642
I had a feeling about now
you'd be wondering about Kris.

671
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,615
Dr. Pierce, Mr. Sawyer.

672
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:11,947
How do you do?

673
00:34:11,984 --> 00:34:14,782
After giving this man
a comprehensive examination...

674
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,845
it's my opinion he should
be dismissed immediately.

675
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:20,256
Really? He failed
to pass the examination?

676
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:22,783
- Yes.
- He didn't answer correctly?

677
00:34:22,828 --> 00:34:25,797
Yes, he did,
but he lacked concentration.

678
00:34:25,831 --> 00:34:28,299
He kept changing the subject.
Even questioned me.

679
00:34:28,334 --> 00:34:30,302
I don't think
there's any doubt about it.

680
00:34:30,336 --> 00:34:32,304
He should be placed
in a mental institution.

681
00:34:32,338 --> 00:34:35,330
I don't agree.
People are institutionalized...

682
00:34:35,374 --> 00:34:37,573
to prevent them from
harming themselves or others.

683
00:34:37,706 --> 00:34:39,571
Mr. Kringle
is incapable of either.

684
00:34:39,608 --> 00:34:41,075
His is a delusion for good.

685
00:34:41,109 --> 00:34:43,043
He only wants
to be friendly and helpful.

686
00:34:43,078 --> 00:34:44,943
That's what I feel, too.

687
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:47,073
Thousands of people
have similar delusions...

688
00:34:47,115 --> 00:34:49,049
living perfectly normal lives
in every other respect.

689
00:34:49,084 --> 00:34:51,951
A famous example
is that fellow...

690
00:34:51,987 --> 00:34:54,455
I can't think of his name.

691
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:56,889
For years, he's insisted
he's a Russian prince.

692
00:34:56,925 --> 00:34:58,950
There's been much evidence
to prove him wrong...

693
00:34:58,994 --> 00:35:00,894
but nothing
has shaken his story.

694
00:35:00,929 --> 00:35:02,396
Is he in an institution?

695
00:35:02,431 --> 00:35:04,729
No. He owns a famous restaurant
in Hollywood...

696
00:35:04,766 --> 00:35:06,028
and is a highly
respected citizen.

697
00:35:06,068 --> 00:35:09,333
I've made a great study
of abnormal psychology...

698
00:35:09,371 --> 00:35:12,704
and I've found from experience
when a delusion is challenged...

699
00:35:12,741 --> 00:35:14,333
the deluded
is apt to become violent.

700
00:35:14,376 --> 00:35:16,344
I'll have to disagree
with you again.

701
00:35:16,378 --> 00:35:19,176
If you tell Kris
there is no Santa Claus...

702
00:35:19,214 --> 00:35:21,648
I grant he'll argue the point,
but he'll not become violent.

703
00:35:21,683 --> 00:35:23,878
His whole manner
suggests aggressiveness!

704
00:35:23,919 --> 00:35:26,786
Look how he carries that cane!
He's never without it.

705
00:35:26,822 --> 00:35:29,222
I know Kris
always carries a cane...

706
00:35:29,258 --> 00:35:31,726
but surely you're not implying
he'd use the cane as a weapon?

707
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,856
Mrs. Walker, naturally
I can't discharge this man.

708
00:35:35,898 --> 00:35:39,425
That's up to you.
But you asked my opinion.

709
00:35:39,468 --> 00:35:41,368
So when he exhibits his latent
maniacal tendencies...

710
00:35:41,403 --> 00:35:43,337
which I assure you he will...

711
00:35:43,372 --> 00:35:46,000
please realize
the responsibility is yours.

712
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,710
Speaking of delusions...

713
00:35:53,749 --> 00:35:56,081
Now we're right back
where we started.

714
00:35:56,118 --> 00:35:57,585
No, we're not.

715
00:35:57,619 --> 00:36:00,053
After listening to Dr. Pierce,
I feel perfectly confident.

716
00:36:00,088 --> 00:36:03,114
But if anything happens,
you won't get blamed. I will.

717
00:36:03,158 --> 00:36:05,752
Nothing's going to happen.

718
00:36:05,794 --> 00:36:08,388
Please don't feel what I've said
was prompted by affection.

719
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:10,398
My specialty is geriatrics.

720
00:36:10,432 --> 00:36:11,729
Huh?

721
00:36:11,767 --> 00:36:13,325
Treatment
of the diseases of old age.

722
00:36:13,368 --> 00:36:15,393
I've had quite a bit
of experience...

723
00:36:15,437 --> 00:36:19,601
and I assure you Kris has
no latent maniacal tendencies.

724
00:36:19,641 --> 00:36:21,336
You'll want to discuss this
with Mr. Shellhammer...

725
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:23,936
so I'll be on my way.
May I see Kris?

726
00:36:23,979 --> 00:36:25,446
Why, certainly, Doctor.

727
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,345
Use the employees' elevator.
It's much quicker.

728
00:36:27,382 --> 00:36:28,849
The same one you came up on.

729
00:36:28,884 --> 00:36:31,250
- Where is that?
- I'll show you.

730
00:36:31,286 --> 00:36:33,083
That isn't necessary.
I'll find my way.

731
00:36:33,121 --> 00:36:35,612
You understand
my position, Doctor.

732
00:36:35,657 --> 00:36:37,181
If there's the slightest
possibility...

733
00:36:37,225 --> 00:36:39,750
of him becoming violent
or getting into trouble...

734
00:36:39,795 --> 00:36:41,729
What trouble could he get into?

735
00:36:41,763 --> 00:36:44,493
All that's got to happen
is a policeman to ask his name.

736
00:36:44,533 --> 00:36:47,366
A big argument.
Clang, clang! Bellevue!

737
00:36:47,402 --> 00:36:49,370
You can prevent that
very simply.

738
00:36:49,404 --> 00:36:51,463
If he could
stay with an employee...

739
00:36:51,506 --> 00:36:53,701
they could ride
to and from work together.

740
00:36:53,742 --> 00:36:56,870
I'd prefer he didn't take the
train to Great Neck twice a day.

741
00:36:56,912 --> 00:36:58,379
That would solve everything.

742
00:36:58,413 --> 00:37:00,472
They could steer him away
from trouble.

743
00:37:00,515 --> 00:37:01,982
Sort of take custody of him.

744
00:37:02,017 --> 00:37:03,644
Do you think
he'd agree to that?

745
00:37:03,685 --> 00:37:05,312
I'll talk to him.
I'm sure he will.

746
00:37:05,354 --> 00:37:06,821
In that case, he can stay.

747
00:37:06,855 --> 00:37:08,447
Good. Thank you.

748
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:11,323
It's the seventh floor,
and thank you very much.

749
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,554
- Bye, Doctor.
- Bye.

750
00:37:14,096 --> 00:37:16,656
I'm sure
you made a wise decision.

751
00:37:16,698 --> 00:37:19,496
Now, let's see...
who could rent him a room?

752
00:37:19,534 --> 00:37:20,660
You.

753
00:37:20,702 --> 00:37:23,330
Your son's away at school.
What about his room?

754
00:37:23,372 --> 00:37:26,364
Well, I don't mind.
I'd be glad to.

755
00:37:26,408 --> 00:37:28,842
I'm positive Mrs. Shellhammer
wouldn't like it.

756
00:37:28,877 --> 00:37:30,469
She's a little...

757
00:37:30,512 --> 00:37:32,480
Say, I have an idea.

758
00:37:32,514 --> 00:37:34,448
We always have martinis
before dinner.

759
00:37:34,483 --> 00:37:37,111
I'll make them
double-strength tonight.

760
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:40,121
I'll bet after a couple of them,
she'll be more receptive.

761
00:37:40,155 --> 00:37:41,850
But Kris is through work
at 6:00.

762
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:43,619
What about
the in-between time?

763
00:37:43,658 --> 00:37:45,353
Take him home to dinner.

764
00:37:45,394 --> 00:37:48,454
I'll call soon as my wife's
plastered... feeling gay.

765
00:37:48,497 --> 00:37:49,862
Oh, no.

766
00:37:49,898 --> 00:37:51,456
If I'm willing
to let my wife...

767
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,400
have a big headache
in the morning...

768
00:37:53,435 --> 00:37:55,300
you can have
a little headache tonight.

769
00:37:55,337 --> 00:37:57,032
All right.

770
00:37:57,072 --> 00:37:59,404
Won't take an hour.
Everything will be OK.

771
00:38:00,409 --> 00:38:02,969
Good. Very good.

772
00:38:03,011 --> 00:38:06,606
What sort of games do you play
with the other children?

773
00:38:06,648 --> 00:38:10,345
I don't play much with them.
They play silly games.

774
00:38:10,385 --> 00:38:11,613
They do?

775
00:38:11,653 --> 00:38:14,315
Like today. They were
in the basement playing zoo...

776
00:38:14,356 --> 00:38:16,483
and all of them were animals.

777
00:38:16,525 --> 00:38:19,824
When I came down, Homer...
he was the zookeeper...

778
00:38:19,861 --> 00:38:22,989
he said, "What animal are you?"

779
00:38:23,031 --> 00:38:26,228
I said,
"I'm not an animal, I'm a girl."

780
00:38:26,268 --> 00:38:28,327
And he said,
"Only animals allowed."

781
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:30,235
So I came upstairs.

782
00:38:30,272 --> 00:38:32,536
Why didn't you tell him
you were a lion or a bear?

783
00:38:32,574 --> 00:38:34,474
Because
I'm not a bear or a lion.

784
00:38:34,509 --> 00:38:37,478
But the other children
were only children...

785
00:38:37,512 --> 00:38:39,480
and they were pretending
to be animals.

786
00:38:39,514 --> 00:38:41,846
That's what makes
the game so silly.

787
00:38:41,883 --> 00:38:43,043
I don't think so.

788
00:38:43,085 --> 00:38:45,519
Sounds like
a wonderful game to me.

789
00:38:45,554 --> 00:38:51,049
Of course, in order to play it,
you need an imagination.

790
00:38:51,093 --> 00:38:53,584
Do you know
what the imagination is?

791
00:38:53,628 --> 00:38:54,890
Oh, sure.

792
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:57,592
That's when you see things,
but they're not really there.

793
00:38:57,632 --> 00:39:01,227
That can be caused
by other things, too.

794
00:39:01,269 --> 00:39:04,830
No, to me the imagination
is a place all by itself...

795
00:39:04,873 --> 00:39:06,841
a separate country.

796
00:39:06,875 --> 00:39:10,003
You've heard of the French
or the British nation.

797
00:39:10,045 --> 00:39:12,013
Well, this is
the Imagine nation.

798
00:39:12,047 --> 00:39:14,106
It's a wonderful place.

799
00:39:14,149 --> 00:39:20,452
How would you like to make
snowballs in the summertime?

800
00:39:20,489 --> 00:39:24,619
Or drive a big bus
right down 5th Avenue?

801
00:39:24,659 --> 00:39:27,219
How would you like to have
a ship all to yourself...

802
00:39:27,262 --> 00:39:31,221
that makes daily trips
to China and Australia?

803
00:39:31,266 --> 00:39:33,826
How would you like to be
the Statue of Liberty...

804
00:39:33,869 --> 00:39:36,201
in the morning,
and in the afternoon...

805
00:39:36,238 --> 00:39:38,069
fly south with a flock of geese?

806
00:39:40,442 --> 00:39:43,843
It's very simple.
Of course, it takes practice.

807
00:39:43,879 --> 00:39:48,339
The first thing you've got
to learn is how to pretend.

808
00:39:48,383 --> 00:39:52,342
And the next time Homer says,
"What kind of animal are you?"

809
00:39:52,387 --> 00:39:54,355
Tell him you're a monkey.

810
00:39:54,389 --> 00:39:56,357
I don't know how to be a monkey.

811
00:39:56,391 --> 00:39:58,859
Sure you do.
Here, I'll show you.

812
00:39:58,894 --> 00:40:00,862
Now just bend
your body over a little.

813
00:40:00,896 --> 00:40:02,864
Let your arms hang loose, see?

814
00:40:02,898 --> 00:40:05,458
Now put your right hand
up here... under here.

815
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,958
Now scratch yourself, see?
That's right.

816
00:40:09,004 --> 00:40:11,973
Put your tongue under your lips,
over your teeth.

817
00:40:12,007 --> 00:40:14,976
- Like this?
- That's right.

818
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:16,875
Now scratch yourself
and chatter, see?

819
00:40:16,912 --> 00:40:20,109
- Bla bla bla!
- Eeek!

820
00:40:20,148 --> 00:40:21,513
Eeek erp!

821
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:24,883
Haislip, Haislip, Sherman,
Mackenzie, and Haislip...

822
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,387
have been very kind to me.

823
00:40:26,421 --> 00:40:29,982
But being an exceptional lawyer,
I want to open my own office.

824
00:40:30,025 --> 00:40:32,516
Put this in
Susan's place for me, please.

825
00:40:32,561 --> 00:40:34,825
Take the meat out.
It should be done.

826
00:40:37,065 --> 00:40:38,896
Don't forget to scratch.

827
00:40:38,934 --> 00:40:41,402
Put your tongue up
in front of your teeth.

828
00:40:41,436 --> 00:40:43,870
Talk to the other monkeys.

829
00:40:43,905 --> 00:40:46,203
What's going on here?

830
00:40:46,241 --> 00:40:48,368
We're having
our first lesson in pretending.

831
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:50,401
Doing quite well at it, too.

832
00:40:50,445 --> 00:40:53,414
That's right.
Call the other monkeys.

833
00:40:53,448 --> 00:40:57,908
No. You mustn't be a goose.
Be a monkey.

834
00:40:57,953 --> 00:41:00,717
- Mr. Kringle...
- Yes?

835
00:41:00,755 --> 00:41:02,780
Mrs. Walker
just happened to mention...

836
00:41:02,824 --> 00:41:05,019
that they're looking
for a room for you.

837
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,357
That's right.

838
00:41:06,394 --> 00:41:08,988
Dr. Pierce doesn't want me
making the long trip daily.

839
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:10,861
I was just thinking.

840
00:41:10,899 --> 00:41:13,891
I'm all alone in my apartment.

841
00:41:13,935 --> 00:41:16,369
Twin beds, plenty of room.

842
00:41:16,404 --> 00:41:19,373
If you'd like
to move in with me...

843
00:41:19,407 --> 00:41:21,375
I'd be only too happy
to have you.

844
00:41:21,409 --> 00:41:23,036
That's awfully nice of you.

845
00:41:23,078 --> 00:41:25,979
You could ride to and from
work with Mrs. Walker.

846
00:41:26,014 --> 00:41:29,211
Yes. That would
give me a chance...

847
00:41:29,251 --> 00:41:31,846
to really talk things
over with her.

848
00:41:34,315 --> 00:41:38,342
Don't forget to scratch.
You're not scratching.

849
00:41:38,386 --> 00:41:41,116
Besides, I could see
Suzie now and then.

850
00:41:41,155 --> 00:41:42,952
Mr. Gailey, it's a deal.

851
00:41:42,991 --> 00:41:44,424
Good!

852
00:41:44,459 --> 00:41:47,758
We'll get your things
after dinner.

853
00:41:47,795 --> 00:41:50,025
Hello.
Oh, yes, just a moment.

854
00:41:50,064 --> 00:41:51,554
It's a Mr. Shellhammer.

855
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:52,759
Thanks.

856
00:41:53,835 --> 00:41:55,598
Hello, Mr. Shellhammer.

857
00:41:55,637 --> 00:41:57,764
Yes. Just a moment.

858
00:41:57,805 --> 00:42:00,000
Mrs. Shellhammer
wants to talk to you.

859
00:42:01,309 --> 00:42:03,903
I made the martinis
triple-strength...

860
00:42:03,945 --> 00:42:05,936
and she feels wonderful.

861
00:42:07,248 --> 00:42:08,909
Here, my pet.

862
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:10,713
Ha ha.

863
00:42:10,752 --> 00:42:12,242
Hello?

864
00:42:13,755 --> 00:42:15,222
Hello?

865
00:42:15,256 --> 00:42:17,224
No, no. No, dear.

866
00:42:17,258 --> 00:42:19,556
Thank you, darling.

867
00:42:21,396 --> 00:42:23,261
Hello?

868
00:42:23,297 --> 00:42:26,095
No, no, dear. There.

869
00:42:26,134 --> 00:42:29,297
Oh, darling, how silly of me!

870
00:42:30,972 --> 00:42:32,599
Hello!

871
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:38,903
We'd love to have Santa Claus
come and stay with us.

872
00:42:40,815 --> 00:42:44,012
I think it would be
simply charming.

873
00:42:44,052 --> 00:42:46,452
Oh, and so do I,
Mrs. Shellhammer.

874
00:42:46,487 --> 00:42:48,455
Just a moment.

875
00:42:48,489 --> 00:42:51,458
It's Mrs. Shellhammer.
They have the loveliest room.

876
00:42:51,492 --> 00:42:53,551
They'd be so happy
if you'd stay with them.

877
00:42:53,594 --> 00:42:55,562
That's very sweet of them.

878
00:42:55,596 --> 00:42:56,927
Please thank them very much...

879
00:42:56,964 --> 00:43:00,422
but I'm going to stay
with Mr. Gailey.

880
00:43:00,468 --> 00:43:01,594
Mr. Gailey.

881
00:43:01,636 --> 00:43:04,332
I think
I'd better get the meat.

882
00:43:07,108 --> 00:43:08,735
Yes, I understand that...

883
00:43:08,776 --> 00:43:10,903
but there must be something
you want for Christmas...

884
00:43:10,945 --> 00:43:13,413
something you haven't
even told your mother.

885
00:43:13,448 --> 00:43:15,712
Oh, come on, now.

886
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:17,775
Why don't you give me a chance?

887
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,311
Well...

888
00:43:38,072 --> 00:43:40,302
That's what
I want for Christmas.

889
00:43:40,341 --> 00:43:41,968
A doll's house like this?

890
00:43:42,009 --> 00:43:44,603
No, a real house.

891
00:43:44,645 --> 00:43:46,806
If you're really Santa Claus,
you can get it for me.

892
00:43:46,848 --> 00:43:48,076
And if you can't...

893
00:43:48,116 --> 00:43:50,812
you're only a nice man with
a white beard, like mother said.

894
00:43:50,852 --> 00:43:52,444
Now wait a minute, Suzie.

895
00:43:52,487 --> 00:43:54,785
Just because every child
can't get his wish...

896
00:43:54,822 --> 00:43:56,289
doesn't mean
there isn't a Santa Claus.

897
00:43:56,324 --> 00:43:58,656
That's what I thought you'd say.

898
00:43:58,693 --> 00:44:00,456
But don't you see, dear?

899
00:44:00,495 --> 00:44:03,396
Some children wish for things
they couldn't possibly use...

900
00:44:03,431 --> 00:44:06,127
like real locomotives
or B-29s.

901
00:44:06,167 --> 00:44:09,728
But this isn't like
a locomotive or a B-29.

902
00:44:09,771 --> 00:44:12,331
It's awful big
for a little girl like you.

903
00:44:12,373 --> 00:44:15,069
What could you do
with a house like this?

904
00:44:15,109 --> 00:44:16,940
Live in it with my mother.

905
00:44:16,978 --> 00:44:19,242
But you've got
this lovely apartment.

906
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,907
I don't think it's lovely.

907
00:44:20,948 --> 00:44:25,351
I want a backyard with a great
big tree to put a swing on...

908
00:44:28,956 --> 00:44:30,821
I guess you can't get it, huh?

909
00:44:30,858 --> 00:44:33,292
I didn't say that.

910
00:44:33,327 --> 00:44:34,817
Well...

911
00:44:39,467 --> 00:44:42,436
Well, it's a tall order...

912
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:44,438
but I'll do my best.

913
00:44:44,472 --> 00:44:46,099
May I keep this picture?

914
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:47,835
Mm-hmm.

915
00:44:47,875 --> 00:44:51,333
Thank you. Good night, Susan.

916
00:44:51,379 --> 00:44:53,370
Good night, Mr. Kringle.

917
00:45:40,962 --> 00:45:42,930
Nice place you've got here.

918
00:45:42,964 --> 00:45:44,932
Was I lucky to get it!

919
00:45:44,966 --> 00:45:48,367
You like living
in Manhattan?

920
00:45:48,402 --> 00:45:50,370
It's all right.

921
00:45:50,404 --> 00:45:52,736
Someday I'd like to get
a place on Long Island.

922
00:45:52,773 --> 00:45:54,104
Not a big house.

923
00:45:54,141 --> 00:45:57,372
One of those junior-partner
deals around Manhasset.

924
00:45:57,411 --> 00:46:00,938
I know just
the kind of place you mean.

925
00:46:00,982 --> 00:46:04,315
One of those
little Colonial houses.

926
00:46:04,352 --> 00:46:06,820
Either that or Cape Cod.

927
00:46:06,854 --> 00:46:09,322
You're right about Mrs. Walker.

928
00:46:09,357 --> 00:46:11,348
A little more effort
on your part...

929
00:46:11,392 --> 00:46:14,361
and she might crawl out
of that shell.

930
00:46:14,395 --> 00:46:16,386
Take her to dinner, the theater.

931
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:18,057
I've tried that.

932
00:46:18,099 --> 00:46:20,363
She's always too busy
with her job.

933
00:46:20,401 --> 00:46:23,029
Try a little harder.
Those two are lost souls.

934
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:24,901
It's up to us to help them.

935
00:46:24,939 --> 00:46:27,908
I'll take care of Suzie
if you take care of her mother.

936
00:46:27,942 --> 00:46:29,910
- It's a deal.
- Ready?

937
00:46:29,944 --> 00:46:32,412
Oh, no, you don't.
I'm not gonna be cheated.

938
00:46:32,446 --> 00:46:34,539
All my life
I've wondered something.

939
00:46:34,582 --> 00:46:36,550
Now's my chance to find out.

940
00:46:36,584 --> 00:46:39,052
It's a question that's puzzled
the world for centuries.

941
00:46:39,086 --> 00:46:43,887
Does Santa Claus sleep
with his whiskers outside or in?

942
00:46:43,925 --> 00:46:45,893
Always sleep with them out.

943
00:46:45,927 --> 00:46:47,918
Cold air makes them grow.

944
00:46:54,302 --> 00:46:55,929
Joe, we're running
out of books.

945
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:57,562
I'll get some right away.

946
00:46:57,605 --> 00:46:59,436
I need some more Wanamakers.

947
00:47:23,431 --> 00:47:25,899
Yes, I know just what you want.

948
00:47:25,933 --> 00:47:28,902
We don't carry that brand,
but I think Gimbels does.

949
00:47:28,936 --> 00:47:32,394
Let me see. Yes, here it is.

950
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:35,034
I thought I noticed it before.
2.98.

951
00:47:35,076 --> 00:47:36,907
Looks like
an exceptional bargain.

952
00:47:36,944 --> 00:47:38,912
Yes, it does. Thank you.

953
00:47:38,946 --> 00:47:40,777
Not at all.

954
00:47:49,323 --> 00:47:51,416
Why didn't one of you
think of this idea?

955
00:47:51,459 --> 00:47:54,860
It's the greatest
goodwill policy I ever heard of.

956
00:47:54,895 --> 00:47:56,829
Every shopper
in New York City...

957
00:47:56,864 --> 00:47:59,958
suddenly thinks of Macy
as a benevolent soul...

958
00:48:00,001 --> 00:48:02,993
thinking only of the welfare
of the public.

959
00:48:03,037 --> 00:48:04,868
And what does that make Gimbel?

960
00:48:04,905 --> 00:48:06,873
Nothing but a profiteering
moneygrubber.

961
00:48:06,907 --> 00:48:08,875
Two can play at this game.

962
00:48:08,909 --> 00:48:11,878
From now on, if we haven't got
what the customer wants...

963
00:48:11,912 --> 00:48:13,379
send him back to Macy's.

964
00:48:13,414 --> 00:48:15,848
And what's more, we'll do
the same thing in our stores...

965
00:48:15,883 --> 00:48:18,511
in Philadelphia,
Milwaukee, and Pittsburgh.

966
00:48:18,552 --> 00:48:20,520
Get to work on it right away.

967
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:25,152
So, Gimbel's doing it
in Philadelphia...

968
00:48:25,192 --> 00:48:26,887
Pittsburgh, and Milwaukee, eh?

969
00:48:26,927 --> 00:48:28,394
And very successfully.

970
00:48:28,429 --> 00:48:30,488
Well, we can cover
the country, too.

971
00:48:30,531 --> 00:48:32,522
Notify our stores
in San Francisco...

972
00:48:32,566 --> 00:48:36,024
Atlanta, Toledo, and Newark
to get going right away.

973
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:37,537
All right, Mr. Macy.

974
00:48:38,706 --> 00:48:41,834
- Look this way, Mr. Gimbel.
- Hold it, Mr. Gimbel.

975
00:48:41,876 --> 00:48:43,605
One more.

976
00:48:43,644 --> 00:48:45,441
That's fine.

977
00:48:45,479 --> 00:48:47,879
Now we'll take some
at my store.

978
00:48:47,915 --> 00:48:49,348
Just a minute.

979
00:48:49,383 --> 00:48:52,841
I have something I'd like
to give our friend here.

980
00:48:52,887 --> 00:48:56,823
This is a little something
to show my appreciation...

981
00:48:56,857 --> 00:48:57,983
for all you've done.

982
00:48:58,025 --> 00:49:00,255
Thank you, Mr. Macy.

983
00:49:00,294 --> 00:49:03,195
Ooh! That's very kind of you.

984
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:06,358
I didn't think
you were that generous.

985
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,368
That's a bit of money.

986
00:49:08,402 --> 00:49:10,370
What are you going
to do with it?

987
00:49:10,404 --> 00:49:14,033
Well, I have a friend.

988
00:49:14,075 --> 00:49:16,873
A doctor.
He's been very kind to me.

989
00:49:16,911 --> 00:49:18,879
He needs an x-ray machine.

990
00:49:18,913 --> 00:49:21,335
I don't think
that's going to be enough.

991
00:49:21,468 --> 00:49:24,096
I'll make up the difference.

992
00:49:24,137 --> 00:49:26,105
Buy it through the store.
Get 10% discount.

993
00:49:26,139 --> 00:49:28,539
I can get it for cost.

994
00:49:34,815 --> 00:49:36,510
Good night, Susan.

995
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:38,279
Good night, Cleo.

996
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:41,776
Like me to sing you
a good night song?

997
00:49:41,822 --> 00:49:43,790
If you want to.

998
00:49:43,824 --> 00:49:46,793
Doesn't your mother
ever sing to you at night?

999
00:49:46,827 --> 00:49:49,557
Uh-uh. Why should she?

1000
00:49:49,596 --> 00:49:54,431
Oh, no reason.
I just think it's kind of nice.

1001
00:49:54,468 --> 00:49:57,767
- Do you like "Market"?
- All right.

1002
00:49:57,804 --> 00:50:01,831
To market, to market
to buy a fat pig

1003
00:50:01,875 --> 00:50:05,106
Home again, home again,
jiggidy jig

1004
00:50:05,145 --> 00:50:08,546
To market, to market
to buy a fat hog

1005
00:50:08,582 --> 00:50:12,450
Home again, home again,
jiggidy...

1006
00:50:17,124 --> 00:50:19,524
Amazing.

1007
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:21,720
Do you happen
to have a spare piece?

1008
00:50:21,762 --> 00:50:23,059
Mm-hmm.

1009
00:50:33,073 --> 00:50:34,904
Well, here goes.

1010
00:50:46,153 --> 00:50:48,781
Oh!

1011
00:51:04,471 --> 00:51:06,302
- Hello, Alfred.
- Hello, Kris.

1012
00:51:06,339 --> 00:51:09,137
How about a game
of checkers after lunch?

1013
00:51:09,175 --> 00:51:12,303
Leave us not today.
I don't feel like it.

1014
00:51:12,345 --> 00:51:14,142
Oh? What's the matter?

1015
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:15,909
Nothing. Nothing.

1016
00:51:15,949 --> 00:51:18,611
Something is wrong.
What is it?

1017
00:51:20,186 --> 00:51:23,019
Well,
remember I was telling you...

1018
00:51:23,056 --> 00:51:26,355
how I like to play Santa
at the "Y" on Christmas...

1019
00:51:26,392 --> 00:51:28,690
and give out packages
to the young kids?

1020
00:51:28,728 --> 00:51:31,196
I was telling that
to Mr. Sawyer, see...

1021
00:51:31,231 --> 00:51:34,098
and he says that's very bad.

1022
00:51:34,134 --> 00:51:35,829
Sawyer. You mean, uh...

1023
00:51:35,869 --> 00:51:38,838
That's the one.
He's a psychologist.

1024
00:51:38,872 --> 00:51:41,841
Ohh,
that's a debatable poin...

1025
00:51:41,875 --> 00:51:43,740
Why is it bad, does he say?

1026
00:51:43,776 --> 00:51:48,338
He says guys who dress
like Santa Claus, see...

1027
00:51:48,381 --> 00:51:49,848
and give presents away...

1028
00:51:49,883 --> 00:51:51,851
do it because
when they was young...

1029
00:51:51,885 --> 00:51:53,352
they must have
did something bad...

1030
00:51:53,386 --> 00:51:54,785
and they feel guilty about it.

1031
00:51:54,821 --> 00:51:56,948
So now they do something
they think is good...

1032
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:58,287
to make up for it.

1033
00:51:58,324 --> 00:52:01,088
It's what he calls
a guilt complex.

1034
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:05,092
How old are you, Alfred?

1035
00:52:05,131 --> 00:52:06,598
Seventeen.

1036
00:52:06,633 --> 00:52:08,794
Seventeen.

1037
00:52:08,835 --> 00:52:11,463
Doesn't seem you've had time
to be guilty of anything...

1038
00:52:11,504 --> 00:52:13,028
except overeating.

1039
00:52:13,072 --> 00:52:15,302
It's nothing to laugh about.

1040
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:17,434
It's pretty serious, he says.

1041
00:52:17,477 --> 00:52:19,775
It's a lot of rubbish, Alfred.
Don't listen.

1042
00:52:19,812 --> 00:52:21,803
Oh, he knows
what he's talking about.

1043
00:52:21,848 --> 00:52:24,646
He's been studying that stuff
for a long time.

1044
00:52:24,684 --> 00:52:28,313
Well, what's the basis
of this guilt complex...

1045
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:29,981
you're supposed to have?

1046
00:52:30,023 --> 00:52:31,547
Does he say that?

1047
00:52:31,591 --> 00:52:34,822
Well, he ain't found out yet.

1048
00:52:34,861 --> 00:52:38,319
It's probably way down
inside of me someplace, see?

1049
00:52:38,364 --> 00:52:41,561
Maybe something that happened
when I was a baby, he says.

1050
00:52:41,601 --> 00:52:44,695
It takes time,
but he'll do it, he says.

1051
00:52:44,737 --> 00:52:47,570
You mean
you're going to him again?

1052
00:52:47,607 --> 00:52:50,667
Sure.
I go every day after lunch.

1053
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:53,076
Oh, he don't soak me nothin'.

1054
00:52:53,112 --> 00:52:56,775
He's doing it for free
'cause I'm an interesting case.

1055
00:52:56,816 --> 00:52:58,010
Yes.

1056
00:52:58,051 --> 00:53:00,918
What else has he found
wrong with you, Alfred?

1057
00:53:01,988 --> 00:53:03,888
Anything else?

1058
00:53:03,923 --> 00:53:06,983
No. Oh, just
that I hate my father.

1059
00:53:07,026 --> 00:53:09,995
I didn't know it,
but he says I do.

1060
00:53:10,029 --> 00:53:12,395
And he sees you every day?

1061
00:53:12,432 --> 00:53:15,890
Yeah. I say anything
that comes into my head.

1062
00:53:15,935 --> 00:53:17,800
Excuse me, Alfred.

1063
00:53:17,837 --> 00:53:19,498
A few things
have just come into my head...

1064
00:53:19,539 --> 00:53:21,063
and I'm going to say them.

1065
00:53:32,619 --> 00:53:34,416
Why are you busting in here?

1066
00:53:34,454 --> 00:53:36,513
Are you a licensed psychiatrist?

1067
00:53:36,556 --> 00:53:38,751
What business is it of yours?

1068
00:53:38,791 --> 00:53:40,816
I have great respect
for psychiatry...

1069
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:43,852
and great contempt for amateurs
who go around practicing it.

1070
00:53:43,896 --> 00:53:45,830
You have no more right
to analyze Alfred...

1071
00:53:45,865 --> 00:53:48,163
than a dentist has
to remove a gallbladder!

1072
00:53:48,201 --> 00:53:49,498
I beg your pardon.

1073
00:53:49,535 --> 00:53:52,800
Your job here, I gather,
is to give intelligence tests.

1074
00:53:52,839 --> 00:53:54,704
Passing yourself off
as a psychologist.

1075
00:53:54,741 --> 00:53:56,971
You ought to be horsewhipped...

1076
00:53:57,010 --> 00:53:59,274
taking a normal, impressionable
boy like Alfred...

1077
00:53:59,312 --> 00:54:01,075
and filling him with complexes.

1078
00:54:01,114 --> 00:54:03,446
I'm better equipped
to judge that than you are.

1079
00:54:03,483 --> 00:54:05,781
Just because the boy
wants to be kind to children...

1080
00:54:05,818 --> 00:54:07,786
you tell him
he has a guilt complex.

1081
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:09,549
Sharing his delusion,
you couldn't understand.

1082
00:54:09,589 --> 00:54:11,955
Alfred's definitely maladjusted,
and I'm helping.

1083
00:54:11,991 --> 00:54:13,458
Maladjusted?!
You talk about maladjusted.

1084
00:54:13,493 --> 00:54:15,791
It seems to me the patient
is running the clinic here.

1085
00:54:15,828 --> 00:54:18,296
I won't stand...
Leave this office immediately.

1086
00:54:18,331 --> 00:54:20,492
Now either
you stop analyzing Alfred...

1087
00:54:20,533 --> 00:54:22,000
or I go straight to Mr. Macy...

1088
00:54:22,035 --> 00:54:24,299
and tell him what a contemptible
fraud you are.

1089
00:54:24,337 --> 00:54:25,998
Leave or I'll call security.

1090
00:54:26,039 --> 00:54:29,941
There's only one way
to handle a man like you.

1091
00:54:29,976 --> 00:54:32,376
You won't listen to reason.
You're heartless.

1092
00:54:32,412 --> 00:54:33,538
You have no humanity.

1093
00:54:33,579 --> 00:54:35,774
Are you going to leave?

1094
00:54:35,815 --> 00:54:37,009
Yes.

1095
00:54:46,192 --> 00:54:47,489
- Kris.
- Mr. Sawyer!

1096
00:54:47,527 --> 00:54:49,995
Mr. Sawyer,
are you all right?

1097
00:54:50,029 --> 00:54:51,223
Look at that bump!

1098
00:54:51,264 --> 00:54:52,492
Mr. Sawyer...
He's unconscious!

1099
00:54:52,532 --> 00:54:54,432
Better get a wet towel.

1100
00:54:54,467 --> 00:54:55,934
No, better get a doctor.

1101
00:54:55,968 --> 00:54:58,436
You must have done
something to him.

1102
00:54:58,471 --> 00:55:00,439
I tell you
we were merely talking...

1103
00:55:00,473 --> 00:55:03,670
but when I mentioned Santa Claus
and attacked his delusion...

1104
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:04,938
he became violent.

1105
00:55:04,977 --> 00:55:07,445
I told you he had
latent maniacal tendencies.

1106
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,448
Well, I think this proves it.

1107
00:55:09,482 --> 00:55:11,950
Have Dr. Pierce
give him another examination.

1108
00:55:11,984 --> 00:55:13,110
Dr. Pierce...

1109
00:55:13,152 --> 00:55:15,450
He doesn't know anything
about this sort of thing.

1110
00:55:15,488 --> 00:55:16,955
He's a general practitioner.

1111
00:55:16,989 --> 00:55:18,957
You must admit
this is rather serious.

1112
00:55:18,991 --> 00:55:20,458
Perhaps we'd better get
a competent psychiatrist.

1113
00:55:20,493 --> 00:55:22,961
But he's taken dozens
of those examinations...

1114
00:55:22,995 --> 00:55:24,462
and passed them all 100%.

1115
00:55:24,497 --> 00:55:27,193
It's possible
his condition has changed.

1116
00:55:27,233 --> 00:55:29,463
I don't think
we can take any chances.

1117
00:55:29,502 --> 00:55:31,470
I can't see any harm in it.

1118
00:55:31,504 --> 00:55:34,029
If he passes the test,
he can return to work at once...

1119
00:55:34,073 --> 00:55:36,473
and if he doesn't,
it's better if we find out.

1120
00:55:36,509 --> 00:55:38,977
You better have
the examination right away...

1121
00:55:39,011 --> 00:55:41,980
before he tells Mr. Ma...
before Mr. Macy finds out.

1122
00:55:42,014 --> 00:55:43,140
Oh, my, yes.

1123
00:55:43,182 --> 00:55:45,980
You explain to Mr. Kringle.
After all, you're his friend.

1124
00:55:46,018 --> 00:55:48,646
I won't do it.
I've grown very fond of him.

1125
00:55:48,688 --> 00:55:51,987
This would be like telling him
I thought he was insane.

1126
00:55:52,024 --> 00:55:54,424
You don't call this
acting normal, do you?

1127
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:55,984
Of course I don't...

1128
00:55:56,028 --> 00:55:58,428
but there are thousands
of elderly who aren't normal.

1129
00:55:58,464 --> 00:56:01,490
This will hurt Kris deeply,
and I don't want to do it!

1130
00:56:09,308 --> 00:56:11,276
That wouldn't be fair to him.

1131
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:12,777
I'll tell him the truth.

1132
00:56:12,812 --> 00:56:14,939
I believe in being truthful
with people.

1133
00:56:14,981 --> 00:56:17,279
If he sees me
or you mention psychiatrist...

1134
00:56:17,316 --> 00:56:19,944
it's more or less attacking
his delusion again.

1135
00:56:19,986 --> 00:56:21,453
He's apt to become violent.

1136
00:56:21,487 --> 00:56:22,954
But in front of the children?

1137
00:56:22,989 --> 00:56:24,456
Oh, that would be terrible.

1138
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:27,288
Get him out of the store
on some other pretext.

1139
00:56:27,326 --> 00:56:29,453
Then once outside,
I'll explain it to him.

1140
00:56:29,495 --> 00:56:31,486
If you think
it's better that way.

1141
00:56:33,032 --> 00:56:35,933
Keep a straight line.
All day long to see Santa Claus.

1142
00:56:38,504 --> 00:56:39,801
Oh!

1143
00:56:42,508 --> 00:56:43,805
- Mr. Kringle.
- Yes?

1144
00:56:43,843 --> 00:56:45,470
Mrs. Walker
wanted you to know...

1145
00:56:45,511 --> 00:56:47,479
that we're going to take
some publicity pictures...

1146
00:56:47,513 --> 00:56:50,311
this afternoon
down at the city hall...

1147
00:56:50,349 --> 00:56:51,475
you and the mayor.

1148
00:56:51,517 --> 00:56:52,984
Good. Like to meet him.

1149
00:56:53,019 --> 00:56:55,419
A few things
I'd like to discuss with him.

1150
00:56:55,455 --> 00:56:58,913
Oh, but I made an appointment
with Mr. Macy at 4:00.

1151
00:56:58,958 --> 00:57:00,926
I want to tell him
about something.

1152
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,428
You'll be back
in plenty of time.

1153
00:57:03,463 --> 00:57:04,930
There's a car waiting
downstairs.

1154
00:57:04,964 --> 00:57:06,898
It's starting to drizzle.
You'll need a coat.

1155
00:57:06,933 --> 00:57:08,059
I'll get it.

1156
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:09,533
Thanks. Be right with you.

1157
00:57:09,569 --> 00:57:12,436
I just want to take care
of a few kiddies first.

1158
00:57:12,472 --> 00:57:13,962
All right.

1159
00:57:37,263 --> 00:57:38,753
Where to?

1160
00:57:38,798 --> 00:57:40,265
Bellevue.

1161
00:57:40,299 --> 00:57:41,527
Bellevue?!

1162
00:57:50,343 --> 00:57:52,104
Did she know about this?

1163
00:57:52,238 --> 00:57:55,071
Yes.
We all discussed it.

1164
00:58:03,983 --> 00:58:05,450
The second party shall...

1165
00:58:05,484 --> 00:58:07,452
in consideration
of the property...

1166
00:58:07,486 --> 00:58:09,454
agree to be conveyed
by the first party to...

1167
00:58:09,488 --> 00:58:12,048
Excuse me, Gertrude. Telephone.

1168
00:58:14,493 --> 00:58:15,960
Hello.

1169
00:58:15,995 --> 00:58:17,986
Yes. Yes.

1170
00:58:19,031 --> 00:58:21,431
Why, yes,
we share an apartment together.

1171
00:58:23,702 --> 00:58:24,828
Bellevue?

1172
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:27,703
But why, Doctor? What did he...

1173
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:29,674
Oh, he's quite comfortable.

1174
00:58:29,708 --> 00:58:32,677
He's going to be with us
for a few days...

1175
00:58:32,711 --> 00:58:35,680
and wondered if you could bring
his personal things.

1176
00:58:35,714 --> 00:58:39,172
Yes, in view
of his examination...

1177
00:58:39,218 --> 00:58:43,484
I'm afraid I shall have
to recommend commitment.

1178
00:58:43,522 --> 00:58:45,490
Yes, I know, Mr. Gailey...

1179
00:58:45,524 --> 00:58:47,389
but I'd rather speak to you
in person.

1180
00:58:47,426 --> 00:58:48,984
I'll be right over, Doctor.

1181
00:58:55,968 --> 00:58:57,629
To see the new patient.

1182
00:58:57,670 --> 00:58:59,331
- Thanks.
- Not at all.

1183
00:59:08,847 --> 00:59:10,508
Hello, Kris.

1184
00:59:10,549 --> 00:59:12,449
Fred.

1185
00:59:12,484 --> 00:59:15,351
Why'd you do it, Kris?

1186
00:59:15,387 --> 00:59:18,379
You deliberately failed
that examination, didn't you?

1187
00:59:20,359 --> 00:59:21,690
Why?

1188
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:25,720
Because the last few days
I've had great hope.

1189
00:59:25,764 --> 00:59:29,222
I had a feeling Doris was
beginning to believe in me.

1190
00:59:29,268 --> 00:59:32,726
And now I find out she was just
humoring me all the time.

1191
00:59:32,771 --> 00:59:34,238
I just telephoned her.

1192
00:59:34,273 --> 00:59:36,969
She didn't know anything about
taking pictures with the mayor.

1193
00:59:37,009 --> 00:59:38,977
That was Sawyer's idea.

1194
00:59:39,011 --> 00:59:40,672
Well, I'm glad of that.

1195
00:59:40,713 --> 00:59:44,274
But why didn't she come to me
and explain the whole thing?

1196
00:59:44,316 --> 00:59:46,750
She didn't want to hurt you.

1197
00:59:46,785 --> 00:59:49,982
Only because I was a nice,
kind old man she felt sorry for.

1198
00:59:50,022 --> 00:59:51,489
That's not true.

1199
00:59:51,523 --> 00:59:53,388
Yes, it is.
She had doubts.

1200
00:59:53,425 --> 00:59:54,687
That's why she was just sorry.

1201
00:59:54,727 --> 00:59:56,695
If you'd been dragged off here
instead of me...

1202
00:59:56,729 --> 00:59:58,287
she wouldn't have been sorry.

1203
00:59:58,330 --> 00:59:59,729
She'd have been furious.

1204
00:59:59,765 --> 01:00:02,791
All right,
she had doubts. Why not?

1205
01:00:02,835 --> 01:00:05,303
She hasn't really believed
in anything for years.

1206
01:00:05,337 --> 01:00:07,271
You can't expect her
to suddenly...

1207
01:00:07,306 --> 01:00:10,139
Oh, it's not just Doris.
There's Mr. Sawyer.

1208
01:00:10,175 --> 01:00:15,135
He's contemptible, dishonest,
selfish, deceitful, vicious...

1209
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:17,808
Yet he's out there
and I'm in here.

1210
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:20,250
He's called normal and I'm not.

1211
01:00:20,285 --> 01:00:22,310
Well, if that's normal,
I don't want it.

1212
01:00:22,354 --> 01:00:25,323
That's why
I answered incorrectly.

1213
01:00:25,357 --> 01:00:28,292
But, Kris, you can't
just think of yourself.

1214
01:00:28,327 --> 01:00:31,421
What happens to you matters
to a lot of people.

1215
01:00:31,463 --> 01:00:34,990
People like me, who believe
in what you stand for...

1216
01:00:35,034 --> 01:00:38,333
and people like Suzie,
who are just beginning to.

1217
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:41,498
You can't quit.
You can't let them down.

1218
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:43,440
No, I suppose I shouldn't.

1219
01:00:43,475 --> 01:00:46,308
Who knows, maybe someday
the Sawyers will be in here...

1220
01:00:46,345 --> 01:00:47,812
instead of out there.

1221
01:00:47,846 --> 01:00:50,838
You're right.
I ought to be ashamed of myself.

1222
01:00:50,883 --> 01:00:54,410
Even if we can't win,
we can go down swinging.

1223
01:00:54,453 --> 01:00:56,353
Let's get out of here.

1224
01:00:56,388 --> 01:00:57,855
Now, wait a minute.

1225
01:00:57,890 --> 01:01:00,916
You're forgetting you flunked
your examination but good.

1226
01:01:00,959 --> 01:01:02,927
Oh, yes, I forgot.

1227
01:01:02,961 --> 01:01:05,327
I said Calvin Coolidge
was the first president.

1228
01:01:05,364 --> 01:01:08,822
I can imagine what they're
thinking of me for saying that.

1229
01:01:08,867 --> 01:01:10,835
But you'll get me out of this.

1230
01:01:10,869 --> 01:01:12,393
You'll think of something.

1231
01:01:12,438 --> 01:01:13,905
It's not gonna be easy, Kris.

1232
01:01:13,939 --> 01:01:15,406
It will be for you.

1233
01:01:15,441 --> 01:01:17,875
I believe you're the greatest
lawyer since Darrow.

1234
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:20,401
Just a second, Kris.
You're putting me in a bad spot.

1235
01:01:20,446 --> 01:01:23,506
But I believe in you.
You can't let me down.

1236
01:01:23,549 --> 01:01:25,574
But you don't understand. It...

1237
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,514
I'll do everything I can, Kris.

1238
01:01:30,556 --> 01:01:31,682
Thank you.

1239
01:01:31,723 --> 01:01:33,953
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

1240
01:01:38,464 --> 01:01:40,762
That's a lot of nonsense!
Dangerous, my foot!

1241
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:42,926
I don't care
if he failed ten examinations.

1242
01:01:42,968 --> 01:01:44,435
You had no right to do it!

1243
01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:46,938
You get the case
dropped tomorrow...

1244
01:01:46,972 --> 01:01:50,908
or you might have another lump
to match the one Kris gave you!

1245
01:01:50,943 --> 01:01:52,342
Yes, Mr. Macy.

1246
01:02:07,326 --> 01:02:08,850
Age unknown.

1247
01:02:08,894 --> 01:02:10,327
Old man, huh?

1248
01:02:10,362 --> 01:02:12,330
Very old, Your Honor.

1249
01:02:12,364 --> 01:02:15,060
I suppose
I'll have to read all this.

1250
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:17,432
Take my word for it.
Just routine commitment papers.

1251
01:02:17,469 --> 01:02:18,936
Cut and dried.

1252
01:02:18,971 --> 01:02:20,836
The man calls himself
Kris Kringle...

1253
01:02:20,873 --> 01:02:22,602
thinks he's Santa Claus.

1254
01:02:22,641 --> 01:02:23,903
Uh-oh.

1255
01:02:26,578 --> 01:02:27,840
Come in.

1256
01:02:28,947 --> 01:02:31,245
Mr. Gailey to see you,
Your Honor.

1257
01:02:31,283 --> 01:02:32,580
He represents Mr. Kringle.

1258
01:02:34,052 --> 01:02:35,383
Better show him in.

1259
01:02:38,223 --> 01:02:39,554
Good morning.

1260
01:02:39,591 --> 01:02:42,185
Your Honor, there seems to be
undue haste in this case.

1261
01:02:42,227 --> 01:02:44,695
I wish to protect my client's
rights, as I'm sure you do.

1262
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:45,856
Of course.

1263
01:02:45,898 --> 01:02:48,025
I request a formal hearing...

1264
01:02:48,066 --> 01:02:49,727
to which I may bring witnesses.

1265
01:02:49,768 --> 01:02:52,396
- This is cut and dried?
- That's what I was told.

1266
01:02:52,437 --> 01:02:54,337
I didn't know anything
about a protest.

1267
01:02:54,373 --> 01:02:57,240
Of course, you may sign
the commitment papers now...

1268
01:02:57,276 --> 01:02:58,937
but I'll bring
a habeas corpus later.

1269
01:02:58,977 --> 01:03:01,445
There's no point in signing.

1270
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:06,144
We'll have a hearing
on Monday morning at 10:00.

1271
01:03:06,185 --> 01:03:08,210
Thank you. Good day.

1272
01:03:12,891 --> 01:03:14,381
Thank you.

1273
01:03:19,464 --> 01:03:20,761
That man...

1274
01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:23,927
I heard him say something
about Mr. Kringle before.

1275
01:03:23,969 --> 01:03:25,436
Who is he?

1276
01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:26,937
His name is Gailey,
Kringle's lawyer.

1277
01:03:26,972 --> 01:03:29,941
Probably grabbed the case
to get some cheap publicity.

1278
01:03:29,975 --> 01:03:32,944
We can't have that.
Mr. Macy would rather drop this.

1279
01:03:32,978 --> 01:03:34,445
It can't be done.
It's too late now.

1280
01:03:34,479 --> 01:03:36,947
Kringle has been examined by
city hospital psychiatrists.

1281
01:03:36,982 --> 01:03:38,540
It has to follow due process.

1282
01:03:38,583 --> 01:03:40,551
We must avoid publicity.

1283
01:03:40,585 --> 01:03:42,075
I, uh... Oh.

1284
01:03:50,895 --> 01:03:53,557
Mr. Gailey,
I represent Mr. Macy.

1285
01:03:53,598 --> 01:03:54,997
My name's Sawyer.

1286
01:03:55,033 --> 01:03:56,500
Oh, so you're Sawyer.

1287
01:03:56,534 --> 01:03:58,559
Yes.
Regarding this Kringle matter...

1288
01:03:58,603 --> 01:04:00,730
We're very anxious
to avoid any publicity.

1289
01:04:00,772 --> 01:04:02,000
Naturally.

1290
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:05,237
So if you would agree
to put this through quietly...

1291
01:04:05,276 --> 01:04:08,507
we'd surely find a generous way
to express our appreciation.

1292
01:04:08,546 --> 01:04:09,706
Very interesting.

1293
01:04:09,748 --> 01:04:11,511
Then you'll cooperate?

1294
01:04:11,549 --> 01:04:14,416
Very interesting.
Publicity. Hmm.

1295
01:04:14,452 --> 01:04:16,215
That's not a bad idea.

1296
01:04:16,254 --> 01:04:18,085
If I'm going to win this case...

1297
01:04:18,123 --> 01:04:20,421
I'll have to have plenty
of public opinion.

1298
01:04:20,458 --> 01:04:22,756
And publicity's
just the way to do it.

1299
01:04:25,096 --> 01:04:27,564
Thanks, Mr. Sawyer.

1300
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:31,228
Oh, Mr. Gailey, wait a minute.

1301
01:04:31,269 --> 01:04:33,760
Mr. Gailey, one moment, please!

1302
01:04:59,097 --> 01:05:01,895
I don't see what
they're making a fuss about.

1303
01:05:01,933 --> 01:05:03,400
After all, he's an old man.

1304
01:05:03,435 --> 01:05:05,403
How've you been feeling lately?

1305
01:05:05,437 --> 01:05:07,029
You look a little run-down.

1306
01:05:07,072 --> 01:05:10,041
Me? Why, I feel fine.
Never better.

1307
01:05:10,075 --> 01:05:12,543
Why not see the doc?
Take a few weeks off.

1308
01:05:12,577 --> 01:05:15,546
Go fishing, go hunting.
Go anyplace.

1309
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:17,548
Why should I?

1310
01:05:17,582 --> 01:05:19,573
Because
this Kringle case is dynamite.

1311
01:05:19,617 --> 01:05:22,586
Let some judge handle it that
isn't coming up for reelection.

1312
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:24,053
I can't do that.

1313
01:05:24,089 --> 01:05:25,556
I'm no legal brain trust.

1314
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:28,423
I don't know
a habeas from a corpus.

1315
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:30,928
But I do know politics.
That's my racket.

1316
01:05:30,962 --> 01:05:32,589
I got you elected, didn't I?

1317
01:05:32,630 --> 01:05:34,757
And I'm gonna try
to get you reelected.

1318
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:38,599
I appreciate everything
that you've done for me.

1319
01:05:38,636 --> 01:05:40,399
Then get off this case.

1320
01:05:40,438 --> 01:05:41,928
But why?

1321
01:05:41,973 --> 01:05:45,170
You're a Pontius Pilate
the minute you start.

1322
01:05:45,210 --> 01:05:47,804
Oh, I don't believe it.

1323
01:05:47,846 --> 01:05:49,438
I'm an honest man...

1324
01:05:49,481 --> 01:05:51,449
and nobody's going
to hold it against me...

1325
01:05:51,483 --> 01:05:53,417
for doing my duty as I see it.

1326
01:05:54,352 --> 01:05:56,320
Grandma!

1327
01:05:56,354 --> 01:05:57,616
Grandma!

1328
01:05:57,655 --> 01:05:59,145
Grandma!

1329
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:00,680
Good night, Terry.

1330
01:06:00,725 --> 01:06:02,192
Good night, Alice.

1331
01:06:02,227 --> 01:06:03,694
Now, straight to bed.

1332
01:06:03,728 --> 01:06:06,162
I promised your mother
you'd be in bed by 8:00...

1333
01:06:06,197 --> 01:06:07,323
and it's way past.

1334
01:06:07,365 --> 01:06:09,162
Aren't you coming, too?

1335
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,794
I'll be up soon
to tuck you in. Now, scoot!

1336
01:06:11,836 --> 01:06:16,296
How about a great big kiss
for Grandpa, hmm?

1337
01:06:18,443 --> 01:06:19,569
Hmmph!

1338
01:06:19,611 --> 01:06:20,771
Hmmph!

1339
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:24,248
Fine way
to treat their grandfather!

1340
01:06:24,282 --> 01:06:25,909
No hug, no kiss, no anything.

1341
01:06:25,950 --> 01:06:27,417
I don't blame them.

1342
01:06:27,452 --> 01:06:30,012
Any man who'd put Santa Claus
on trial for lunacy.

1343
01:06:31,322 --> 01:06:33,153
See what I mean?

1344
01:06:38,496 --> 01:06:40,123
Hey.

1345
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:57,040
Don't worry about me.

1346
01:06:57,081 --> 01:06:58,912
I've got the best lawyer
in the world.

1347
01:06:58,950 --> 01:07:00,713
How long do you think
this will take?

1348
01:07:00,752 --> 01:07:01,946
Maybe a week.

1349
01:07:01,986 --> 01:07:03,715
A week?! That seems impossible!

1350
01:07:03,755 --> 01:07:05,723
That lawyer
won't be stupid enough...

1351
01:07:05,757 --> 01:07:08,351
to let him admit anything.
He'll deny everything.

1352
01:07:08,393 --> 01:07:10,452
I'll bring witnesses,
and he'll bring witnesses.

1353
01:07:11,663 --> 01:07:13,358
Hear ye, hear ye.

1354
01:07:13,398 --> 01:07:15,366
All persons having business...

1355
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:19,860
with the supreme court
of the county of New York...

1356
01:07:19,904 --> 01:07:22,600
draw near, give attendance,
and ye shall be heard.

1357
01:07:25,076 --> 01:07:28,534
You have Kris Kringle's
commitment papers.

1358
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:32,038
I'd like to call
the first witness.

1359
01:07:32,083 --> 01:07:35,575
Mr. Kringle,
will you take the stand?

1360
01:07:47,465 --> 01:07:48,932
Good morning, Your Honor.

1361
01:07:48,967 --> 01:07:50,958
You do solemnly swear...

1362
01:07:51,002 --> 01:07:54,904
the testimony you'll give
shall be the whole truth...

1363
01:07:54,939 --> 01:07:56,907
so help you God?

1364
01:07:56,941 --> 01:07:58,135
I do.

1365
01:07:58,176 --> 01:08:01,236
Before you begin, I want
to explain to the witness...

1366
01:08:01,279 --> 01:08:02,974
this is a hearing, not a trial.

1367
01:08:03,014 --> 01:08:04,538
Mr. Kringle...

1368
01:08:04,582 --> 01:08:06,948
you don't have to answer
against your wishes...

1369
01:08:06,985 --> 01:08:09,613
or even testify at all.

1370
01:08:09,654 --> 01:08:11,417
We have no objection,
Your Honor.

1371
01:08:13,157 --> 01:08:15,557
I'll be glad to answer
any questions I can.

1372
01:08:17,595 --> 01:08:19,586
What is your name?

1373
01:08:19,631 --> 01:08:20,791
Kris Kringle.

1374
01:08:22,433 --> 01:08:23,900
Where do you live?

1375
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:26,403
That's what this hearing
will decide.

1376
01:08:32,043 --> 01:08:34,603
A very sound answer,
Mr. Kringle.

1377
01:08:36,447 --> 01:08:38,608
Do you believe
that you're Santa Claus?

1378
01:08:38,650 --> 01:08:40,311
Of course.

1379
01:08:45,657 --> 01:08:48,148
The state rests, Your Honor.

1380
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:57,367
Well, Mr. Gailey...

1381
01:08:57,402 --> 01:08:59,870
do you wish to cross-examine
the witness?

1382
01:08:59,904 --> 01:09:02,065
I believe he was employed
to play Santa Claus.

1383
01:09:02,106 --> 01:09:04,700
Perhaps he didn't understand
the question correctly.

1384
01:09:04,742 --> 01:09:07,336
Oh, I understood perfectly,
Your Honor.

1385
01:09:11,616 --> 01:09:14,084
No further questions
at this time.

1386
01:09:17,588 --> 01:09:19,180
Thank you.

1387
01:09:22,593 --> 01:09:24,254
In view of this statement...

1388
01:09:24,295 --> 01:09:27,230
do you still wish
to put in a defense?

1389
01:09:27,265 --> 01:09:29,233
I do, Your Honor.

1390
01:09:29,267 --> 01:09:32,566
I'm fully aware
of my client's opinions.

1391
01:09:32,603 --> 01:09:33,934
That's the entire case
against him.

1392
01:09:33,972 --> 01:09:37,464
All these complicated tests
boil down to this:

1393
01:09:37,508 --> 01:09:39,703
Mr. Kringle is not sane...

1394
01:09:39,744 --> 01:09:41,541
because he believes himself
to be Santa Claus.

1395
01:09:41,579 --> 01:09:42,910
An entirely logical...

1396
01:09:42,947 --> 01:09:45,541
and reasonable assumption,
I'm afraid.

1397
01:09:45,583 --> 01:09:48,916
It would be if the clerk,
Mr. Marrah, or I...

1398
01:09:48,953 --> 01:09:50,511
believed we were Santa Claus.

1399
01:09:50,555 --> 01:09:53,217
Anyone who thinks
he's Santa Claus is not sane.

1400
01:09:53,257 --> 01:09:54,815
Not necessarily.

1401
01:09:54,859 --> 01:09:57,327
You believe yourself
to be Judge Harper...

1402
01:09:57,362 --> 01:10:00,627
yet no one questions your sanity
because you are Judge Harper.

1403
01:10:00,665 --> 01:10:03,361
I know all about myself,
young man.

1404
01:10:03,401 --> 01:10:05,198
Mr. Kringle is the subject
of this hearing.

1405
01:10:05,236 --> 01:10:06,396
Yes, Your Honor...

1406
01:10:06,437 --> 01:10:09,372
and if he is the person
he believes himself to be...

1407
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:12,501
just as you are,
then he's just as sane.

1408
01:10:12,543 --> 01:10:13,703
Granted, but he isn't.

1409
01:10:13,745 --> 01:10:14,871
Oh, but he is.

1410
01:10:14,912 --> 01:10:16,664
Is what?

1411
01:10:16,797 --> 01:10:19,766
I intend to prove
that Mr. Kringle is Santa Claus.

1412
01:10:21,502 --> 01:10:23,629
He's crazy, too!

1413
01:10:36,083 --> 01:10:38,517
Hi, darling.

1414
01:10:38,553 --> 01:10:41,386
Sorry I'm late. Get your coat.
I reserved our table at Luigi's.

1415
01:10:41,422 --> 01:10:42,548
We're gonna celebrate.

1416
01:10:42,590 --> 01:10:44,023
What are we celebrating?

1417
01:10:44,058 --> 01:10:46,526
Read all about it.
"Gailey Throws Court Bombshell."

1418
01:10:46,561 --> 01:10:48,529
Yes, I read that.

1419
01:10:48,563 --> 01:10:51,532
I didn't see this...
Front page! Good. Good.

1420
01:10:51,566 --> 01:10:53,500
You're not serious about this?

1421
01:10:53,534 --> 01:10:55,001
Of course I am.

1422
01:10:55,036 --> 01:10:57,504
But you can't possibly
prove he's Santa Claus.

1423
01:10:57,538 --> 01:11:00,063
Why not? You saw Macy
and Gimbel shaking hands.

1424
01:11:00,107 --> 01:11:02,575
That wasn't possible either,
but it happened.

1425
01:11:02,610 --> 01:11:04,043
It's the best defense I can use.

1426
01:11:04,078 --> 01:11:06,546
Completely logical
and completely unexpected.

1427
01:11:06,581 --> 01:11:08,071
And completely idiotic.

1428
01:11:08,115 --> 01:11:09,582
What about your bosses...

1429
01:11:09,617 --> 01:11:11,346
Haislip and Mackenzie
and the rest?

1430
01:11:11,385 --> 01:11:12,511
What do they say?

1431
01:11:12,553 --> 01:11:14,521
That I'm jeopardizing
the prestige and dignity...

1432
01:11:14,555 --> 01:11:16,523
of an old, established
law firm...

1433
01:11:16,557 --> 01:11:19,025
and either I drop this
impossible case immediately...

1434
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:20,527
or they will drop me.

1435
01:11:20,561 --> 01:11:22,085
I beat them to it. I quit.

1436
01:11:22,129 --> 01:11:23,596
Fred, you didn't.

1437
01:11:23,631 --> 01:11:25,792
Of course I did.
I can't let Kris down.

1438
01:11:25,833 --> 01:11:28,597
He needs me,
and all the rest of us need him.

1439
01:11:28,636 --> 01:11:30,399
Darling,
he's a nice old man...

1440
01:11:30,438 --> 01:11:34,340
and I admire you
for wanting to help him...

1441
01:11:34,375 --> 01:11:36,843
but you've got to be realistic
and face facts.

1442
01:11:36,877 --> 01:11:38,845
You can't just
throw your career away...

1443
01:11:38,879 --> 01:11:40,540
because of a sentimental whim.

1444
01:11:40,581 --> 01:11:42,549
But I'm not
throwing my career away.

1445
01:11:42,583 --> 01:11:44,551
If Haislip feels that way...

1446
01:11:44,585 --> 01:11:46,553
so will every other law firm.

1447
01:11:46,587 --> 01:11:49,055
I'm sure they will.
I'll open my own office.

1448
01:11:49,090 --> 01:11:51,558
What kind of cases will you get?

1449
01:11:51,592 --> 01:11:54,561
Probably people like
Kris who are being bullied.

1450
01:11:54,595 --> 01:11:56,563
That's the only fun in law
anyway.

1451
01:11:56,597 --> 01:11:59,498
If you believe in me
and have faith in me...

1452
01:11:59,533 --> 01:12:01,330
everything will...

1453
01:12:02,837 --> 01:12:06,000
You don't have any faith in me,
do you?

1454
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:09,703
It's not about faith.
It's just common sense.

1455
01:12:11,545 --> 01:12:13,672
Faith is believing in things...

1456
01:12:13,714 --> 01:12:16,512
when common sense
tells you not to.

1457
01:12:16,550 --> 01:12:19,110
It's not just Kris
that's on trial.

1458
01:12:19,153 --> 01:12:20,677
It's everything he stands for.

1459
01:12:20,721 --> 01:12:22,746
It's kindness, joy, love,
and all other intangibles.

1460
01:12:22,790 --> 01:12:24,621
Fred,
you're talking like a child.

1461
01:12:24,659 --> 01:12:26,149
You're living
in a realistic world!

1462
01:12:26,193 --> 01:12:27,660
Those lovely intangibles
aren't worth much.

1463
01:12:27,695 --> 01:12:29,185
You don't get ahead that way.

1464
01:12:29,230 --> 01:12:32,028
That all depends
on what you call getting ahead.

1465
01:12:32,066 --> 01:12:34,034
Evidently,
we have different definitions.

1466
01:12:34,068 --> 01:12:36,536
We've talked
about wonderful plans.

1467
01:12:36,570 --> 01:12:38,697
Then you go
on an idealistic binge.

1468
01:12:38,739 --> 01:12:41,537
You give up your job,
throw away your security...

1469
01:12:41,575 --> 01:12:44,703
and then you expect me
to be happy about it!

1470
01:12:44,745 --> 01:12:48,044
Yes,
I guess I expected too much.

1471
01:12:48,082 --> 01:12:50,209
Someday,
you're going to find out...

1472
01:12:50,251 --> 01:12:52,048
that your way of facing
this realistic world...

1473
01:12:52,086 --> 01:12:53,553
just doesn't work.

1474
01:12:53,587 --> 01:12:54,986
And when you do...

1475
01:12:55,022 --> 01:12:56,819
don't overlook
those lovely intangibles.

1476
01:12:56,857 --> 01:12:58,654
You'll discover
they're the only things...

1477
01:12:58,693 --> 01:13:00,024
that are worthwhile.

1478
01:13:08,536 --> 01:13:11,096
These reporters make me
look like a sadistic monster...

1479
01:13:11,138 --> 01:13:12,605
who likes to drown cats...

1480
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:14,505
and tear the wings
off butterflies.

1481
01:13:14,542 --> 01:13:15,668
Why, this old man...

1482
01:13:15,710 --> 01:13:19,168
Tommy, go get
mother's scissors, will you?

1483
01:13:19,213 --> 01:13:21,181
They're in the bedroom.

1484
01:13:21,215 --> 01:13:23,206
That's a good boy.

1485
01:13:24,652 --> 01:13:27,120
I don't want to discuss
this case in front of him.

1486
01:13:27,154 --> 01:13:29,019
It'll break his heart.

1487
01:13:29,056 --> 01:13:31,024
While we're on the subject,
I agree with the reporters.

1488
01:13:31,058 --> 01:13:33,026
Mr. Kringle seems
to be a nice old man.

1489
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:35,528
I don't see why you have
to keep persecuting him.

1490
01:13:35,563 --> 01:13:37,531
Firstly,
I am not persecuting him.

1491
01:13:37,565 --> 01:13:39,032
I am prosecuting him.

1492
01:13:39,066 --> 01:13:41,694
And secondly,
I like the old man, too.

1493
01:13:41,736 --> 01:13:44,034
I wish
I'd never gotten into this.

1494
01:13:44,071 --> 01:13:46,539
But it's too late now. There's
nothing I can do about it.

1495
01:13:46,574 --> 01:13:48,542
It's up to the state
of New York.

1496
01:13:48,576 --> 01:13:50,043
I'm their duly appointed
legal representative.

1497
01:13:50,077 --> 01:13:52,045
Kringle has been declared
a menace to society...

1498
01:13:52,079 --> 01:13:53,706
by competent doctors.

1499
01:13:53,748 --> 01:13:55,978
It's my duty to protect
the state of New York...

1500
01:13:56,016 --> 01:13:57,643
and see that he's put away.

1501
01:13:57,685 --> 01:13:59,585
No matter what they say
about me...

1502
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:01,144
I've got to do it.

1503
01:14:01,188 --> 01:14:04,487
Sometimes I wish I'd married
a butcher or a plumber.

1504
01:14:04,525 --> 01:14:07,153
Well, my dear,
if I lose this case...

1505
01:14:07,194 --> 01:14:09,526
it's very possible
that you'll get your wish.

1506
01:14:21,542 --> 01:14:22,941
Hello, Kris.

1507
01:14:34,889 --> 01:14:36,356
Your name?

1508
01:14:36,390 --> 01:14:37,789
R.H. Macy.

1509
01:14:37,825 --> 01:14:38,951
You are the owner...

1510
01:14:38,993 --> 01:14:40,460
of one of the biggest
department stores...

1511
01:14:40,494 --> 01:14:41,722
in New York City?

1512
01:14:41,762 --> 01:14:42,888
The biggest.

1513
01:14:42,930 --> 01:14:46,331
Who is the gentleman
seated there?

1514
01:14:46,367 --> 01:14:47,561
Kris Kringle.

1515
01:14:47,601 --> 01:14:49,034
- Your employee?
- Yes.

1516
01:14:49,069 --> 01:14:50,696
Do you believe him
to be truthful?

1517
01:14:50,738 --> 01:14:51,864
Yes.

1518
01:14:51,906 --> 01:14:54,041
You believe him to be
of sound mind?

1519
01:14:54,076 --> 01:14:55,133
I certainly do.

1520
01:14:55,176 --> 01:14:56,973
Mr. Macy, you're under oath.

1521
01:14:57,011 --> 01:14:59,172
You really believe
this man is Santa Claus?

1522
01:14:59,213 --> 01:15:01,511
Well, I...

1523
01:15:06,187 --> 01:15:08,747
Well, he gives
every indication...

1524
01:15:08,789 --> 01:15:12,190
Do you really believe
he's Santa Claus?

1525
01:15:20,534 --> 01:15:22,024
I do.

1526
01:15:22,069 --> 01:15:23,195
You do?

1527
01:15:23,237 --> 01:15:24,727
That's all.

1528
01:15:37,384 --> 01:15:39,079
Psychologist!

1529
01:15:39,119 --> 01:15:42,213
Where'd you graduate from,
a correspondence school?

1530
01:15:43,224 --> 01:15:44,714
You're fired.

1531
01:15:46,493 --> 01:15:48,518
Your Honor,
I object to this testimony.

1532
01:15:48,562 --> 01:15:50,530
It's ridiculous, irrelevant,
and immaterial.

1533
01:15:50,564 --> 01:15:52,691
Mr. Gailey is making
a circus of this court.

1534
01:15:52,733 --> 01:15:54,462
There is no such person
as Santa Claus...

1535
01:15:54,501 --> 01:15:55,968
and everybody knows it.

1536
01:15:56,003 --> 01:15:58,471
I submit
it's purely a matter of opinion.

1537
01:15:58,505 --> 01:16:00,871
Can Mr. Marrah disprove
Santa's existence?

1538
01:16:00,908 --> 01:16:02,637
No. I don't intend to.

1539
01:16:02,676 --> 01:16:05,110
This isn't a nursery. It's the
New York State Supreme Court.

1540
01:16:05,145 --> 01:16:07,636
I'll not waste this court's time
with such nonsense!

1541
01:16:07,681 --> 01:16:09,649
Mr. Marrah seems to have
appointed himself judge.

1542
01:16:09,683 --> 01:16:12,652
He's ruling on what testimony
I may introduce.

1543
01:16:12,686 --> 01:16:15,484
We request an immediate
ruling from this court.

1544
01:16:15,522 --> 01:16:18,047
Is there or is there not
a Santa Claus?

1545
01:16:20,194 --> 01:16:21,661
Well...

1546
01:16:21,695 --> 01:16:23,492
Ahem!

1547
01:16:29,203 --> 01:16:32,604
The court will take a recess
to consider the matter.

1548
01:16:35,542 --> 01:16:38,511
I don't care what you do
with old whisker puss...

1549
01:16:38,545 --> 01:16:41,013
but if you rule
that there's no Santa Claus...

1550
01:16:41,048 --> 01:16:43,516
you better start looking
for that chicken farm.

1551
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:47,008
We won't even be able
to put you in the primaries.

1552
01:16:47,054 --> 01:16:49,045
But, Charley, listen to reason.

1553
01:16:49,089 --> 01:16:51,057
I'm a responsible judge.

1554
01:16:51,091 --> 01:16:53,059
I've taken an oath.

1555
01:16:53,093 --> 01:16:56,085
How can I seriously rule
there is a Santa Claus?

1556
01:16:56,130 --> 01:16:58,121
Why don't you...

1557
01:16:59,633 --> 01:17:01,100
All right.

1558
01:17:01,135 --> 01:17:04,593
Tell them the New York
State Supreme Court rules...

1559
01:17:04,638 --> 01:17:06,105
there's no Santa Claus.

1560
01:17:06,140 --> 01:17:07,368
It's all over the papers.

1561
01:17:07,408 --> 01:17:09,603
The kids don't hang up
their stockings.

1562
01:17:09,643 --> 01:17:11,941
Now, what happens
to all the toys...

1563
01:17:11,979 --> 01:17:14,106
that are supposed to be
in those stockings?

1564
01:17:14,148 --> 01:17:15,615
Nobody buys them.

1565
01:17:15,649 --> 01:17:18,117
The toy manufacturers
are going to like that.

1566
01:17:18,152 --> 01:17:21,315
So they have to lay off
a lot of their employees...

1567
01:17:21,355 --> 01:17:23,323
union employees.

1568
01:17:23,357 --> 01:17:26,986
Now you got the C.I.O.
And the A.F.L. Against you.

1569
01:17:27,027 --> 01:17:29,549
And they're gonna adore you
for it.

1570
01:17:29,683 --> 01:17:32,777
And they're gonna say it
with votes.

1571
01:17:32,819 --> 01:17:35,720
And the department stores
will love you, too...

1572
01:17:35,755 --> 01:17:38,383
and the Christmas card makers...

1573
01:17:38,425 --> 01:17:39,892
and the candy companies.

1574
01:17:39,926 --> 01:17:44,727
Oh, Henry, you're going to be
an awful popular fellow.

1575
01:17:44,764 --> 01:17:47,130
And what about
the Salvation Army?

1576
01:17:47,167 --> 01:17:49,658
Why, they got a Santa Claus
on every corner...

1577
01:17:49,703 --> 01:17:51,364
and they take in a fortune.

1578
01:17:51,404 --> 01:17:52,735
But you go ahead, Henry.

1579
01:17:52,772 --> 01:17:55,002
You do it your way.

1580
01:17:55,041 --> 01:17:57,509
You go on back in there
and tell them...

1581
01:17:57,544 --> 01:18:00,604
that you rule
there's no Santa Claus.

1582
01:18:01,615 --> 01:18:04,015
But if you do, remember this:

1583
01:18:04,050 --> 01:18:05,881
You can count on getting
just two votes...

1584
01:18:05,919 --> 01:18:08,683
your own and that
district attorney's out there.

1585
01:18:11,224 --> 01:18:13,419
The district attorney's
a Republican.

1586
01:18:14,628 --> 01:18:15,788
All rise!

1587
01:18:32,746 --> 01:18:34,714
Before making a ruling...

1588
01:18:34,748 --> 01:18:38,844
this court has consulted
the highest authority available.

1589
01:18:40,987 --> 01:18:43,046
The question of Santa Claus...

1590
01:18:43,089 --> 01:18:45,319
seems to be largely
a matter of opinion.

1591
01:18:45,358 --> 01:18:48,225
Many people
firmly believe in him.

1592
01:18:48,261 --> 01:18:50,229
Others do not.

1593
01:18:50,263 --> 01:18:53,426
The tradition
of American justice demands...

1594
01:18:53,466 --> 01:18:57,459
a broad, unprejudiced view
of such a controversial matter.

1595
01:18:57,504 --> 01:19:02,498
This court, therefore,
intends to keep an open mind.

1596
01:19:02,542 --> 01:19:04,339
I'll hear all the evidence.

1597
01:19:04,377 --> 01:19:06,208
He's crazy, too.

1598
01:19:07,881 --> 01:19:11,009
The burden of proof for this
ridiculous contention...

1599
01:19:11,051 --> 01:19:12,518
clearly rests with my opponent.

1600
01:19:12,552 --> 01:19:15,521
Can he produce evidence
to support his views?

1601
01:19:15,555 --> 01:19:17,523
If Your Honor pleases, I can.

1602
01:19:17,557 --> 01:19:19,024
Will Thomas Marrah
please take the stand?

1603
01:19:19,059 --> 01:19:20,219
Who, me?

1604
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:22,285
Thomas Marrah, Jr.

1605
01:19:33,707 --> 01:19:35,197
Hello, Daddy.

1606
01:19:37,677 --> 01:19:39,668
Here you are, Tommy.

1607
01:19:42,315 --> 01:19:44,783
Tommy,
you know the difference...

1608
01:19:44,818 --> 01:19:47,343
between telling the truth
and telling a lie, right?

1609
01:19:47,387 --> 01:19:50,914
Everybody knows you
shouldn't tell a lie...

1610
01:19:50,957 --> 01:19:52,982
especially in court.

1611
01:19:54,628 --> 01:19:55,993
Proceed, Mr. Gailey.

1612
01:19:56,029 --> 01:19:57,758
Do you believe in Santa Claus?

1613
01:19:57,797 --> 01:19:59,731
Sure I do.

1614
01:19:59,766 --> 01:20:03,862
He gave me a brand-new
flexible flyer sled last year.

1615
01:20:03,903 --> 01:20:07,236
And what does he look like?

1616
01:20:07,273 --> 01:20:09,764
There he is, sitting there.

1617
01:20:09,809 --> 01:20:11,367
Your Honor, I protest!

1618
01:20:12,779 --> 01:20:14,770
Overruled.

1619
01:20:16,216 --> 01:20:17,513
Tell me, Tommy...

1620
01:20:17,550 --> 01:20:20,747
why are you so sure
there's a Santa Claus?

1621
01:20:20,787 --> 01:20:23,756
Because my daddy told me so.

1622
01:20:23,790 --> 01:20:25,451
Didn't you, Daddy?

1623
01:20:27,594 --> 01:20:29,528
You believe your daddy,
don't you?

1624
01:20:29,562 --> 01:20:31,257
He's a very honest man.

1625
01:20:31,297 --> 01:20:32,457
Of course he is.

1626
01:20:32,499 --> 01:20:35,468
My daddy wouldn't tell me
anything that wasn't so.

1627
01:20:35,502 --> 01:20:37,470
Would you, Daddy?

1628
01:20:40,206 --> 01:20:41,571
Thank you, Tommy.

1629
01:20:45,278 --> 01:20:46,404
Good-bye, Daddy.

1630
01:20:47,614 --> 01:20:49,844
Your Honor...

1631
01:20:49,883 --> 01:20:52,852
Don't forget.
A real official football helmet.

1632
01:20:52,886 --> 01:20:55,616
Don't worry, Tommy.
You'll get it.

1633
01:21:13,606 --> 01:21:15,073
Your Honor,
the state of New York...

1634
01:21:15,108 --> 01:21:17,440
concedes the existence
of Santa Claus.

1635
01:21:23,583 --> 01:21:27,041
But we ask that Mr. Gailey
cease presenting...

1636
01:21:27,087 --> 01:21:29,055
personal opinion as evidence.

1637
01:21:29,089 --> 01:21:31,922
We could bring witnesses
with opposite opinions...

1638
01:21:31,958 --> 01:21:34,188
but we desire
to shorten this hearing...

1639
01:21:34,227 --> 01:21:36,058
rather than prolong it.

1640
01:21:36,096 --> 01:21:38,064
I request that Mr. Gailey...

1641
01:21:38,098 --> 01:21:39,588
now submit
authoritative proof...

1642
01:21:39,632 --> 01:21:41,190
that Mr. Kringle...

1643
01:21:41,234 --> 01:21:43,828
is the one-and-only Santa Claus.

1644
01:21:45,138 --> 01:21:47,003
Your point's well taken.

1645
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,736
I'm afraid we must agree.

1646
01:21:54,581 --> 01:21:58,540
Mr. Gailey, can you show that
Mr. Kringle is Santa Claus...

1647
01:21:58,585 --> 01:22:00,849
on the basis
of competent authority?

1648
01:22:02,555 --> 01:22:04,523
Not at this time, Your Honor.

1649
01:22:04,557 --> 01:22:07,151
I ask for an adjournment
until tomorrow.

1650
01:22:07,193 --> 01:22:10,026
Court stands adjourned
till tomorrow afternoon, 3:00.

1651
01:22:15,635 --> 01:22:18,103
Well, I guess that's that.

1652
01:22:18,138 --> 01:22:19,867
There's a way, Alfred.

1653
01:22:19,906 --> 01:22:21,464
There's got to be!

1654
01:22:27,147 --> 01:22:29,115
It's hard to explain.

1655
01:22:29,149 --> 01:22:32,118
They're having a trial
about him.

1656
01:22:32,152 --> 01:22:34,120
You mean like for murder?

1657
01:22:34,154 --> 01:22:36,088
No, it isn't that kind
of a trial.

1658
01:22:36,122 --> 01:22:38,613
It's just because
he says he's Santa Claus.

1659
01:22:38,658 --> 01:22:41,627
I've got a feeling
he is Santa Claus.

1660
01:22:41,661 --> 01:22:44,596
Some people don't
believe that. That's why...

1661
01:22:44,631 --> 01:22:47,600
But he's so kind
and nice and jolly.

1662
01:22:47,634 --> 01:22:50,102
He's not like anyone else.

1663
01:22:50,136 --> 01:22:52,104
He must be Santa.

1664
01:22:52,138 --> 01:22:54,368
I think
perhaps you're right, Suzie.

1665
01:22:54,407 --> 01:22:57,570
Is Mr. Kringle sad now,
Mother?

1666
01:22:57,610 --> 01:22:59,578
I'm afraid he is.

1667
01:22:59,612 --> 01:23:02,080
I'm sure he misses you.

1668
01:23:02,115 --> 01:23:05,744
Then I'll write him
a letter and cheer him up.

1669
01:24:17,690 --> 01:24:19,954
Hey, Lou, come here!

1670
01:24:19,992 --> 01:24:21,118
Yeah?

1671
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:22,627
Here's a new one.

1672
01:24:22,662 --> 01:24:24,653
I seen them write
to Santa Claus...

1673
01:24:24,697 --> 01:24:27,131
North Pole, South Pole,
and every other place.

1674
01:24:27,166 --> 01:24:28,633
This kid writes...

1675
01:24:28,668 --> 01:24:30,659
"Kris Kringle,
New York County Courthouse."

1676
01:24:30,703 --> 01:24:33,638
The kid's right.
They got him on trial there.

1677
01:24:33,673 --> 01:24:37,473
He claims he's Santa Claus,
and the D.A. Claims he's nuts.

1678
01:24:37,510 --> 01:24:40,673
Read it for yourself.
Right on the front page.

1679
01:24:44,216 --> 01:24:48,016
Hey, Lou,
how many Santa Claus letters...

1680
01:24:48,054 --> 01:24:49,681
we got
at the dead-letter office?

1681
01:24:49,722 --> 01:24:51,189
I don't know.

1682
01:24:51,223 --> 01:24:53,191
There must be
about 50,000 of them.

1683
01:24:53,225 --> 01:24:55,125
Bags and bags
all over the joint.

1684
01:24:55,161 --> 01:24:57,629
And there's more coming in
every day.

1685
01:24:57,663 --> 01:24:59,130
Yeah. Hey, Lou.

1686
01:24:59,165 --> 01:25:03,625
It'd be nice
to get rid of them, huh?

1687
01:25:03,669 --> 01:25:05,637
Yeah, but...

1688
01:25:05,671 --> 01:25:08,139
Hey, that's a wonderful idea!

1689
01:25:08,174 --> 01:25:11,143
Why should we be
bothered with all that stuff?

1690
01:25:11,177 --> 01:25:13,611
Why not get some trucks?
Big ones right away.

1691
01:25:13,646 --> 01:25:16,638
Load them with Santa Claus mail
and deliver it...

1692
01:25:16,682 --> 01:25:19,116
to Mr. Kringle
at the courthouse.

1693
01:25:19,151 --> 01:25:21,949
Let somebody else
worry about it, huh?

1694
01:25:21,987 --> 01:25:24,251
Hey! Jingle bells, jingle bells

1695
01:25:24,290 --> 01:25:25,757
Jingle all the way

1696
01:25:39,705 --> 01:25:41,172
Hello, Kris.

1697
01:25:41,207 --> 01:25:42,674
Fred.

1698
01:25:42,708 --> 01:25:46,667
Kris, I'm afraid
I've got bad news for you.

1699
01:25:46,712 --> 01:25:50,170
I've tried every way to get
some competent authority.

1700
01:25:50,216 --> 01:25:52,480
I've wired the governor,
the mayor. I even...

1701
01:25:52,518 --> 01:25:54,418
This is worth more to me...

1702
01:25:54,453 --> 01:25:56,751
than all the governors
and mayors in the world.

1703
01:25:56,789 --> 01:25:58,916
It's all over. Look at him.

1704
01:25:58,958 --> 01:26:00,789
He hasn't got a thing.

1705
01:26:17,209 --> 01:26:20,372
And furthermore,
the defense has yet to offer...

1706
01:26:20,413 --> 01:26:22,881
one concrete
piece of evidence...

1707
01:26:22,915 --> 01:26:25,383
to substantiate
this preposterous claim.

1708
01:26:25,418 --> 01:26:28,615
Not one authoritative proof
that this man is Santa Claus.

1709
01:26:28,654 --> 01:26:29,882
In view of these facts...

1710
01:26:29,922 --> 01:26:32,390
and especially since
today is Christmas Eve...

1711
01:26:32,425 --> 01:26:35,121
we're, naturally,
all anxious to get home...

1712
01:26:35,161 --> 01:26:37,129
I ask that you sign
the commitment papers...

1713
01:26:37,163 --> 01:26:38,391
without further delay.

1714
01:26:38,431 --> 01:26:40,626
Mr. Gailey...

1715
01:26:40,666 --> 01:26:43,100
have you anything further
to offer?

1716
01:26:43,135 --> 01:26:44,625
Yes, I have, Your Honor.

1717
01:26:44,670 --> 01:26:47,639
I'd like to submit the following
facts in evidence.

1718
01:26:47,673 --> 01:26:49,504
It concerns
the Post Office Department...

1719
01:26:49,542 --> 01:26:53,000
an official agency
of the United States government.

1720
01:26:53,045 --> 01:26:55,513
"The Post Office Department
was created...

1721
01:26:55,548 --> 01:26:57,516
"by the Second
Continental Congress...

1722
01:26:57,550 --> 01:26:59,017
"on July 26, 1776.

1723
01:26:59,051 --> 01:27:01,815
"The first postmaster general
was Benjamin Franklin.

1724
01:27:01,854 --> 01:27:03,515
"The Post Office...

1725
01:27:03,556 --> 01:27:06,252
"is one of the world's
largest business concerns.

1726
01:27:06,292 --> 01:27:08,260
"Last year,
under Robert Hannigan...

1727
01:27:08,294 --> 01:27:14,324
"it did a gross business
of $1,112,877,174."

1728
01:27:14,366 --> 01:27:17,335
We're all gratified to know...

1729
01:27:17,369 --> 01:27:19,337
the Post Office
is doing nicely...

1730
01:27:19,371 --> 01:27:21,931
but it hardly has
any bearing on this case.

1731
01:27:21,974 --> 01:27:25,068
It has a great deal, Your Honor,
if I may be allowed to proceed.

1732
01:27:25,110 --> 01:27:27,670
By all means, Mr. Gailey.

1733
01:27:29,148 --> 01:27:32,049
Your Honor, the figures
I have just quoted...

1734
01:27:32,084 --> 01:27:35,110
indicate an efficiently run
organization.

1735
01:27:35,154 --> 01:27:38,282
United States postal laws
and regulations...

1736
01:27:38,324 --> 01:27:41,555
make it a criminal offense
to willfully misdirect mail...

1737
01:27:41,594 --> 01:27:44,290
or intentionally deliver it
to the wrong party.

1738
01:27:44,330 --> 01:27:45,558
Consequently...

1739
01:27:45,598 --> 01:27:47,759
the Department uses
every possible precaution.

1740
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:53,136
The state of New York
admires the Post Office.

1741
01:27:53,172 --> 01:27:55,470
It is efficient, authoritative,
and prosperous.

1742
01:27:55,508 --> 01:27:58,636
We're happy to concede
Mr. Gailey's claims.

1743
01:27:58,677 --> 01:28:00,008
For the record?

1744
01:28:00,045 --> 01:28:02,912
For the record.
Anything to get this case going.

1745
01:28:02,948 --> 01:28:04,745
Then I want
to introduce this evidence.

1746
01:28:04,783 --> 01:28:07,149
I'll take them, please.

1747
01:28:07,186 --> 01:28:11,282
I have three letters
addressed simply "Santa Claus."

1748
01:28:11,323 --> 01:28:12,756
No other address whatsoever.

1749
01:28:12,791 --> 01:28:15,919
Yet these were just now
delivered to Mr. Kringle...

1750
01:28:15,961 --> 01:28:18,589
by bona fide employees
of the Post Office.

1751
01:28:18,631 --> 01:28:20,929
I offer them
as positive proof that...

1752
01:28:20,966 --> 01:28:24,424
Uh, three letters
are hardly positive proof.

1753
01:28:24,470 --> 01:28:28,201
I understand the Post Office
receives thousands of these.

1754
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:31,698
I have further exhibits,
but I hesitate to produce them.

1755
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:33,735
We'll be very happy to see them.

1756
01:28:33,779 --> 01:28:35,713
Yes, yes.
Produce them, Mr. Gailey.

1757
01:28:35,748 --> 01:28:37,841
Put them here on my desk.

1758
01:28:37,883 --> 01:28:39,908
But, Your Honor...

1759
01:28:39,952 --> 01:28:41,852
Put them here on the desk.

1760
01:28:41,887 --> 01:28:43,718
Put them here.

1761
01:28:43,756 --> 01:28:45,747
Yes, Your Honor.

1762
01:29:13,252 --> 01:29:14,719
Your Honor!

1763
01:29:16,722 --> 01:29:18,212
Your Honor!

1764
01:29:28,734 --> 01:29:30,599
Your Honor...

1765
01:29:30,636 --> 01:29:33,696
every one of these letters
is addressed to Santa Claus.

1766
01:29:33,739 --> 01:29:35,707
The Post Office
has delivered them.

1767
01:29:35,741 --> 01:29:37,208
Therefore, the Post Office...

1768
01:29:37,242 --> 01:29:39,437
a branch
of the federal government...

1769
01:29:39,478 --> 01:29:41,969
recognizes this man,
Kris Kringle...

1770
01:29:42,014 --> 01:29:44,346
to be the one-and-only
Santa Claus!

1771
01:29:51,757 --> 01:29:54,073
Since the United States
government...

1772
01:29:54,108 --> 01:29:56,390
declares this man
to be Santa Claus...

1773
01:29:56,428 --> 01:29:58,123
this court will not dispute it.

1774
01:29:58,163 --> 01:29:59,528
Case dismissed.

1775
01:30:11,710 --> 01:30:13,610
I've got to get
that football helmet!

1776
01:30:19,718 --> 01:30:21,709
Thank you so much,
Your Honor...

1777
01:30:21,754 --> 01:30:23,847
and a very merry Christmas
to you.

1778
01:30:23,889 --> 01:30:26,687
Thank you, Mr. Kringle,
and the same to you.

1779
01:30:26,725 --> 01:30:28,215
Thank you.

1780
01:30:39,738 --> 01:30:41,035
Kris.

1781
01:30:41,073 --> 01:30:42,597
I had to wait to tell you.

1782
01:30:42,641 --> 01:30:45,075
I got your note.
It made me very happy.

1783
01:30:45,110 --> 01:30:46,600
Oh, I'm so glad.

1784
01:30:46,645 --> 01:30:48,442
We're having
a big Christmas party...

1785
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:50,107
at the Brooks' Home
tomorrow morning.

1786
01:30:50,149 --> 01:30:51,616
Breakfast, a beautiful tree.

1787
01:30:51,650 --> 01:30:54,448
I'd like to have you and Susan.

1788
01:30:54,486 --> 01:30:56,113
Oh, thank you.

1789
01:30:56,155 --> 01:30:59,157
There's no one I'd rather
spend Christmas with.

1790
01:30:59,291 --> 01:31:02,226
Would you like
to come to dinner tonight?

1791
01:31:02,260 --> 01:31:04,228
Tonight? Oh, I can't.

1792
01:31:04,262 --> 01:31:05,695
It's Christmas Eve.

1793
01:31:05,730 --> 01:31:07,197
Oh, I forgot.

1794
01:31:07,232 --> 01:31:08,392
Bye.

1795
01:31:33,592 --> 01:31:36,220
Oh, my dear sir...

1796
01:31:36,261 --> 01:31:38,752
you know my assistant Alfred,
Mr. Macy?

1797
01:31:38,797 --> 01:31:40,765
Merry Christmas, Alfred.

1798
01:31:40,799 --> 01:31:42,266
Mr. Macy!

1799
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:43,767
Hello, Alfred.

1800
01:31:43,802 --> 01:31:45,235
Mr. Macy!

1801
01:32:00,552 --> 01:32:03,020
Kris, all I can say
is the state supreme court...

1802
01:32:03,054 --> 01:32:05,716
declared you
to be Santa Claus...

1803
01:32:05,757 --> 01:32:07,224
and personally
and professionally...

1804
01:32:07,259 --> 01:32:08,556
I agree with them.

1805
01:32:12,063 --> 01:32:14,531
But there are lots
of presents there for you.

1806
01:32:14,566 --> 01:32:16,193
Not the one I wanted.

1807
01:32:16,234 --> 01:32:18,031
Not the one Mr. Kringle
was going to get for me.

1808
01:32:18,069 --> 01:32:19,434
Well, what was that?

1809
01:32:19,471 --> 01:32:21,439
It doesn't matter.
I didn't get it.

1810
01:32:21,473 --> 01:32:24,271
I knew it wouldn't be here...

1811
01:32:24,309 --> 01:32:26,641
but I thought
there'd be a letter.

1812
01:32:26,678 --> 01:32:29,704
I don't suppose
you even want to talk to me.

1813
01:32:29,748 --> 01:32:31,716
Something about a present.

1814
01:32:31,750 --> 01:32:33,718
Yes, I know.
I'm sorry, Suzie.

1815
01:32:33,752 --> 01:32:36,220
I tried my best, but...

1816
01:32:36,254 --> 01:32:39,087
You couldn't get it
because you're not Santa.

1817
01:32:39,124 --> 01:32:42,093
You're just a nice old man
with whiskers...

1818
01:32:42,127 --> 01:32:43,651
like my mother said...

1819
01:32:43,695 --> 01:32:45,925
and I shouldn't have
believed you.

1820
01:32:47,265 --> 01:32:50,325
I was wrong
when I told you that.

1821
01:32:50,368 --> 01:32:53,735
You must believe in Mr. Kringle
and keep right on doing it.

1822
01:32:53,772 --> 01:32:55,171
You must have faith in him.

1823
01:32:55,207 --> 01:32:57,675
But he didn't get me the...

1824
01:32:57,709 --> 01:32:59,643
That doesn't make sense, Mommy.

1825
01:32:59,678 --> 01:33:01,942
Faith is believing in things...

1826
01:33:01,980 --> 01:33:04,107
when common sense
tells you not to.

1827
01:33:04,149 --> 01:33:05,673
Huh?

1828
01:33:05,717 --> 01:33:08,151
Just because things
don't turn out...

1829
01:33:08,186 --> 01:33:10,211
the way you want them to
the first time...

1830
01:33:10,255 --> 01:33:12,689
you've still got to believe
in people.

1831
01:33:12,724 --> 01:33:14,692
I found that out.

1832
01:33:14,726 --> 01:33:16,193
You mean like...

1833
01:33:16,228 --> 01:33:19,629
"If at first you don't succeed,
try, try again"?

1834
01:33:19,664 --> 01:33:20,790
Yes.

1835
01:33:20,832 --> 01:33:22,732
I thought so.

1836
01:33:26,104 --> 01:33:28,072
May I drive you home?

1837
01:33:28,106 --> 01:33:29,232
Thank you.

1838
01:33:29,274 --> 01:33:32,141
If you'll go this way,
you'll miss a lot of traffic.

1839
01:33:32,177 --> 01:33:34,372
You go along Maplewood
until you've come to Ashley...

1840
01:33:34,412 --> 01:33:38,348
I believe. I believe.
It's silly, but I believe.

1841
01:33:38,383 --> 01:33:41,045
Thanks, Kris.
Merry Christmas.

1842
01:33:41,086 --> 01:33:42,314
Merry Christmas to you.

1843
01:33:42,354 --> 01:33:45,187
And to you, my dear,
and many of them.

1844
01:33:45,223 --> 01:33:47,214
Good-bye, my dear.

1845
01:33:47,259 --> 01:33:49,193
Good-bye, Mrs. Walker.

1846
01:33:49,227 --> 01:33:50,694
Good-bye, Alfred.

1847
01:33:50,729 --> 01:33:52,219
Good-bye, Suzie.

1848
01:33:55,767 --> 01:33:58,634
This must be the turn here.

1849
01:33:58,670 --> 01:34:00,638
That's right. Ashley.

1850
01:34:00,672 --> 01:34:03,664
Now you go straight
for four blocks.

1851
01:34:04,943 --> 01:34:08,777
I believe. I believe.

1852
01:34:12,250 --> 01:34:14,582
Stop, Uncle Fred! Stop!

1853
01:34:14,619 --> 01:34:16,587
Stop! Stop!

1854
01:34:20,258 --> 01:34:21,452
Suzie!

1855
01:34:22,460 --> 01:34:23,654
Suzie!

1856
01:34:25,797 --> 01:34:27,424
Suzie, where are you going?

1857
01:34:27,465 --> 01:34:28,989
What is she doing?

1858
01:34:29,034 --> 01:34:31,059
- Suzie!
- Suzie!

1859
01:34:33,305 --> 01:34:35,705
Suzie, where are you?

1860
01:34:35,740 --> 01:34:37,207
I'm upstairs!

1861
01:34:37,242 --> 01:34:39,210
You shouldn't run around
in other people's houses.

1862
01:34:39,244 --> 01:34:40,711
You know better than that.

1863
01:34:40,745 --> 01:34:44,772
But this is my house,
the one I asked Mr. Kringle for.

1864
01:34:44,816 --> 01:34:46,613
It is! I know it is!

1865
01:34:46,651 --> 01:34:49,552
My room upstairs is like
I knew it would be!

1866
01:34:49,587 --> 01:34:50,747
You were right, Mommy.

1867
01:34:50,789 --> 01:34:54,885
Mommy said if things
don't turn out right at first...

1868
01:34:54,926 --> 01:34:56,951
you've still got to believe.

1869
01:34:56,995 --> 01:34:58,929
I kept believing.
You were right, Mommy!

1870
01:34:58,963 --> 01:35:01,363
Mr. Kringle is Santa Claus!

1871
01:35:01,399 --> 01:35:03,162
Where are you going?

1872
01:35:03,201 --> 01:35:04,691
To see if there's a swing!

1873
01:35:06,037 --> 01:35:07,971
There is one! There is one!

1874
01:35:12,711 --> 01:35:14,702
You told her that?

1875
01:35:23,722 --> 01:35:27,351
The sign outside
said it's for sale.

1876
01:35:27,392 --> 01:35:29,121
We can't let her down.

1877
01:35:30,995 --> 01:35:32,929
I never really doubted you.

1878
01:35:32,964 --> 01:35:35,694
It was just
my silly common sense.

1879
01:35:35,734 --> 01:35:38,703
It even makes sense
to believe in me now.

1880
01:35:38,737 --> 01:35:41,205
I must be a pretty good lawyer.

1881
01:35:41,239 --> 01:35:42,706
I take a little old man...

1882
01:35:42,741 --> 01:35:44,709
and legally prove
that he's Santa Claus.

1883
01:35:44,743 --> 01:35:46,233

1884
01:35:56,688 --> 01:35:59,156
Oh, no. It can't be.

1885
01:35:59,190 --> 01:36:01,852
It must have been left
by the people that moved out.

1886
01:36:02,861 --> 01:36:04,021
Maybe.

1887
01:36:05,263 --> 01:36:09,700
Maybe I didn't do such
a wonderful thing after all.
