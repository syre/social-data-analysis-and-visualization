1
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,120
I was sheriff of this county
when I was 25 years old.

2
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,120
Hard to believe.

3
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,560
My grandfather was a lawman.
Father too.

4
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,160
Me and him was sheriffs at the same
time, him up in Plano and me out here.

5
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,080
I think he's pretty proud of that.

6
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,600
I know I was.

7
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,400
Some of the old-time sheriffs
never even wore a gun.

8
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,920
Folks find that hard to believe.
Jim Scarborough never carried one.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,560
That's the younger Jim.

10
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,920
Gaston Boykins wouldn't wear one
up in Comanche County.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,320
I always liked to hear
about the old-timers.

12
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,280
Never missed a chance to do so.

13
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,720
You can't help but compare yourself
against the old-timers.

14
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,480
Can't help but wonder
how they'd have operated these times.

15
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,200
There's this boy I sent to the electric
chair at Huntsville here a while back.

16
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,480
My arrest and my testimony.

17
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,960
He killed a 14-year-old girl.

18
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,400
Paper said it was a crime of passion...

19
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,240
...but he told me there
wasn't any passion to it.

20
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,360
Told me he'd planned to kill somebody
for as long as he could remember.

21
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,200
Said if they turned him out,
he'd do it again.

22
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,760
Said he knew he was going to hell.

23
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,160
Be there in about 15 minutes.

24
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,880
I don't know what to make of that.

25
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,080
I sure do don't.

26
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,680
The crime you see now,
it's hard to even take its measure.

27
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,280
It's not that I'm afraid of it.

28
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,840
I always knew you had to be willing
to die to even do this job.

29
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,000
But I don't want to push
my chips forward and go out.

30
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,400
...and meet something I don't understand.

31
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,640
A man would have
to put his soul at hazard.

32
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,240
He'd have to say, "OK.

33
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,160
I'll be part of this world. "

34
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,400
Yes, sir, I just walked in the door.

35
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,480
He had some sort of thing on him...

36
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,960
...like a oxygen tank
for emphysema or something...

37
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,280
...and a hose that run down his sleeve.

38
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,760
Oxygen tank?
What the hell's he got that for?

39
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,480
You got me. Well,
you can look at it when you get in.

40
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,840
- I'll be down there in a bit.
- Yes, sir, I got it under control.

41
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,440
- Howdy. What's this about?
- Step out of the car please, sir.

42
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,680
What is that?

43
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,000
I need you to step out of the car, sir.

44
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,400
- What is that for?
- Would you?...

45
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,400
Would you hold still please, sir?

46
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,080
You hold still.

47
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,560
Shit.

48
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,160
Agua.

49
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,080
Agua.

50
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,360
Agua.

51
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,040
I ain't got no water.

52
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,000
Agua.

53
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,240
Agua.

54
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,440
I told you I ain't got no agua.

55
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,960
Do you speak English?

56
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,160
Where's the last guy?

57
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,760
ÃœItimo hombre, last man standing. There
must have been one. Where'd he go?

58
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,640
I reckon I go out the way I come in.

59
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,600
Hay lobos.

60
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,920
There ain't no lobos.

61
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,000
You stopped to watch
your backtrack.

62
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,720
Now shoot my dumb ass.

63
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,360
But if you stop...

64
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,360
...you stopped in shade.

65
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,480
Yeah.

66
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,240
Hmm.

67
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,040
Mmm.

68
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,720
My place is wrong?

69
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,240
Yours is the first place
Danzer and Dora will look if they...

70
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,240
If they know.

71
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,120
- What's in the satchel?
- It's full of money.

72
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,320
That would be the day.

73
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,040
- Where'd you get the pistol?
- At the gettin' place.

74
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,360
- Did you buy that gun?
- No. I found it.

75
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,560
- Llewelyn.
- What? Quit your hollering.

76
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,040
What'd you get for that thing?

77
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,240
You don't need to know everything,
Carla Jean.

78
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,600
- I need to know that.
- Keep running that mouth of yours...

79
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,160
I'm gonna take you in the back
and screw you.

80
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,200
- Big talk.
- Keep it up.

81
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,240
Fine. I don't want to know.

82
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,120
I don't even want to know
where you been all day.

83
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,840
That'll work.

84
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,880
All right.

85
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,680
- Llewelyn?
- Yeah?

86
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,160
- What're you doing, baby?
- I'm going out.

87
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,280
Going where?

88
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,120
A little something I forgot to do,
but I'll be back.

89
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,400
- And what're you gonna do?
- I'm fixing to do something.

90
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,560
...dumber than hell, but I'm going anyways.

91
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,040
If I don't come back,
you tell Mother I love her.

92
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,080
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.

93
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,200
Well, then I'll tell her myself.

94
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,600
- How much?
- Sixty-nine cents.

95
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,080
And the gas?

96
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,600
Y'all getting any rain up your way?

97
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,640
- What way would that be?
- Well, I seen you was from Dallas.

98
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,520
What business is it of yours
where I'm from...

99
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,000
...friendo?

100
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,440
- Well, I didn't mean nothing by it.
- You didn't mean nothing?

101
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,760
I was just passing the time.

102
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,720
If you don't want to accept that,
I don't know what else I can do for you.

103
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,920
- Will there be something else?
- I don't know. Will there?

104
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,840
- Is something wrong?
- With what?

105
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,240
With anything.

106
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,280
Is that what you're asking me?
Is there something wrong with anything?

107
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,640
- Will there be anything else?
- You already asked me that.

108
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,280
- Well, I need to see about closing now.
- See about closing?

109
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,240
- Yes, sir.
- What time do you close?

110
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,440
- Now. We close now.
- Now is not a time.

111
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,480
- What time do you close?
- Generally around dark. At dark.

112
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,040
You don't know what
you're talking about, do you?

113
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,120
Sir?

114
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,720
I said you don't know
what you're talking about.

115
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,600
- What time do you go to bed?
- Sir?

116
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,120
You're a bit deaf, aren't you?
I said, what time do you go to bed?

117
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,680
Oh.

118
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,720
Somewhere around 9:30.
I'd say around 9:30.

119
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,280
I could come back then.

120
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,680
Why would you be coming back?
We'll be closed.

121
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,440
Yeah, you said that.

122
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,000
- Well, I got to close now.
- You live in that house out back?

123
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,000
- Yes, I do.
- You lived here all your life?

124
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,440
Well, this is my wife's
father's place, originally.

125
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,960
You married into it?

126
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,800
We lived in Temple, Texas
for many years.

127
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,640
Raised a family there. In Temple.

128
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,640
- We come out here about four years ago.
- You married into it?

129
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,760
- If that's the way you want to put it.
- Well, I don't have some way to put it.

130
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,480
That's the way it is.

131
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,040
What's the most you ever lost
on a coin toss?

132
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,880
- Sir?
- The most you ever lost on a coin toss?

133
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,400
Oh, I don't know. I couldn't say.

134
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,600
- Call it.
- Call it?

135
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,720
- Yes.
- For what?

136
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,960
Just call it.

137
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,960
Well, we need to know
what we're calling it for here.

138
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,320
You need to call it.
I can't call it for you.

139
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,360
- Or it wouldn't be fair.
- I didn't put nothing up.

140
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,800
Yes, you did. You've been
putting it up your whole life.

141
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,160
You just didn't know it.

142
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,120
- You know what date is on this coin?
- No.

143
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,320
1958. It's been traveling
22 years to get here.

144
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,920
And now it's here.
And it's either heads or tails.

145
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,280
You have to say. Call it.

146
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,680
Well, look,
I need to know what I stand to win.

147
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,440
- Everything.
- How's that?

148
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,000
You stand to win everything. Call it.

149
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,200
All right. Heads, then.

150
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,000
Well done.

151
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,920
- Don't put it in your pocket.
- Sir?

152
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,920
Don't put it in your pocket.
It's your lucky quarter.

153
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,880
Where do you want me to put it?

154
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,000
Anywhere not in your pocket.

155
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,360
Or it'll get mixed in with the others
and become just a coin.

156
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,760
Which it is.

157
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,520
Llewelyn?

158
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,920
What the hell?

159
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,120
- Odessa.
- Why would we go to Odessa?

160
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,480
No, not we. You.
You stay with your mother.

161
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,800
Well, how come?

162
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,960
Look, right now it's midnight Sunday.
Courthouse opens nine hours from now.

163
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,960
Someone's gonna call in the number
on the inspection plate of my truck.

164
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,200
And around 9:30,
they'll show up here.

165
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,720
- How long do we?...
- What point would you quit.

166
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,840
...bothering to look
for your two million dollars?

167
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,040
What am I supposed to tell Mama?

168
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,640
Stand in the door and holler,
"Mama, I'm home!"?

169
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,920
- Llewelyn.
- Come on, pack your things.

170
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,720
Anything you leave,
you ain't gonna see again.

171
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,720
Well, don't fall down apologizing.

172
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,960
Oh, baby, things happen.

173
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,760
Come on, I can't take them back.

174
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,200
Mind riding bitch?

175
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,760
- This his truck?
- Mm-hmm.

176
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,400
Got a screwgie?

177
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,880
- Who cut his tires?
- Mexicans, I guess. Wasn't us.

178
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,680
- That is a dead dog.
- Yes, it is.

179
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,680
- Where's the receiver?
- I've got it.

180
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,480
These are some ripe petunias.

181
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,360
Hold this, please.

182
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,520
Want it?

183
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,040
- Getting anything on this?
- Not a bleep.

184
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,720
All right.

185
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,040
Give me that.

186
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,040
- I thought it was a car afire.
- It is a car afire.

187
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,440
Wendell said there's something
in the back country too.

188
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,480
Step in there.

189
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,400
When's the county gonna start
paying rent on my horse?

190
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,440
- I love you more and more every day.
- That's very nice.

191
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,320
- Be careful.
- Always am.

192
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,040
- Don't get hurt.
- Never do.

193
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,880
Don't hurt no one.

194
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,840
If you say so.

195
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:45,320
- Wouldn't think a car'd burn like that.
- Yes, sir.

196
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,640
We should've brought wienies.

197
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,520
That look like about
a '77 Ford to you, Wendell?

198
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,680
- It could be.
- I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.

199
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,560
- The old boy shot by the highway?
- Yes, sir. His vehicle.

200
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,640
Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car,
killed that man on the highway...

201
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,920
...swapped for his car, now here it is and
he's swapped again for God knows what.

202
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,280
That's very linear, sheriff.

203
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,360
- Age'll flatten a man, Wendell.
- Yes, sir.

204
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,440
- Then there's this other.
- Yeah.

205
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,520
- You ride Winston.
- You sure?

206
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,680
Oh, I'm more than sure. If anything
happens to Loretta's horse out here...

207
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,080
I can tell you, I don't want
to be the party that was aboard.

208
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:32,840
It's the same tire tread coming back as
going. Made about the same time too.

209
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,960
You can see the sipes real clear.

210
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,520
Somebody's pried the inspection plate
off the door on this one.

211
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,200
I know this truck.

212
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,760
Belongs to a feller named Moss.

213
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,520
- Llewelyn Moss?
- That's the boy.

214
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,320
- You figure him for a dope runner?
- I don't know.

215
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,000
- I kindly doubt it.
- O.K. Corral is just yonder.

216
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,640
Oh, hell's bells,
they even shot the dog.

217
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,680
This is just
a deal gone wrong, isn't it?

218
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,840
Yup. Appears to have been
a glitch or two.

219
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,080
- What calibers you got there, sheriff?
- Nine-millimeter.

220
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,160
Couple of. 45 ACPs.

221
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,840
Somebody unloaded on that thing
with a shotgun.

222
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,480
How come the coyotes
ain't been at them?

223
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,560
I don't know.

224
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,960
Supposedly, a coyote
won't eat a Mexican.

225
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,400
These boys appear to be managerial.

226
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,600
I think we're looking at more
than one fracas. Execution here.

227
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,960
Wild West over there.

228
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,160
- It's that Mexican brown dope.
- Oh, these boys is all swole up.

229
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,960
So this was earlier.
Getting set to trade.

230
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,800
Then, whoa, differences, and...

231
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,680
- Might not even a been no money.
- That's possible.

232
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,920
- But you don't believe it?
- No.

233
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,200
Probably I don't.

234
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,720
Well, it's a mess, ain't it, sheriff?

235
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,320
If it ain't,
it'll do till the mess gets here.

236
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,440
Yes, sir?

237
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:12,400
- I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
- Did you go up to his trailer?

238
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,280
- Yes, I did.
- Well, I'd say he's at work.

239
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,160
- Do you want to leave a message?
- Where does he work?

240
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,200
I can't say.

241
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,000
Where does he work?

242
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:27,360
Sir, I ain't at liberty to give out
no information about our residents.

243
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,560
Where does he work?

244
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,520
Did you not hear me?

245
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,560
We can't give out no information.

246
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,760
- Why all the way to Del Rio?
- I'm gonna borrow a car from Roberto.

247
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,600
- You can't afford one?
- I don't want to register it.

248
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,240
- Look, I'll call you in a couple days.
- Promise?

249
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,280
Yes, I do.

250
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:14,120
- I got a bad feeling, Llewelyn.
- I got a good one. Oughta even out.

251
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,480
Listen, you gotta quit
your worrying so much.

252
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,360
- Mama's gonna raise hell.
- Mm-hm.

253
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,320
She's just gonna cuss you up and down.

254
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,040
- Well, you should be used to that.
- I'm used to lots of things.

255
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,960
- I work at Wal-Mart.
- Not anymore, Carla Jean.

256
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,840
You are retired.

257
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,720
- Llewelyn?
- Yes, ma'am?

258
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,200
- You are coming back, ain't you?
- I shall return.

259
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,960
Sheriff's department!

260
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,800
Look at that lock.

261
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,720
- We going in?
- Gun out and up.

262
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,080
- What about yours?
- I'm hiding behind you.

263
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,960
Sheriff's department!

264
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,720
- I believe they done lit a shuck.
- I believe you're right.

265
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,760
- That from the lock?
- Probably must be.

266
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,360
- So when was he here, sheriff?
- I don't know. Oh...

267
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,800
- Now that's aggravating.
- Sheriff?

268
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:48,560
- Still sweating.
- Oh, sheriff! We just missed him!

269
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,680
We gotta circulate this on radio.

270
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,960
All right.

271
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,960
What do we circulate?

272
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,680
Looking for a man
who has recently drunk milk?

273
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:09,680
- Oh, sheriff, that's aggravating.
- I'm ahead of you there.

274
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:15,280
Think this boy Moss has got any notion
of the sorts of sons-of-bitches.

275
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,160
- That are hunting him?
- I don't know. He ought to.

276
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,960
He's seen the same things I've seen and
it certainly made an impression on me.

277
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,200
- Take me to a motel.
- Got one in mind?

278
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,480
Someplace cheap.

279
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,840
- You tell me the option.
- Do what now?

280
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,400
You pick the option
goes with the applicable rate.

281
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,800
I'm just one person,
so it don't matter the size of the bed.

282
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,520
This is Roberto's
Automotive. I'm not in right now.

283
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,240
Please leave a message.

284
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:57,080
- Hello?
- Is Llewelyn there?

285
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,440
Llewelyn? No, he ain't.

286
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,360
You expect him?

287
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,080
Now why would
I expect him? Who is this?

288
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,640
- May I help you?
- Yeah, you got a pair of Larry Mahans?

289
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,000
Shoulder, size 11?

290
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,640
- I'll check.
- You all sell socks?

291
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,040
- Just white.
- Well, white's all I wear. Bathroom?

292
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,120
Don't stop.
Just ride me up past those rooms.

293
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:56,040
- What room?
- Just drive me around.

294
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,320
I wanna see if someone's here.

295
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,440
Keep going. Don't stop.

296
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,360
I don't wanna get into
some kind of a jackpot here.

297
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,280
It's all right.

298
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,880
Why don't I just set you down
right here and we won't argue about it?

299
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,120
- Take me to another motel.
- Let's just call it square.

300
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,200
You're in the jackpot,
and I'm trying to get you out of it.

301
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,240
Take me to another motel.

302
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,640
Lab reports from Austin
on that boy by the highway.

303
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,800
- What was the bullet?
- Wasn't no bullet.

304
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,800
- Wasn't no bullet?
- Yes, sir. Wasn't none.

305
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,600
Well, Wendell, with all due respect,
that don't make a lot of sense.

306
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,760
No, sir.

307
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,760
You said entry wound in the forehead,
no exit wound.

308
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,000
- Yes, sir.
- You telling me he shot this boy.

309
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,320
...and then went digging around
with a knife?

310
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,560
- Sir, I don't wanna picture that.
- I don't either.

311
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,840
Can I freshen that there for you,
sheriff?

312
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,720
Yeah, Maureen, you better had.

313
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,400
Ranger and the DEA
are headed back out to the scene.

314
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,960
Gonna join 'em?

315
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,520
Any new bodies accumulate out there?

316
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,720
- No, sir.
- Well, then I guess I can skip it.

317
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,760
- Twelve-gauge. You need shells?
- Yeah, double-ought.

318
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:18,520
- Yeah, that'll give you a wallop.
- Y'all got camping supplies?

319
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,760
Tent poles. You already have the tent?

320
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,520
Well, something like that.

321
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,320
Give me the model number on the tent,
I can order poles.

322
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,680
- Never mind. I want a tent.
- What kind?

323
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,680
The kind with most poles.

324
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,720
- Could I get another room?
- You wanna change rooms?

325
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,320
No, ma'am, I wanna keep my room
and get another one.

326
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,800
- Another additional?
- Yes, ma'am.

327
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,120
And do you have a map of the rooms?

328
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,760
Well, yeah, we had a sorta one.

329
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,520
Oh, thank you.

330
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,680
How about 38?

331
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,240
Well, you can have the one right next to
yours if you want, 137. It ain't took.

332
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:22,200
- No, 38 will be fine.
- Well, that's got two double beds.

333
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,600
How'd you find that?

334
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,440
You shouldn't be doin' that.

335
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:31,880
Even a young man like you.

336
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:35,480
- Doin' what?
- Hitchhiking.

337
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,640
Dangerous.

338
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,320
You know Anton Chigurh by sight,
is that correct?

339
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,760
Yes, sir, I know him every which way.

340
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:09,120
When did you last see him?

341
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,600
Uh...

342
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,720
...November 28th, last year.

343
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:16,920
Seem pretty sure of the date.
Did I ask you to sit?

344
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:21,640
No, sir, but you struck me as a man
who wouldn't wanna waste a chair.

345
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:26,960
I remember dates, names, numbers.
I saw him November the 28th.

346
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,640
Got a loose cannon here.

347
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,000
We're out a bunch of money,
and the other party is out his product.

348
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:36,840
- Yes, sir.
- This account will give up.

349
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:41,000
$1,200 in any 24-hour period.
That's up from a thousand.

350
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:45,080
If your expenses run higher,
I hope you'll trust us for it.

351
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,160
OK.

352
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:50,840
- Just how well do you know Chigurh?
- What do you wanna know?

353
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:54,640
I just wanna know your opinion of him,
in general.

354
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:59,960
- Just how dangerous is he?
- Compared to what, the bubonic plague?

355
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:02,120
He's bad enough you called me.

356
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:06,520
Yeah, he's a psychopathic killer,
but so what?

357
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,320
There's plenty of them around.

358
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,960
Killed three men
in a Del Rio motel yesterday...

359
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:14,480
...and two others in that
colossal goat-fuck out in the desert.

360
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:17,360
- We can stop that.
- Seem pretty sure of yourself.

361
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:23,720
You've led something of a charmed life,
haven't you, Mr. Wells?

362
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:28,840
In all honesty, I can't say that charm
has had a whole lot to do with it.

363
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,800
- I was wondering...
- Yes?

364
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,720
Could you validate my parking ticket?

365
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:42,120
- An attempt at humor, I suppose?
- I'm sorry.

366
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:51,840
You know, I counted the floors
to this building from the street.

367
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,320
- And?
- There's one missing.

368
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,840
We'll look into it.

369
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,720
One room. One night.

370
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,280
- That'll be $26.
- Alrighty.

371
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,400
You on all night?

372
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:32,560
Yes, sir, I'll be right here
till 10:00 in the morning.

373
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:38,400
This here's for you. Now, I ain't
asking you to do anything illegal.

374
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,400
There's someone
who been looking for me. Not police.

375
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:44,080
You just call me
if anyone else checks in tonight.

376
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,280
And by anyone, I mean any swinging dick.

377
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,080
There just ain't no way.

378
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,360
Don't worry, I ain't gonna hurt you.

379
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,200
I need you
to drive me on outta here.

380
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,800
- Why not?
- I don't know, man.

381
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,520
Were you in a car accident?

382
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,680
I'll give you 500 bucks for that coat.

383
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:30,400
Lemme see the money.

384
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:34,720
Were you in a car accident?

385
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:39,240
- Yeah.
- OK, give me the money.

386
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:43,080
- It's right here. Give me the clothes.
- Let him hold the money.

387
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,040
Give it here.

388
01:03:58,600 --> 01:03:59,680
Gimme that beer too.

389
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:04,040
How much?

390
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,440
Brian, give him the beer.

391
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:18,600
Ah!

392
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:14,600
Medico...

393
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,760
...por favor.

394
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:17,480
Wait up!

395
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:23,080
...and I had a 44 inch waist.
My diet specialist got a hold of me...

396
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:25,240
...and that first week,
I lost seven pounds!

397
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:28,720
Looking back on the diet, it was
relatively easy to lose the weight...

398
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:32,480
...though it did have moments. Sometimes,
it looked as if I gained weight.

399
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:35,840
...instead of lost it.
The most difficult part is still ahead.

400
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:38,160
Keeping weight off
now that we've lost it.

401
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:40,520
It's natural
for you to gain a few pounds.

402
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:44,040
But as soon as you do,
make sure you go on...

403
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:43,080
Here are a few points to remember.
First of all, weigh in every day.

404
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:13,040
Any word on those vehicles yet?

405
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:16,000
Sheriff, I found out
everything there was to find.

406
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:20,480
Those vehicles are titled
and registered to deceased people.

407
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:22,920
The owner of that Bronco's
been dead 20 years.

408
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,160
Want me to find out
about the Mexican ones?

409
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:27,880
No. Lord, no.

410
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:29,920
There's this month's checks.

411
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:33,320
That DEA agent called again.
You don't wanna talk to him?

412
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:36,000
Gonna try to keep from it much as I can.

413
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:38,920
Going back. Wanted to know
if you wanted to go with him.

414
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,200
That's cordial of him.

415
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:43,640
Can I get you to call Loretta...

416
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:46,280
...tell her I'm going to Odessa
to see Carla Jean Moss?

417
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:49,240
- Yes, sheriff.
- I'll call her when I get there.

418
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:51,920
I'd call now, but if she
want me to come home, I might.

419
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,680
Do you want me to wait
till you quit the building?

420
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:58,320
Uh-huh. Don't wanna lie without
what it's absolutely necessary.

421
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:04,160
What is it Torbert says
about truth and justice?

422
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:08,680
Oh, we dedicate ourselves daily anew.
Something like that.

423
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:11,680
I'm gonna commence
dedicating myself twice daily.

424
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:14,440
Might come to three before it's over.

425
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:17,160
What the hell?

426
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:26,920
Sheriff?

427
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:29,440
You looked at your load lately?

428
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:35,280
- That is a damn outrage.
- One of those tie-downs worked loose.

429
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:40,440
- How many bodies did you leave with?
- I ain't lost none of 'em, sheriff.

430
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:42,760
Couldn't y'all have
taken a van out there?

431
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:45,120
We didn't have no van
with four-wheel drive.

432
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:47,760
You gonna write me up
for improperly secured load?

433
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,640
You get your ass outta here.

434
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:55,800
Buenos dias.

435
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:59,320
I'm guessing this isn't the future
you had pictured for yourself.

436
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:01,880
...when you first clapped eyes
on that money.

437
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:04,960
Don't worry.
I'm not the man who's after you.

438
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,120
I know that.

439
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:10,520
I've seen him.

440
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:13,800
You've seen him?
And you're not dead?

441
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:15,920
Huh.

442
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,640
What's this guy supposed to be,
the ultimate badass?

443
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:20,720
Don't think that's how I'd describe him.

444
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,600
How would you describe him?

445
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:26,680
I guess I'd say
he doesn't have a sense of humor.

446
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:29,200
- His name's Chigurh.
- Sugar?

447
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:31,640
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh.

448
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:34,920
- You know how he found you?
- Yeah, I know how he found me.

449
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:38,040
- It's called a transponder.
- I know what it's called.

450
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,680
- He won't find me again.
- Not that way.

451
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:43,480
- Not any way.
- Took me about three hours.

452
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:48,040
- Yeah, well, I been immobile.
- No. You don't understand.

453
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:53,400
- What do you do?
- I'm retired.

454
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:56,120
- What did you do?
- Welder.

455
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:58,360
- Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
- Any of it.

456
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:00,840
- If it can be welded, I can weld it.
- Cast iron?

457
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:02,640
- Yeah.
- I don't mean braze.

458
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:04,560
- I didn't say braze.
- Pot metal?

459
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:06,040
What did I say?

460
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:12,040
- Were you in 'Nam?
- Yeah, I was 'Nam.

461
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,760
So was I.

462
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:18,080
So, what does that make me, your buddy?

463
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:24,600
Look, you gotta give me this money.
I got no other reason to protect you.

464
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:28,200
It's too late. I spent it.

465
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:31,440
A million and a half
on whores and whiskey...

466
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:34,160
...and the rest of it,
I just sorta blew it in.

467
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:38,320
How do you know he's not
on his way to Odessa?

468
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:46,120
- Why would he go to Odessa?
- Kill your wife.

469
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:57,320
Maybe he's the one
that needs to be worried... About me.

470
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:59,000
He isn't.

471
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:02,560
Yeah. You're not cut out for this.

472
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:05,960
You're just a guy
who happened to find those vehicles.

473
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:13,760
I'm across the river at the Hotel Eagle.

474
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:17,120
Carson Wells.

475
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:19,080
Call me when you've had enough.

476
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:22,000
I can even let you keep
a little of the money.

477
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:25,320
If I was into cutting deals,
why wouldn't I deal with Sugar?

478
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:29,640
No, no, you don't understand.
You can't make a deal with him.

479
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:34,320
Even if you gave him the money, he'd
still kill you for inconveniencing him.

480
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:36,520
He's a peculiar man.

481
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:41,440
Might even say he has principles,
principles that transcend money or drugs.

482
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:45,040
...or anything like that. Not like you.

483
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:48,200
Yeah. He's not even like me.

484
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:51,680
No, he don't talk as much as you.
I give him points for that.

485
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,520
Carla Jean, thank you for coming.

486
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,280
Don't know why I did.

487
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:01,160
I told you, I don't know where he is.

488
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:03,440
- You haven't heard from him?
- No, I ain't.

489
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:05,240
- Nothing?
- Not word one.

490
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:09,320
- Would you tell me if you had?
- Well, I don't know.

491
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:14,040
- He don't need any trouble from you.
- It ain't me he's in trouble with.

492
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:17,560
- Who's he in trouble with then?
- Some pretty bad people.

493
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:21,200
These people will kill him, Carla Jean.
They won't quit.

494
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:24,160
He won't neither. He never has.

495
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:28,160
He can take all comers.

496
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:33,120
You know Charlie Walser's
got that place out east of Sanderson?

497
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:38,760
You know how he used to slaughter
beeves, hit 'em right there with a maul...

498
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:40,600
...truss 'em and slit their throats?

499
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:43,720
Charlie's got one all trussed up,
all set to drain him.

500
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:45,960
...and the beef comes to,
thrashing around.

501
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:49,440
Six hundred pounds
of very pissed off livestock.

502
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:52,000
You'll excuse the... Well...

503
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:54,520
Charlie grabs a gun,
shoot the thing in the head...

504
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:57,480
...but with the swinging and thrashing,
it's a glance shot.

505
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:00,080
Ricochets, hits Charlie in the shoulder.

506
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:03,640
You go see Charlie, he still can't
pick up his right hand for his hat.

507
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:07,760
The point being, that even in
the contest between man and steer...

508
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:09,560
...the issue is not certain.

509
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:21,400
When Llewelyn calls,
just tell him I can make him safe.

510
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:29,640
'Course, they slaughter
steers a lot different these days.

511
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:33,600
Use a air gun. Shoots out a little rod
about that far under the brain.

512
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:36,680
Sucks right back in.
Animal never knows what hit him.

513
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:43,160
- Why are you telling me that, sheriff?
- I don't know.

514
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:48,320
My mind wanders.

515
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:10,240
Hello, Carson.

516
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:13,960
Let's go to your room.

517
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:28,280
You don't have to do this.

518
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:32,200
I'm a day trader.
I could just go home.

519
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,840
- You could.
- Make it worth your while...

520
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:40,920
...take you to an ATM.
There's 14 grand in it.

521
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,240
And everybody just walks away.

522
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:46,520
An ATM.

523
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:53,320
I know where the satchel is.

524
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,560
If you knew, you would have it with you.

525
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:59,400
I can find it from the river bank.
I know where it is.

526
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:03,680
- I know something better.
- What's that?

527
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:05,160
Where it's going to be.

528
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:10,120
- Where's that?
- It will be brought to me.

529
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:12,600
...and placed at my feet.

530
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:17,200
You don't know to a certainty.

531
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:21,080
- In 20 minutes it could be here.
- I do know to a certainty.

532
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:23,720
And you know what's
gonna happen now, Carson?

533
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:29,200
You should admit your situation.
There would be more dignity in it.

534
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:36,840
You go to hell.

535
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:40,800
All right.
Let me ask you something.

536
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:47,080
If the rule you followed
brought you to this...

537
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:49,640
...of what use was the rule?

538
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,760
Do you have any idea how crazy you are?

539
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:02,120
You mean the nature
of this conversation?

540
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:04,280
I mean the nature of you.

541
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:14,000
You... You can have the money, Anton.

542
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:54,720
- Hello?
- Yes?

543
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:59,400
Is, uh, Carson Wells there?

544
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:03,960
Not in the sense that you mean.

545
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:09,880
- You need to come see me.
- Who is this?

546
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:12,800
You know who it is.

547
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:15,920
- You need to talk to me.
- I don't need to talk to you.

548
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,240
I think you do.

549
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:19,960
Do you know where I'm going?

550
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:22,520
Why would I care where you're going?

551
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:25,120
I know where you are.

552
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:27,320
Yeah, where am I?

553
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:31,480
You're in the hospital across the river,
but that's not where I'm going.

554
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:34,360
Do you know where I'm going?

555
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:40,000
- Yeah, I know where you're going.
- All right.

556
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:41,560
You know she won't be there.

557
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:44,000
It doesn't make any difference
where she is.

558
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:46,120
So, what're you going up there for?

559
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:52,040
You know how this is gonna turn out,
don't you?

560
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:55,400
Nope.

561
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:59,560
I think you do.
So this is what I'll offer.

562
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:03,000
You bring me the money,
and I'll let her go.

563
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:07,520
Otherwise, she's accountable,
the same as you.

564
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:11,880
That's the best deal you're gonna get.

565
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:15,720
I won't tell you you can save yourself,
because you can't.

566
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:22,120
Yeah, I'm gonna bring you something,
all right.

567
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:24,280
Decided to make you a project of mine.

568
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:26,880
You ain't gonna have
to come look for me at all.

569
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,480
- The motel in Del Rio?
- Yes, sir.

570
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:35,240
None of the three had ID on 'em...

571
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:38,920
...but they're tellin' me that all three
is Mexican... was Mexicans.

572
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:43,680
There's a question,
whether they stopped being and when.

573
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,440
Yes, sir.

574
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:50,000
Wendell, did you inquire
about the lock cylinder?

575
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:52,600
- Yes, sir. It was punched out.
- OK.

576
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:56,280
- Wanna drive out there?
- No, that's all I had to look for...

577
01:22:56,360 --> 01:22:58,760
...it sound like these boys
died of natural causes.

578
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:02,600
- How's that, sheriff?
- Natural to the line of work they in.

579
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:05,440
- Yes, sir.
- My God, Wendell, it's all-out war.

580
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:09,320
I can't think of any other word for it.
Who are these people?

581
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:12,720
Here, last week they found
this couple out in California.

582
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:16,360
They rent out rooms to old people,
kill 'em, bury 'em in the yard...

583
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:18,640
...cash their Social Security checks.

584
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:22,680
Oh, they'd torture 'em first.
I don't know why.

585
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:25,840
Maybe their television set was broke.

586
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:29,160
And this went on until, here, I quote...

587
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:32,960
"Neighbors were alerted
when a man ran from the premises.

588
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,920
...wearing only a dog collar. "

589
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:39,480
You can't make up such
a thing as that. I dare you to try.

590
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:43,080
But that's what it took, you notice,
to get somebody's attention.

591
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:45,800
Digging graves in the backyard
didn't bring any.

592
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:55,800
Well, that's all right.
I laugh myself sometimes.

593
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:59,760
Ain't a whole lot else you can do.

594
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:04,160
Tell me something.

595
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:07,120
Who gets through this gate
into the United States?

596
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:11,240
I don't know. American citizens?

597
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:14,120
Some American citizens.
Who do you think decides?

598
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:16,080
- You do, I reckon.
- That is correct.

599
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:18,360
- How do I decide?
- I don't know.

600
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:22,200
I ask questions. If I get sensible
answers, then they get to go to America.

601
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:23,560
If I don't, they don't.

602
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:25,600
- Anything you don't understand?
- No.

603
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:28,240
I ask again, how you come
to be here with no clothes?

604
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,080
Well, I got an overcoat on.

605
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:34,160
- Are you jacking with me?
- No, sir.

606
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:36,200
- Don't jack with me.
- Yes, sir.

607
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,880
- You in the service?
- No, I'm a veteran.

608
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:41,320
- 'Nam?
- Yes, sir, two tours.

609
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:43,880
- What outfit?
- Twelfth Infantry Battalion...

610
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:47,400
August 7th, 1966, July 2nd, 1968.

611
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:52,840
- Wilson!
- Yes, sir!

612
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:56,320
Get someone to help this man.
He needs to get into town.

613
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:08,240
- How those Larry's holdin' up?
- Good, good.

614
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:10,760
- I need everything else.
- OK.

615
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:14,280
Have a lot of people come
in here without any clothes on?

616
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:16,600
No, sir. It's unusual.

617
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:32,400
- She don't want to talk to you.
- Yes, she does. Put her on.

618
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:34,880
- Do you know what time it is?
- I don't care...

619
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:37,160
...and don't you hang up this phone.

620
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:40,280
Discombobulated
by a no-account son-in-law.

621
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:43,200
- Llewelyn?
- Hey, you.

622
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:46,280
- What should I do?
- You know what's going on?

623
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:49,960
I don't know. I had the sheriff here
from Terrell County. He...

624
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,160
- What'd you tell him?
- What did I know to tell him?

625
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:56,880
You're hurt, ain't you?

626
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:59,120
What makes you say that?

627
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:02,600
- I can hear it in your voice.
- It's falseness in his voice!

628
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:06,120
Look, I want you to meet me at
the Desert Sands Motel in El Paso.

629
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:08,560
I'm gonna give you the money,
put you on a plane.

630
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:10,960
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna
leave you in the lurch.

631
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:14,120
This works better. With you
gone and I don't have the money...

632
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:16,840
...he can't touch me,
but I can sure touch him.

633
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:19,480
And after I find him,
I'll come and join you.

634
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:22,880
Find who?
What am I supposed to do with mother?

635
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:24,760
- She'll be all right.
- All right?

636
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:27,240
Be all right? I got the cancer!

637
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:29,200
Ain't nobody gonna bother her.

638
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:01,920
Hmm.

639
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:03,800
Who are you?

640
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,760
- Me?
- Yes.

641
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:11,920
Nobody.

642
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,640
Accounting.

643
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,360
He gave the Mexicans a receiver.

644
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:21,480
He feels...

645
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:25,040
He felt that the more people looking...

646
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:29,840
That's foolish.
You pick the one right tool.

647
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:31,240
I see.

648
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:35,600
Are you going to shoot me?

649
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,320
That depends.

650
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,120
Do you see me?

651
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:52,640
I always seen this
is what it'd come to.

652
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:56,840
- Three years ago, I pre-visioned it.
- It ain't three years we been married.

653
01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:00,920
Three years ago I said
them very words, "no" and "good. "

654
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:04,480
Here we are, 90 degree heat...

655
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:09,760
I got the cancer and look at this,
not even a home to go to.

656
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:13,120
We're going to El Paso, Texas.

657
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:16,200
You know how may people
I know in El Paso, Texas?

658
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:19,080
- No, ma'am.
- That's how many.

659
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:30,760
- I didn't see my prednisone.
- I put it in, Mama.

660
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:34,440
- Well, I didn't see it.
- Well, I put it in that one.

661
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:38,160
You just set there. I'll get tickets
and a cart for the bags.

662
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:40,320
You need help with the bags, madam?

663
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:44,120
Well, thank God, there is
one gentleman left in west Texas.

664
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:46,840
Yes, thank you.
I am old and I am not well!

665
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:51,400
- Which bus are you taking?
- Going to El Paso, don't ask me why.

666
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:54,280
It's not often you see
a Mexican in a suit.

667
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:56,800
You go to El Paso? I know it.
Where are you staying?

668
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:58,120
Oh...

669
01:28:58,200 --> 01:28:59,880
Carla Jean, how are you?

670
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:03,800
Sheriff, was that a true story
about Charlie Walser?

671
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:06,240
Who's Charlie Walser? Uh! Oh...

672
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:08,320
Um...

673
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,880
True story.
I couldn't swear to every detail...

674
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:14,320
- But it's certainly true it is a story.
- Yeah, right.

675
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:18,080
Sheriff, can you give me
your word on something?

676
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:20,000
Yes, ma'am.

677
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:24,480
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed,
you promise it'll be just you.

678
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:27,600
...who goes and talks with him?
You and nobody else.

679
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:31,440
- Yes, ma'am, I do.
- Llewelyn would never ask for help.

680
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:34,280
He never thinks he needs any.

681
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:38,080
Carla Jean, I will not harm your man.

682
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:41,440
And he needs help,
whether he knows it or not.

683
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
What's the problem there, neighbor?

684
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:56,280
Yep, that'll suck some power, over time.

685
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,640
- You from around here?
- Yeah, Alpine, born and bred.

686
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:05,600
- Here you go.
- What airport would you use?

687
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:09,680
- Well, airport or airstrip?
- Airport.

688
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:13,360
- Well, where you goin'?
- I don't know.

689
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:17,720
Just lightin' out for the territories,
huh? Brother, I been there.

690
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:21,320
Well, there's airstrips.

691
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:23,640
The airport is El Paso.

692
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:25,440
If you want someplace specific...

693
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:29,280
...you might could be better off just
driving to Dallas, not have to connect.

694
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:31,480
You gonna clamp them, buddy?

695
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:34,320
Can you get those chicken crates
out of the bed?

696
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:37,160
What are you talking about?

697
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:56,240
Hey, Mr. Sportin' Goods.

698
01:30:56,320 --> 01:31:00,120
- Hey, yourself.
- You a sport?

699
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:02,480
Yeah, that's me.

700
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:05,240
I got beers in my room.

701
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:09,040
- Oh, uh, I'm... I'm waiting on my wife.
- Oh.

702
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:11,840
That's who you keep
looking out the window for?

703
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:14,400
- Well, half.
- What else then?

704
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:19,120
- Just looking for what's comin'.
- Yeah.

705
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:21,760
But no one ever sees that.

706
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:25,000
Beer! That's what's comin'.

707
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:27,760
I'll bring the ice chest out.
You can stay married.

708
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:30,240
No, ma'am, I know what beer leads to.

709
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,040
Beer leads to more beer.

710
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:20,440
You all right?

711
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:27,280
Call the police.

712
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:35,080
Your local law enforcement.

713
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:38,240
I'm not on their radio.

714
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:40,960
I met his daughter at the...

715
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:29,520
Buy you a cup of coffee
'fore you drive home?

716
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:33,000
- No money in his room there?
- Couple hundred, on his person.

717
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:35,320
Those hombres
would have taken the stash.

718
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:37,840
I suppose so.

719
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:40,000
Though they was leavin' in a hurry.

720
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:45,040
It's all the goddamn money, Ed Tom.
Money and the drugs.

721
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:48,720
It's just goddamn beyond everything.

722
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:52,520
What's it mean? What's it leading to?

723
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:55,520
You know,
if you'd have told me 20 years ago.

724
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:58,600
I'd see children walking
the streets of our Texas towns.

725
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:01,680
...with green hair, bones in their noses...

726
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:04,200
I just flat-out
wouldn't have believed you.

727
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:05,760
Signs and wonders.

728
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:10,240
But I think once you quit hearing "sir"
and "ma'am," the rest is soon to foller.

729
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:11,960
- Oh, it's the tide.
- Yeah.

730
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:15,720
It's the dismal tide.
It is not the one thing.

731
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:17,280
Not the one thing.

732
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:20,120
Yeah, well,
none of that explains your man, though.

733
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:23,200
Well, he's just a goddamn
homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.

734
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:26,480
- I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
- Well, what would you call him?

735
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:29,800
Well, sometimes
I think he's pretty much a ghost.

736
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:31,720
- He's real, all right.
- Oh, yeah?

737
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:35,400
Yeah. All of that over at
the Eagle Hotel? Just beyond everything.

738
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:37,920
Yeah. Got some hard bark on him.

739
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:40,760
Why... Well, that don't hardly say it.

740
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,680
He shoots a desk clerk one day...

741
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:48,040
...walks right back in the next
and shoots a retired Army colonel.

742
01:34:48,120 --> 01:34:49,560
It's hard to believe.

743
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:52,760
Just strolls right back
into a crime scene.

744
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:57,960
Now, who'd do such a thing?
How do you defend against it?

745
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:00,920
Well, good trip, Ed Tom.

746
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,280
Sorry we couldn't help your boy.

747
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:29,800
- In back!
- How'd you know I was here?

748
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:32,840
Who else'd be driving up in your truck?

749
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:34,400
- You heard it?
- How's that?

750
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:38,520
Did you hear my?...
You're having fun with me.

751
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:42,760
What give you that idea?
I seen one of the cats heard it.

752
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:47,440
- How'd you know it was my truck?
- I deduced it when you walked in.

753
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:49,600
How many of them things you got now?

754
01:38:49,640 --> 01:38:52,080
Cats? Oh, I don't know, several.

755
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:55,320
Well, it depends
on what you mean by "got. "

756
01:38:55,400 --> 01:38:59,440
Some of 'em are half wild,
some of 'em are just outlaws.

757
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:05,960
- How you been, Ellis?
- You're looking at it.

758
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:10,440
I got to say, you're looking older.

759
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:12,000
I am older.

760
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:15,440
Got a letter from your wife.

761
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:19,760
She writes me pretty regular,
keeps me up on the family news.

762
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:23,360
- Didn't know there was any.
- Told me you're quittin'.

763
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:29,120
- You want a cup?
- Appreciate it.

764
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:38,080
How fresh is that coffee?

765
01:39:38,120 --> 01:39:43,640
I generally make a fresh pot every week,
even if there's some left over.

766
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:47,720
That man that shot you died in prison?

767
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,160
Angola. Yeah.

768
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:54,920
What'd you done he'd a been released?

769
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:57,760
Oh, I don't know. Nothing.

770
01:39:57,800 --> 01:39:59,360
Wouldn't be no point in it.

771
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:02,600
Kindly surprised to hear you say that.

772
01:40:02,640 --> 01:40:06,240
Well, all the time
you spend trying to get back.

773
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:09,800
...what's been took from you,
more is going out the door.

774
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:12,720
After a while, you have
to try to get a tourniquet on it.

775
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:17,720
Your granddad never asked me
to sign on as a deputy.

776
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:24,280
Loretta tells me you're quittin'.
How come you doing that?

777
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:26,560
I don't know.

778
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:30,720
I feel overmatched.

779
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:37,600
I always figured when I got older...

780
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:42,400
God would... Sort of
come into my life somehow.

781
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:46,280
And He didn't.

782
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,560
And I don't blame Him.

783
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:56,680
If I was Him, I'd have
the same opinion of me that He does.

784
01:40:57,280 --> 01:40:59,000
You don't know what He thinks.

785
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:16,200
I sent Uncle Mac's thumbbuster and badge
over to the Rangers...

786
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:18,800
...put it in their museum.

787
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:22,360
Your daddy ever tell you
how Uncle Mac come to his reward?

788
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:26,800
Gunned down on his own porch
over in Hudspeth County.

789
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:33,640
Seven or eight of 'em come up there,
all wanting this, wanting that.

790
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:36,520
Uncle Mac went back in the house
to get the shotgun.

791
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:40,080
Well, they was ahead of him.

792
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:42,760
Shot him in his doorway.

793
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:45,320
Aunt Ella come out,
tried to stop the bleeding.

794
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:49,160
Uncle Mac all the while
trying to get that shotgun.

795
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:53,480
They just sat there on their horses,
watching him die.

796
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:58,560
After a while, one of 'em said
something in Indian and they turned.

797
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:01,160
Left out.

798
01:42:03,240 --> 01:42:06,560
Uncle Mac knew the score,
even if Aunt Ella didn't.

799
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:09,640
Shot through the left lung.

800
01:42:09,720 --> 01:42:14,080
And that was that... As they say.

801
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:18,440
When'd he die?

802
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:22,920
Nineteen zero and, uh... Nine?

803
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:26,640
No, I mean,
was it right away or in the night or...

804
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:30,240
- When was it?
- I believe it was that night.

805
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:35,160
She buried him the next morning.
Digging in that hard old caliche.

806
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:40,640
What you got ain't nothin' new.

807
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:44,320
This country is hard on people.

808
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:49,920
You can't stop what's coming.

809
01:42:51,680 --> 01:42:53,640
It ain't all waitin' on you.

810
01:42:56,360 --> 01:42:58,160
That's vanity.

811
01:43:56,600 --> 01:43:58,880
I knew this wasn't done with.

812
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:03,400
I ain't got the money.

813
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:09,440
What little I had is long gone
and there's bills aplenty to pay yet.

814
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:15,640
I buried my mother today.
Ain't paid for that neither.

815
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:18,400
I wouldn't worry about it.

816
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:22,400
I need to sit down.

817
01:44:37,080 --> 01:44:39,080
You got no cause to hurt me.

818
01:44:39,160 --> 01:44:42,840
No. But I gave my word.

819
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:47,680
- You gave your word?
- To your husband.

820
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:53,240
That don't make sense.

821
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:56,400
You gave your word
to my husband to kill me?

822
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:59,840
Your husband had
the opportunity to save you.

823
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:02,640
Instead, he used you
to try to save himself.

824
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:09,360
Not like that.

825
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:12,640
Not like you say.

826
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:20,200
You don't have to do this.

827
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:22,440
People always say the same thing.

828
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:25,280
What do they say?

829
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:28,480
They say, "You don't have to do this. "

830
01:45:29,640 --> 01:45:34,480
- You don't.
- OK.

831
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:41,280
This is the best I can do.

832
01:45:42,360 --> 01:45:43,320
Call it.

833
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:51,080
I knowed you was crazy
when I saw you sitting there.

834
01:45:53,400 --> 01:45:55,920
I knowed exactly
what was in store for me.

835
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:00,160
- Call it.
- No.

836
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:02,640
I ain't gonna call it.

837
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:07,240
Call it.

838
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:10,240
The coin don't have no say.

839
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:12,080
It's just you.

840
01:46:14,520 --> 01:46:17,480
Well, I got here
the same way the coin did.

841
01:47:55,880 --> 01:47:58,920
Mister, you got
a bone sticking out of your arm.

842
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,320
I'm all right.
Let me just sit here a minute.

843
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:04,200
There's an ambulance coming.
The man went to call.

844
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:06,440
All right.

845
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:10,200
Are you all right?
You got a bone sticking out your arm.

846
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:13,320
What'll you take for the shirt?

847
01:48:17,680 --> 01:48:20,520
Well, hell, mister,
I'll give you my shirt.

848
01:48:27,240 --> 01:48:30,560
Look at that fucking bone.

849
01:48:30,640 --> 01:48:31,760
Tie this for me.

850
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:34,720
Just tie it, just tie it.

851
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:55,840
Hell, mister.
Look, I don't mind helping someone out.

852
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:58,320
- That's a lot of money.
- Take it.

853
01:48:58,400 --> 01:49:01,400
Take it and... You didn't see me.

854
01:49:01,480 --> 01:49:03,640
I was already gone.

855
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:04,960
Yes, sir.

856
01:49:09,160 --> 01:49:12,560
- Part of that's mine, right?
- You still got your damn shirt.

857
01:49:12,640 --> 01:49:16,840
- Ain't even what it was for.
- Maybe. But I'm still out a shirt.

858
01:49:36,160 --> 01:49:38,680
- Maybe I'll go ridin'.
- OK.

859
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:42,440
- What do you think?
- Well, I can't plan your day.

860
01:49:43,680 --> 01:49:47,040
- I mean, would you care to join me?
- Lord, no, I'm not retired.

861
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:53,240
- Maybe I'll help out here then.
- Uh... Better not.

862
01:49:57,360 --> 01:50:00,560
- How'd you sleep?
- I don't know. Had dreams.

863
01:50:00,640 --> 01:50:04,840
Well, you got time for 'em now.
Anything interesting?

864
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:07,600
They always is to the party concerned.

865
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:12,240
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.

866
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:19,480
All right, then. Two of 'em, both
had my father in 'em. It's peculiar.

867
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:22,400
I'm older now
than he ever was by 20 years.

868
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:26,200
So, in a sense, he's the younger man.

869
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:29,240
Anyway, the first one
I don't remember too well...

870
01:50:29,320 --> 01:50:31,920
...but it was about meeting him in town...

871
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,480
...somewheres,
and he give me some money.

872
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:36,120
I think I lost it.

873
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:42,560
Second one, it was like we
was both back in older times.

874
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:46,560
And I was a-horseback,
going through the mountains of a night.

875
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:49,920
Going through this pass
in the mountains.

876
01:50:49,960 --> 01:50:53,240
It was cold,
and there was snow on the ground.

877
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:55,680
And he rode past me and kept on going...

878
01:50:55,720 --> 01:50:58,400
...never said nothing going by,
just rode on past.

879
01:50:59,960 --> 01:51:03,600
He had his blanket wrapped around him
and his head down.

880
01:51:05,320 --> 01:51:09,160
When he rode past,
I seen he was carrying fire in a horn...

881
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:11,080
...the way people used to do, and I...

882
01:51:11,120 --> 01:51:13,600
I could see the horn
from the light inside of it...

883
01:51:13,680 --> 01:51:15,360
'bout the color of the moon.

884
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:19,040
And, in the dream, I knew that he was...

885
01:51:19,880 --> 01:51:21,600
...going on ahead.

886
01:51:22,160 --> 01:51:26,840
He was fixin' to make a fire somewhere
out there in all that dark and cold.

887
01:51:30,280 --> 01:51:33,160
And I knew that whenever I got there,
he'd be there.

888
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:39,400
And then I woke up.

889
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:45,760
Don't worry, I ain't gonna hurt you.

890
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:47,560
I need you
to drive me on outta here.

891
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,160
- Why not?
- I don't know, man.

892
01:56:11,920 --> 01:56:13,920
Were you in a car accident?

893
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:18,040
I'll give you 500 bucks for that coat.

894
01:56:19,680 --> 01:56:20,760
Lemme see the money.

895
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:25,120
Were you in a car accident?

896
01:56:27,320 --> 01:56:29,640
- Yeah.
- OK, give me the money.

897
01:56:29,680 --> 01:56:33,480
- It's right here. Give me the clothes.
- Let him hold the money.

898
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:41,440
Give it here.

899
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:50,080
Gimme that beer too.

900
01:56:52,840 --> 01:56:54,400
How much?

901
01:56:55,120 --> 01:56:56,840
Brian, give him the beer.

902
01:58:06,200 --> 01:58:09,000
Ah!

903
01:59:03,560 --> 01:59:04,960
Medico...

904
01:59:06,160 --> 01:59:08,120
...por favor.

905
02:01:06,640 --> 02:01:07,880
Wait up!

906
02:01:10,240 --> 02:01:13,480
...and I had a 44 inch waist.
My diet specialist got a hold of me...

907
02:01:13,520 --> 02:01:15,600
...and that first week,
I lost seven pounds!

908
02:01:15,680 --> 02:01:19,080
Looking back on the diet, it was
relatively easy to lose the weight...

909
02:01:19,160 --> 02:01:22,840
...though it did have moments. Sometimes,
it looked as if I gained weight.

910
02:01:22,920 --> 02:01:26,200
...instead of lost it.
The most difficult part is still ahead.

911
02:01:26,280 --> 02:01:28,520
Keeping weight off
now that we've lost it.

912
02:01:28,600 --> 02:01:30,880
It's natural
for you to gain a few pounds.

913
02:01:30,920 --> 02:01:34,400
But as soon as you do,
make sure you go on...

914
02:02:29,360 --> 02:02:33,440
Here are a few points to remember.
First of all, weigh in every day.

915
02:03:01,440 --> 02:03:03,400
Any word on those vehicles yet?

916
02:03:03,480 --> 02:03:06,400
Sheriff, I found out
everything there was to find.

917
02:03:06,440 --> 02:03:10,840
Those vehicles are titled
and registered to deceased people.

918
02:03:10,920 --> 02:03:13,280
The owner of that Bronco's
been dead 20 years.

919
02:03:13,360 --> 02:03:15,520
Want me to find out
about the Mexican ones?

920
02:03:15,560 --> 02:03:18,280
No. Lord, no.

921
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:20,320
There's this month's checks.

922
02:03:20,840 --> 02:03:23,680
That DEA agent called again.
You don't wanna talk to him?

923
02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:26,360
Gonna try to keep from it much as I can.

924
02:03:26,440 --> 02:03:29,280
Going back. Wanted to know
if you wanted to go with him.

925
02:03:29,360 --> 02:03:30,560
That's cordial of him.

926
02:03:32,400 --> 02:03:34,000
Can I get you to call Loretta...

927
02:03:34,080 --> 02:03:36,680
...tell her I'm going to Odessa
to see Carla Jean Moss?

928
02:03:36,720 --> 02:03:39,600
- Yes, sheriff.
- I'll call her when I get there.

929
02:03:39,680 --> 02:03:42,280
I'd call now, but if she
want me to come home, I might.

930
02:03:42,360 --> 02:03:45,040
Do you want me to wait
till you quit the building?

931
02:03:45,120 --> 02:03:48,680
Uh-huh. Don't wanna lie without
what it's absolutely necessary.

932
02:03:52,120 --> 02:03:54,560
What is it Torbert says
about truth and justice?

933
02:03:55,240 --> 02:03:59,040
Oh, we dedicate ourselves daily anew.
Something like that.

934
02:03:59,120 --> 02:04:02,040
I'm gonna commence
dedicating myself twice daily.

935
02:04:02,120 --> 02:04:04,840
Might come to three before it's over.

936
02:04:06,240 --> 02:04:07,520
What the hell?

937
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,320
Sheriff?

938
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:19,800
You looked at your load lately?

939
02:04:21,320 --> 02:04:25,640
- That is a damn outrage.
- One of those tie-downs worked loose.

940
02:04:25,720 --> 02:04:30,800
- How many bodies did you leave with?
- I ain't lost none of 'em, sheriff.

941
02:04:30,880 --> 02:04:33,160
Couldn't y'all have
taken a van out there?

942
02:04:33,200 --> 02:04:35,480
We didn't have no van
with four-wheel drive.

943
02:04:35,560 --> 02:04:38,120
You gonna write me up
for improperly secured load?

944
02:04:38,200 --> 02:04:40,040
You get your ass outta here.

945
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:46,160
Buenos dias.

946
02:04:46,240 --> 02:04:49,680
I'm guessing this isn't the future
you had pictured for yourself.

947
02:04:49,760 --> 02:04:52,240
...when you first clapped eyes
on that money.

948
02:04:52,680 --> 02:04:55,320
Don't worry.
I'm not the man who's after you.

949
02:04:56,680 --> 02:04:58,480
I know that.

950
02:04:59,800 --> 02:05:00,880
I've seen him.

951
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:04,160
You've seen him?
And you're not dead?

952
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:06,280
Huh.

953
02:05:06,360 --> 02:05:09,000
What's this guy supposed to be,
the ultimate badass?

954
02:05:09,080 --> 02:05:11,080
Don't think that's how I'd describe him.

955
02:05:11,160 --> 02:05:12,960
How would you describe him?

956
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:17,040
I guess I'd say
he doesn't have a sense of humor.

957
02:05:17,120 --> 02:05:19,560
- His name's Chigurh.
- Sugar?

958
02:05:19,640 --> 02:05:22,000
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh.

959
02:05:22,080 --> 02:05:25,280
- You know how he found you?
- Yeah, I know how he found me.

960
02:05:25,320 --> 02:05:28,400
- It's called a transponder.
- I know what it's called.

961
02:05:28,480 --> 02:05:31,080
- He won't find me again.
- Not that way.

962
02:05:31,120 --> 02:05:33,840
- Not any way.
- Took me about three hours.

963
02:05:33,920 --> 02:05:38,400
- Yeah, well, I been immobile.
- No. You don't understand.

964
02:05:40,600 --> 02:05:43,760
- What do you do?
- I'm retired.

965
02:05:43,840 --> 02:05:46,480
- What did you do?
- Welder.

966
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:48,720
- Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
- Any of it.

967
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:51,200
- If it can be welded, I can weld it.
- Cast iron?

968
02:05:51,280 --> 02:05:53,000
- Yeah.
- I don't mean braze.

969
02:05:53,080 --> 02:05:54,920
- I didn't say braze.
- Pot metal?

970
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:56,400
What did I say?

971
02:05:57,920 --> 02:06:02,440
- Were you in 'Nam?
- Yeah, I was 'Nam.

972
02:06:04,200 --> 02:06:06,120
So was I.

973
02:06:06,200 --> 02:06:08,440
So, what does that make me, your buddy?

974
02:06:09,960 --> 02:06:14,960
Look, you gotta give me this money.
I got no other reason to protect you.

975
02:06:15,880 --> 02:06:18,600
It's too late. I spent it.

976
02:06:19,560 --> 02:06:21,800
A million and a half
on whores and whiskey...

977
02:06:21,880 --> 02:06:24,520
...and the rest of it,
I just sorta blew it in.

978
02:06:26,320 --> 02:06:28,680
How do you know he's not
on his way to Odessa?

979
02:06:32,720 --> 02:06:36,480
- Why would he go to Odessa?
- Kill your wife.

980
02:06:43,480 --> 02:06:47,720
Maybe he's the one
that needs to be worried... About me.

981
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:49,360
He isn't.

982
02:06:49,440 --> 02:06:52,920
Yeah. You're not cut out for this.

983
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:56,320
You're just a guy
who happened to find those vehicles.

984
02:07:01,960 --> 02:07:04,120
I'm across the river at the Hotel Eagle.

985
02:07:05,120 --> 02:07:07,480
Carson Wells.

986
02:07:07,560 --> 02:07:09,440
Call me when you've had enough.

987
02:07:09,520 --> 02:07:12,360
I can even let you keep
a little of the money.

988
02:07:12,440 --> 02:07:15,720
If I was into cutting deals,
why wouldn't I deal with Sugar?

989
02:07:15,760 --> 02:07:20,040
No, no, you don't understand.
You can't make a deal with him.

990
02:07:20,080 --> 02:07:24,680
Even if you gave him the money, he'd
still kill you for inconveniencing him.

991
02:07:24,760 --> 02:07:26,880
He's a peculiar man.

992
02:07:26,920 --> 02:07:31,840
Might even say he has principles,
principles that transcend money or drugs.

993
02:07:31,880 --> 02:07:35,400
...or anything like that. Not like you.

994
02:07:36,240 --> 02:07:38,560
Yeah. He's not even like me.

995
02:07:38,600 --> 02:07:42,080
No, he don't talk as much as you.
I give him points for that.

996
02:07:44,680 --> 02:07:46,880
Carla Jean, thank you for coming.

997
02:07:46,920 --> 02:07:48,640
Don't know why I did.

998
02:07:48,680 --> 02:07:51,520
I told you, I don't know where he is.

999
02:07:51,560 --> 02:07:53,800
- You haven't heard from him?
- No, I ain't.

1000
02:07:53,880 --> 02:07:55,600
- Nothing?
- Not word one.

1001
02:07:55,680 --> 02:07:59,720
- Would you tell me if you had?
- Well, I don't know.

1002
02:07:59,760 --> 02:08:04,400
- He don't need any trouble from you.
- It ain't me he's in trouble with.

1003
02:08:04,480 --> 02:08:07,920
- Who's he in trouble with then?
- Some pretty bad people.

1004
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:11,560
These people will kill him, Carla Jean.
They won't quit.

1005
02:08:11,640 --> 02:08:14,560
He won't neither. He never has.

1006
02:08:15,240 --> 02:08:18,520
He can take all comers.

1007
02:08:20,040 --> 02:08:23,520
You know Charlie Walser's
got that place out east of Sanderson?

1008
02:08:25,240 --> 02:08:29,120
You know how he used to slaughter
beeves, hit 'em right there with a maul...

1009
02:08:29,200 --> 02:08:30,960
...truss 'em and slit their throats?

1010
02:08:31,040 --> 02:08:34,080
Charlie's got one all trussed up,
all set to drain him.

1011
02:08:34,120 --> 02:08:36,360
...and the beef comes to,
thrashing around.

1012
02:08:37,240 --> 02:08:39,800
Six hundred pounds
of very pissed off livestock.

1013
02:08:39,880 --> 02:08:42,360
You'll excuse the... Well...

1014
02:08:42,440 --> 02:08:44,880
Charlie grabs a gun,
shoot the thing in the head...

1015
02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:47,840
...but with the swinging and thrashing,
it's a glance shot.

1016
02:08:47,920 --> 02:08:50,440
Ricochets, hits Charlie in the shoulder.

1017
02:08:50,520 --> 02:08:54,000
You go see Charlie, he still can't
pick up his right hand for his hat.

1018
02:08:54,080 --> 02:08:58,120
The point being, that even in
the contest between man and steer...

1019
02:08:58,200 --> 02:08:59,920
...the issue is not certain.

1020
02:09:07,280 --> 02:09:11,760
When Llewelyn calls,
just tell him I can make him safe.

1021
02:09:15,440 --> 02:09:20,000
'Course, they slaughter
steers a lot different these days.

1022
02:09:20,040 --> 02:09:24,000
Use a air gun. Shoots out a little rod
about that far under the brain.

1023
02:09:24,040 --> 02:09:27,040
Sucks right back in.
Animal never knows what hit him.

1024
02:09:29,920 --> 02:09:33,520
- Why are you telling me that, sheriff?
- I don't know.

1025
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:38,680
My mind wanders.

1026
02:10:58,480 --> 02:11:00,600
Hello, Carson.

1027
02:11:02,800 --> 02:11:04,320
Let's go to your room.

1028
02:11:16,160 --> 02:11:18,640
You don't have to do this.

1029
02:11:18,720 --> 02:11:22,560
I'm a day trader.
I could just go home.

1030
02:11:24,440 --> 02:11:27,200
- You could.
- Make it worth your while...

1031
02:11:27,240 --> 02:11:31,280
...take you to an ATM.
There's 14 grand in it.

1032
02:11:31,360 --> 02:11:33,600
And everybody just walks away.

1033
02:11:34,880 --> 02:11:36,880
An ATM.

1034
02:11:40,720 --> 02:11:43,680
I know where the satchel is.

1035
02:11:43,760 --> 02:11:45,960
If you knew, you would have it with you.

1036
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:49,760
I can find it from the river bank.
I know where it is.

1037
02:11:51,240 --> 02:11:54,040
- I know something better.
- What's that?

1038
02:11:54,120 --> 02:11:55,520
Where it's going to be.

1039
02:11:57,120 --> 02:12:00,480
- Where's that?
- It will be brought to me.

1040
02:12:00,560 --> 02:12:02,960
...and placed at my feet.

1041
02:12:04,760 --> 02:12:07,560
You don't know to a certainty.

1042
02:12:07,640 --> 02:12:11,440
- In 20 minutes it could be here.
- I do know to a certainty.

1043
02:12:11,520 --> 02:12:14,120
And you know what's
gonna happen now, Carson?

1044
02:12:15,120 --> 02:12:19,560
You should admit your situation.
There would be more dignity in it.

1045
02:12:24,520 --> 02:12:27,240
You go to hell.

1046
02:12:28,040 --> 02:12:31,160
All right.
Let me ask you something.

1047
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:37,480
If the rule you followed
brought you to this...

1048
02:12:37,520 --> 02:12:40,000
...of what use was the rule?

1049
02:12:45,360 --> 02:12:49,120
Do you have any idea how crazy you are?

1050
02:12:50,240 --> 02:12:52,520
You mean the nature
of this conversation?

1051
02:12:52,560 --> 02:12:54,640
I mean the nature of you.

1052
02:12:58,760 --> 02:13:04,360
You... You can have the money, Anton.

1053
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:45,080
- Hello?
- Yes?

1054
02:13:46,680 --> 02:13:49,800
Is, uh, Carson Wells there?

1055
02:13:51,920 --> 02:13:54,320
Not in the sense that you mean.

1056
02:13:56,400 --> 02:14:00,240
- You need to come see me.
- Who is this?

1057
02:14:00,320 --> 02:14:03,200
You know who it is.

1058
02:14:03,240 --> 02:14:06,280
- You need to talk to me.
- I don't need to talk to you.

1059
02:14:06,360 --> 02:14:08,600
I think you do.

1060
02:14:08,680 --> 02:14:10,320
Do you know where I'm going?

1061
02:14:10,400 --> 02:14:12,880
Why would I care where you're going?

1062
02:14:12,960 --> 02:14:15,520
I know where you are.

1063
02:14:15,560 --> 02:14:17,680
Yeah, where am I?

1064
02:14:17,760 --> 02:14:21,840
You're in the hospital across the river,
but that's not where I'm going.

1065
02:14:22,720 --> 02:14:24,720
Do you know where I'm going?

1066
02:14:26,480 --> 02:14:30,360
- Yeah, I know where you're going.
- All right.

1067
02:14:30,440 --> 02:14:31,920
You know she won't be there.

1068
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,360
It doesn't make any difference
where she is.

1069
02:14:34,440 --> 02:14:36,480
So, what're you going up there for?

1070
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,400
You know how this is gonna turn out,
don't you?

1071
02:14:44,320 --> 02:14:45,760
Nope.

1072
02:14:45,840 --> 02:14:49,960
I think you do.
So this is what I'll offer.

1073
02:14:50,920 --> 02:14:53,360
You bring me the money,
and I'll let her go.

1074
02:14:53,440 --> 02:14:57,920
Otherwise, she's accountable,
the same as you.

1075
02:14:59,920 --> 02:15:02,240
That's the best deal you're gonna get.

1076
02:15:02,280 --> 02:15:06,080
I won't tell you you can save yourself,
because you can't.

1077
02:15:09,200 --> 02:15:12,520
Yeah, I'm gonna bring you something,
all right.

1078
02:15:12,560 --> 02:15:14,640
Decided to make you a project of mine.

1079
02:15:14,720 --> 02:15:17,280
You ain't gonna have
to come look for me at all.

1080
02:15:21,400 --> 02:15:23,840
- The motel in Del Rio?
- Yes, sir.

1081
02:15:23,920 --> 02:15:25,640
None of the three had ID on 'em...

1082
02:15:25,680 --> 02:15:29,320
...but they're tellin' me that all three
is Mexican... was Mexicans.

1083
02:15:29,360 --> 02:15:34,040
There's a question,
whether they stopped being and when.

1084
02:15:35,960 --> 02:15:37,800
Yes, sir.

1085
02:15:37,880 --> 02:15:40,360
Wendell, did you inquire
about the lock cylinder?

1086
02:15:40,440 --> 02:15:42,960
- Yes, sir. It was punched out.
- OK.

1087
02:15:43,760 --> 02:15:46,640
- Wanna drive out there?
- No, that's all I had to look for...

1088
02:15:46,720 --> 02:15:49,120
...it sound like these boys
died of natural causes.

1089
02:15:49,200 --> 02:15:53,000
- How's that, sheriff?
- Natural to the line of work they in.

1090
02:15:53,040 --> 02:15:55,800
- Yes, sir.
- My God, Wendell, it's all-out war.

1091
02:15:55,880 --> 02:15:59,680
I can't think of any other word for it.
Who are these people?

1092
02:15:59,760 --> 02:16:03,080
Here, last week they found
this couple out in California.

1093
02:16:03,160 --> 02:16:06,760
They rent out rooms to old people,
kill 'em, bury 'em in the yard...

1094
02:16:06,800 --> 02:16:09,000
...cash their Social Security checks.

1095
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:13,040
Oh, they'd torture 'em first.
I don't know why.

1096
02:16:14,160 --> 02:16:16,200
Maybe their television set was broke.

1097
02:16:16,280 --> 02:16:19,520
And this went on until, here, I quote...

1098
02:16:19,560 --> 02:16:23,320
"Neighbors were alerted
when a man ran from the premises.

1099
02:16:23,400 --> 02:16:25,280
...wearing only a dog collar. "

1100
02:16:26,960 --> 02:16:29,840
You can't make up such
a thing as that. I dare you to try.

1101
02:16:29,920 --> 02:16:33,480
But that's what it took, you notice,
to get somebody's attention.

1102
02:16:33,520 --> 02:16:36,160
Digging graves in the backyard
didn't bring any.

1103
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:46,160
Well, that's all right.
I laugh myself sometimes.

1104
02:16:48,200 --> 02:16:50,120
Ain't a whole lot else you can do.

1105
02:16:52,640 --> 02:16:54,560
Tell me something.

1106
02:16:54,600 --> 02:16:57,480
Who gets through this gate
into the United States?

1107
02:16:59,200 --> 02:17:01,600
I don't know. American citizens?

1108
02:17:01,680 --> 02:17:04,480
Some American citizens.
Who do you think decides?

1109
02:17:04,520 --> 02:17:06,440
- You do, I reckon.
- That is correct.

1110
02:17:06,520 --> 02:17:08,720
- How do I decide?
- I don't know.

1111
02:17:08,800 --> 02:17:12,560
I ask questions. If I get sensible
answers, then they get to go to America.

1112
02:17:12,640 --> 02:17:13,960
If I don't, they don't.

1113
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
- Anything you don't understand?
- No.

1114
02:17:16,040 --> 02:17:18,600
I ask again, how you come
to be here with no clothes?

1115
02:17:19,960 --> 02:17:21,440
Well, I got an overcoat on.

1116
02:17:22,680 --> 02:17:24,520
- Are you jacking with me?
- No, sir.

1117
02:17:24,600 --> 02:17:26,560
- Don't jack with me.
- Yes, sir.

1118
02:17:27,160 --> 02:17:29,280
- You in the service?
- No, I'm a veteran.

1119
02:17:29,320 --> 02:17:31,720
- 'Nam?
- Yes, sir, two tours.

1120
02:17:31,760 --> 02:17:34,240
- What outfit?
- Twelfth Infantry Battalion...

1121
02:17:34,320 --> 02:17:37,760
August 7th, 1966, July 2nd, 1968.

1122
02:17:40,360 --> 02:17:43,200
- Wilson!
- Yes, sir!

1123
02:17:43,240 --> 02:17:46,680
Get someone to help this man.
He needs to get into town.

1124
02:17:55,320 --> 02:17:58,600
- How those Larry's holdin' up?
- Good, good.

1125
02:17:58,680 --> 02:18:01,120
- I need everything else.
- OK.

1126
02:18:01,680 --> 02:18:04,640
Have a lot of people come
in here without any clothes on?

1127
02:18:04,720 --> 02:18:06,960
No, sir. It's unusual.

1128
02:18:19,400 --> 02:18:22,760
- She don't want to talk to you.
- Yes, she does. Put her on.

1129
02:18:22,840 --> 02:18:25,280
- Do you know what time it is?
- I don't care...

1130
02:18:25,320 --> 02:18:27,560
...and don't you hang up this phone.

1131
02:18:27,600 --> 02:18:30,640
Discombobulated
by a no-account son-in-law.

1132
02:18:31,760 --> 02:18:33,560
- Llewelyn?
- Hey, you.

1133
02:18:33,640 --> 02:18:36,680
- What should I do?
- You know what's going on?

1134
02:18:36,720 --> 02:18:40,320
I don't know. I had the sheriff here
from Terrell County. He...

1135
02:18:40,360 --> 02:18:43,560
- What'd you tell him?
- What did I know to tell him?

1136
02:18:44,200 --> 02:18:47,240
You're hurt, ain't you?

1137
02:18:47,320 --> 02:18:49,480
What makes you say that?

1138
02:18:49,560 --> 02:18:52,960
- I can hear it in your voice.
- It's falseness in his voice!

1139
02:18:53,040 --> 02:18:56,480
Look, I want you to meet me at
the Desert Sands Motel in El Paso.

1140
02:18:56,560 --> 02:18:58,920
I'm gonna give you the money,
put you on a plane.

1141
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,320
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna
leave you in the lurch.

1142
02:19:01,400 --> 02:19:04,480
This works better. With you
gone and I don't have the money...

1143
02:19:04,520 --> 02:19:07,240
...he can't touch me,
but I can sure touch him.

1144
02:19:07,280 --> 02:19:09,840
And after I find him,
I'll come and join you.

1145
02:19:09,920 --> 02:19:13,240
Find who?
What am I supposed to do with mother?

1146
02:19:13,320 --> 02:19:15,120
- She'll be all right.
- All right?

1147
02:19:15,200 --> 02:19:17,600
Be all right? I got the cancer!

1148
02:19:17,680 --> 02:19:19,560
Ain't nobody gonna bother her.

1149
02:19:49,920 --> 02:19:52,280
Hmm.

1150
02:19:52,720 --> 02:19:54,160
Who are you?

1151
02:19:58,360 --> 02:20:00,120
- Me?
- Yes.

1152
02:20:00,200 --> 02:20:02,280
Nobody.

1153
02:20:02,360 --> 02:20:04,000
Accounting.

1154
02:20:05,360 --> 02:20:07,720
He gave the Mexicans a receiver.

1155
02:20:09,960 --> 02:20:11,880
He feels...

1156
02:20:11,920 --> 02:20:15,400
He felt that the more people looking...

1157
02:20:15,480 --> 02:20:20,200
That's foolish.
You pick the one right tool.

1158
02:20:20,280 --> 02:20:21,640
I see.

1159
02:20:24,400 --> 02:20:25,960
Are you going to shoot me?

1160
02:20:31,960 --> 02:20:33,680
That depends.

1161
02:20:35,960 --> 02:20:37,480
Do you see me?

1162
02:20:40,520 --> 02:20:43,000
I always seen this
is what it'd come to.

1163
02:20:43,080 --> 02:20:47,200
- Three years ago, I pre-visioned it.
- It ain't three years we been married.

1164
02:20:47,240 --> 02:20:51,280
Three years ago I said
them very words, "no" and "good. "

1165
02:20:51,360 --> 02:20:54,880
Here we are, 90 degree heat...

1166
02:20:54,920 --> 02:21:00,120
I got the cancer and look at this,
not even a home to go to.

1167
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:03,480
We're going to El Paso, Texas.

1168
02:21:03,560 --> 02:21:06,600
You know how may people
I know in El Paso, Texas?

1169
02:21:06,640 --> 02:21:09,480
- No, ma'am.
- That's how many.

1170
02:21:18,040 --> 02:21:21,160
- I didn't see my prednisone.
- I put it in, Mama.

1171
02:21:21,200 --> 02:21:24,800
- Well, I didn't see it.
- Well, I put it in that one.

1172
02:21:24,840 --> 02:21:28,520
You just set there. I'll get tickets
and a cart for the bags.

1173
02:21:28,600 --> 02:21:30,680
You need help with the bags, madam?

1174
02:21:30,760 --> 02:21:34,480
Well, thank God, there is
one gentleman left in west Texas.

1175
02:21:34,560 --> 02:21:37,200
Yes, thank you.
I am old and I am not well!

1176
02:21:37,280 --> 02:21:41,800
- Which bus are you taking?
- Going to El Paso, don't ask me why.

1177
02:21:41,840 --> 02:21:44,680
It's not often you see
a Mexican in a suit.

1178
02:21:44,720 --> 02:21:47,200
You go to El Paso? I know it.
Where are you staying?

1179
02:21:47,240 --> 02:21:48,520
Oh...

1180
02:21:48,560 --> 02:21:50,280
Carla Jean, how are you?

1181
02:21:50,320 --> 02:21:54,160
Sheriff, was that a true story
about Charlie Walser?

1182
02:21:54,240 --> 02:21:56,640
Who's Charlie Walser? Uh! Oh...

1183
02:21:56,680 --> 02:21:58,720
Um...

1184
02:21:58,760 --> 02:22:01,240
True story.
I couldn't swear to every detail...

1185
02:22:01,320 --> 02:22:04,680
- But it's certainly true it is a story.
- Yeah, right.

1186
02:22:04,760 --> 02:22:08,440
Sheriff, can you give me
your word on something?

1187
02:22:08,520 --> 02:22:10,360
Yes, ma'am.

1188
02:22:10,440 --> 02:22:14,880
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed,
you promise it'll be just you.

1189
02:22:14,920 --> 02:22:17,960
...who goes and talks with him?
You and nobody else.

1190
02:22:18,040 --> 02:22:21,800
- Yes, ma'am, I do.
- Llewelyn would never ask for help.

1191
02:22:21,880 --> 02:22:24,640
He never thinks he needs any.

1192
02:22:24,680 --> 02:22:28,440
Carla Jean, I will not harm your man.

1193
02:22:28,520 --> 02:22:31,800
And he needs help,
whether he knows it or not.

1194
02:22:40,360 --> 02:22:42,400
What's the problem there, neighbor?

1195
02:22:42,440 --> 02:22:46,640
Yep, that'll suck some power, over time.

1196
02:22:48,360 --> 02:22:52,000
- You from around here?
- Yeah, Alpine, born and bred.

1197
02:22:52,040 --> 02:22:55,960
- Here you go.
- What airport would you use?

1198
02:22:56,040 --> 02:23:00,040
- Well, airport or airstrip?
- Airport.

1199
02:23:00,120 --> 02:23:03,720
- Well, where you goin'?
- I don't know.

1200
02:23:03,800 --> 02:23:08,080
Just lightin' out for the territories,
huh? Brother, I been there.

1201
02:23:08,600 --> 02:23:11,720
Well, there's airstrips.

1202
02:23:11,760 --> 02:23:14,000
The airport is El Paso.

1203
02:23:14,080 --> 02:23:15,800
If you want someplace specific...

1204
02:23:15,880 --> 02:23:19,680
...you might could be better off just
driving to Dallas, not have to connect.

1205
02:23:19,720 --> 02:23:21,840
You gonna clamp them, buddy?

1206
02:23:21,920 --> 02:23:24,680
Can you get those chicken crates
out of the bed?

1207
02:23:24,760 --> 02:23:27,520
What are you talking about?

1208
02:23:42,760 --> 02:23:46,600
Hey, Mr. Sportin' Goods.

1209
02:23:46,680 --> 02:23:50,480
- Hey, yourself.
- You a sport?

1210
02:23:50,560 --> 02:23:52,840
Yeah, that's me.

1211
02:23:52,920 --> 02:23:55,600
I got beers in my room.

1212
02:23:55,680 --> 02:23:59,400
- Oh, uh, I'm... I'm waiting on my wife.
- Oh.

1213
02:23:59,480 --> 02:24:02,200
That's who you keep
looking out the window for?

1214
02:24:02,280 --> 02:24:04,800
- Well, half.
- What else then?

1215
02:24:04,840 --> 02:24:09,480
- Just looking for what's comin'.
- Yeah.

1216
02:24:09,560 --> 02:24:12,160
But no one ever sees that.

1217
02:24:12,200 --> 02:24:15,400
Beer! That's what's comin'.

1218
02:24:15,440 --> 02:24:18,120
I'll bring the ice chest out.
You can stay married.

1219
02:24:18,200 --> 02:24:20,600
No, ma'am, I know what beer leads to.

1220
02:24:22,360 --> 02:24:24,400
Beer leads to more beer.

1221
02:25:09,400 --> 02:25:10,800
You all right?

1222
02:25:15,880 --> 02:25:17,640
Call the police.

1223
02:25:23,240 --> 02:25:25,440
Your local law enforcement.

1224
02:25:26,720 --> 02:25:28,640
I'm not on their radio.

1225
02:25:28,680 --> 02:25:31,320
I met his daughter at the...

1226
02:26:16,840 --> 02:26:19,880
Buy you a cup of coffee
'fore you drive home?

1227
02:26:19,960 --> 02:26:23,360
- No money in his room there?
- Couple hundred, on his person.

1228
02:26:23,440 --> 02:26:25,680
Those hombres
would have taken the stash.

1229
02:26:25,760 --> 02:26:28,200
I suppose so.

1230
02:26:28,280 --> 02:26:30,360
Though they was leavin' in a hurry.

1231
02:26:30,440 --> 02:26:35,400
It's all the goddamn money, Ed Tom.
Money and the drugs.

1232
02:26:36,520 --> 02:26:39,080
It's just goddamn beyond everything.

1233
02:26:39,800 --> 02:26:42,920
What's it mean? What's it leading to?

1234
02:26:42,960 --> 02:26:45,920
You know,
if you'd have told me 20 years ago.

1235
02:26:45,960 --> 02:26:48,960
I'd see children walking
the streets of our Texas towns.

1236
02:26:49,040 --> 02:26:52,040
...with green hair, bones in their noses...

1237
02:26:52,120 --> 02:26:54,560
I just flat-out
wouldn't have believed you.

1238
02:26:54,640 --> 02:26:56,160
Signs and wonders.

1239
02:26:56,200 --> 02:27:00,600
But I think once you quit hearing "sir"
and "ma'am," the rest is soon to foller.

1240
02:27:00,680 --> 02:27:02,320
- Oh, it's the tide.
- Yeah.

1241
02:27:02,400 --> 02:27:06,080
It's the dismal tide.
It is not the one thing.

1242
02:27:06,120 --> 02:27:07,680
Not the one thing.

1243
02:27:07,720 --> 02:27:10,480
Yeah, well,
none of that explains your man, though.

1244
02:27:10,560 --> 02:27:13,560
Well, he's just a goddamn
homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.

1245
02:27:13,640 --> 02:27:16,840
- I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
- Well, what would you call him?

1246
02:27:16,920 --> 02:27:20,160
Well, sometimes
I think he's pretty much a ghost.

1247
02:27:20,200 --> 02:27:22,080
- He's real, all right.
- Oh, yeah?

1248
02:27:22,120 --> 02:27:25,760
Yeah. All of that over at
the Eagle Hotel? Just beyond everything.

1249
02:27:25,800 --> 02:27:28,280
Yeah. Got some hard bark on him.

1250
02:27:28,360 --> 02:27:31,120
Why... Well, that don't hardly say it.

1251
02:27:32,280 --> 02:27:34,040
He shoots a desk clerk one day...

1252
02:27:34,120 --> 02:27:38,400
...walks right back in the next
and shoots a retired Army colonel.

1253
02:27:38,480 --> 02:27:39,920
It's hard to believe.

1254
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:43,120
Just strolls right back
into a crime scene.

1255
02:27:43,200 --> 02:27:48,360
Now, who'd do such a thing?
How do you defend against it?

1256
02:27:48,400 --> 02:27:51,280
Well, good trip, Ed Tom.

1257
02:27:51,360 --> 02:27:53,640
Sorry we couldn't help your boy.

1258
02:31:17,080 --> 02:31:20,200
- In back!
- How'd you know I was here?

1259
02:31:20,240 --> 02:31:23,200
Who else'd be driving up in your truck?

1260
02:31:23,280 --> 02:31:24,800
- You heard it?
- How's that?

1261
02:31:24,840 --> 02:31:28,880
Did you hear my?...
You're having fun with me.

1262
02:31:28,960 --> 02:31:33,160
What give you that idea?
I seen one of the cats heard it.

1263
02:31:33,200 --> 02:31:37,800
- How'd you know it was my truck?
- I deduced it when you walked in.

1264
02:31:37,880 --> 02:31:39,960
How many of them things you got now?

1265
02:31:40,040 --> 02:31:42,440
Cats? Oh, I don't know, several.

1266
02:31:42,520 --> 02:31:45,680
Well, it depends
on what you mean by "got. "

1267
02:31:45,760 --> 02:31:49,800
Some of 'em are half wild,
some of 'em are just outlaws.

1268
02:31:52,760 --> 02:31:56,360
- How you been, Ellis?
- You're looking at it.

1269
02:31:57,640 --> 02:32:00,840
I got to say, you're looking older.

1270
02:32:00,880 --> 02:32:02,360
I am older.

1271
02:32:03,440 --> 02:32:05,800
Got a letter from your wife.

1272
02:32:05,880 --> 02:32:10,120
She writes me pretty regular,
keeps me up on the family news.

1273
02:32:10,200 --> 02:32:13,760
- Didn't know there was any.
- Told me you're quittin'.

1274
02:32:16,680 --> 02:32:19,480
- You want a cup?
- Appreciate it.

1275
02:32:26,680 --> 02:32:28,440
How fresh is that coffee?

1276
02:32:28,520 --> 02:32:34,000
I generally make a fresh pot every week,
even if there's some left over.

1277
02:32:35,880 --> 02:32:38,120
That man that shot you died in prison?

1278
02:32:40,360 --> 02:32:42,520
Angola. Yeah.

1279
02:32:42,600 --> 02:32:45,280
What'd you done he'd a been released?

1280
02:32:45,320 --> 02:32:48,120
Oh, I don't know. Nothing.

1281
02:32:48,200 --> 02:32:49,760
Wouldn't be no point in it.

1282
02:32:49,800 --> 02:32:52,960
Kindly surprised to hear you say that.

1283
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:56,600
Well, all the time
you spend trying to get back.

1284
02:32:56,680 --> 02:33:00,160
...what's been took from you,
more is going out the door.

1285
02:33:00,240 --> 02:33:03,080
After a while, you have
to try to get a tourniquet on it.

1286
02:33:04,120 --> 02:33:08,080
Your granddad never asked me
to sign on as a deputy.

1287
02:33:10,760 --> 02:33:14,640
Loretta tells me you're quittin'.
How come you doing that?

1288
02:33:14,720 --> 02:33:16,920
I don't know.

1289
02:33:19,520 --> 02:33:21,120
I feel overmatched.

1290
02:33:25,480 --> 02:33:28,000
I always figured when I got older...

1291
02:33:28,040 --> 02:33:32,760
God would... Sort of
come into my life somehow.

1292
02:33:35,640 --> 02:33:36,640
And He didn't.

1293
02:33:40,360 --> 02:33:41,920
And I don't blame Him.

1294
02:33:44,200 --> 02:33:47,040
If I was Him, I'd have
the same opinion of me that He does.

1295
02:33:47,640 --> 02:33:49,360
You don't know what He thinks.

1296
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:06,600
I sent Uncle Mac's thumbbuster and badge
over to the Rangers...

1297
02:34:06,640 --> 02:34:09,160
...put it in their museum.

1298
02:34:09,240 --> 02:34:12,720
Your daddy ever tell you
how Uncle Mac come to his reward?

1299
02:34:13,760 --> 02:34:17,160
Gunned down on his own porch
over in Hudspeth County.

1300
02:34:19,320 --> 02:34:24,000
Seven or eight of 'em come up there,
all wanting this, wanting that.

1301
02:34:24,040 --> 02:34:26,920
Uncle Mac went back in the house
to get the shotgun.

1302
02:34:26,960 --> 02:34:30,440
Well, they was ahead of him.

1303
02:34:30,520 --> 02:34:33,120
Shot him in his doorway.

1304
02:34:33,200 --> 02:34:35,680
Aunt Ella come out,
tried to stop the bleeding.

1305
02:34:35,760 --> 02:34:39,560
Uncle Mac all the while
trying to get that shotgun.

1306
02:34:39,600 --> 02:34:43,880
They just sat there on their horses,
watching him die.

1307
02:34:44,920 --> 02:34:48,920
After a while, one of 'em said
something in Indian and they turned.

1308
02:34:49,800 --> 02:34:51,520
Left out.

1309
02:34:53,600 --> 02:34:56,960
Uncle Mac knew the score,
even if Aunt Ella didn't.

1310
02:34:57,000 --> 02:35:00,000
Shot through the left lung.

1311
02:35:00,080 --> 02:35:04,440
And that was that... As they say.

1312
02:35:07,560 --> 02:35:08,840
When'd he die?

1313
02:35:10,040 --> 02:35:13,280
Nineteen zero and, uh... Nine?

1314
02:35:13,320 --> 02:35:17,000
No, I mean,
was it right away or in the night or...

1315
02:35:17,080 --> 02:35:20,640
- When was it?
- I believe it was that night.

1316
02:35:20,680 --> 02:35:25,520
She buried him the next morning.
Digging in that hard old caliche.

1317
02:35:28,360 --> 02:35:31,000
What you got ain't nothin' new.

1318
02:35:32,080 --> 02:35:34,680
This country is hard on people.

1319
02:35:38,280 --> 02:35:40,320
You can't stop what's coming.

1320
02:35:42,040 --> 02:35:44,000
It ain't all waitin' on you.

1321
02:35:46,760 --> 02:35:48,520
That's vanity.

1322
02:36:46,960 --> 02:36:49,240
I knew this wasn't done with.

1323
02:36:51,960 --> 02:36:53,800
I ain't got the money.

1324
02:36:55,720 --> 02:36:59,800
What little I had is long gone
and there's bills aplenty to pay yet.

1325
02:37:01,640 --> 02:37:06,000
I buried my mother today.
Ain't paid for that neither.

1326
02:37:06,960 --> 02:37:08,760
I wouldn't worry about it.

1327
02:37:11,280 --> 02:37:12,800
I need to sit down.

1328
02:37:27,440 --> 02:37:29,440
You got no cause to hurt me.

1329
02:37:29,520 --> 02:37:33,200
No. But I gave my word.

1330
02:37:34,600 --> 02:37:38,080
- You gave your word?
- To your husband.

1331
02:37:40,960 --> 02:37:43,600
That don't make sense.

1332
02:37:43,680 --> 02:37:46,760
You gave your word
to my husband to kill me?

1333
02:37:46,840 --> 02:37:50,200
Your husband had
the opportunity to save you.

1334
02:37:50,280 --> 02:37:53,000
Instead, he used you
to try to save himself.

1335
02:37:57,800 --> 02:37:59,720
Not like that.

1336
02:38:01,240 --> 02:38:03,000
Not like you say.

1337
02:38:08,840 --> 02:38:10,560
You don't have to do this.

1338
02:38:10,600 --> 02:38:12,800
People always say the same thing.

1339
02:38:14,440 --> 02:38:15,680
What do they say?

1340
02:38:16,720 --> 02:38:18,880
They say, "You don't have to do this. "

1341
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:24,840
- You don't.
- OK.

1342
02:38:29,760 --> 02:38:31,680
This is the best I can do.

1343
02:38:32,720 --> 02:38:33,680
Call it.

1344
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:41,440
I knowed you was crazy
when I saw you sitting there.

1345
02:38:43,760 --> 02:38:46,280
I knowed exactly
what was in store for me.

1346
02:38:46,360 --> 02:38:50,520
- Call it.
- No.

1347
02:38:50,600 --> 02:38:53,000
I ain't gonna call it.

1348
02:38:56,240 --> 02:38:57,600
Call it.

1349
02:38:57,640 --> 02:39:00,600
The coin don't have no say.

1350
02:39:00,680 --> 02:39:02,440
It's just you.

1351
02:39:04,880 --> 02:39:07,840
Well, I got here
the same way the coin did.

1352
02:40:46,280 --> 02:40:49,280
Mister, you got
a bone sticking out of your arm.

1353
02:40:49,360 --> 02:40:51,680
I'm all right.
Let me just sit here a minute.

1354
02:40:51,720 --> 02:40:54,560
There's an ambulance coming.
The man went to call.

1355
02:40:54,600 --> 02:40:56,840
All right.

1356
02:40:56,880 --> 02:41:00,560
Are you all right?
You got a bone sticking out your arm.

1357
02:41:01,800 --> 02:41:03,680
What'll you take for the shirt?

1358
02:41:08,040 --> 02:41:10,920
Well, hell, mister,
I'll give you my shirt.

1359
02:41:17,640 --> 02:41:20,960
Look at that fucking bone.

1360
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:22,120
Tie this for me.

1361
02:41:23,200 --> 02:41:25,080
Just tie it, just tie it.

1362
02:41:42,360 --> 02:41:46,240
Hell, mister.
Look, I don't mind helping someone out.

1363
02:41:46,280 --> 02:41:48,680
- That's a lot of money.
- Take it.

1364
02:41:48,760 --> 02:41:51,760
Take it and... You didn't see me.

1365
02:41:51,840 --> 02:41:54,000
I was already gone.

1366
02:41:54,080 --> 02:41:55,320
Yes, sir.

1367
02:41:59,560 --> 02:42:02,920
- Part of that's mine, right?
- You still got your damn shirt.

1368
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:07,240
- Ain't even what it was for.
- Maybe. But I'm still out a shirt.

1369
02:42:26,520 --> 02:42:29,040
- Maybe I'll go ridin'.
- OK.

1370
02:42:29,120 --> 02:42:32,840
- What do you think?
- Well, I can't plan your day.

1371
02:42:34,040 --> 02:42:37,440
- I mean, would you care to join me?
- Lord, no, I'm not retired.

1372
02:42:39,400 --> 02:42:43,600
- Maybe I'll help out here then.
- Uh... Better not.

1373
02:42:47,720 --> 02:42:50,920
- How'd you sleep?
- I don't know. Had dreams.

1374
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:55,200
Well, you got time for 'em now.
Anything interesting?

1375
02:42:55,240 --> 02:42:57,960
They always is to the party concerned.

1376
02:43:00,120 --> 02:43:02,600
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.

1377
02:43:04,960 --> 02:43:09,840
All right, then. Two of 'em, both
had my father in 'em. It's peculiar.

1378
02:43:09,920 --> 02:43:12,800
I'm older now
than he ever was by 20 years.

1379
02:43:12,840 --> 02:43:16,560
So, in a sense, he's the younger man.

1380
02:43:16,640 --> 02:43:19,600
Anyway, the first one
I don't remember too well...

1381
02:43:19,680 --> 02:43:22,280
...but it was about meeting him in town...

1382
02:43:22,360 --> 02:43:24,840
...somewheres,
and he give me some money.

1383
02:43:24,920 --> 02:43:26,480
I think I lost it.

1384
02:43:28,200 --> 02:43:32,920
Second one, it was like we
was both back in older times.

1385
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:36,920
And I was a-horseback,
going through the mountains of a night.

1386
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:40,280
Going through this pass
in the mountains.

1387
02:43:40,360 --> 02:43:43,600
It was cold,
and there was snow on the ground.

1388
02:43:43,680 --> 02:43:46,040
And he rode past me and kept on going...

1389
02:43:46,120 --> 02:43:48,760
...never said nothing going by,
just rode on past.

1390
02:43:50,320 --> 02:43:53,960
He had his blanket wrapped around him
and his head down.

1391
02:43:55,720 --> 02:43:59,520
When he rode past,
I seen he was carrying fire in a horn...

1392
02:43:59,600 --> 02:44:01,440
...the way people used to do, and I...

1393
02:44:01,480 --> 02:44:04,000
I could see the horn
from the light inside of it...

1394
02:44:04,040 --> 02:44:05,720
'bout the color of the moon.

1395
02:44:07,160 --> 02:44:09,400
And, in the dream, I knew that he was...

1396
02:44:10,240 --> 02:44:11,960
...going on ahead.

1397
02:44:12,520 --> 02:44:17,200
He was fixin' to make a fire somewhere
out there in all that dark and cold.

1398
02:44:20,680 --> 02:44:23,520
And I knew that whenever I got there,
he'd be there.

1399
02:44:27,880 --> 02:44:29,800
And then I woke up.
