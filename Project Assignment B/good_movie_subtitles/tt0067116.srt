Merry Christmas!

11
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,052
- What's your name, little boy?
- Eric.

12
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:43,472
Eric. What do you want for Christmas, Eric?

13
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:47,184
Johnny Lightning 500.

14
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,811
- Have you been a good little boy?
- Yes.

15
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,980
Have you? Good.
Do you like Santa Claus?

16
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:56,610
Oh, now, you like Santa Claus, right?

17
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,285
All right, let's sing a little song.
"Jingle Bells."

18
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,496
♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells ♪

19
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,998

20

♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride ♪

21
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,131
Right on. Right on.

22
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,311
Get out of here. Get up.

23
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,730
Get up! Hold 'em up.

24
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,485
Don't move.

25
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:49,538
- Hold it! Freeze!
- Jimmy, watch it. He's got a knife.

26
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,040
Cloudy-Cloudy, watch him.

27
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,376
Aaah! Son of a...

28
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,352
Son of a bitch.

29
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,577
Hold it, you son of a bitch!

30
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,455
No! No! No!

31
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,712
That's enough. Don't kill him.
That's enough!

32
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,134
- Come on.
- Get up!

33
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,136
- Come on now.
- Give me a break!

34
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,889
- Please.
- Holy shit.

35
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,224
- I ain't done nothin', man.
- Break your ass!

36
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,226
Come on. Hey.

37
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,312
- Come on.
- Get up!

38
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,482
Stop it!

39
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,068
- Let me at him, goddamn you!
- Jimmy!

40
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,944
- Fuck you.
- Will you stop it?

41
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,946
I'm gonna bust you.
Get over here. Come on.

42
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,115
- Jimmy.
- Come on, let me...

43
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,326
Let me bust him.
I wanna bust him.

44
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,370
- I wanna bust him.
- Don't...

45
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,205
- Let me talk to him. Let me talk to him.
- Oh, you...

46
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,082
- You got a friend here, buddy.
- Just for a minute.

47
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,959
- You got a friend.
- Jimmy. You gonna tell us who your man is?

48
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:21,588
- When's the last time you picked your feet, Willie?
- Who's your connection?

49
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,590
- What's his name?
- What?

50
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,926
- Answer him!
- No! No, man. No. I ain't never...

51
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:29,012
Is it Joe the barber? Joe the barber, right?
That's who it is, isn't it?

52
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:33,100
- Aw, don't give us any shit. What's Joe's last name?
- I don't know, man.

53
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,976
Give him a chance.
Just give him a chance.

54
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,813
- Give him a chance.
- Man, all I know is he lives on 125th Street...

55
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,774
- Above the barbershop.
- What side of the street does he live on?

56
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,651
North or south? North or south?

57
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,528
I don't know what you're talking about, man.
I don't know...

58
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,405
I'm asking you what side
of the street he lives on!

59
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:49,157
Hey, shithead, when was the last time
you picked your feet?

60
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,202
- Man, what's he talkin' about?
- I've got a man in Poughkeepsie wants to talk to you.

61
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:54,079
You ever been to Poughkeepsie?

62
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,415
- Have you ever been to Poughkeepsie?
- Hey, man, give me a break.

63
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,250
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Come on, say it.

64
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,544
Let me hear you say it.
Have you ever been to Poughkeepsie?

65
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,421
You've been to Poughkeepsie,
haven't you?

66
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,423
- I wanna hear it! Come on!
- Yes. Yes, I...

67
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,882
- You've been there, right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

68
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,801
You sat on the edge of the bed,
didn't you?

69
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:10,929
You took off your shoes, put your finger in
between your toes and picked your feet. Say it!

70
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:15,142
- Yes.
- You put a shiv in my partner. You know what that means?

71
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:19,771
Goddamn it! All winter long I gotta listen
to him gripe about his bowling scores.

72
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,982
Now I'm gonna bust your ass
for those three bags...

73
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,609
and I'm gonna nail you
for pickin' your feet in Poughkeepsie.

74
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,287
Merci.

75
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,146
Bonjour.

76
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,065
Merci, chéri.

77
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,502
13-80, 61. 13-80, 61.

78
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:51,464
- Who's detective for 13 Victor Six?
- Yes, ma'am.

79
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,341
How many fellas?

80
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,303
- Two?
- A family dispute.

81
00:09:56,387 --> 00:10:00,807
Do you have a description?

82
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,853
Yes, ma'am.

00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:16,031

84
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,159
You dumb guinea.

85
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:22,078
- How the hell did I know he had a knife?
- Never trust a nigger.

86
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,914
- He could have been white.
- Never trust anyone.

87
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,625
- You goin' sick?
- No.

88
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,460
- Are you goin' sick?
- No!

89
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:31,296
What do you say we "popeye" down to
the Chez and have a couple of drinks?

90
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,674
- I'm beat. I'm gonna go home.

91
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,885

Right?

131
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,641

shirt and tie combo...

Who is that clown?

135
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,533
He's a policy guy from Queens.

136
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,870
Right.

137
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,503
Dig the creep that's coming
to the table now.

138
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:21,257
It's Jewish Lucky. He don't look the same
without numbers across his chest.

hide the salami with his old lady?

Yeah.

157
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,811
Miss can I ask you
about those boots there?

158
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,269
Monica.

159

- Who keeps score?

160

Hey.

161
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:50,156
- Kissy devil, isn't he? Look at him.
- Yeah.

00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,210
- Hudson Terraplane. That's what he got.
- No, no.

166
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,212
- Easy, easy.
- Okay.

167
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,383
Go to work.

168
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,389
Cloudy, lay odds he takes us
to Dago town.

169
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,725
We'll take him, Popeye.
He's nothin'.

170
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,879
7:00 in the morning.

171
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,090
I don't believe this.

172
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:52,051
Relax. You're having fun, ain't you?

173
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,396
Man, if that's not a drop...

174
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,315
I'll open up a charge for you
at Bloomingdales.

175
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,151
Make it Alexander's.
I like the toy department.

176
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,371
He's coming back.
Pass him. Make a left.

177
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,074
Alain.

178
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,499
Bonjour.

179
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,419
Enchanté.

180
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:20,231
Our friend's name is Boca...

181
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:23,109
Salvatore Boca. B-O-C-A.

182
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:26,153
They call him Sal.
He's a sweetheart.

183
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:30,199
He was picked up on suspicion
of armed robbery. Now, get this.

184
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:32,660
Three years ago
he tries to hold up Tiffany's...

185
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,662
on Fifth Avenue in broad daylight.

186
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,705
He coulda got two and a half to five...

187
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,707
but Tiffany's wouldn't prosecute.

188
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:42,795
Also, downtown they're pretty sure he pulled
off a contract on a guy named DeMarco.

189
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:44,922
What about his old lady?

190
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:47,842
Her name's Angie. She's a fast filly.

191
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,553
She drew a suspended for
shoplifting a year ago.

192
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:53,848
She's only a kid. Nineteen,
according to the marriage license.

193
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,724
Nineteen going on 50.

194
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,018
What else?

195
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,229
He's had the store a year and a half.

196
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:02,648
Takes in a fast seven grand a year.

197
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:04,525
So what's he doing with two cars...

198
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,402
and hundred-dollar tabs at the Chez?

199
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:08,279
The LTD's in his wife's name.

200
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:11,824
The Comet belongs to his brother Lou.

201
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:15,536
He's a trainee at the garbageman school
on Ward's Island.

202
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,664
He did time a couple of years ago...
assault and robbery.

203
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:22,042
The black Cadillac...

204
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,670
New Jersey plates.

205
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,714
RWN-264. I know that one cat.

206
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,300
We saw him outside the Pike Slip Inn
the other day.

207
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,427
I wanna get a blouse
like that for my girlfriend...

208
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:33,304
but I want you to model it for me.

209
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,473
Better not let my husband hear that.

210
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:39,143
I don't care if he hears it.
Will you do it for me?

211
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,437
Okay. How much you gonna pay?

212
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:46,817
- Fifty dollars an hour.
- Fifty an hour? I'll do it... 200.

213
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,694
Nah. Can't afford it.

214
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:51,822
I'll call you later.
All right. Bye-bye.

215
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:56,035
Hey, it's 1:30.
I didn't expect you till 2:00.

216
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:58,245
- You work around here?
- Yeah. Across the street.

217
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,457
That's the third time
he's come here this week.

218
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,544
- You got anything on this building?
- The building's clean.

219
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:09,215
I checked the tenant list.
Remember Don Ameche, the actor?

220
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:12,551
He lives here.
Oh, yeah. And somebody else.

221
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:15,596
Does the name
Joel Weinstock ring a bell?

222
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,432
- Oh, you're kidding.
- No, sir. He lives right here.

223
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:23,270
He was the bank on a shipment out of Mexico...
What was it? Three years ago.

224
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,147
Yeah, so I hear.

225
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,165
He's going to Ward's Island.
We're gonna be spotted there.

226
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,377
- What the hell is he doing that?
- Maybe he's gonna go down and see his brother.

227
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:49,755
- Shit.
- Well, maybe it's another drop.

228
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,799
Well, he gets a free ride.

229
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,281

280
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:56,108
Hey, you, haircut.

00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:59,820
- Where are you going?
- You talkin' to me, baby?

282
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,905
Yeah, I'm talking to you.
Come here. Get out of there.

284
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,617
- Where you been?
- I've been in there.

285
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,494
- Can you stand a toss?
- Sure. I'm clean.

286
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,371
- You use shit?
- No, man.

287
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:12,166
Oh, man, who are you, Dick Tracy
or somebody? I said I was clean.

288
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,084
- I'm not gonna get stuck, am I?
- No. I said I'm clean.

289
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,837
- If I do, you know what happens, don't you?
- Yeah. I said I'm clean.

290
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,006
Motherfucker, don't...

291
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,467
I'll break your motherfuckin' ass.
Fuck you.

292
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:24,178
Oh, yeah, in where?

293
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,471
- Gimme a nickel.
- Come on, man.

294
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,431
Gimme a nickel.
Come on. Come on!

295
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:30,726
I told you I'm clean. Why the fuck you
wanna come down on me like that for?

296
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,353
- Get your ass in there.
- Oh, man, would you...

297
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:36,273
This ain't nothin' but goddamn bullshit.

298
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:41,528
- How's everything?
- Everything's everything, baby.

299
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,072
Hey, how come there's nothin' out there?
That stuff's all milk.

300
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,825
Ain't nothin' around.
Nobody's holding.

301
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,495
- I got a name for you. Sal Boca. Brooklyn.
- Boca?

302
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:52,748
Yeah. B-O-C-A.

303
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:56,210
- Never heard of him.
- What about his wife, Angie?

304
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,879
Doesn't register.

305
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,173
- There's been some talk.
- About what?

306
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:04,259
A shipment... coming in this week,
week after.

307
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,136
Everybody's gonna get well.

308
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,764
- Well, who's bringing it?
- Who knows?

309
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:11,391
Oh, shit.

310
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:20,651
Where do you want it?

311
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:23,654
- Where do you want it?
- Oh, shit.

312
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:25,572
This side.

313
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:33,288
- Beat it.
- Damn.

314
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,165
I'm gonna check on this address
in the Bronx...

315
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,292
and if they don't know you there,
it's your ass.

316
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:39,169
I thought I told you to stand there.

317
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,255
Get that hair done before Saturday.

318
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,715
We're going now. Good-bye.

319
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,262
Move ass.

320
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,305
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.

321
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:53,767
All that is great, but you belong in
Bedford-Stuyvesant, not out there in Ridgewood.

322
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,562
Why don't you detach us then, for Christ's sakes?
Give us a shot at it.

323
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:59,064
At least till we find out
if there's anything here or not.

324
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:02,776
Everybody wants Weinstock, right? Well,
maybe here's the lead we're looking for.

325
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,028
We deserve this.

326
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,030
You couldn't burn a three-time loser...

327
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,116
with this garbage you're bringing in here.

328
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,034
The man has done absolutely nothing.

329
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,954
The first thing you know, you'll wind up
in an entrapment rap-the both of you.

330
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,831
Brooklyn is loaded with guys...

331
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:18,333
that own candy stores, two cars,
and like to go to nightclubs.

332
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,210
Yeah, but you put
this little candy store hustler together...

333
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,212
with Joel Weinstock,
and maybe we got a big score.

334
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,089
Big score, my ass.

335
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:25,966
At best he's selling
nickel and dime bags.

336
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,885
I wouldn't be infringing
on your coffee break, Simonson...

337
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,888
if I thought it was a nickel-and-dimer.

338
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:33,557
Your hunches have backfired before, Doyle.

339
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:36,643
Or have you forgotten about that already?

340
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,813
Jesus Christ, Jimmy.
What's happened to you guys lately?

341
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,441
Every year you lead
the Narcotics Bureau in arrests.

342
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:44,401
What was it,
over a hundred again last year?

343
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:47,237
Terrific. But who?
What did you bring in?

344
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:50,240
- A high school kid in short pants that had a twitch.
- Oh, Christ.

345
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:53,577
You grab a bellhop because
he's got three joints in his sock.

346
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:02,002
Walt, we got the information
there's no shit on the street, right?

347
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,254
It's like a goddamn desert
full of junkies out there.

348
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,089
- Everybody waiting to get well.
- Goddamn it.

349
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,717
This could be it.
This little candy store guy...

350
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:11,929
He's puttin' on a big show in a fancy
nightclub with known narcotics connections.

351
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,764
They were all over him.

352
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:15,933
And then, on our own,
after working a whole day and night...

353
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,852
we tail him to Brooklyn,
and we sat on him for practically a week.

354
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,563
Now, who do we come up with?
Joel Weinstock, for Christ's sake.

355
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,857
Now, you gotta let us have it.

356
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:28,528
Do you believe all this crap?

357
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,530
I go with my partner.

358
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,993
- What'll it take?
- A wire.

359
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,870
- No. Two wires.
- Two wires.

360
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,915
One on the store, one on the house.

361
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:43,377
You know I have to get a court order
for a wiretap, don't you?

362
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,462
But you'll try.

363
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:48,632
We know you can do it, Walt.

364
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,717
Popeye.

365
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,011
You still pickin' your feet
in Poughkeepsie?

366
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,655
Mr. Devereaux,
is this your first trip to New York?

367
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:13,865
Yes. It's my first trip.

368
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,159
Why did you choose to come by ship?

369
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:19,329
The next several weeks
will be very difficult for me...

370
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:23,083
and the middle of the ocean
is the only place...

371
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,669
where the telephone
isn't ringing all the time.

372
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:28,922
Mr. Devereaux, do you agree
with the recent survey finding...

373
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:32,009
that showed that Mayor Lindsay
was the sexiest man in the world?

374
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,059
To les femmes.

375
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:37,449
Here's the rest of the warrants. The
court order's in there for the wiretaps.

376
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:39,326
Judge gave you 60 days on it.

377
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,411
Tell Doyle that Mulderig and Klein
will sit in for the feds.

378
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,705
They'll make all the buys.

379
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,874
Make sure you keep 'em informed
of everything that goes down.

380
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:48,460
You know Doyle there, don't you, Bill?

381
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:50,670
Yeah, I know Popeye.

382
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:54,341
- His brilliant hunches cost the life of a good cop.
- Hey, look.

383
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,426
If this is the way
you're comin' in on this...

384
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,970
why don't you stay home
and save us all a lot of grief?

385
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,890
- 'Cause that's my opinion.
- Shove it up your ass.

386
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:04,017
Whatever.

387
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,937
Bill, look. Please...
Do me a favor. Give them a chance.

388
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:08,897
He came in here
with a little basic information.

389
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:10,941
I know you worked with him before.
You had a little trouble.

390
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,943
- But don't get off on the wrong foot?
- I'm not getting off...

391
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:16,446
- If you have any problems, come to me with 'em.
- Just keep him off my back.

392
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,323
- Just try and cool it with him.
- I will.

393
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,450
If you have any problems, come to me.
I'll handle him.

394
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,452
- Do me a favor.
- I'll be happy to work with him, believe me.

395
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,329
He's a good cop-basically a good cop.

396
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:26,665
- He's got good hunches every once in a while.
- Fine, fine, fine.

397
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:28,542
- Give him a chance.
- Keep him off my back.

398
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,544
Florida's Mackel Brothers...

399
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,629
invite you to join the great escape.

400
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:35,298
You can say good-bye
to air pollution, commuting...

401
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:39,469
high prices, rising taxes
and cold, depressing winters.

402
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,972
Mackel Brothers will show you
the way to Florida...

403
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:45,767
and fresh, clean air,
warm and sunny year-round weather...

404
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,686
and a home that you'll be proud to own.

405
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,604
Call Mackel Brothers right now for...

406
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,249
Popeye.

407
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,837
Popeye!

408
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,797
- What?
- It's me, Cloudy.

409
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,799
Open the door.

410
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,178
I can't.

411
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:05,722
What do you mean, you can't?
You all right?

412
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:09,476
Yeah, I'm all right.
Let yourself in, will you?

413
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:56,189
What happened?

414
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:02,529
That crazy kid.

415
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:06,324
She locked me up with my own cuffs.

416
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,287
Where's the keys?

417
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,372
Over there.

418
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:26,344
Hi there.

419
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:41,067
Anybody hurt in this wreck?

420
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,992
Thought I told you
to get plastic folders for this stuff.

421
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:55,206
Your scrapbook is like you-
a mess.

422
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,250
Gimme my pants, will ya?

423
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,423
Come on.

424
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:06,760
- Did you get the warrants?
- Yeah.

425
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:09,846
I also got two feds-
Mulderig and Klein.

426
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:14,517
What do we need those pricks for?

427
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:18,271
Because our department's got
about 908 bucks to make buys...

428
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,857
and they can get all they want
from "Uncle Sap."

429
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,942
Hello.

430
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,613
These yours, darling?

431
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:29,741
Mike, take a look at this blue one
with the tan, on the right.

432
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,062
You got an extra grand with you?

433
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,064
A lot of this stuff is
worth a grand, total.

434
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:03,983
- I got it. I got it if I need it.
- All right.

435
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:07,112
- Keep it good and ready.
- Did you look at the board, Mike?

436
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,619
Thirty over here from the general.
Okay, I got 30.

437
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:16,496
- Can I get 35? Anyone, 35.
- Thirty-five here.

438
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,706
- Thirty-five over here. How about 38?
- Yeah, right here.

439
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,625
Thirty-eight over here.
How about 40? Can I get 40?

440
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:23,169
- Forty.
- Forty over here. I got 40. Can I get 41?

441
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:27,298
Forty once. Forty twice.
Sold to the gentleman for $40.

442
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:31,428
All right, we come now
to the next number, 42-399.

443
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:34,681
Rambler four-door sedan.

444
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,809
- Do I hear $10?
- Ten bucks.

445
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:40,019
- I got $10 over here. Do I hear 12?
- Twelve.

446
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,147
- Twelve over here. Twelve. Can I get 14?
- Fourteen.

447
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,023
- Fourteen.
- Fourteen over here. How about 16?

448
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,859
- Can I hear 16? Sixteen?
- Sixteen.

449
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,153
- Eighteen dollars.
- Eighteen over there. How about 20? Can I get 20?

450
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:50,572
- Twenty.
- Twenty dollars over here. How about 22? Twenty-two?

451
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:52,866
- Twenty-two.
- I got 22 over here. Can I get 24?

452
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,618
- Twenty-four.
- Twenty-four over here. How about 25?

453
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:58,955
- Twenty-five.
- Twenty-five. I got 25. Can I get 26? Can I get 26?

454
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:02,292
Twenty-five once. Twenty-five twice.
Sold to the gentleman for 25.

455
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:04,335
Every car sold here today...

456
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,588
Where are you?

457
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,590
Taking care of business.

458
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:12,177
What do you mean, taking care of business?
It's after midnight.

459
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:15,763
You know I had to meet some people tonight.

460
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:19,392
Yeah, well, finish all your
meeting people and get back here now.

461
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:22,270
- And bring a pizza with you.
- Where am I gonna get a pizza this time of night?

462
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:26,065
Well, try, okay?

463
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,693
Hey, I don't know where
I'm gonna find a pizza joint open.

464
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:31,070
- Sal?
- Yeah?

465
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:34,407
Don't forget-Anchovies.

466
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,831
- Salvatore?
- Oh, yes. Yeah, yeah.

467
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,708
- Who is it?
- Hello. Hello. Yeah, this is Sal.

468
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:46,711
- How are you?
- Sounds like a foreigner.

469
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:48,838
You meet me Wednesday
at the hotel, okay?

470
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,882
- Good. Great.
- Sounds French.

471
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:53,384
- Will I expect you?
- Yeah. What time?

472
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:56,763
- 12:00. Yes?
- Yeah. Yes. Yeah.

473
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,363
Strictly small potatoes.

474
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:15,823
Sure can pick 'em, Doyle.

475
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:21,412
Still wearing your gun on your ankle?

476
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:24,624
You know, someone told me
the reason why you do that...

477
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:28,127
is when you meet a chick
and you rub up against her...

478
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:31,756
she can't tell you're a cop.

479
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,008
I said, "That's bullshit."

480
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,386
It's gotta be a fast-draw gimmick
or something."

481
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:39,556
Bill, why don't you knock it off?

482
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,474
He's gettin' too far ahead.

483
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:45,645
You're gonna lose him.

484
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:04,455
For Christ's sake, move the car?

485
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,583
- Jesus Christ!
- Move it!

486
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:10,003
Move it, will you, mac?

487
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,963
Son of a...

488
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:14,632
What the hell is goin' on here?

489
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,509
Come on, Cloudy, move.

490
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:22,348
Klein, this is Cloudy.
Do you read me?

491
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,934
Bill, for-
Bill, come in, for Christ's sakes.

492
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:27,729
This is Cloudy. Do you read me?

493
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:30,481
Listen. We lost him on the bridge.

494
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:36,195
Right. I got him.
He's heading north on East River Drive.

495
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,931
Excuse me. Excuse me.

496
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:40,570
You take Sal. I'll take the beard.

497
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:42,613
There goes Sal.

498
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:20,396
Do you want the red or the white?

499
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,273
What year?

500
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:03,874
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah, the guy who just walked in...

501
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:05,751
What's his name?

502
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:59,597
Here.

503
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,984
I'm pretty sure that was the frog.

504
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,612
He made me too.

505
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:17,406
He lives on four. He went up to six.

506
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:19,241
He's cute. Real cute.

507
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,702
The other guy's a frog too.
He checked into the Edison.

508
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:25,915
- Had a hooker sent up.
- You could have collared him right there.

509
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:27,958
- Who's on him?
- Klein.

510
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:31,837
- How 'bout Sal?
- We put him to bed for the night.

511
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:34,590
Why don't you do the same, Doyle?
You look like shit.

512
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:38,260
- Come on.
- Look. My partner and I made this case.

513
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:41,931
You know? Originally.
We don't want any feds screwin' it up.

514
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:44,683
Case? So far you haven't
showed me a damn thing.

515
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,603
You keep shootin' your mouth off, I'm gonna
knock you right in the middle of next week.

516
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:49,355
- Get out-
- Knock it off.

517
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,315
- Don't tell me to knock it off, goddamn it.
- We don't need this.

518
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:54,110
Now, cut it out, will ya?
For Christ's sakes!

519
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:57,196
There's nothing going down.
Get some sleep.

520
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:42,992
Blast off.

521
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:45,703
180.

522
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:56,422
200. Good Housekeeping
Seal of approval.

523
00:52:56,506 --> 00:53:00,009
210. U.S. Government certified.

524
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:04,722
220. Lunar trajectory.

525
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,392
Junk of the Month Club sirloin steak.

526
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:10,978
230.

527
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:12,980
Grade "A" poison.

528
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:18,694
Absolute dynamite.

529
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:23,199
89% pure junk. Best I've ever seen.

530
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:26,827
If the rest is like this, you'll be dealing
on this load for two years.

531
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:29,538
- So you're telling me it's worth a half million?
- How many kilos?

532
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,540
- Sixty.
- Sixty kilos?

533
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:34,126
Eight big ones a kilo, right?

534
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:37,546
This stuff'll take
a 7-to-1 hit on the street.

535
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:40,716
And by the time it gets down to nickel
bags, it'll be at least 32 million.

536
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,844
Thank you, Howard. Take what's
left there with you, and good night.

537
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:47,514
Not that one. The little one.

538
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:55,022
- I guess we got a deal?
- What we got here, Sal, is a test.

539
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:58,400
A deal for half a million dollars?
Maybe.

540
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:00,569
Maybe?

541
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:03,572
Come on, Joel. I know that guy's
in a hurry. Wants the bread.

542
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:07,034
He wants to go back to France. This guy's
not gonna hang around and play games.

543
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:09,995
Look, he's one of the shrewdest cats
I ever come across.

544
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,539
What am I, a schmuck?
What's the hurry?

545
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:14,541
He could see a couple of shows...

546
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:17,169
visit the top of the Empire State Building.

547
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:20,923
Don't jerk me, Weinstock.
I spent a lot of time settin' this one up.

548
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:22,967
So what do you want, a badge?

549
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:26,804
This is your first major league game, Sal.
One thing I learned...

550
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:29,932
Move calmly, move cautiously.
You'll never be sorry.

551
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:32,935
Look. I've been damn careful up to now.

552
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:36,981
This is why your phone lines are tapped and the
feds are crawling all over you like fleas.

553
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:40,484
Look, I'm telling you,
he'll take the deal somewhere else.

554
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:42,987
So let him take his 60 kilos
of heroin someplace else...

555
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:45,906
and find how easy it is
to put together a half a million in cash.

556
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:48,951
He wouldn't find there's any hurry
to do this kind of business.

557
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:51,954
The stuff is here!
We could make the switch in an hour!

558
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:54,915
Look, Weinstock, I'm telling you.
He'll split if we don't move!

559
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,794
This guy's got 'em like that.
He's everything they say he is.

560
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:00,796
What about you, Sal?

561
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,048
Are you everything they say you are?

562
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:55,220
I'll be a son of a bitch.

563
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:01,847
Come on!

564
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:11,940
Thank you. Hello.

565
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:14,860
This is Doyle.
I'm sittin' on Frog One.

566
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:18,030
Yeah, I know that.
We got the Westbury covered like a tent.

567
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:20,991
The Westbury, my ass!
I got him on the shuttle at Grand Central.

568
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:23,952
Now, what the hell's goin' on up there?

569
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:26,913
I make him coming out of the hotel,
free as a bird. There wasn't a soul awake.

570
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:29,958
What the hell are you talking about?

571
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:32,294
Yeah, well...

572
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:35,964
Listen, I don't care how many bartenders
you got that are sick.

573
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:39,509
Nah, I'm not workin' that joint.
That's right.

574
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:41,595
Same to you, buddy.

575
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,811
Can I get a grape drink?

576
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:42,948
Watch the closing doors.

577
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:02,509
You son of a bitch!

578
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:32,998
Hi. Can I have a
round-trip ticket to Washington?

579
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:35,584
- Washington? Cash or charge?
- Cash.

580
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:38,086
- Cash is $54.
- Right.

581
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:40,922
Okay. Please print your name on both
tickets before you board the plane.

582
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:43,300
Yeah. Bye-bye.

583
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:45,927
Bye-bye. Have a nice flight.

584
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:48,138
- Yes, sir?
- Round trip to Washington, please.

585
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:13,747
So?

586
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:17,584
So everything's going great,
terrific, beautiful.

587
01:03:17,668 --> 01:03:19,711
I'll need a few more days though.

588
01:03:21,255 --> 01:03:23,465
The boys think we oughta
cool it for a while...

589
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:25,884
just to make sure there's no heat.

590
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:28,887
You must take me for an imbecile.

591
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:32,140
Why do you think I asked you
to meet me in Washington?

592
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:34,184
I haven't spent five minutes
in New York City...

593
01:03:34,268 --> 01:03:36,645
without the company of a policeman.

594
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:38,730
Look, I'm leveling with you.

595
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:40,732
I need a little more time.

596
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:45,821
It's just that my people think we oughta
find a better time to make the switch.

597
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:48,865
- That's all.
- It has to be by the end of this week.

598
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:52,452
Look, Charnier.
You got to be reasonable.

599
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:55,831
It's your problem.

600
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:57,916
Well, it's your problem too.

601
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,586
It's so nice to have seen you again.

602
01:05:30,509 --> 01:05:33,595
I don't want to get into this.
I gotta have time.

603
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:35,597
I can't get any more time.

604
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:38,099
- Give me some fuckin' time, will you?
- You're not gonna get it.

605
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:41,227
We found a set of works on the kid
driving the sports car over there.

606
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:43,438
His girlfriend's in the back of the car.
She's dead.

607
01:05:43,522 --> 01:05:46,399
- Give the car a complete toss.
- I say we keep sittin' on Boca.

608
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:48,902
Jimmy, give it up. Give it up.
It's all over with.

609
01:05:48,986 --> 01:05:51,655
If there was a deal, it's gone down by now.
We blew it.

610
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:54,032
We blew our warrants.
We blew our cover.

611
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:56,743
Walter, listen.
I know the deal hasn't gone down.

612
01:05:56,827 --> 01:05:59,621
I- I know it. I can feel it.
I'm dead certain.

613
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:02,707
Last time you were dead certain,
we ended up with a dead cop.

614
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:05,418
Hey! Hold-Hold on! Hold on!

615
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:08,546
Break it up, both of you!
Will you two break it up?

616
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:11,007
Stop it now. Hold on to yourself!
What's the matter with you?

617
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:15,428
- Son of a-
- Jimmy, you wasted two months on this.

618
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:19,474
No collars are comin' in while you two guys
are runnin' around town, jerkin' off.

619
01:06:19,558 --> 01:06:22,769
Now, go back to work!
You're off special assignment!

620
01:06:22,853 --> 01:06:25,897
10-4.

621
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:50,505
Oh, there he is!

622
01:06:53,884 --> 01:06:56,261
Oh! Oh!

623
01:07:00,057 --> 01:07:02,434
Get down! Get down. Get out of the area!

624
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:05,270
Leave her alone! Get away!
Leave her alone!

625
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:07,230
There's a sniper up there!

626
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:27,667
Somebody should call the doctor.

627
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:36,092
Hey, there's a doctor
right across the street.

628
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:38,678
- There must be a doctor.
- There is one.

629
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:42,719
Hey!

630
01:09:44,096 --> 01:09:46,681
Hey!

631
01:09:47,766 --> 01:09:50,268
Stop that man!
He's wanted by the police!

632
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:03,448
- What's the next stop into the city?
- 25th Avenue.

633
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:16,877
Hold it!

634
01:10:30,976 --> 01:10:33,478
Police emergency!
I need your car. I need your car.

635
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:37,232
When am I gonna get it back?

636
01:10:44,281 --> 01:10:46,282
For Christ's sake!

637
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:34,706
Hold it! Stop! Halt!

638
01:12:28,385 --> 01:12:33,014
- Don't stop. Don't stop, or I'll kill you!
- Hey, what? What...

639
01:12:33,098 --> 01:12:35,099
I gotta stop in the next station.

640
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:37,727
Touch the brake,
and I'll blow you in half.

641
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:16,015
- What's going on?
- I don't know. Sit down, buddy. Relax.

642
01:13:24,983 --> 01:13:27,985
Coke! Coke, you all right?

643
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:48,714
Hey, Coke. You all right?

644
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:51,008
Don't answer.

645
01:14:55,115 --> 01:14:56,741
Hey, Coke. You all right?

646
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:01,996
Get back!

647
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:04,790
- Relax. Now, put your gun down.
- Keep going!

648
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:07,418
Oh, my God!

649
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:23,768
You're not gonna get away with this.
Put the gun down.

650
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:27,939
- Get back!
- Come on now...

651
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:29,941
- I said get back!
- You can't get away...

652
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:39,784
Stop!

653
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:29,894
Hold it!

654
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:33,898
Let's get out of here!

655
01:17:50,248 --> 01:17:52,583
Come on! Come on! Shake your ass.

656
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:56,253
It's getting cold.

657
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:15,750
I can't seem to find the damn ticket.

658
01:19:15,834 --> 01:19:18,836
- Where's the guy?
- He's getting my car from the back.

659
01:19:31,057 --> 01:19:33,017
- Thank you.
- Sure.

660
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:39,482
- Can I help you?
- Yeah. It's a convertible.

661
01:19:39,566 --> 01:19:41,567
Do you have the ticket?

662
01:19:41,651 --> 01:19:43,778
The top one. The top floor?

663
01:19:43,862 --> 01:19:46,363
- What kind of ticket do you have?
- Never mind.

664
01:19:59,753 --> 01:20:01,879
He's in the brown Lincoln,
foreign plates.

665
01:20:37,582 --> 01:20:40,709
- All right. He's walking towards Front Street.
- Got him.

666
01:20:40,794 --> 01:20:42,753
Angie's parked over here in the LTD.

667
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:44,755
Cute.

668
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:47,925
You stay with her.
We're gonna sit on the Lincoln.

669
01:20:58,395 --> 01:21:00,396
That car's dirty, Cloudy.

670
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:05,192
We're gonna sit here all night
if we have to.

671
01:23:00,058 --> 01:23:02,059
What time is it?

672
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:07,815
Ten after 4:00.

673
01:23:08,858 --> 01:23:11,777
Ten after 4:00.

674
01:23:35,802 --> 01:23:38,762
That's the third time
those guys have been around.

675
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:04,955
All right. Let's hit 'em! Hit 'em!

676
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:09,960
Freeze!

677
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:12,546
All right. Nobody move!
Put your hands in the air!

678
01:24:16,176 --> 01:24:19,928
Get over... Get over there! Hey!
Get up there!

679
01:24:20,013 --> 01:24:23,724
Spread those fucking legs!
Now stay right there!

680
01:24:23,808 --> 01:24:26,101
You move,
I'll blow your fuckin' head off!

681
01:24:26,186 --> 01:24:28,979
- What the hell's that?
- What are you doing? Turn around!

682
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:31,899
- Man, I have my rights.
- What do you mean, your rights?

683
01:24:31,983 --> 01:24:34,860
Who's the boss here?
Hey, who's running this outfit?

684
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:36,862
- I am.
- You are?

685
01:24:36,946 --> 01:24:39,073
- What are you doing here? Who sent you down?
- Just runnin' around.

686
01:24:39,157 --> 01:24:41,617
Don't talk back to me, man.
What are you doing here?

687
01:24:41,701 --> 01:24:43,702
- We saw the car, man.
- You heist this car?

688
01:24:43,787 --> 01:24:46,997
No. We was breaking down the tires.
That's all it was.

689
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:50,459
Lock 'em up.
Lock 'em up. Lock 'em up.

690
01:24:50,543 --> 01:24:52,961
- All of you, come on.
- Come on! Come on!

691
01:24:53,046 --> 01:24:55,631
Come on. Stop draggin' your ass.
Keep your hands on your head.

692
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:59,676
You dumb spics, get outta here!
Lock 'em up and throw away the goddamn key!

693
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:06,892
Nothin' but a bunch
of lousy spic car thieves.

694
01:25:11,648 --> 01:25:15,442
- Nothin' in there except a New York City map.
- Are you bullshittin' me?

695
01:25:15,527 --> 01:25:17,694
That car's dirty.

696
01:25:18,863 --> 01:25:21,532
Take it in and tear it apart.

697
01:25:57,193 --> 01:26:00,237
Tear it right out. Tear it out!

698
01:26:02,866 --> 01:26:04,616
Nothing here, Jimmy.

699
01:26:10,582 --> 01:26:12,541
Look in here.

700
01:26:32,896 --> 01:26:34,813
This is all solid.

701
01:27:09,933 --> 01:27:13,518
There's nobody been under that car
since it came from the factory.

702
01:27:13,603 --> 01:27:15,854
That thing is clean.

703
01:27:15,939 --> 01:27:18,232
I don't buy that, Irv.

704
01:27:18,316 --> 01:27:20,484
The stuff is in that car.

705
01:27:20,568 --> 01:27:23,111
Well, you find it. I can't.

706
01:27:42,799 --> 01:27:45,133
Look, the car was lost
some time last night.

707
01:27:45,218 --> 01:27:48,095
First, they send us to Pier 1,
then they send us here. Then what?

708
01:27:48,179 --> 01:27:50,847
I don't understand why you parked the car
down by the waterfront.

709
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:53,183
You tell me you're staying at the Doral
in midtown Manhattan...

710
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:55,394
and you lose the car
out by the Brooklyn Bridge?

711
01:27:55,478 --> 01:27:59,439
Look, Monsieur Devereaux is scouting
locations for a film for French television.

712
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:01,858
He probably left the car
to look at some point of interest.

713
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:05,904
We were told by the police commissioner's
office that the car was brought to this garage.

714
01:28:05,989 --> 01:28:07,906
I demand its immediate return.

715
01:28:07,991 --> 01:28:11,618
You're going to have to be patient, Mr. Devereaux.
We get 400, 500 cars here a day.

716
01:28:11,703 --> 01:28:14,663
Monsieur Devereaux is
a very important guest of this country.

717
01:28:14,747 --> 01:28:18,500
He's working with the absolute cooperation
and participation of your government.

718
01:28:18,584 --> 01:28:21,545
Here are his credentials
from the French consulate.

719
01:28:21,629 --> 01:28:24,089
Unless you wish to see this episode
portrayed in his film...

720
01:28:24,173 --> 01:28:27,050
I suggest you locate the car immediately.

721
01:28:27,135 --> 01:28:29,136
You're in a no-smoking area, sir.

722
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:31,346
Will you please
extinguish your cigarettes?

723
01:28:49,073 --> 01:28:51,908
What was the weight of the car
when you got it, Irv?

724
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:01,918
4,795 pounds.

725
01:29:06,716 --> 01:29:09,343
You sure?

726
01:29:09,427 --> 01:29:12,304
That's what it was... 4,795 pounds...

727
01:29:12,388 --> 01:29:14,514
when it came into the shop.

728
01:29:14,599 --> 01:29:18,226
The owner's manual says 4,675.

729
01:29:19,645 --> 01:29:21,646
It's 120 pounds overweight.

730
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:28,695
And when it was booked into Marseille,
it was 4,795.

731
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:31,948
That's still 120 pounds overweight.
Jimmy's gotta be right.

732
01:29:34,077 --> 01:29:38,413
Listen, I ripped everything out of there
except the rocker panels.

733
01:29:38,498 --> 01:29:40,624
Come on, Irv!
What the hell is that?

734
01:30:03,189 --> 01:30:05,190
Well, shit!

735
01:30:07,777 --> 01:30:09,736
Son of a bitch.

736
01:30:09,821 --> 01:30:11,822
All right.

737
01:30:17,870 --> 01:30:20,997
It isn't the only car we have here.

738
01:30:21,082 --> 01:30:25,001
Got it for you, Randy.
It just came in from downtown.

739
01:30:25,086 --> 01:30:27,587
- Who's Devereaux?
- I am Mr. Devereaux. Why?

740
01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:29,589
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Devereaux...

741
01:30:29,674 --> 01:30:32,801
but we get a lot of cars here at night,
and sometimes it's hard to keep track...

742
01:30:32,885 --> 01:30:35,387
- You mean the car is here now?
- Oh, yeah, yeah. It's right outside.

743
01:30:35,471 --> 01:30:38,765
They stole it right
off the street from you?

744
01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:40,767
Goddamn.

745
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:42,936
You're gonna have to pay
the towing charge, you know.

746
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:46,606
I was told these things happen
in New York, but one never expects it.

747
01:30:46,691 --> 01:30:49,818
Well, that's New York.
Is this your first trip over here?

748
01:30:49,902 --> 01:30:52,904
- Yeah. Where's my car, please?
- It's right over here.

749
01:30:55,366 --> 01:30:57,492
But you're lucky this time.

750
01:30:57,577 --> 01:31:01,163
It's in perfect shape. Not a scratch.
You must lead a charming life.

751
01:31:22,393 --> 01:31:24,394
Henri.

752
01:31:28,858 --> 01:31:30,775
Je vous attendais.

753
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:01,337
- Let's go!
- Bon voyage.

754
01:36:01,422 --> 01:36:03,339
Merci.

755
01:36:03,424 --> 01:36:05,925
I would give you a ride, but...

756
01:36:06,010 --> 01:36:09,137
Tom, take care.

757
01:36:14,852 --> 01:36:16,811
Take care, baby.

758
01:36:18,773 --> 01:36:20,732
Lou!

759
01:36:20,816 --> 01:36:23,943
Yea!

760
01:36:26,155 --> 01:36:29,741
- Listen. I'll see you at Pop's tonight?
- Okay, babe. Take care?

761
01:37:19,375 --> 01:37:22,752
We made a good strike?

762
01:37:28,092 --> 01:37:30,176
What happened with Sal?
What's the matter with him?

763
01:37:30,261 --> 01:37:32,637
They got the bridge blocked off!

764
01:37:40,563 --> 01:37:43,898
Let me in! Open the door.

765
01:37:59,206 --> 01:38:01,583
This is the police!
You're surrounded!

766
01:38:01,667 --> 01:38:05,253
Come out with your hands up!

767
01:38:05,337 --> 01:38:07,797
This is the police! You're surrounded!

768
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:07,565
Bring out the gas!

769
01:39:18,327 --> 01:39:20,119
Hold your fire!

770
01:39:23,874 --> 01:39:26,209
Stop!

771
01:39:26,293 --> 01:39:29,253
Stop!

772
01:39:32,049 --> 01:39:34,300
We're coming out! Hold your fire!

773
01:39:34,385 --> 01:39:36,302
Drop the guns!

774
01:39:36,387 --> 01:39:38,221
Over here! Move it. Let's go!

775
01:39:55,572 --> 01:39:57,031
Popeye?

776
01:39:57,116 --> 01:39:58,908
It's me! It's me!

777
01:40:09,086 --> 01:40:11,462
Frog One is in that room.

778
01:40:56,008 --> 01:40:57,967
Drop it!

779
01:41:16,987 --> 01:41:18,905
Mulderig.

780
01:41:21,241 --> 01:41:24,202
You shot Mulderig.

781
01:41:24,286 --> 01:41:27,538
The son of a bitch is here.
I saw him. I'm gonna get him.
