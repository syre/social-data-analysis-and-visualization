1
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:58,065
All right, all right, all
right, what's it going to be?

2
00:02:58,282 --> 00:03:00,674
A triple cream cup for Christopher...

3
00:03:00,892 --> 00:03:03,371
A Squelchy Snorter for Otis...

4
00:03:03,545 --> 00:03:05,998
A Sizzler for June Marie...

5
00:03:06,084 --> 00:03:09,242
- And listen! Wonka's got a new one today.
- What is it?

6
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:11,895
This is called a Scrumdidilyumptious Bar.

7
00:03:12,107 --> 00:03:15,070
Scrumbibilyunctions Bar?
How does he do it?

8
00:03:15,287 --> 00:03:17,943
- My dear boy, do you ask a fish how it swims?
- No.

9
00:03:17,974 --> 00:03:19,723
- Or a bird how it flies?
- No.

10
00:03:19,897 --> 00:03:20,898
No sirree, you don't!

11
00:03:21,114 --> 00:03:22,855
They do it because they were
born to do it.

12
00:03:23,072 --> 00:03:25,942
Just like Willy Wonka was
born to be a candy man,

13
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,813
you look like you were
born to be a Wonkerer.

Hi, Mr. Jopeck.

44
00:05:37,107 --> 00:05:39,759
Ah, come along, Charlie.
You're late.

45
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,369
It's payday, Mr. Jopeck.

46
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:44,631
You're right.

47
00:05:45,414 --> 00:05:47,762
- There you are.
- Thanks.

48
00:05:48,545 --> 00:05:50,501
- Say hello to your Grandpa Joe.
- Okay.

49
00:06:33,817 --> 00:06:35,949
Up the airy mountain

50
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,383
Down the rushing glen

51
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:40,733
We dare not go a-hunting

52
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:44,037
For fear of little men

53
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,622
You see...

54
00:06:46,821 --> 00:06:48,604
Nobody ever goes in...

55
00:06:52,301 --> 00:06:54,344
and nobody ever comes out!

56
00:07:04,826 --> 00:07:06,260
Charlie's late.

57
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:09,131
He works too hard for a little boy.

58
00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:11,479
He should have some time to play.

59
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:13,654
Not enough hours in the day.

60
00:07:13,871 --> 00:07:16,112
With the four of you bedridden
for the past twenty years,

61
00:07:16,307 --> 00:07:19,134
it takes a lot of work
to keep this family going.

62
00:07:19,352 --> 00:07:21,656
If only his father were alive.

63
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:25,484
Soon as I get my strength back, I'm
gonna get out of this bed and help him.

64
00:07:25,701 --> 00:07:28,876
Dad, in all the years you've been saying
you're going to get out of that bed,

65
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,181
I've yet to see you set foot
on the floor.

66
00:07:32,306 --> 00:07:35,759
Well... maybe if the floor wasn't so cold.

67
00:07:37,182 --> 00:07:38,617
Hi, everybody!

68
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,052
Wake up. Charlie's home!

69
00:07:43,358 --> 00:07:44,618
Grandpa George.

70
00:07:46,359 --> 00:07:47,968
Grandma Georgina.

71
00:07:48,359 --> 00:07:49,837
Grandma Josephine.

72
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:53,056
Grandpa Joe.

73
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,578
Is this your supper, Grandpa?

74
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,666
Well, it's yours too, Charlie.

75
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,536
I'm fed up with cabbage water.
It's not enough!

76
00:08:02,754 --> 00:08:03,914
- Charlie!
- It's all we have.

77
00:08:04,059 --> 00:08:05,755
What are you saying?

78
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,321
- How about this?
- Charlie, where'd you get that?

79
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:12,669
What difference does it make where
he got it? Point is: he got it.

80
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:14,366
It's my first pay day.

81
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:17,367
Good for you, Charlie.
We'll have a real banquet.

82
00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:18,758
Mom...?

83
00:08:19,106 --> 00:08:22,107
Here's what's left. You keep it.

84
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:24,369
Except for this.

85
00:08:24,585 --> 00:08:27,282
From now on, I'm going to
pay for your tobacco.

86
00:08:28,586 --> 00:08:31,892
No one's going to pay for it, Charlie.
I'm giving it up.

87
00:08:32,234 --> 00:08:34,544
Come on, Dad, it's only one pipe a day.

88
00:08:34,893 --> 00:08:38,242
When a loaf of bread looks like a
banquet, I've no right buying tobacco.

89
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:40,242
Go on, Grandpa.

90
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,591
Please take it.

91
00:08:49,114 --> 00:08:53,340
After I finished my paper route,
I was in front of Wonka's.

92
00:08:53,511 --> 00:08:55,816
There was this strange man there.

93
00:08:56,072 --> 00:08:57,769
I think he was a tinker.

94
00:08:57,943 --> 00:09:01,378
He was standing right behind me,
looking up at the factory.

95
00:09:01,595 --> 00:09:03,727
Just before he left he said,

96
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:07,205
"Nobody ever goes in,
and nobody ever comes out."

97
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:09,424
And right he was, Charlie.

98
00:09:09,641 --> 00:09:12,251
Not since the tragic day
that Willy Wonka locked it.

99
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:13,555
Why'd he lock it?

100
00:09:13,816 --> 00:09:17,121
Because all the other chocolate makers
in the world were sending in spies,

101
00:09:17,295 --> 00:09:20,774
dressed as workers, to steal
Mr. Wonka's secret recipes.

102
00:09:20,992 --> 00:09:24,949
Especially Slugworth... Oh,
that Slugworth, he was the worst!

103
00:09:25,471 --> 00:09:28,124
Finally Mr. Wonka shouted
"I shall be ruined!"

104
00:09:28,342 --> 00:09:32,255
"Close the factory!"
And that's just what he did.

105
00:09:32,473 --> 00:09:35,995
He locked the gates and
vanished completely.

106
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,127
And then suddenly, about three years later,

107
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,911
the most amazing thing happened.

108
00:09:42,128 --> 00:09:44,737
The factory started working
again, full blast!

109
00:09:44,954 --> 00:09:48,304
And more delicious candies were
coming out than ever before.

110
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,652
But the gates stayed
locked so that no one,

111
00:09:51,826 --> 00:09:54,610
not even Mr. Slugworth, could steal them.

112
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:58,828
But Grandpa, someone must be
helping Mr. Wonka work the factory.

113
00:09:59,002 --> 00:10:00,829
Thousands must be helping him.

114
00:10:01,003 --> 00:10:02,003
But who?

115
00:10:02,177 --> 00:10:03,872
Who are they?

116
00:10:04,351 --> 00:10:07,439
That is the biggest mystery of them all.

117
00:10:09,613 --> 00:10:11,831
- Charlie Bucket?
- Yes, Mr. Turkentine?

118
00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:14,223
I shall need an assistant.
Come and give me a hand.

119
00:10:17,398 --> 00:10:19,312
We have here nitric acid, glycerine...

120
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:21,616
and a special mixture of
my own.

121
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:24,617
Together it's horrible, dangerous stuff.
Blows you up.

122
00:10:24,835 --> 00:10:28,836
But mixed together in the right way, as only
I know how, what do you think it makes?

123
00:10:29,054 --> 00:10:30,488
- I don't know, sir.
- Of course you don't know.

124
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:32,141
You don't know
because only I know.

125
00:10:32,358 --> 00:10:35,838
If you knew and I didn't know, then you'd
be teaching me instead of me teaching you.

126
00:10:36,055 --> 00:10:40,665
And for a student to teach his teacher is
presumptuous and rude. Do I make myself clear?

127
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:42,144
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

128
00:10:42,361 --> 00:10:46,710
Now, mixed together in the right way
these three highly dangerous ingredients

129
00:10:46,884 --> 00:10:49,146
make the finest wart remover in the world.

130
00:10:49,494 --> 00:10:52,147
The trick is to pour them in in
equal amount.

131
00:10:52,363 --> 00:10:55,625
Now, Charlie, you take the
nitric acid and the glycerine,

132
00:10:55,843 --> 00:10:58,713
and I'll take my own special
mixture. You ready?

133
00:10:58,888 --> 00:11:01,062
Good lad. Pour.

134
00:11:03,193 --> 00:11:04,628
Did we do it wrong?

135
00:11:04,846 --> 00:11:07,542
No, certainly not. This
is for very big warts.

136
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:10,369
Now what's going on out there?

137
00:11:12,891 --> 00:11:15,239
You, Winkelmann, come here.
What's happening?

138
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,730
Willy Wonka's opening his factory.
He's gonna let people in.

139
00:11:18,022 --> 00:11:18,937
Are you sure?

140
00:11:19,016 --> 00:11:21,458
It's on the radio. And he's giving
truckloads of chocolate away.

141
00:11:21,676 --> 00:11:23,850
- Class dismissed!
- No, no, it's only for five people.

142
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,547
Class un-dismissed.

143
00:11:26,721 --> 00:11:29,634
He's hidden five Golden Tickets, and the
people who find them will win the big prize.

144
00:11:29,852 --> 00:11:31,071
Where's he hidden the tickets?

145
00:11:31,097 --> 00:11:33,972
Inside five Wonka Bars! You
gotta buy Wonka Bars to find 'em!

146
00:11:34,022 --> 00:11:35,972
Class re-dismissed!

147
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:49,161
<i>And now, details on the sudden announcement</i>

148
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:51,901
that has captured the
attention of entire world.

149
00:11:52,075 --> 00:11:54,728
Hidden among the countless
billions of Wonka Bars

150
00:11:54,946 --> 00:11:56,859
are five gold tickets,

151
00:11:57,076 --> 00:12:01,425
and to the five people who find them will
come the most fabulous prize one could wish for:

152
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:03,947
a lifetime supply of chocolate.

153
00:12:04,122 --> 00:12:07,862
<i>And as if this were not enough,
each winner before he receives his prize</i>

154
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,863
<i>will be personally escorted through
the top secret chocolate factory.</i>

155
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,428
They're all crazy!

156
00:12:11,602 --> 00:12:12,950
Sssshhh! The man's a genius!

157
00:12:13,124 --> 00:12:14,777
He'll sell a million bars.

158
00:12:15,951 --> 00:12:18,560
Grandpa, do you think I've got a
chance to find one?

159
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:21,474
One? I'm counting on you to find all five!

160
00:12:21,735 --> 00:12:23,039
One's enough for me.

161
00:12:23,115 --> 00:12:24,577
<i>Already we have reports coming in</i>

162
00:12:24,606 --> 00:12:26,460
<i>that the response is phenomenal.</i>

163
00:12:26,514 --> 00:12:28,444
<i>Wonka Bars are beginning to disappear</i>

164
00:12:28,475 --> 00:12:31,694
<i>from candy store shelves at
a rate to boggle the mind.</i>

165
00:12:31,866 --> 00:12:33,390
<i>Truly it is incredible,</i>

166
00:12:33,607 --> 00:12:36,391
<i>the way that Wonkamania
has descended upon the globe.</i>

167
00:12:36,608 --> 00:12:39,576
<i>While the world searches, we
watch and wait,</i>

168
00:12:39,623 --> 00:12:43,914
<i>wondering where the pursuit will lead and
how long the spirit of man will hold up</i>

169
00:12:43,991 --> 00:12:45,079
<i>under the strain.</i>

170
00:12:45,437 --> 00:12:49,568
I'm still having these dreams, Doctor, and I
still can't stop myself from believing them.

171
00:12:49,786 --> 00:12:51,656
I've told you, Mr. Hofstedder,

172
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,656
to believe in one's dreams
is a manifestation of insanity.

173
00:12:54,831 --> 00:12:57,657
And the sooner you accept this,
the sooner you will get well.

174
00:12:58,266 --> 00:13:02,964
But I dreamed the Archangel appeared and whispered
into my ear and told me where to find a Golden Wonka Ticket.

175
00:13:03,964 --> 00:13:05,312
And what exactly did he say?

176
00:13:05,486 --> 00:13:08,617
Well what difference does that
make? This was a dream, a fantasy.

177
00:13:08,834 --> 00:13:12,234
- I mean, you said just now...
- Shut up, Hofstedder, and tell me where the ticket is!

178
00:13:12,314 --> 00:13:14,271
We began with five Golden Tickets,

179
00:13:14,488 --> 00:13:19,098
like five lucky bolts of lightning ready to
strike without notice at any point on the map.

180
00:13:19,316 --> 00:13:22,186
No one knew where, no one knew when the
first one would hit.

181
00:13:22,359 --> 00:13:24,839
But as you all know, last
night we got our answer.

182
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:28,361
While we in America slept, the
first golden ticket was found

183
00:13:28,535 --> 00:13:31,623
in the small town of
Duselheim, Germany.

184
00:13:31,797 --> 00:13:36,320
We've been waiting several hours for the follow-up
story and we're finally ready with a live report.

185
00:13:36,972 --> 00:13:39,886
Proud we are, for the attention
of the entire world

186
00:13:40,016 --> 00:13:42,148
focuses today right here in Duselheim.

187
00:13:42,365 --> 00:13:44,887
A community suddenly thrust into prominence

188
00:13:45,018 --> 00:13:48,671
by the unexpected discovery of
the first Wonka Golden Ticket.

189
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:51,889
Its lucky finder is the son of our
most prominent parve butcher.

190
00:13:52,063 --> 00:13:54,759
The boy's name?
Augustus Gloop.

191
00:13:54,898 --> 00:14:00,022
Augustus Gloop, the pride of Duselheim,
the fame of Western Germany,

192
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:03,067
an example for the whole world.

193
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,241
Augustus, how does it make you feel
to be the first Golden Ticket finder?

194
00:14:06,415 --> 00:14:08,024
- Hungry.
- Any other feelings?

195
00:14:08,241 --> 00:14:11,242
Feel sorry for Wonka.
It's gonna cost him a fortune in fudge.

196
00:14:11,677 --> 00:14:13,851
Mr. Gloop, would you mind saying...

197
00:14:14,548 --> 00:14:17,982
Mrs. Gloop, would you care to say a few
words to the television audience?

198
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,071
I just knew Augustus would find a Golden Ticket.
Eating is his hobby, you know.

199
00:14:22,245 --> 00:14:23,465
We encourage him...

200
00:14:28,856 --> 00:14:30,900
Happy Birthday, Charlie!

201
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:34,248
Here you are, Charlie.

202
00:14:34,422 --> 00:14:35,900
Thank you.

203
00:14:42,598 --> 00:14:43,599
It's terrific.

204
00:14:43,773 --> 00:14:47,034
We each knitted a bit: Grandma
Georgina, Grandma Josephine, and me.

205
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:49,731
I did the end pieces with the little tassels.

206
00:14:49,948 --> 00:14:53,253
And here's a little gift from
Grandpa George and me.

207
00:14:53,427 --> 00:14:55,775
I think I know what this is.

208
00:14:56,775 --> 00:14:59,385
- It is! A Wonka!
- Open it, Charlie.

209
00:14:59,602 --> 00:15:00,950
Let's see that Golden Ticket.

210
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,685
- Wouldn't that be fantastic?
- It's not fair to raise his hopes.

211
00:15:03,951 --> 00:15:06,778
Never mind. Go on, open it, Charlie.
I want to see that gold.

212
00:15:06,952 --> 00:15:08,214
Stop it, Dad.

213
00:15:08,431 --> 00:15:13,475
- I've got the same chance as anybody else, haven't I?
- You've got more, Charlie, because you want it more.

214
00:15:13,737 --> 00:15:15,128
Go on, open it.

215
00:15:15,302 --> 00:15:16,911
Here goes.

216
00:15:19,738 --> 00:15:21,130
- I got it!
- Where? Where?

217
00:15:21,609 --> 00:15:22,609
Let's see!

218
00:15:22,913 --> 00:15:24,784
Fooled you, didn't I?

219
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:26,914
You thought I really had it.

220
00:15:28,436 --> 00:15:30,393
Never mind, Charlie.

221
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,133
You'll find one.

222
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,960
- Here, everybody have a bite.
- No no no, you eat it.

223
00:15:48,093 --> 00:15:50,877
<i>I wanted to be the first to find
a Golden Ticket, Daddy.</i>

224
00:15:51,094 --> 00:15:54,313
<i>I know, Angel.
We're doing the best we can.</i>

225
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:57,226
<i>I've got every girl on the
bleeding staff hunting for you.</i>

226
00:15:57,401 --> 00:15:59,618
All right, where is it?
Why haven't they found it?

227
00:15:59,836 --> 00:16:02,968
Veruca, sweetheart, I'm not a magician!

228
00:16:03,445 --> 00:16:04,489
Give me time!

229
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:07,794
I want it now! What's the matter
with those twerps down there?

230
00:16:08,012 --> 00:16:11,491
For five days now the entire
flipping factory's been on the job.

231
00:16:11,665 --> 00:16:14,405
They haven't shelled a peanut
in there since Monday.

232
00:16:14,622 --> 00:16:18,102
They've been shelling flaming
chocolate bars from dawn to dusk.

233
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:19,668
Make 'em work nights.

234
00:16:21,668 --> 00:16:23,451
Come along, come along,
you girls,

235
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:26,495
put a jack in it or you'll be out
on your ears, every one of you!

236
00:16:26,756 --> 00:16:27,818
And listen to this.

237
00:16:27,849 --> 00:16:33,105
The first girl that finds a Golden Ticket
gets a one pound bonus in her pay bucket!

238
00:16:33,323 --> 00:16:35,019
What do you think of that?

239
00:16:37,107 --> 00:16:38,542
They're not even trying.

240
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,108
They don't want to find it.
They're jealous of me.

241
00:16:41,325 --> 00:16:43,500
Sweetheart, I can't push 'em no harder.

242
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,066
Nineteen thousand bars
an hour they're shelling.

243
00:16:46,283 --> 00:16:48,631
Seven hundred and sixty
thousand they've done so far.

244
00:16:48,849 --> 00:16:49,893
You promised, Daddy!

245
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,719
You promised I'd have
it the very first day!

246
00:16:52,936 --> 00:16:56,807
You're going to very unpopular around here,
Henry, if you don't deliver soon.

247
00:16:57,069 --> 00:17:00,330
It breaks my heart, Henrietta.
I hate to see her unhappy.

248
00:17:00,547 --> 00:17:02,069
I won't talk to you ever again.

249
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:05,593
You're a rotten, mean father.
You never give me anything I want.

250
00:17:05,766 --> 00:17:07,593
And I won't go to school 'til I have it.

251
00:17:07,767 --> 00:17:10,376
Veruca, sweetheart, angel...

252
00:17:10,724 --> 00:17:13,334
Now. There are only four
tickets left in the whole world,

253
00:17:13,551 --> 00:17:16,161
and the whole ruddy
world's hunting for them.

254
00:17:16,377 --> 00:17:17,204
What can I do?

255
00:17:18,465 --> 00:17:20,727
I got it! I got it, Mr. Salt, here it is!

256
00:17:22,728 --> 00:17:25,641
It's about time too! I want it!

257
00:17:30,555 --> 00:17:33,512
Give me that ticket! It's mine!

258
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:36,209
I've found a Golden Ticket!

259
00:17:41,906 --> 00:17:42,950
Thank God for that.

260
00:17:43,168 --> 00:17:46,299
Aye. Happiness is what
counts with children.

261
00:17:46,472 --> 00:17:48,560
Happiness and harmony.

262
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:53,778
This, ladies and gentlemen, is the sign of
our times, the symbol of the havoc,

263
00:17:53,996 --> 00:17:56,693
the mad craze that's
sweeping the world today.

264
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:01,042
Whatever corner of the globe we are in,
whichever of the five continents we're on,

265
00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:04,006
the great search for
Wonka Bars continues.

266
00:18:04,107 --> 00:18:08,373
We're now nearing the end of our forty-third
day in the hunt for Golden Tickets,

267
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,509
<i>and everywhere we're beginning
to see signs of anxiety.</i>

268
00:18:12,001 --> 00:18:13,132
<i>Every hour on the hour,</i>

269
00:18:13,349 --> 00:18:16,002
<i>new shipments are being sent to
different points around the globe,</i>

270
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,351
<i>but they're just not moving fast enough.</i>

271
00:18:18,612 --> 00:18:23,003
And as time passes, the men who seek
them become more and more desperate.

272
00:18:23,178 --> 00:18:27,310
Gentlemen, I know how anxious you've
all been during these last few days,

273
00:18:27,527 --> 00:18:29,919
but now I think I can safely say

274
00:18:30,137 --> 00:18:32,833
that your time and money
have been well spent.

275
00:18:33,268 --> 00:18:37,051
We're about to witness the greatest
miracle of the machine age.

276
00:18:37,269 --> 00:18:41,095
Based on the revolutionary Computonian
Law of Probability this machine

277
00:18:41,313 --> 00:18:45,358
will tell us the precise location
of the three remaining

278
00:18:45,793 --> 00:18:47,446
Golden Tickets.

279
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:56,926
It says:

280
00:18:57,144 --> 00:18:59,971
"I won't tell. That
would be cheating."

281
00:19:06,406 --> 00:19:08,712
I am now telling the computer that,

282
00:19:08,886 --> 00:19:12,930
if it will tell me the correct answer,
I will gladly share with it

283
00:19:13,147 --> 00:19:14,930
the grand prize.

284
00:19:19,584 --> 00:19:20,193
He says:

285
00:19:20,411 --> 00:19:25,151
"What would a computer do with
a lifetime supply of chocolate?"

286
00:19:29,326 --> 00:19:34,240
I am now telling the computer exactly what he
can do with a lifetime supply of chocolate.

287
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,894
<i>And it can happen right here too,
unbelievable as it sounds</i>

288
00:19:40,111 --> 00:19:41,721
<i>right here in America.</i>

289
00:19:41,938 --> 00:19:46,591
<i>Where even in the smallest town,
the happiest of dreams can come true.</i>

290
00:19:46,722 --> 00:19:48,026
<i>Because folks, here she is.</i>

291
00:19:48,374 --> 00:19:52,071
<i>Miss Violet Beauregarde, finder of
Wonka's Golden Ticket Number Three,</i>

292
00:19:52,289 --> 00:19:53,984
<i>from Miles City, Montana.</i>

293
00:19:54,202 --> 00:19:55,594
<i>And with her, the proud parents:</i>

294
00:19:55,767 --> 00:19:59,127
<i>Mr. Beauregarde, a prominent local
politician, a great civic leader, a philosopher...</i>

295
00:19:59,203 --> 00:20:01,404
<i>Hi, folks, Sam Beauregarde here,
Square Deal Sam to you,</i>

296
00:20:01,552 --> 00:20:03,465
<i>with all of today's great give-away bargains.</i>

297
00:20:03,726 --> 00:20:06,086
<i>The finest values you'll get
anywhere in the entire country.</i>

298
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:08,423
<i>- Now this little number right here's a four door sedan...
- Come on, Dad, they don't want you!</i>

299
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,467
<i>- Violet, would you care to say a few words to the nation?
- Sure I will.</i>

300
00:20:10,728 --> 00:20:13,335
<i>Here it is, Golden Ticket Number
Three, and it's all mine.</i>

301
00:20:13,366 --> 00:20:14,639
<i>Tell us how it happened, Violet.</i>

302
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:17,948
<i>Well I'm a gum-chewer, normally, but when
I heard about these ticket things of Wonka's,</i>

303
00:20:18,122 --> 00:20:20,252
<i>I laid off the gum and
switched to candy bars instead.</i>

304
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:22,862
<i>Now, of course, I'm right back on gum.</i>

305
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:25,863
<i>I chew it all day except at meal
times when I stick it behind my ear.</i>

306
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,602
<i>- Violet...
- Cool it, Mother.</i>

307
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:32,690
<i>Now this piece of gum here is one that I've been chewing
on for three months solid, and that's a world record.</i>

308
00:20:32,907 --> 00:20:36,126
<i>It's beaten the record held by my best
friend Miss Cornelia Prinzmetel,</i>

309
00:20:36,343 --> 00:20:38,126
<i>and was she mad!</i>

310
00:20:38,344 --> 00:20:39,779
<i>Hi, Cornelia, how are you sweetie?</i>

311
00:20:39,997 --> 00:20:44,277
<i>Let me just butt in here for a moment to say that if
any of you folks watching are dissatisfied with your...</i>

312
00:20:53,856 --> 00:20:57,795
- Charlie, what are you doing here?
- I thought if you were ready, I'd walk you home.

313
00:20:58,001 --> 00:21:01,132
I wish I were, but it looks like I'm
gonna be here late tonight.

314
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:03,959
Oh, well, then I guess I'll be going.

315
00:21:04,177 --> 00:21:05,916
Well why don't you stay a minute?

316
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:09,178
Here, pull up a pile of clothes and sit down.

317
00:21:11,788 --> 00:21:13,309
Everything all right at school?

318
00:21:13,527 --> 00:21:14,310
Yep.

319
00:21:14,527 --> 00:21:15,615
Good.

320
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,050
Go on your newspaper route today?

321
00:21:18,267 --> 00:21:19,224
Just finished.

322
00:21:19,441 --> 00:21:20,529
Good.

323
00:21:23,225 --> 00:21:25,269
I wanted to tell you something.

324
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,836
They found the third ticket today.

325
00:21:30,053 --> 00:21:31,315
Did they?

326
00:21:31,756 --> 00:21:32,866
Yeah.

327
00:21:33,451 --> 00:21:34,381
Well...

328
00:21:35,055 --> 00:21:36,708
Guess I'll be going now.

329
00:21:38,056 --> 00:21:39,230
Is that all?

330
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:42,361
Well I thought you'd like to know.

331
00:21:42,578 --> 00:21:46,188
Most people are pretty interested.
I know I'm interested.

332
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:49,580
There are only two tickets
left, you know. Just two.

333
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:51,624
Pretty soon just one.

334
00:21:51,798 --> 00:21:53,538
I wonder who the lucky ones will be.

335
00:21:53,755 --> 00:21:55,800
Well in case you're wondering
if it'll be me, it won't be.

336
00:21:55,973 --> 00:21:58,887
Just in case you're wondering,
you can count me out.

337
00:21:59,142 --> 00:22:02,453
Charlie, there are a hundred
billion people in this world,

338
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:05,801
and only five of them
will find Golden Tickets.

339
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:09,194
Even if you had a sackful of money
you probably wouldn't find one.

340
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:14,065
And after this contest is over, you'll be no different
from the billions of others who didn't find one.

341
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:17,066
But I am different. I want it
more than any of them.

342
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:21,457
Charlie, you'll get your chance.
One day things will change.

343
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:24,024
When? When will they change?

344
00:22:24,285 --> 00:22:26,590
Probably when you least expect it.

345
00:22:29,851 --> 00:22:30,939
See you later.

While the rest of the world
goes on searching,

378
00:25:12,416 --> 00:25:14,257
here in the Southwest
it has actually happened.

379
00:25:14,677 --> 00:25:18,548
That's what I said, friends. There's only
one Golden Ticket left in the entire world,

380
00:25:18,766 --> 00:25:22,244
because right here in our own
community of Marble Falls, Arizona,

381
00:25:22,462 --> 00:25:24,245
is lucky winner number four.

382
00:25:24,462 --> 00:25:28,246
Now, the name soon to be heard around
the universe is Mr. Mike Teevee.

383
00:25:28,417 --> 00:25:30,247
Hey, Mike, do you think we
might shut that thing off?

384
00:25:30,464 --> 00:25:33,247
- No, are you crazy?
- He won't answer 'til the station break.

385
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,509
Mike, the country wants to hear
from you. The world is waiting...

386
00:25:35,727 --> 00:25:37,814
Can't you shut up? I'm busy.

387
00:25:38,031 --> 00:25:39,162
Boy, what a great show.

388
00:25:39,379 --> 00:25:41,162
I serve all his TV dinners right here.

389
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,859
He's never even been to the table.

390
00:25:42,981 --> 00:25:44,860
- You love to watch TV, Mike?
- You bet.

391
00:25:45,033 --> 00:25:46,686
What about that Golden Ticket, Mike?

392
00:25:46,903 --> 00:25:48,252
Hold it! I wanna catch this.

393
00:25:48,469 --> 00:25:51,427
- You like the killings, huh?
- What do you think life's all about?

394
00:25:51,644 --> 00:25:53,383
Mike, would you tell us...

395
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:56,514
Wait 'til I get a real one.

396
00:25:56,732 --> 00:25:57,820
Colt 45.

397
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,254
Pop won't let me have
one yet, will you, Pop?

398
00:26:00,472 --> 00:26:02,472
Not 'til you're twelve, son.

399
00:26:08,996 --> 00:26:10,866
Four down, and one to go.

400
00:26:11,084 --> 00:26:15,215
And somewhere out there, another lucky
person is moving closer and closer

401
00:26:15,433 --> 00:26:20,173
to finding the last of the most
sought after prizes in history.

402
00:26:20,652 --> 00:26:23,304
Though we cannot help but
envy him, whoever he is,

403
00:26:23,521 --> 00:26:26,478
and we might be tempted
to be bitter in our losing,

404
00:26:26,696 --> 00:26:29,653
we must remember there are
many more important things,

405
00:26:29,726 --> 00:26:32,248
many more important things.

406
00:26:32,698 --> 00:26:36,438
Offhand I can't think of what they are,
but I'm sure there must be something.

407
00:26:36,699 --> 00:26:38,721
And now for tomorrow's weather and...

408
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:43,787
Why'd you wake me up, Grandpa?
Is something wrong?

409
00:26:49,703 --> 00:26:51,877
Grandpa, that money was for tobacco.

410
00:26:52,137 --> 00:26:54,225
I told you, Charlie, I've given it up.

411
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:55,835
Go on, open it.

412
00:26:56,052 --> 00:26:58,095
One ticket left. Now
let's see some of that gold.

413
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:00,619
No, you do it. I can't.

414
00:27:01,705 --> 00:27:03,923
Something tells me we're
gonna be lucky this time.

415
00:27:04,141 --> 00:27:06,533
I've got a funny feeling inside.

416
00:27:08,403 --> 00:27:10,708
Which end shall I open first?

417
00:27:11,882 --> 00:27:13,970
That end. Just a tiny bit.

418
00:27:15,709 --> 00:27:18,319
- Like this?
- Now a bit more.

419
00:27:19,493 --> 00:27:22,406
- You finish it. I can't.
- No, Grandpa, you do it.

420
00:27:22,885 --> 00:27:24,233
All right,

421
00:27:24,581 --> 00:27:26,060
here goes.

422
00:27:32,322 --> 00:27:33,496
You know...

423
00:27:34,496 --> 00:27:38,498
I bet those Golden Tickets make
the chocolate taste terrible.

424
00:27:48,762 --> 00:27:50,849
Lot 403.

425
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:53,458
I can personally guarantee,
ladies and gentlemen,

426
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:57,372
that this is the one and only, the
absolutely last case of Wonka Bars

427
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:59,155
left in the United Kingdom.

428
00:27:59,373 --> 00:28:03,113
Shall we start the bidding at one thousand
pounds? Do I hear one thousand pounds?

429
00:28:03,896 --> 00:28:05,070
Fifteen hundred pounds?

430
00:28:05,288 --> 00:28:06,193
Two thousand?

431
00:28:06,248 --> 00:28:08,114
I have two thousand five hundred here.

432
00:28:08,374 --> 00:28:09,631
Four thousand pounds?

433
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,332
Forty-five hundred pounds!

434
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,159
Five thousand pou...

435
00:28:13,377 --> 00:28:15,030
Your Majesty!

436
00:28:18,552 --> 00:28:20,248
I'm sorry, Mrs. Curtis.

437
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:22,825
Doesn't seem to be anything
in his papers to give us a clue.

438
00:28:22,857 --> 00:28:24,901
They kidnapped my husband twelve hours ago.

439
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:27,280
When are we going to hear from them?
What do they want?

440
00:28:27,381 --> 00:28:31,033
Try to stay calm. They did it for ransom.
All we can do is wait to hear their demands.

441
00:28:31,556 --> 00:28:33,773
I'll give them anything, anything they want!

442
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:35,817
All I want is to have Harold back!

443
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:42,645
Go ahead, we're listening.

444
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:50,908
What did they ask for?
Whatever it is, they can have it.

445
00:28:51,822 --> 00:28:54,344
They want your case of Wonka Bars.

446
00:28:59,563 --> 00:29:01,259
Mrs. Curtis, did you hear me?

447
00:29:02,085 --> 00:29:04,999
It's your husband's life or
your case of Wonka Bars.

448
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,348
How long will they give me to think it over?

449
00:29:10,087 --> 00:29:11,044
That's it, that's it!

450
00:29:11,262 --> 00:29:13,697
It's all over!
The Wonka Contest is all over!

451
00:29:13,915 --> 00:29:15,958
The fifth and final ticket has been found,

452
00:29:16,176 --> 00:29:20,612
and we've got a live report coming in
directly now from Paraguay, South America.

453
00:29:20,786 --> 00:29:23,221
<i>Ladies and Gentlemen, it is finished.
The end has come.</i>

454
00:29:23,439 --> 00:29:26,135
<i>The fifth and last Golden
Ticket has just been found,</i>

455
00:29:26,352 --> 00:29:27,744
<i>right here in Paraguay.</i>

456
00:29:27,962 --> 00:29:30,919
<i>The finder is lucky Alberto Minoleta,</i>

457
00:29:31,093 --> 00:29:34,920
<i>the multimillionaire owner of gambling
casinos throughout South America.</i>

458
00:29:35,094 --> 00:29:38,573
<i>Here is the most recent picture
of Alberto the happy finder.</i>

459
00:29:40,008 --> 00:29:41,313
Turn it off.

460
00:29:42,791 --> 00:29:44,748
Well, that's that.

461
00:29:44,966 --> 00:29:46,488
No more Golden Tickets.

462
00:29:46,706 --> 00:29:48,749
A lot of rubbish, the whole thing.

463
00:29:48,967 --> 00:29:50,358
Not to Charlie it wasn't.

464
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:55,447
A little boy's got to have something in this
world to hope for. What's he got to hope for now?

465
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,707
Who's going to tell him?

466
00:29:57,761 --> 00:30:00,840
Let's not wake him.
He'll find out soon enough.

467
00:30:01,057 --> 00:30:02,536
Yeah, let him sleep.

468
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:05,145
Let him have one last dream.

469
00:30:12,886 --> 00:30:15,713
I've just decided to switch our
Friday schedule to Monday,

470
00:30:15,887 --> 00:30:19,541
which means that the test we take each
Friday on what we learned during the week

471
00:30:19,757 --> 00:30:22,019
will now take place on Monday
before we've learned it.

472
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,717
But since today is Tuesday,
it doesn't matter in the slightest.

473
00:30:24,933 --> 00:30:26,673
Pencils ready.

474
00:30:28,238 --> 00:30:31,152
Today we are going to learn about...

475
00:30:32,761 --> 00:30:33,631
percentages.

476
00:30:33,849 --> 00:30:37,458
And for an example, let's take
the recent unpleasantness.

477
00:30:37,675 --> 00:30:40,720
Supposing that there were a thousand
Wonka Bars in the world,

478
00:30:40,937 --> 00:30:44,721
and during the contest you each
opened a certain number of them.

479
00:30:44,938 --> 00:30:47,113
That number is...

480
00:30:47,417 --> 00:30:49,113
a percent. Everyone understand?

481
00:30:51,505 --> 00:30:54,027
You, Madeline Durkin, how many
Wonka Bars did you open?

482
00:30:54,593 --> 00:30:55,680
About a hundred.

483
00:30:56,028 --> 00:31:00,986
There are ten hundreds in a thousand.
Therefore you opened ten percent.

484
00:31:01,465 --> 00:31:03,725
You, Peter Goff, how many did you open?

485
00:31:03,943 --> 00:31:05,204
A hundred and fifty.

486
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:10,423
That's ten percent half over again, which
makes fifteen percent. Charlie Bucket.

487
00:31:10,641 --> 00:31:12,815
- How many did you open?
- Two.

488
00:31:13,033 --> 00:31:15,555
That's easy. Two hundred
is twice one hundred...

489
00:31:15,859 --> 00:31:17,251
Not two hundred.

490
00:31:17,817 --> 00:31:18,860
Just two.

491
00:31:19,469 --> 00:31:22,208
Two? What do you mean
you only opened two?

492
00:31:22,731 --> 00:31:24,688
I don't care very much for chocolate.

493
00:31:24,905 --> 00:31:26,775
Well I can't figure out just two,

494
00:31:26,992 --> 00:31:29,124
so let's pretend you opened two hundred.

495
00:31:29,298 --> 00:31:33,603
Now, if you opened two hundred Wonka Bars,
apart from being dreadfully sick,

496
00:31:33,821 --> 00:31:35,430
you'd have used up twenty
percent of one thousand,

497
00:31:35,647 --> 00:31:38,561
which is fifteen percent half
over again, ten percent...

498
00:32:27,457 --> 00:32:28,183
Hi.

499
00:32:28,269 --> 00:32:30,184
I'd like a bar of chocolate please.

500
00:32:30,314 --> 00:32:31,444
Yeah, sure.

501
00:32:31,662 --> 00:32:32,749
What kind?

502
00:32:32,967 --> 00:32:35,924
A Slugworth Sizzler?
A Wonka Scrumdidilyumptious?

503
00:32:36,142 --> 00:32:39,143
- Whichever's the biggest.
- Try a Wonka Scrumdidilyumptious.

504
00:32:40,012 --> 00:32:43,186
Now that all the tickets have been found,
I don't have to hide them anymore.

505
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:57,756
Hey, hey, hey, take it easy.

506
00:32:57,973 --> 00:33:00,148
You'll get a stomach ache
if you swallow it like that.

507
00:33:00,495 --> 00:33:02,366
- Bye.
- Bye now.

508
00:33:10,151 --> 00:33:13,499
I think I'll buy just one more,
for my Grandpa Joe.

509
00:33:13,717 --> 00:33:15,021
Sure.

510
00:33:16,021 --> 00:33:17,978
Why not try a regular Wonka Bar this time?

511
00:33:18,152 --> 00:33:19,501
Fine.

512
00:33:30,506 --> 00:33:35,505
- All right, all right, take it easy. One at a time.
- Did you hear the news?

513
00:33:35,766 --> 00:33:38,070
That gambler from Paraguay
made up a phony ticket.

514
00:33:38,288 --> 00:33:41,419
That means there's one Golden Ticket
still floating around somewhere.

515
00:33:41,594 --> 00:33:44,551
Can you imagine the nerve of that guy,
trying to fool the whole world?

516
00:33:45,076 --> 00:33:49,247
Aw, he really was a crook!
Well this means the contest goes on forever.

517
00:34:32,422 --> 00:34:35,292
Hey, you've got it!
You've got the last Golden Ticket!

518
00:34:35,304 --> 00:34:38,130
The kid's found the last Golden Ticket!

519
00:34:41,265 --> 00:34:44,001
Stand back there.
Leave the boy alone!

520
00:34:46,828 --> 00:34:48,176
Break it up.

521
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:51,529
Come on, Charlie! Hold on to that ticket!

522
00:34:51,655 --> 00:34:54,091
Run for it, Charlie!
Run straight home,

523
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,164
and don't stop 'til you get there!

524
00:35:28,012 --> 00:35:29,621
I congratulate you, little boy.

525
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:31,057
Well done.

526
00:35:31,492 --> 00:35:33,970
You found the fifth Golden Ticket.

527
00:35:34,188 --> 00:35:36,015
May I introduce myself?

528
00:35:36,232 --> 00:35:37,798
Arthur Slugworth.

529
00:35:38,015 --> 00:35:40,581
President of Slugworth
Chocolates, Incorporated.

530
00:35:41,407 --> 00:35:45,321
Now listen carefully because I'm
going to make you very rich indeed.

531
00:35:45,539 --> 00:35:49,236
Mr. Wonka is at this moment
working on a fantastic invention:

532
00:35:49,757 --> 00:35:52,019
The Everlasting Gobstopper.

533
00:35:52,715 --> 00:35:54,715
If he succeeds, he'll ruin me.

534
00:35:54,889 --> 00:35:58,195
So all I want you to do is to get hold
of just one Everlasting Gobstopper,

535
00:35:58,412 --> 00:36:01,761
and bring it to me so that I
can find the secret formula.

536
00:36:02,065 --> 00:36:05,675
Your reward will be ten
thousand of these.

537
00:36:05,892 --> 00:36:07,501
Think it over, will you?

538
00:36:07,763 --> 00:36:09,720
A new house for your family,

539
00:36:09,937 --> 00:36:13,198
and good food and comfort
for the rest of their lives.

540
00:36:14,068 --> 00:36:15,851
And don't forget the name:

541
00:36:16,069 --> 00:36:18,287
Everlasting Gobstopper.

542
00:36:47,642 --> 00:36:50,817
Look, everyone, look, I've got it!
The fifth Golden Ticket is mine!

543
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,730
You're pulling our legs, Charlie!

544
00:36:53,948 --> 00:36:56,269
There aren't any more Golden Tickets.

545
00:36:56,324 --> 00:36:59,429
No, Grandpa, the last one was a fake.
It said so in the papers.

546
00:36:59,472 --> 00:37:03,081
I found some money in the street, and I
bought a Wonka Bar, and the ticket was in it.

547
00:37:03,256 --> 00:37:05,604
Look at it, Grandpa, see for yourself!

548
00:37:06,169 --> 00:37:08,605
Read it, Joe, for heaven's sake!

549
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:13,431
"Greetings to you, the lucky
finder of this Golden Ticket,"

550
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:17,606
"from Mr. Willy Wonka. Present
this ticket at the factory gates"

551
00:37:17,824 --> 00:37:22,086
"at ten o'clock in the morning of the first
day of October, and do not be late."

552
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:27,088
"You may bring with you one member
of your own family, but no one else."

553
00:37:27,305 --> 00:37:30,436
"In your wildest dreams
you could not imagine"

554
00:37:30,609 --> 00:37:33,469
"the marvellous surprises that await you!"

555
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,875
- Charlie, you've done it!
- I can't believe it.

556
00:37:35,899 --> 00:37:39,917
Grandpa? It says I can take
somebody with me.

557
00:37:40,134 --> 00:37:41,787
I wish you could go.

558
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:53,442
Charlie.

559
00:37:59,423 --> 00:38:02,140
Ah, that's good, Charlie.

560
00:38:02,314 --> 00:38:03,880
Now help me up.

561
00:38:17,362 --> 00:38:18,448
Are you okay?

562
00:38:18,666 --> 00:38:20,710
Oh yeah, I'm fine, Charlie.

563
00:38:28,049 --> 00:38:28,986
Joe!

564
00:38:30,791 --> 00:38:32,235
Watch it, Joe!

565
00:38:41,411 --> 00:38:42,890
Look at me!

566
00:38:45,934 --> 00:38:47,761
Look at me!

567
00:38:48,413 --> 00:38:50,414
Up and about...

568
00:38:52,066 --> 00:38:55,372
I haven't done this in twenty years.

569
00:38:56,402 --> 00:38:57,550

00:41:54,027 --> 00:41:58,147
Jumping Crocodiles, Charlie! We've got a lot to do.
Comb your hair, wash your face, polish your shoes...

610
00:41:58,289 --> 00:42:01,334
- I'll take care of everything, Dad.
- We don't have too much time.

611
00:42:01,508 --> 00:42:06,553
Grandpa... On the way home today,
I ran into Mr. Slugworth.

612
00:42:30,385 --> 00:42:32,081
Hey, Mom, we're on TV!

613
00:42:32,298 --> 00:42:34,255
Hi, everybody in Marble Falls!

614
00:42:34,473 --> 00:42:37,126
Hi, Billy! Hi, Maggie! Hi, Fishface!

615
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,170
How do I look?

616
00:42:38,386 --> 00:42:39,865
- You guys ready?
- Yeah, you're on.

617
00:42:40,083 --> 00:42:41,843
Well, this is it folks. This is the big day,

618
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:46,780
the historic day on which Willy Wonka has promised to
open his gates and shower gifts on the five lucky winners.

619
00:42:46,998 --> 00:42:50,302
From all over the globe, people have
gathered here waiting for the hour to strike,

620
00:42:50,477 --> 00:42:53,738
waiting to catch a glimpse of that
legendary magician Mr. Willy Wonka.

621
00:42:56,261 --> 00:42:59,696
Hi, friends. Sam Beauregarde here. The next time
you're in Miles City, Montana, don't forget to visit...

622
00:42:59,914 --> 00:43:02,785
Cut it out, Dad. For heaven's
sake, this is my show!

623
00:43:03,002 --> 00:43:06,829
Hi, Cornelia sweetie, I've still got it.
And how's this for a stretch?

624
00:43:20,006 --> 00:43:22,312
I want to go in first before anybody else.

625
00:43:22,528 --> 00:43:24,355
Anything you say, sweetheart.

626
00:43:27,617 --> 00:43:31,053
Save some room for later,
Augustus liebling.

627
00:43:33,967 --> 00:43:37,663
Grandpa? I don't believe it. We did it.
We're actually going in.

628
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,620
We're going to see the greatest of them all:
Mr. Willy Wonka!

629
00:45:23,249 --> 00:45:27,910
Thank you. Thank you.

630
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:30,128
Welcome, my friends.

631
00:45:30,389 --> 00:45:32,388
Welcome to my chocolate factory.

632
00:45:33,085 --> 00:45:34,303
Would you come forward please?

633
00:45:35,477 --> 00:45:37,678
Veruca first! Get back, you!
Come on, Veruca sweetheart!

634
00:45:43,523 --> 00:45:45,957
That's Slugworth! That's the
one I've told you about!

635
00:45:50,611 --> 00:45:53,481
Welcome. It's nice to have you here.

636
00:45:53,872 --> 00:45:55,308
I'm so glad you could come.

637
00:45:55,482 --> 00:45:59,396
This is going to be such an
exciting day. I hope you enjoy it.

638
00:45:59,788 --> 00:46:01,310
I think you will.

639
00:46:01,657 --> 00:46:03,789
And now would you please
show me your Golden Tickets?

640
00:46:04,876 --> 00:46:06,311
I'm Veruca Salt.

641
00:46:06,485 --> 00:46:08,616
My dear Veruca, what a pleasure.

642
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:10,965
And how pretty you look
in that lovely mink coat.

643
00:46:11,139 --> 00:46:12,834
I've got three others at home.

644
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:17,227
And Mr. Salt, overjoyed to see you, sir.
Would you just step over there for a minute?

645
00:46:17,488 --> 00:46:18,488
Augustus Gloop.

646
00:46:18,662 --> 00:46:20,663
Augustus, my dear boy,

647
00:46:20,837 --> 00:46:23,446
how good to see you,
and in such fine shape.

648
00:46:23,663 --> 00:46:27,196
And this must be the radiant Mrs.
Gloop. Just over there, dear lady.

649
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:30,881
- Violet Beauregarde.
- Darling child, welcome to Wonka's.

650
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,535
What kind of gum you got here?

651
00:46:32,753 --> 00:46:34,014
Charming, charming!

652
00:46:34,492 --> 00:46:35,840
Sam Beauregarde here, Mr. Wonka.

653
00:46:36,015 --> 00:46:37,537
My dear sir, what a genuine pleasure.

654
00:46:37,754 --> 00:46:40,973
If ever you need anything in the automotive line,
just call on Sam B, phone number's on the card.

655
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:43,277
With Sam B, it's a guarantee.

656
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:45,887
- I'm Mike Teevee.
- Mike.

657
00:46:46,104 --> 00:46:47,582
Wham! You're dead!

658
00:46:47,757 --> 00:46:49,061
Wonderful to meet you, Mike.

659
00:46:49,279 --> 00:46:51,062
And Mrs. Teevee, how do you do?

660
00:46:51,279 --> 00:46:53,932
- What an adorable little boy you have.
- Thank you.

661
00:46:54,628 --> 00:46:55,411
Charlie Bucket.

662
00:46:55,628 --> 00:47:00,069
Well, well, Charlie Bucket, I read all about you in the papers.
I'm so happy for you. And who is this gentleman?

663
00:47:00,282 --> 00:47:01,848
My grandfather, Grandpa Joe.

664
00:47:02,021 --> 00:47:03,102
Delighted to meet you, sir.

665
00:47:03,196 --> 00:47:05,326
Overjoyed, enraptured, entranced.

666
00:47:05,544 --> 00:47:07,023
Are we ready? Yes! Good!

667
00:47:07,371 --> 00:47:08,719
In we go!

668
00:47:43,254 --> 00:47:46,425
Now. Hats, coats, galoshes, over here.

669
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:49,642
But hurry please, we have so
much time and so little to see.

670
00:47:49,816 --> 00:47:51,774
Wait a minute! Strike that.

671
00:47:51,991 --> 00:47:54,340
Reverse it. Thank you.

672
00:47:56,253 --> 00:47:59,559
- When do I get my chocolate?
- First take off your coat, Violet.

673
00:47:59,775 --> 00:48:01,255
Boy, what weird looking coat hangers.

674
00:48:03,864 --> 00:48:08,256
Little surprises around every corner but
nothing dangerous. Don't be alarmed.

675
00:48:08,517 --> 00:48:11,126
And as soon as your outer
vestments are in hand,

676
00:48:11,344 --> 00:48:12,692
we'll begin.

677
00:48:13,344 --> 00:48:14,214
Now.

678
00:48:14,432 --> 00:48:17,389
Will the children kindly step up here?

679
00:48:28,435 --> 00:48:30,523
Accidents? What kind of accidents?

680
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:33,306
I didn't know we had to
sign anything for this tour.

681
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,046
I can't see what it says in the bottom.

682
00:48:35,567 --> 00:48:37,481
Violet? You first.

683
00:48:37,611 --> 00:48:38,742
Sign here.

684
00:48:38,959 --> 00:48:39,960
Hold it!

685
00:48:40,134 --> 00:48:42,395
Lemme through here, you kids.
Violet, baby, don't you sign anything there.

686
00:48:42,657 --> 00:48:43,874
What's this all about?

687
00:48:44,092 --> 00:48:45,700
Standard form of contract.

688
00:48:45,918 --> 00:48:49,571
Don't talk to me about contracts, Wonka.
I use 'em myself. They're strictly for suckers.

689
00:48:49,789 --> 00:48:53,051
Yes, but you wouldn't begrudge
me a little protection. A drop.

690
00:48:53,267 --> 00:48:54,616
I don't sign anything without my lawyer.

691
00:48:54,834 --> 00:48:57,574
- My Veruca don't sign anything either.
- Then she don't go in.

692
00:48:57,834 --> 00:48:59,400
I'm sorry, rules of the house.

693
00:48:59,618 --> 00:49:03,575
- I want to go in. Don't you dare stop me.
- I'm only trying to help you, sweetheart.

694
00:49:03,793 --> 00:49:08,142
Gimme that pen. You're
always making things difficult.

695
00:49:09,011 --> 00:49:12,621
Nicely handled, Veruca. She's a
girl who knows where she's going.

696
00:49:12,855 --> 00:49:13,753
Violet.

697
00:49:13,795 --> 00:49:15,622
Wait a minute, what's all that
small print there at the bottom?

698
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:19,034
Oh, if you have any problems,
dial information, thank you for calling.

699
00:49:19,162 --> 00:49:21,021
- Mike, Augustus.
- Violet.

700
00:49:21,318 --> 00:49:22,248
Violet!

701
00:49:22,536 --> 00:49:25,016
I assume there's an accident
indemnity clause.

702
00:49:25,233 --> 00:49:26,233
Never between friends.

703
00:49:26,407 --> 00:49:29,972
Saw this in a movie once. Guy
signed his wife's insurance policy.

704
00:49:30,408 --> 00:49:32,191
- Then he bumped her off.
- Clever.

705
00:49:32,365 --> 00:49:33,286
What about me, Grandpa?

706
00:49:33,496 --> 00:49:35,844
Sign away, Charlie.
We got nothing to lose.

707
00:49:36,061 --> 00:49:37,790
Let's go in. Come on!

708
00:49:37,806 --> 00:49:41,368
Patience, patience, little dear.
Everything has to be in order.

709
00:49:41,584 --> 00:49:43,411
Everyone's signed? Yes?

710
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,238
Good. On we go!

711
00:49:54,762 --> 00:49:56,328
Ninety-nine...

712
00:49:56,676 --> 00:49:57,850
forty-four...

713
00:49:58,154 --> 00:49:59,937
one hundred percent pure.

714
00:50:01,590 --> 00:50:03,765
Just through the other door please.

715
00:50:06,113 --> 00:50:07,940
Uh, Wonka, there's some mistake here...

716
00:50:08,592 --> 00:50:10,332
There is no other door.

717
00:50:10,593 --> 00:50:11,723
There's no way out!

718
00:50:11,941 --> 00:50:14,724
Well I know there's a door here someplace.

719
00:50:14,942 --> 00:50:16,862
I don't like this, Wonka.
I don't like it at all!

720
00:50:17,029 --> 00:50:18,469
Is this a trick or something, Wonka?

721
00:50:18,508 --> 00:50:20,421
Help! Mr. Wonka, help!

722
00:50:20,595 --> 00:50:22,074
I'm getting squashed! Save me!

723
00:50:22,292 --> 00:50:24,640
Is it my soul that calls upon my name?

724
00:50:24,857 --> 00:50:26,293
Let me out or I'll scream!

725
00:50:26,596 --> 00:50:28,988
- Somebody's touching me.
- Now look here, Wonka...

726
00:50:29,206 --> 00:50:33,773
Excuse me, question time will come at the end of
the session. We must press on. Come along...

727
00:50:33,901 --> 00:50:34,893
Come along.

728
00:50:35,026 --> 00:50:37,035
- Ah, here we are.
- Oh, don't be a darn fool, Wonka.

729
00:50:37,252 --> 00:50:38,687
That's the way we came in.

730
00:50:38,992 --> 00:50:41,122
It is? Are you sure?

731
00:50:41,341 --> 00:50:43,565
We've just come through there.

732
00:50:43,775 --> 00:50:45,211
Huh. How do you like that?

733
00:50:46,515 --> 00:50:48,386
- There we are...
- What is this, Wonka?

734
00:50:48,602 --> 00:50:49,523
Some kind of fun house?

735
00:50:50,342 --> 00:50:51,473
Why, having fun?

736
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:53,647
I've had enough. I'm not going in there.

737
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,585
Come on, Violet, we're getting out of here.

738
00:50:55,692 --> 00:50:59,127
Oh, you can't get out backwards.
You've gotta go forwards to go back.

739
00:50:59,344 --> 00:51:00,867
Better press on.

740
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:04,303
- Hey, the room is getting smaller!
- No, it's not.

741
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:06,737
- He's getting bigger.
- He's at it again.

742
00:51:07,216 --> 00:51:09,912
- Where's the chocolate?
- I doubt if there is any.

743
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:12,218
I doubt if any of us
will get out of here alive.

744
00:51:12,284 --> 00:51:15,098
Oh, you should never, never doubt
what nobody is sure about.

745
00:51:15,305 --> 00:51:17,479
You're not squeezing me
through that tiny door.

746
00:51:17,697 --> 00:51:20,297
You're off your bleeding nut, Wonka.
No one can get through there.

747
00:51:20,394 --> 00:51:21,742
My dear friends,

748
00:51:21,959 --> 00:51:24,829
you are now about to enter the nerve centre

749
00:51:25,047 --> 00:51:27,309
to the entire Wonka Factory.

750
00:51:28,221 --> 00:51:32,354
Inside this room, all of my
dreams become realities.

751
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:34,615
And some of my realities
become dreams.

752
00:51:34,788 --> 00:51:38,616
And almost everything you
will see is eatible. Edible.

753
00:51:38,833 --> 00:51:40,790
I mean, you can eat almost everything.

754
00:51:41,051 --> 00:51:42,552
Let me in, I'm starving!

755
00:51:42,584 --> 00:51:45,834
Now, don't get overexcited!
Don't lose your head Augustus.

756
00:51:46,009 --> 00:51:47,792
We wouldn't want anyone to lose that!

757
00:51:49,923 --> 00:51:51,053
Yet.

758
00:51:51,228 --> 00:51:53,054
Now, the combination...

759
00:51:53,229 --> 00:51:55,228
This is a musical lock.

760
00:51:57,751 --> 00:51:58,969
Rachmaninoff.

761
00:51:59,187 --> 00:52:00,788
Ladies and gentlemen,

762
00:52:01,579 --> 00:52:03,274
boys and girls...

763
00:52:04,275 --> 00:52:05,970
The chocolate room.

764
00:52:44,112 --> 00:52:46,025
Hold your breath.
Make a wish.

765
00:52:47,069 --> 00:52:48,199
Count to three.

766
00:52:49,069 --> 00:52:50,505
♪ Come with me ♪

767
00:52:50,896 --> 00:52:52,679

What a disgusting, dirty river.

800
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:20,081
It's industrial waste, that.

801
00:56:20,255 --> 00:56:22,386
You've ruined your
watershed, Wonka. It's polluted.

802
00:56:22,603 --> 00:56:23,604
It's chocolate.

803
00:56:23,778 --> 00:56:25,083
That's chocolate?!?

804
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:26,474
That's chocolate.

805
00:56:26,691 --> 00:56:28,126
A chocolate river.

806
00:56:28,344 --> 00:56:30,780
That's the most fantastic
thing I've ever seen.

807
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:32,606
Ten thousand gallons an hour.

808
00:56:32,867 --> 00:56:36,607
And look at my waterfall.
That's the most important thing.

809
00:56:37,694 --> 00:56:41,478
It's mixing my chocolate.
It's actually churning my chocolate.

810
00:56:41,695 --> 00:56:45,435
You know, no other factory in the
world mixes its chocolate by waterfall.

811
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:49,089
But it's the only way if
you want it just right...

812
00:56:49,306 --> 00:56:51,698
Grandpa, look over there across the river!

813
00:56:52,046 --> 00:56:53,003
They're little men!

814
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:55,133
Jumping crocodiles, Charlie!

815
00:56:55,482 --> 00:56:57,309
Now we know who makes the chocolate.

816
00:56:57,525 --> 00:57:00,700
I never saw anybody with
an orange face before.

817
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:03,483
Funny-looking people, aren't they, Wonka?

818
00:57:03,657 --> 00:57:05,195
What are they doing there?

819
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:07,091
It must be creaming and sugaring time.

820
00:57:07,137 --> 00:57:10,225
- Well they can't be real people.
- Well of course they're real people.

821
00:57:10,485 --> 00:57:11,617
Stuff and nonsense.

822
00:57:11,791 --> 00:57:13,747
No, Oompa Loompas.

823
00:57:15,052 --> 00:57:15,878
From Loompaland.

824
00:57:16,052 --> 00:57:17,879
Loompaland? There's no such place.

825
00:57:18,044 --> 00:57:19,017
Excuse me, dear lady...

826
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,010
Mr. Wonka, I am a teacher of geography.

827
00:57:21,226 --> 00:57:22,662
Oh, well then you know all about it

828
00:57:22,704 --> 00:57:24,359
and what a terrible country it is.

829
00:57:24,576 --> 00:57:27,708
Nothing but desolate wastes
and fierce beasts.

830
00:57:27,925 --> 00:57:30,969
And the poor little Oompa Loompas
were so small and helpless,

831
00:57:31,143 --> 00:57:33,159
they would get gobbled up right and left.

832
00:57:33,214 --> 00:57:36,746
A Wangdoodle would eat ten of them
for breakfast and think nothing of it.

833
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:38,928
And so, I said:

834
00:57:39,276 --> 00:57:42,060
"Come and live with me
in peace and safety,"

835
00:57:42,276 --> 00:57:45,191
"away from all the Wangdoodles
and Hornswogglers"

836
00:57:45,364 --> 00:57:48,887
"and Snozzwangers and
rotten Vermicious Knids."

837
00:57:49,104 --> 00:57:53,062
Snozzwangers? Vermicious Knids?
What kind of rubbish is that?

838
00:57:53,279 --> 00:57:55,759
I'm sorry, but all questions
must be submitted in writing.

839
00:57:55,761 --> 00:57:57,823
And so, in the greatest of secrecy,

840
00:57:57,886 --> 00:58:01,717
I transported the entire population of
Oompa Loompas to my factory here.

841
00:58:01,934 --> 00:58:05,848
Hey, Daddy, I want an Oompa Loompa. I want
you to get me an Oompa Loompa right away.

842
00:58:06,022 --> 00:58:08,743
All right, Veruca, all right. I'll get
you one before the day is out.

843
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:11,415
I want an Oompa Loompa now!

844
00:58:11,444 --> 00:58:12,937
Can it, you nit!

845
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:15,416
Mmmmm... this stuff is terrific.

846
00:58:15,676 --> 00:58:18,982
- Grandpa, look at Augustus.
- Don't worry, he can't drink it all.

847
00:58:19,373 --> 00:58:22,983
Augustus, sweetheart,
save some room for later.

848
00:58:23,201 --> 00:58:27,202
Oh, uh, Augustus, please, don't do that. My
chocolate must never be touched by human hands.

849
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:30,681
Please don't do that! Don't do that.
You're contaminating my entire river.

850
00:58:30,898 --> 00:58:33,073
Please, I beg you, Augustus!

851
00:58:34,464 --> 00:58:35,595
My chocolate!

852
00:58:35,812 --> 00:58:36,900
Help!

853
00:58:38,074 --> 00:58:40,336
My chocolate! My beautiful chocolate.

854
00:58:41,814 --> 00:58:44,118
Don't just stand there. Do something!

855
00:58:44,336 --> 00:58:46,424
Help. Police. Murder.

856
00:58:46,719 --> 00:58:49,425
- Quick, Charlie. Here.
- Quick, Augustus, grab this!

857
00:58:50,381 --> 00:58:51,991
What-what's happening to him?

858
00:58:52,056 --> 00:58:53,853
- It looks like he's drowning.
- Dive in!

859
00:58:53,904 --> 00:58:55,295
- Save him!
- Oh, it's too late.

860
00:58:55,513 --> 00:58:56,905
- Too late?
- Oh, he's had it now,

861
00:58:57,079 --> 00:58:59,602
- the suction's got him.
- Augustus, come back.

862
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:01,211
Where is he?

863
00:59:01,427 --> 00:59:02,515
Watch the pipe.

864
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:05,255
How long is he going to stay down, Daddy?

865
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:07,864
- He can't swim.
- There's no better time to learn.

866
00:59:08,429 --> 00:59:10,039
There's his coat going up the pipe.

867
00:59:10,256 --> 00:59:11,300
Call a plumber.

868
00:59:11,518 --> 00:59:13,475
He's stuck in the pipe
there, isn't he, Wonka?

869
00:59:13,692 --> 00:59:15,053
It's his stomach that's done that.

870
00:59:16,171 --> 00:59:18,606
- He's blocking all the chocolate.
- Well, what happens now?

871
00:59:19,171 --> 00:59:23,434
Oh, the pressure'll get him out. Terrific
pressure is building up behind the blockage.

872
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,652
I wonder how long it's gonna
take him to push through.

873
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:28,913
The suspense is terrible.

874
00:59:29,131 --> 00:59:30,131
I hope it'll last.

875
00:59:33,219 --> 00:59:34,578
He'll never get out!

876
00:59:34,633 --> 00:59:36,380
Yes, he will, Charlie. Watch.

877
00:59:36,524 --> 00:59:39,742
Remember you once asked me
how a bullet comes out of a gun?

878
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:43,367
He's gone! He'll be made into
marshmallows in five seconds!

879
00:59:43,482 --> 00:59:46,396
- Impossible, my dear lady, that's absurd! Unthinkable!
- Why?

880
00:59:47,136 --> 00:59:49,528
Because that pipe doesn't go to the
marshmallow room. It goes to the fudge room.

881
00:59:49,702 --> 00:59:51,050
You terrible man.

882
00:59:53,789 --> 00:59:56,442
Take Mrs. Gloop straight to the
fudge room, but look sharp!

883
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:58,941
Or her little boy is liable to
get poured into the boiler.

884
00:59:59,052 --> 01:00:00,791
You've boiled him up, I know it!

885
01:00:00,965 --> 01:00:04,619
Nil desperandum, dear lady.
Across the desert lies the promised land.

886
01:00:04,836 --> 01:00:06,184
Goodbye, Mrs. Gloop.

887
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:10,924
Adieu! Auf wiedersehen.

Hey, what kind of place you
running here anyhow, Wonka?

903
01:01:07,483 --> 01:01:11,576
Madames et monsieurs, maintenant nous
allons faire un petit voyage par bateau.

904
01:01:11,636 --> 01:01:12,596
What's he talking about?

905
01:01:12,628 --> 01:01:16,409
Voulez-vous entrer le Wonkatania?

906
01:01:31,902 --> 01:01:33,207
Wow, what a boat!

907
01:01:33,424 --> 01:01:35,425
Ohhhh, looks good enough to eat.

908
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:38,231
That's quite a nice little canoe
you've got there, Wonka.

909
01:01:38,252 --> 01:01:42,297
All I ask is a tall ship
and a star to sail her by.

910
01:01:42,513 --> 01:01:43,557
All aboard, everybody.

911
01:01:43,731 --> 01:01:45,775
Uh, ladies first, and that means Veruca.

912
01:01:45,993 --> 01:01:48,950
If she's a lady, I'm a Vermicious Knid.

913
01:01:49,168 --> 01:01:52,734
- You sure this thing'll float, eh, Wonka?
- With your buoyancy, sir, rest assured.

914
01:01:52,908 --> 01:01:55,126
She's very pretty, but is she seaworthy?

915
01:01:55,343 --> 01:01:58,909
Nothing to worry about, my dear lady.
I take good care of my guests.

916
01:01:59,081 --> 01:02:01,552
Yeah, you took real good care of that
August kid over there, that's for sure.

917
01:02:01,578 --> 01:02:03,064
Everybody aboard?

918
01:02:04,432 --> 01:02:06,303
You're going to love this.

919
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:07,868
Just love it.

920
01:02:38,397 --> 01:02:42,356
Hey, Daddy, I want a boat like this.
A beautiful paddle boat, that's what I want.

921
01:02:42,572 --> 01:02:45,139
What she wants is a good kick in the pants.

922
01:02:45,487 --> 01:02:46,791
I think I'm gonna be seasick.

923
01:02:46,965 --> 01:02:48,605
- Here, try one of these.
- What are they?

924
01:02:48,661 --> 01:02:51,302
Rainbow drops. Suck 'em and you
can spit in seven different colours.

925
01:02:51,324 --> 01:02:52,967
Spitting's a dirty habit.

926
01:02:53,141 --> 01:02:54,750
I know a worse one.

927
01:03:06,492 --> 01:03:09,319
- What business you in, Salt?
- Nuts.

928
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:22,791
Hang on, where are we going?

929
01:03:23,018 --> 01:03:24,801
I don't know, but I don't like the
looks of that tunnel up there.

930
01:03:25,019 --> 01:03:26,323
Hey, Wonka, I want off!

931
01:03:26,541 --> 01:03:31,456
Round the world and home again,
that's the sailor's way!

932
01:03:32,107 --> 01:03:34,457
I don't like this ride, Daddy.

933
01:03:38,457 --> 01:03:40,241
We're going too fast!

934
01:03:40,457 --> 01:03:41,893
We're gonna sink, I know it!

935
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:44,241
- Why doesn't he stop the boat?
- Faster!

936
01:03:44,458 --> 01:03:46,699
Hang on, darling! Just close
your eyes and hang on tight!

937
01:03:51,287 --> 01:03:53,647
- What is this, a freak-out?
- Hey, this isn't funny, Wonka!

938
01:03:54,114 --> 01:03:56,244
You can't possibly see
where you're going, Wonka!

939
01:03:56,462 --> 01:03:58,375
You're right. I can't.

940
01:03:58,636 --> 01:04:00,550
Boy, what a great series this would make.

941
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:06,899
- This is kind of strange...
- Yeah, strange, Charlie, but it's fun! Ha ha!

942
01:04:08,987 --> 01:04:10,814
How much to get off the boat, Wonka?

943
01:04:13,075 --> 01:04:14,075
I think I'm gonna be sick.

944
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:15,728
I can take a joke, but this has gone too far.

945
01:04:15,902 --> 01:04:18,555
Tell that little guy to
turn us around, Wonka!

946
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:20,555
Now I am gonna be sick!

01:04:59,870 --> 01:05:02,349
Are the fires of hell a-glowing?

956
01:05:03,218 --> 01:05:05,828
Is the grisly reaper mowing?

957
01:05:06,045 --> 01:05:07,351
Yes!

958
01:05:07,524 --> 01:05:12,177
The danger must be growing,
for the rowers keep on rowing.

959
01:05:12,395 --> 01:05:15,396
And they're certainly not showing

960
01:05:15,657 --> 01:05:19,571
any signs that they are slowing!

961
01:05:24,311 --> 01:05:25,963
Oh, make him stop, Daddy!

962
01:05:26,018 --> 01:05:28,779
- Wonka, this has gone far enough!
- Quite right, sir!

963
01:05:28,877 --> 01:05:30,095
Stop the boat!

964
01:05:31,792 --> 01:05:33,531
- We're there
- Where?

965
01:05:33,749 --> 01:05:34,662
Here.

966
01:05:34,835 --> 01:05:38,489
A small step for mankind,
but a giant step for us.

967
01:05:38,837 --> 01:05:40,316
All ashore!

968
01:05:40,489 --> 01:05:42,490
Let me off this crate!

969
01:05:42,530 --> 01:05:45,707
- Now why don't they show stuff like that on TV?
- I don't know.

970
01:05:45,926 --> 01:05:46,969
What a nightmare.

971
01:05:47,143 --> 01:05:49,796
Daddy, I do not want a boat like this.

972
01:05:50,014 --> 01:05:50,884
Dairy cream.

973
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:52,014
Whipped cream.

974
01:05:52,144 --> 01:05:54,015
- Coffee cream.
- Vanilla cream.

975
01:05:54,927 --> 01:05:56,364
Hair cream?

976
01:05:56,397 --> 01:05:59,826
Meine Herrschaften, schenken
Sie mir ihre Aufmerksamkeit.

977
01:05:59,885 --> 01:06:01,103
That's not French.

978
01:06:01,709 --> 01:06:04,310
Sie kommen jetzt in den interessantesten

979
01:06:04,342 --> 01:06:07,756
und gleichzeitig geheimsten
raum meiner fabrik.

980
01:06:07,844 --> 01:06:09,367
I can't take much more of this.

981
01:06:09,443 --> 01:06:11,334
Meine Dammen und Herren,

982
01:06:12,019 --> 01:06:14,411
Der Inventing Room.

983
01:06:14,933 --> 01:06:17,586
Now remember, no messing about.

984
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:20,500
No touching, no tasting, no telling.

985
01:06:20,674 --> 01:06:21,587
No telling what?

986
01:06:21,761 --> 01:06:26,023
You see, all of my most secret inventions
are cooking and simmering in here.

987
01:06:26,349 --> 01:06:30,045
Old Slugworth would give his false
teeth to get inside for just five minutes,

988
01:06:30,098 --> 01:06:32,838
so don't touch a thing!

989
01:06:58,510 --> 01:06:59,336
Inventing room?

990
01:06:59,511 --> 01:07:01,380
It looks more like a Turkish bath to me.

991
01:07:01,598 --> 01:07:04,637
Even if Slugworth did get in here,
he couldn't find anything.

992
01:07:04,653 --> 01:07:07,729
- You got a garbage strike going on here, Wonka?
- Who does your cleaning up?

993
01:07:07,947 --> 01:07:09,508
Shouldn't you be wearing rubber gloves?

994
01:07:09,512 --> 01:07:11,644
You'll have the health inspectors
after you, you know that, don't you?

995
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:15,644
Invention, my dear friends,
is ninety-three percent perspiration,

996
01:07:15,862 --> 01:07:17,906
six percent electricity,

997
01:07:18,124 --> 01:07:19,907
four percent evaporation,

998
01:07:20,124 --> 01:07:22,429
and two percent butterscotch ripple.

999
01:07:22,646 --> 01:07:24,821
That's a hundred and five percent!

1000
01:07:25,038 --> 01:07:26,300
Any good?

1001
01:07:27,778 --> 01:07:28,822
Yes!

1002
01:07:29,213 --> 01:07:30,649
Excuse me...

1003
01:07:33,041 --> 01:07:36,477
Time is a precious thing. Never waste it.

1004
01:07:38,302 --> 01:07:42,086
- He's absolutely bonkers.
- And that's not bad.

I told you not to, silly boy.

1010
01:08:00,569 --> 01:08:01,874
Your teeth!

1011
01:08:02,092 --> 01:08:03,657
Boy, that's great stuff.

1012
01:08:04,005 --> 01:08:07,571
That's exploding candy for your enemies.
Great idea, isn't it?

1013
01:08:07,745 --> 01:08:10,354
Not ready yet, though, still too weak.
Needs more gelignite.

1014
01:08:20,531 --> 01:08:21,837
What's that for?

1015
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:23,532
Gives it a little kick.

1016
01:08:26,185 --> 01:08:27,359
Wonka?

1017
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:31,621
Butterscotch... butter gin...

1018
01:08:31,882 --> 01:08:33,665
you've got something going on
inside of here?

1019
01:08:33,883 --> 01:08:36,796
Candy is dandy, but liquor is quicker.

1020
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:42,842
What's the matter?
Too hot, Mr. Wonka?

1021
01:08:43,059 --> 01:08:45,103
Too cold. Far too cold.

1022
01:08:45,277 --> 01:08:47,626
That's gourmet cooking for you.

1023
01:08:48,452 --> 01:08:50,495
No! Don't. Please.

1024
01:08:50,844 --> 01:08:53,427
Forgive me, but no one
must look under there.

1025
01:08:53,473 --> 01:08:56,758
This is the most secret machine
in my entire factory.

1026
01:08:57,150 --> 01:09:00,586
- This is the one that's really going to sizzle old Slugworth.
- What's it do?

1027
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:04,412
- Would you like to see?
- Yeah.

1028
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:29,028
But what's it do?

1029
01:09:29,243 --> 01:09:31,649
Can't you see?
It makes Everlasting Gobstoppers.

1030
01:09:31,688 --> 01:09:34,116
Did you say "Everlasting Gobstoppers"?

1031
01:09:34,333 --> 01:09:37,613
That's right. For children with very little
pocket money. You can suck 'em forever.

1032
01:09:37,682 --> 01:09:39,465
I want an Everlasting Gobstopper.

1033
01:09:39,682 --> 01:09:40,639
- Me too!
- And me!

1034
01:09:40,857 --> 01:09:43,380
Fantastic invention.
Revolutionize the industry.

1035
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:47,250
You can suck 'em and suck 'em and suck 'em,
and they'll never get any smaller. Never.

1036
01:09:47,424 --> 01:09:48,664
At least I don't think they do.

1037
01:09:48,772 --> 01:09:50,816
- A few more tests.
- How do you make 'em?

1038
01:09:51,579 --> 01:09:54,556
I'm a trifle deaf in this ear.
Speak a little louder next time.

1039
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:58,209
- Who wants an Everlasting Gobstopper?
- Me! I do!

1040
01:09:59,210 --> 01:10:03,602
I can only give them to you if you solemnly
swear to keep them for yourselves

1041
01:10:03,776 --> 01:10:07,777
and never show them to another living
soul as long as you all shall live.

1042
01:10:08,386 --> 01:10:09,081
Agreed?

1043
01:10:09,299 --> 01:10:10,255
Agreed.

1044
01:10:10,473 --> 01:10:13,909
Good. One for you, and one
for you, and one for you.

1045
01:10:14,127 --> 01:10:15,474
Eh, what about Charlie?

1046
01:10:15,822 --> 01:10:17,084
And one for Charlie.

1047
01:10:17,301 --> 01:10:19,693
Hey, she's got two. I want another one!

1048
01:10:19,911 --> 01:10:22,694
- Stop squawking, you twit!
- Everybody has had one,

1049
01:10:22,912 --> 01:10:26,390
and one is enough for anybody.
Now come along.

1050
01:10:27,826 --> 01:10:29,522
Now over here, if you'll follow me,

1051
01:10:29,783 --> 01:10:31,957
I have something rather
special to show you.

1052
01:10:32,175 --> 01:10:33,654
Well, it's special, all right.

1053
01:10:34,175 --> 01:10:36,350
I only hope my Veruca doesn't want one.

1054
01:10:36,567 --> 01:10:37,697
What a contraption.

1055
01:10:37,915 --> 01:10:38,959
Isn't she scrumptious?

1056
01:10:38,993 --> 01:10:41,960
She's my revolutionary,
non-pollutionary mechanical wonder.

1057
01:10:42,165 --> 01:10:45,482
Now. Button, button, who's
got the button?

1058
01:10:45,917 --> 01:10:47,439
It's over there.

1059
01:10:48,005 --> 01:10:49,179
- Here?
- Yeah.

1060
01:11:05,269 --> 01:11:07,168
What you are witnessing, dear friends,

1061
01:11:07,216 --> 01:11:10,403
is the most enormous
miracle of the machine age:

1062
01:11:10,513 --> 01:11:13,707
the creation of a confectionery giant!

1063
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:24,798
- Finito!
- That's all?

1064
01:11:25,449 --> 01:11:27,450
That's all!? Don't you know what this is?

1065
01:11:27,711 --> 01:11:29,407
- By gum, it's gum!
- Wrong!

1066
01:11:29,624 --> 01:11:33,225
It's the most amazing, fabulous,
sensational gum in the whole world.

1067
01:11:33,321 --> 01:11:34,669
What's so fab about it?

1068
01:11:34,887 --> 01:11:38,018
- This little piece of gum is a three course dinner.
- Bull.

1069
01:11:38,235 --> 01:11:41,120
- No, roast beef, but I haven't got it quite right yet.
- I don't care

1070
01:11:41,167 --> 01:11:43,498
Oh, I wouldn't do that.
I really wouldn't.

1071
01:11:43,715 --> 01:11:45,455
So long as it's gum, then that's for me.

1072
01:11:45,629 --> 01:11:47,673
Violet, now don't you do anything stupid.

1073
01:11:47,890 --> 01:11:49,717
What's it taste like?

1074
01:11:50,065 --> 01:11:52,631
Madness! It's tomato soup!

1075
01:11:53,065 --> 01:11:55,806
It's hot and creamy I can actually feel it
running down my throat!

1076
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:57,675
- It's delicious!
- Stop, don't...

1077
01:11:57,893 --> 01:11:59,458
Why doesn't she listen to Mr. Wonka?

1078
01:11:59,676 --> 01:12:01,840
Because, Charlie, she's a nitwit.

1079
01:12:01,894 --> 01:12:03,721
This sure is great soup.

1080
01:12:03,894 --> 01:12:05,721
Hey, second course is coming up!

1081
01:12:05,895 --> 01:12:08,243
Roast beef and a baked potato! Mmmm.

1082
01:12:08,766 --> 01:12:10,505
With sour cream?

1083
01:12:11,504 --> 01:12:14,810
- What's for dessert, baby?
- Dessert? Here it comes.

1084
01:12:15,028 --> 01:12:19,073
Blueberry pie and cream! It's the most
marvellous blueberry pie that I've ever tasted!

1085
01:12:19,247 --> 01:12:21,725
- Holy Toledo, what's happening to your face?
- Cool it, Dad!

1086
01:12:21,942 --> 01:12:22,986
Lemme finish.

1087
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:24,813
Yeah, but your face is turning blue!

1088
01:12:25,031 --> 01:12:28,162
- Violet, you're turning violet, Violet!
- What are you talking about?

1089
01:12:28,336 --> 01:12:30,554
I told you I hadn't got it quite right yet.

1090
01:12:30,771 --> 01:12:33,163
You can say that again.
Look what it's done to my kid!

1091
01:12:33,337 --> 01:12:36,686
It always goes wrong when we
come to the dessert. Always.

1092
01:12:37,530 --> 01:12:39,078
Violet, what are you doing now?!?

1093
01:12:39,295 --> 01:12:41,252
- You're blowing up!
- I feel funny.

1094
01:12:41,470 --> 01:12:43,514
- I'm not surprised.
- What's happening?

1095
01:12:43,688 --> 01:12:45,849
- You're blowing up like a balloon!
- Like a blueberry.

1096
01:12:45,862 --> 01:12:47,775
- Somebody do something! Call a doctor!
- Stick her with a pin.

1097
01:12:48,124 --> 01:12:50,516
- She'll pop!
- It happens every time!

1098
01:12:50,690 --> 01:12:53,733
- They all become blueberries.
- You've really done it this time, haven't you, Wonka?

1099
01:12:53,951 --> 01:12:55,516
I'll break you for this.

1100
01:12:55,734 --> 01:12:56,960
Oh, well, I'll get it right in the end.

1101
01:12:56,998 --> 01:12:58,690
Help! Help!

1102
01:12:58,866 --> 01:13:01,344
We've got to let the air out of her, quick!

1103
01:13:01,605 --> 01:13:02,780
There's no air in there.

1104
01:13:02,953 --> 01:13:04,519
- That's juice.
- Juice?!

1105
01:13:04,736 --> 01:13:07,867
Would you roll the young lady down
to the juicing room at once, please?

1106
01:13:08,041 --> 01:13:10,086
- What for?
- For squeezing.

1107
01:13:10,303 --> 01:13:12,695
She has to be squeezed immediately
before she explodes.

1108
01:13:12,913 --> 01:13:15,261
- Explodes?!
- It's a fairly simple operation.

Wonka, if it's the last thing I ever do!

1124
01:14:13,276 --> 01:14:15,885
I got a blueberry for a daughter...

1125
01:14:16,843 --> 01:14:20,626
Where is fancy bred?
In the heart, or in the head?

1126
01:14:22,105 --> 01:14:23,626
Shall we roll on?

1127
01:14:27,889 --> 01:14:29,237
Thank you.

1128
01:14:30,063 --> 01:14:34,500
Well, well, well... two naughty,
nasty little children gone.

1129
01:14:35,065 --> 01:14:38,501
Three good, sweet little children left.

1130
01:14:40,588 --> 01:14:43,415
Hurry, please, long way to go yet.

1131
01:14:46,893 --> 01:14:49,025
Wait a minute. Must show you this.

1132
01:14:49,243 --> 01:14:51,851
Lickable wallpaper for nursery walls.

1133
01:14:52,069 --> 01:14:56,635
Lick an orange, it tastes like an orange. Lick a
pineapple, it tastes like a pineapple. Go ahead, try it.

1134
01:14:58,288 --> 01:15:00,245
Mmm, I got a plum.

1135
01:15:00,462 --> 01:15:03,898
Grandpa, this banana's
fantastic! It tastes so real.

1136
01:15:04,116 --> 01:15:07,203
Try some more. The strawberries
taste like strawberries.

1137
01:15:07,421 --> 01:15:09,813
The snozzberries taste like snozzberries!

1138
01:15:10,030 --> 01:15:13,205
Snozzberries? Who ever
heard of a snozzberry?

1139
01:15:14,205 --> 01:15:16,641
We are the music-makers,

1140
01:15:16,989 --> 01:15:20,293
and we are the dreamers of dreams.

1141
01:15:21,381 --> 01:15:22,903
Come along, come along.

1142
01:15:25,904 --> 01:15:28,731
Something very unusual in here.

1143
01:15:29,079 --> 01:15:32,384
Bubbles, bubbles everywhere,
but not a drop to drink...

1144
01:15:32,558 --> 01:15:33,385
Yet.

1145
01:15:33,559 --> 01:15:35,080
What's it making, Mr. Wonka?

1146
01:15:35,254 --> 01:15:39,379
Fizzy Lifting Drinks. They fill you with gas,
and the gas is so terrifically lifting

1147
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:41,816
that it lifts you right off the
ground like a balloon.

1148
01:15:41,863 --> 01:15:44,387
Oh, isn't it high! Gosh!

1149
01:15:44,519 --> 01:15:46,475
But I daren't sell it yet.
It's still too powerful.

1150
01:15:46,582 --> 01:15:48,013
Come on, let us try some! Please?

1151
01:15:48,606 --> 01:15:52,954
No, no, no. Absolutely not. There'd be
children floating around all over the place.

1152
01:15:53,172 --> 01:15:55,085
Come along now. Don't hang about.

1153
01:15:55,782 --> 01:15:58,173
You're going to be wild about this next room.

1154
01:15:59,435 --> 01:16:01,827
Let's take a drink,
Charlie. Nobody's watching.

1155
01:16:02,045 --> 01:16:03,784
A small one won't hurt us.

1156
01:16:09,219 --> 01:16:10,611
Mmmm, not bad.

1157
01:16:12,785 --> 01:16:14,047
Well?

1158
01:16:14,308 --> 01:16:15,874
Nothing's happening.

1159
01:16:16,135 --> 01:16:19,352
You're right, Charlie. I
can't understand why...

1160
01:16:21,788 --> 01:16:23,441
Oh, oh, oh, I feel terribly strange...

1161
01:16:23,615 --> 01:16:26,495
- What do we do now, Grandpa?
- I don't know, Charlie, but aaaah! Oh! Oh!

1162
01:16:27,225 --> 01:16:31,443
- We're in big trouble! Mr. Wonka isn't gonna like this.
- We can't stay up here all day!

1163
01:16:31,617 --> 01:16:33,444
- You're right, Charlie, but...
- I'm gonna try and get down.

1164
01:16:33,662 --> 01:16:36,661
All right, Charlie, but please...
be very careful.

1165
01:16:37,662 --> 01:16:41,507
Hey, it's fun, Grandpa! It works!
Come on in, the air's fine!

1166
01:16:41,547 --> 01:16:42,500
Oh, I don't know, Charlie.

1167
01:16:42,546 --> 01:16:44,707
- I haven't been swimming in twenty years, I...
- Come on, give me your hand.

1168
01:16:44,881 --> 01:16:46,838
I don't think I ought to...

1169
01:16:49,491 --> 01:16:51,405
Oh. Oh! This is great!

1170
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,231
Hey, try this, Grandpa! Whee!

1171
01:16:53,579 --> 01:16:55,841
All right, Charlie, wait for me! Wheeeeee!

1172
01:16:59,668 --> 01:17:02,538
- I'm a shooting star!
- I'm a rocket!

1173
01:17:04,017 --> 01:17:05,886
Grandpa, this is really great.

1174
01:17:06,104 --> 01:17:08,148
Look, I'm a bird!

1175
01:17:10,193 --> 01:17:12,323
I feel light as a feather.

1176
01:17:13,193 --> 01:17:14,368
Look down, Charlie.

1177
01:17:14,541 --> 01:17:16,412
We're really high now.

1178
01:17:20,587 --> 01:17:22,282
Watch this, Grandpa.

1179
01:17:25,849 --> 01:17:27,370
Wonderful, Charlie.

1180
01:17:27,545 --> 01:17:29,720
- Try it, Grandpa.
- Oh, I don't know, I...

1181
01:17:29,937 --> 01:17:31,415
Come on, Grandpa.

1182
01:17:31,633 --> 01:17:33,112
All right.

1183
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:37,635
Hey, you did it, Grandpa.

1184
01:17:39,026 --> 01:17:40,853
I think I hit an air pocket.

1185
01:17:41,027 --> 01:17:43,071
You can fly to the moon this way.

1186
01:17:43,288 --> 01:17:45,246
Let's just fly south for the winter.

1187
01:17:45,463 --> 01:17:46,897
Why not?

1188
01:17:48,724 --> 01:17:49,812
I'm a bird!

1189
01:17:50,029 --> 01:17:51,334
I'm a plane!

1190
01:17:51,551 --> 01:17:52,552
I'm...

1191
01:17:52,813 --> 01:17:54,639
going too high!

1192
01:17:55,465 --> 01:17:57,727
Hey, Grandpa, I can't get down!

1193
01:17:57,988 --> 01:17:58,945
Help!

1194
01:17:59,162 --> 01:18:00,771
Grandpa, the fan!

1195
01:18:00,988 --> 01:18:03,032
Stay away from it, Charlie.
It'll chop us to bits!

1196
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:05,468
We're in trouble, Charlie. I can't stop!

1197
01:18:05,729 --> 01:18:07,033
It's pulling me in!

1198
01:18:07,251 --> 01:18:09,121
I can't stop! I can't stop!

1199
01:18:09,338 --> 01:18:11,687
- What do we do?
- Grab hold of something, quick!

1200
01:18:12,339 --> 01:18:14,905
There's nothing to grab on to! Help!

1201
01:18:15,427 --> 01:18:16,689
We're gonna get killed!

1202
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:18,688
Help! Help!

1203
01:18:18,906 --> 01:18:21,689
Mr. Wonka, please! Turn off the fan!

1204
01:18:25,125 --> 01:18:26,378
I'm going down!

1205
01:18:26,432 --> 01:18:30,039
Quick, Charlie, burp, burp! If you don't
get down you'll be chopped into ribbons!

1206
01:18:30,257 --> 01:18:32,388
- I can't! Help!
- You've gotta burp, Charlie.

1207
01:18:32,605 --> 01:18:34,475
It's the only way.

1208
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:37,041
'Atta boy, burp again.

1209
01:18:37,259 --> 01:18:39,129
'Atta boy, come on.

1210
01:18:41,434 --> 01:18:43,564
Ahhhh, that's wonderful, Charlie.

1211
01:18:50,088 --> 01:18:53,103
Grab onto me, Charlie.
We're gonna be all right now.

1212
01:19:01,308 --> 01:19:02,526
Good boy.

1213
01:19:03,135 --> 01:19:05,440
From now on, we keep
our feet on the ground.

1214
01:19:05,657 --> 01:19:07,745
Come on, let's catch up to the others!

1215
01:19:10,441 --> 01:19:12,094
I know what you're thinking.

1216
01:19:12,312 --> 01:19:14,312
They can't be doing what they're doing.

1217
01:19:14,530 --> 01:19:16,573
But they are. They have to.

1218
01:19:16,791 --> 01:19:18,922
I haven't met the Oompa Loompa
yet who could do it.

1219
01:19:19,488 --> 01:19:21,662
These are the geese that lay the golden eggs.

1220
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:24,532
As you can see, they're larger than
ordinary geese. As a matter of fact,

1221
01:19:24,707 --> 01:19:26,292
they're quadruple size geese,

1222
01:19:26,378 --> 01:19:30,186
which produce octuple size eggs
They're laying overtime right now for Easter.

1223
01:19:30,269 --> 01:19:31,751
But Easter's over!

1224
01:19:32,578 --> 01:19:33,969
They don't know that.

1225
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:36,448
I'm trying to get ahead for next year.

1226
01:19:38,057 --> 01:19:40,057
What happens if they drop
one of those eggs, Wonka?

1227
01:19:40,493 --> 01:19:43,058
An omelet fit for a king, sir.

1228
01:19:43,406 --> 01:19:45,015
Are they chocolate eggs?

1229
01:19:45,233 --> 01:19:48,060
Golden chocolate eggs.
That's a great delicacy.

1230
01:19:48,234 --> 01:19:49,713
But I wouldn't get too close.

1231
01:19:49,930 --> 01:19:52,890
The geese are very temperamental.
That's why we have the Eggdicator.

1232
01:19:52,977 --> 01:19:53,774
Eggdawhat?

1233
01:19:53,844 --> 01:19:57,019
The Eggdicator. The Eggdicator can
tell the difference between a good egg

1234
01:19:57,672 --> 01:19:58,889
and a bad egg.

1235
01:19:59,107 --> 01:20:02,498
If it's a good egg, it's shined up
and shipped out all over the world.

1236
01:20:02,847 --> 01:20:04,760
But if it's a bad egg...

1237
01:20:05,673 --> 01:20:07,196
down the chute.

1238
01:20:11,457 --> 01:20:13,066
It's an educated Eggdicator.

1239
01:20:13,284 --> 01:20:14,849
It's a lot of nonsense.

1240
01:20:15,458 --> 01:20:18,415
♪ A little nonsense now and then ♪

1241

Hey, Daddy, I want a golden goose.

1243
01:20:24,635 --> 01:20:25,722
Here we go again.

1244
01:20:25,940 --> 01:20:27,592
All right, sweetheart, all right.

1245
01:20:27,809 --> 01:20:29,984
Daddy'll get you a golden goose
as soon as we get home.

1246
01:20:30,201 --> 01:20:32,550
No, I want one of those!

1247
01:20:33,202 --> 01:20:35,420
Wonka, how much do you
want for the golden goose?

1248
01:20:35,637 --> 01:20:37,029
- They're not for sale.
- Name your price.

1249
01:20:37,203 --> 01:20:38,247
She can't have one.

1250
01:20:38,465 --> 01:20:39,769
Who says I can't?

1251
01:20:39,987 --> 01:20:41,682
- The man with the funny hat.
- I want one!

Geeses.

1255
01:20:46,815 --> 01:20:49,423
I want my geese to lay gold eggs for Easter.

1256
01:20:49,641 --> 01:20:51,859
- It will, sweetheart.
- At least a hundred a day.

1257
01:20:52,077 --> 01:20:55,078
- Anything you say.
- And by the way...

1258
01:20:55,251 --> 01:20:56,513
I want a feast.

01:22:42,845 --> 01:22:46,020
Where all the other bad eggs go:
down the garbage chute.

1291
01:22:46,281 --> 01:22:48,281
The garbage chute.

1292
01:22:48,847 --> 01:22:50,238
Where does it lead to?

1293
01:22:50,412 --> 01:22:52,021

- Well not necessarily.

- Inside the...

- Veruca went first.

1303
01:23:16,201 --> 01:23:20,290
Mr. Wonka, they won't really be
burned in the furnace, will they?

1304
01:23:20,942 --> 01:23:23,900
Well, I think that furnace
is lit only every other day,

1305
01:23:24,030 --> 01:23:26,639

Shall we press on?

1322
01:24:25,263 --> 01:24:27,264
Mr. Wonka, can't we sit down for a minute?

Places, please, the dance is about to begin.

1327
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:46,070
Better grab a seat, they're going fast.

1328
01:24:46,101 --> 01:24:49,139
Mr. Wonka, what's that
they're filling it up with?

1329
01:24:49,313 --> 01:24:52,096
Oh, ginger ale, ginger pop,
ginger beer, beer bubbles,

1330
01:24:52,314 --> 01:24:55,620
bubble-ade, bubble cola, double cola,

power there is in one of those things

1333
01:25:02,143 --> 01:25:04,012
Sorry I asked.

1334
01:25:04,274 --> 01:25:07,274
You think Slugworth would
pay extra to know about this?

1335
01:25:07,492 --> 01:25:10,449
Just keep your eyes open and your mouth shut.

1336
01:25:11,928 --> 01:25:13,102
Everybody set?

1337
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:14,624
Is this gonna go fast, Grandpa?

1338
01:25:14,842 --> 01:25:17,436
It should, Charlie. It's got more
gas in it than a politician.

1339
01:25:17,530 --> 01:25:21,800
Now hold on tight. I'm gonna really open
her up this time and see what she can do.

1340
01:25:29,845 --> 01:25:31,846
Swifter than eagles...

1341
01:25:32,151 --> 01:25:34,195
stronger than lions...

1342
01:25:42,154 --> 01:25:44,023
It's getting in my eye!

Oh, it's even in my shoes!

I'm soaked! It'll never come out!

1345

It's sticking to my gun.

1346

Ohhhhhh...

1347
01:26:04,029 --> 01:26:06,899
I'm sending you the cleaning bill,
Mr. Wonka!

1348
01:26:09,987 --> 01:26:11,856
I'm dry cleaned!

1349
01:26:15,814 --> 01:26:16,945
Hey, Grandpa,

1350
01:26:17,119 --> 01:26:19,424
what was that we just went through?

1351
01:26:19,641 --> 01:26:21,042
Hsawaknow.

1352
01:26:21,074 --> 01:26:24,208
- Is that Japanese?
- No, that's "Wonkawash" spelled backwards.

1353
01:26:24,381 --> 01:26:26,513
That's it, ladies and gentlemen.
The journey is over.

1354
01:26:26,730 --> 01:26:29,035
Finest bath I've had in twenty years.

1355
01:26:29,253 --> 01:26:30,601
Let's do it again, Mr. Wonka.

1356
01:26:30,818 --> 01:26:34,167
- You mean that's as far as it goes?
- Couldn't we have walked?

1357
01:26:34,646 --> 01:26:38,745
If the Good Lord had intended us to walk,
he wouldn't have invented roller skates.

1358
01:26:39,081 --> 01:26:40,864
Now would you all please put these on.

1359
01:26:41,081 --> 01:26:43,343
We have to be very careful.

1360
01:26:43,821 --> 01:26:46,170
There's dangerous stuff inside.

1361
01:26:48,910 --> 01:26:49,954
Wonkavision,

1362
01:26:49,976 --> 01:26:52,689
my very latest and greatest invention.

1363
01:26:53,346 --> 01:26:55,738
- It's television.
- Uh, it's Wonkavision.

1364
01:26:55,912 --> 01:26:58,956
Now I suppose you all know
how ordinary television works.

1365
01:26:59,173 --> 01:27:01,479
Sure, I do. You photograph something,

1366
01:27:01,696 --> 01:27:04,306
and then the photograph is split
up into millions of tiny pieces,

1367
01:27:04,522 --> 01:27:09,003
and they go whizzing through the air down to your TV set
where they're all put together again in the right order.

1368
01:27:09,263 --> 01:27:12,351
You should open your mouth
a little wider when you speak.

1369
01:27:12,612 --> 01:27:14,752
So I said to myself,
"If they can do it with a photograph,"

1370
01:27:14,799 --> 01:27:17,526
"why can't I do it with a bar of chocolate?"

1371
01:27:20,439 --> 01:27:24,832
I shall now send this chocolate bar from
one end of the room to the other.

1372
01:27:25,050 --> 01:27:28,398
It has to be big because whenever
you transmit something by television,

1373
01:27:28,483 --> 01:27:30,351
it always ends up smaller
on the other end.

1374
01:27:31,139 --> 01:27:32,747
Goggles on, please.

1375
01:27:34,965 --> 01:27:37,053
Lights, camera,

1376
01:27:37,271 --> 01:27:38,445
action!

1377
01:27:40,228 --> 01:27:41,923
You can remove your goggles.

1378
01:27:42,794 --> 01:27:44,011
Where's the chocolate?

1379
01:27:44,229 --> 01:27:46,447
It's flying over our
heads in a million pieces.

1380
01:27:49,317 --> 01:27:50,926
Now watch the screen.

1381
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:55,101
Here it comes.

1382
01:27:56,406 --> 01:27:57,884
There it is.

1383
01:27:58,231 --> 01:27:59,004
Take it.

1384
01:27:59,050 --> 01:28:01,134
How can you take it? It's just a picture.

1385
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:02,625
All right, you take it.

1386
01:28:04,060 --> 01:28:04,973
It's real.

1387
01:28:05,148 --> 01:28:06,148
Taste it. It's delicious.

1388
01:28:06,234 --> 01:28:08,148
It's just gotten smaller, that's all.

1389
01:28:10,497 --> 01:28:11,453
It's perfect.

1390
01:28:11,514 --> 01:28:12,628
It's unbelievable.

1391
01:28:12,845 --> 01:28:13,540
It's a miracle.

1392
01:28:13,758 --> 01:28:14,628
It's a TV dinner.

1393
01:28:14,846 --> 01:28:15,628
It's Wonkavision.

1394
01:28:15,846 --> 01:28:17,281
It could change the world.

1395
01:28:17,498 --> 01:28:19,325
Mr. Wonka, can you send other things?

1396
01:28:19,498 --> 01:28:21,543
- Not just chocolate, I mean.
- Anything you like.

1397
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,108
What about... people?

1398
01:28:23,369 --> 01:28:24,761
People?

1399
01:28:26,197 --> 01:28:28,892
I don't really know.
I suppose I could.

1400
01:28:29,110 --> 01:28:32,155
Yes, I'm sure I could.
I'm pretty sure I could.

1401
01:28:32,372 --> 01:28:33,981
But it might have some messy results.

1402
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:37,407
Look at me. I'm gonna be the first person
in the world to be sent by television!

1403
01:28:37,634 --> 01:28:38,874
Mike, get away from that thing!

1404
01:28:39,026 --> 01:28:40,331
Stop, don't, come back...

1405
01:28:40,548 --> 01:28:42,157
Lights, camera, action!

1406
01:28:44,992 --> 01:28:47,680
Mike! Where are you?

1407
01:28:47,854 --> 01:28:50,072
He's up there, in a million pieces!

1408
01:28:50,290 --> 01:28:53,856
- Mike! Are you there?
- No good shouting here. Watch the screen.

1409
01:28:57,031 --> 01:28:59,335
Mike? Why's he taking so long?

1410
01:28:59,553 --> 01:29:01,597
Million pieces take a
long time to put together.

1411
01:29:01,815 --> 01:29:04,511
- Oh, where are they?
- There's definitely something coming through.

1412
01:29:04,728 --> 01:29:07,468
- Is it Mike?
- Well it's hard to tell, but I...

1413
01:29:08,294 --> 01:29:10,382
Our little group is getting
smaller by the minute.

1414
01:29:10,642 --> 01:29:14,861
Look at me, everybody. I'm the first person
in the world to be sent by television.

1415
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:18,036
Wow, what a wild trip that was.

1416
01:29:18,253 --> 01:29:20,776
It's the greatest thing
that's ever happened to me.

1417
01:29:20,799 --> 01:29:24,168
Am I coming in clear? Hey, Mom, I said,
"Am I coming in clear?"

1418
01:29:24,733 --> 01:29:26,691
Great. He's completely unharmed.

1419
01:29:26,907 --> 01:29:29,039
You call that unharmed?

1420
01:29:29,257 --> 01:29:32,214
Wow, that was something
Can I do it again?

1421
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:34,041
No, there'll be nothing left.

1422
01:29:34,257 --> 01:29:36,389
Don't worry about a thing, Mom. I feel fine.

1423
01:29:36,606 --> 01:29:38,563
I'm famous. I'm a TV star.

1424
01:29:38,737 --> 01:29:40,781
Wait 'til the kids back home hear about this.

1425
01:29:40,999 --> 01:29:42,303
Nobody's gonna hear about this.

1426
01:29:42,521 --> 01:29:43,912
Where are you taking me?

1427
01:29:44,174 --> 01:29:45,652
I don't want to go in there!

1428
01:29:45,869 --> 01:29:47,043
Be quiet.

1429
01:29:47,435 --> 01:29:48,522
Well...

1430
01:29:49,174 --> 01:29:52,915
Well, fortunately small boys are
extremely springy and elastic,

1431
01:29:53,089 --> 01:29:56,916
so I think we'll put him in my special
taffy-pulling machine. That should do the trick.

1432
01:29:57,090 --> 01:29:58,656
To the taffy-pulling room.

1433
01:29:58,873 --> 01:30:02,613
You'll find the boy in his mother's purse.
But be extremely careful.

1434
01:30:04,614 --> 01:30:06,527
Oh, what's he saying?

1435
01:30:06,788 --> 01:30:09,354
No, no, I won't hold you responsible.

1436
01:30:10,615 --> 01:30:14,355
And now, my dearest lady,
it's time to say goodbye.

1437
01:30:14,529 --> 01:30:16,356
No, no, don't speak.

1438
01:30:16,530 --> 01:30:20,748
For some moments in life there
are no words. Run along now.

1439
01:30:27,315 --> 01:30:29,455
Adieu, adieu,

1440
01:30:29,794 --> 01:30:32,447
parting is such sweet sorrow.

1459
01:31:43,987 --> 01:31:46,467
I must answer that note from the queen.

1460
01:31:47,293 --> 01:31:49,424
Mr. Wonka, what's gonna
happen to the other kids?

1461
01:31:49,606 --> 01:31:50,949
Augustus, Veruca?

1462
01:31:51,077 --> 01:31:52,077
My dear boy,

1463
01:31:52,294 --> 01:31:54,294
I promise you they'll be quite all right.

1464
01:31:54,555 --> 01:31:59,469
When they leave here, they'll be completely
restored to their normal, terrible old selves.

1465
01:32:00,078 --> 01:32:02,688
But maybe they'll be a
little bit wiser for the wear.

1466
01:32:02,905 --> 01:32:04,341
Anyway, don't worry about them.

1467
01:32:04,558 --> 01:32:06,994
Eh, what do we do now, Mr. Wonka?

1468
01:32:07,385 --> 01:32:11,603
Oh, yes, well, I hope you enjoyed yourselves.
Excuse me for not showing you out.

1469
01:32:11,616 --> 01:32:13,312
Straight up the stairs.
You'll find the way.

1470
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:16,822
I'm terribly busy. Whole day wasted.
Goodbye to you both. Goodbye.

1471
01:32:20,432 --> 01:32:23,868
What happened?
Did we do something wrong?

1472
01:32:24,172 --> 01:32:26,042
I don't know, Charlie.

1473
01:32:26,694 --> 01:32:28,738
But I'm gonna find out.

1474
01:32:46,439 --> 01:32:49,396
- Mr. Wonka?
- I am extraordinarily busy, sir.

1475
01:32:49,613 --> 01:32:52,093
I just wanted to ask about the chocolate.

1476
01:32:52,528 --> 01:32:55,919
The lifetime supply of
chocolate, for Charlie.

1477
01:32:56,441 --> 01:32:57,919
When does he get it?

1478
01:32:58,137 --> 01:33:00,269
- He doesn't.
- Why not?

1479
01:33:00,443 --> 01:33:02,573
Because he broke the rules.

1480
01:33:02,791 --> 01:33:05,574
What rules? We didn't see any rules,
did we, Charlie?

1481
01:33:05,661 --> 01:33:07,844
Wrong, sir, wrong!

1482
01:33:08,053 --> 01:33:11,532
Under Section Thirty-Seven B
of the contract signed by him,

1483
01:33:11,706 --> 01:33:15,751
it states quite clearly that all offers
shall become null and void if,

1484
01:33:16,055 --> 01:33:19,012
and you can read it for yourself
in this photostatic copy:

1485
01:33:19,230 --> 01:33:20,709
"I, the undersigned,

1486
01:33:20,882 --> 01:33:23,753
shall forfeit all rights,
privileges, and licenses

1487
01:33:23,970 --> 01:33:26,101
herein and herein contained,
etcetera, etcetera...

1488
01:33:26,319 --> 01:33:27,276
fax mentis,

1489
01:33:27,493 --> 01:33:30,450
incendium gloria culpam,
etcetera, etcetera...

1490
01:33:30,668 --> 01:33:33,277
memobis quelitor della cassum!"

1491
01:33:33,495 --> 01:33:36,800
It's all there, black and white,
clear as crystal!

1492
01:33:37,017 --> 01:33:39,192
You stole Fizzy Lifting Drinks.

1493
01:33:39,409 --> 01:33:43,062
You bumped into the ceiling which
now has to be washed and sterilized,

1494
01:33:43,237 --> 01:33:45,237
so you get nothing!

1495
01:33:45,497 --> 01:33:46,803
You lose!

1496
01:33:47,020 --> 01:33:49,151
Good day, sir!

1497
01:33:49,934 --> 01:33:51,282
You're a crook!

1498
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:54,456
You're a cheat and a swindler!
That's what you are.

1499
01:33:54,674 --> 01:33:56,631
How can you do a thing like this?

1500
01:33:56,848 --> 01:34:00,458
Build up a little boy's hopes and then
smash all his dreams to pieces.

1501
01:34:00,676 --> 01:34:02,459
You're an inhuman monster!

1502
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:04,937
I said "good day"!

1503
01:34:08,678 --> 01:34:11,156
Come on, Charlie, let's get out of here.

1504
01:34:11,853 --> 01:34:14,505
I'll get even with him if it's
the last thing I ever do.

1505
01:34:14,679 --> 01:34:17,637
If Slugworth wants a
Gobstopper, he'll get one.

1506
01:34:40,938 --> 01:34:42,454
Mr. Wonka?

1507
01:34:50,472 --> 01:34:52,994
So shines a good deed

1508
01:34:53,254 --> 01:34:55,516
in a weary world.

1509
01:34:56,777 --> 01:34:58,019
Charlie,

1510
01:34:59,517 --> 01:35:01,170
my boy...

1511
01:35:01,822 --> 01:35:03,127
You won!

1512
01:35:03,344 --> 01:35:05,214
You did it! You did it!

1513
01:35:05,431 --> 01:35:08,450
I knew you would. I just knew you would.

1514
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:12,791
Oh, Charlie, forgive me for putting
you through this. Please, forgive me.

1515
01:35:12,912 --> 01:35:16,043
Come in, Mr. Wilkinson
Charlie, meet Mr. Wilkinson.

1516
01:35:16,261 --> 01:35:17,479
- Pleasure.
- Slugworth!

1517
01:35:17,696 --> 01:35:20,175
No, no, that's not Slugworth.
He works for me.

1518
01:35:20,436 --> 01:35:22,740
- For you?
- I had to test you, Charlie.

1519
01:35:22,914 --> 01:35:25,915
And you passed the test.
You won!

1520
01:35:26,050 --> 01:35:28,307
- Won what?
- The jackpot, my dear sir,

1521
01:35:28,525 --> 01:35:31,134
- the grand and glorious jackpot.
- The chocolate?

1522
01:35:31,352 --> 01:35:34,744
The chocolate, yes, the chocolate,
but that's just the beginning.

1523
01:35:34,961 --> 01:35:38,354
We have to get on, we have to get on.
We have so much time, and so little to do.

1524
01:35:38,614 --> 01:35:40,484
Strike that. Reverse it.

1525
01:35:40,702 --> 01:35:42,441
This way please.

1526
01:35:42,876 --> 01:35:44,921
We'll take the Wonkavator.

1527
01:35:45,703 --> 01:35:48,225
Step in, Charlie. Grandpa Joe, sir.

1528
01:35:56,054 --> 01:36:00,011
- This is the Great Glass Wonkavator.
- It's an elevator.

1529
01:36:00,229 --> 01:36:02,621
It's a Wonkavator. An elevator
can only go up and down,

1530
01:36:02,795 --> 01:36:05,926
but the Wonkavator can go sideways and
slantways and longways and backways...

1531
01:36:06,143 --> 01:36:07,448
And frontways?

1532
01:36:07,665 --> 01:36:09,623
And squareways and frontways and
any other ways that you can think of.

1533
01:36:10,144 --> 01:36:14,505
It can take you to any room in the whole factory, just
by pressing one of these buttons. Any of these buttons.

1534
01:36:14,667 --> 01:36:17,277
Just press a button and zing!
You're off.

1535
01:36:18,059 --> 01:36:20,581
And up until now I've pressed them all...

1536
01:36:20,973 --> 01:36:22,408
except one.

1537
01:36:23,235 --> 01:36:24,105
This one.

1538
01:36:25,497 --> 01:36:26,888
Go ahead, Charlie.

1539
01:36:27,062 --> 01:36:28,280
Me?

1540
01:36:31,020 --> 01:36:32,237
There it goes.

1541
01:36:34,412 --> 01:36:35,760
Hold on tight.

1542
01:36:36,239 --> 01:36:39,108
I'm not exactly sure what's going to happen.

1543
01:36:39,848 --> 01:36:43,283
Faster, faster... If we don't pick up
enough speed, we'll never get through.

1544
01:36:43,501 --> 01:36:44,936
Get through what?

1545
01:36:45,763 --> 01:36:47,632
- You mean we're going...?
- Up and out!

1546
01:36:47,850 --> 01:36:50,764
But this roof is made of glass
It'll shatter into a thousand pieces.

1547
01:36:51,024 --> 01:36:53,460
- We'll be cut to ribbons!
- Probably.

1548
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:58,809
Hold on, everybody.

1549
01:37:00,027 --> 01:37:02,375
Here it comes.

1550
01:37:17,466 --> 01:37:21,293
- You did it, Mr. Wonka, congratulations!
- Get up. Take a look.

1551
01:37:21,539 --> 01:37:23,873
Grandpa, our town looks
so pretty from up here.

1552
01:37:23,903 --> 01:37:25,164
Yeah, look over here, Charlie.

1553
01:37:25,382 --> 01:37:27,034
I think I see our house.

1554
01:37:27,860 --> 01:37:28,798
Wow!

1555
01:37:28,891 --> 01:37:30,774
It really looks beautiful.

1556
01:37:30,991 --> 01:37:32,470
There is my school, Grandpa.

1557
01:37:39,081 --> 01:37:41,168
How did you like the
chocolate factory, Charlie?

1558
01:37:41,473 --> 01:37:44,299
I think it's the most wonderful
place in the whole world.

1559
01:37:44,474 --> 01:37:46,475
I'm very pleased to hear you say that,

1560
01:37:46,735 --> 01:37:49,040
because I'm giving it to you.

1561
01:37:51,217 --> 01:37:52,475
That's all right, isn't it?

1562
01:37:52,649 --> 01:37:55,346
- You're giving Charlie the...?
- I can't go on forever,

1563
01:37:55,607 --> 01:37:57,608
and I don't really want to try.

1564
01:37:57,912 --> 01:38:02,826
So, who can I trust to run the factory when I leave
and take care of the Oompa Loompas for me?

1565
01:38:03,087 --> 01:38:04,391
Not a grown-up.

1566
01:38:04,609 --> 01:38:07,741
A grown-up would want to do everything
his own way, not mine.

1567
01:38:08,089 --> 01:38:11,741
That's why I decided a long time ago
I had to find a child.

1568
01:38:11,959 --> 01:38:13,568
A very honest,

1569
01:38:13,959 --> 01:38:15,351
loving child,

1570
01:38:15,873 --> 01:38:19,222
to whom I can tell all my most
precious candy making secrets.

1571
01:38:19,439 --> 01:38:21,999
- And that's why you sent out the Golden Tickets.
- That's right.

1572
01:38:22,179 --> 01:38:24,701
So the factory's yours, Charlie.
You can move in immediately.

1573
01:38:24,962 --> 01:38:26,919
- And me?
- Absolutely.

1574
01:38:27,354 --> 01:38:29,573
- What happens to the rest of...
- The whole family.

1575
01:38:29,790 --> 01:38:31,573
I want you to bring them all.

1576
01:38:35,313 --> 01:38:36,705
But Charlie...

1577
01:38:37,879 --> 01:38:41,575
don't forget what happened to the man who
suddenly got everything he always wanted.

1578
01:38:41,629 --> 01:38:42,673
What happened?

1579
01:38:43,054 --> 01:38:45,402
He lived happily ever after.
