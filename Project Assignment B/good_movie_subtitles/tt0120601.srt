00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:10,850
Craig, honey, it's time for bed.

3
00:03:12,883 --> 00:03:16,950
<i>Craig, honey, time to get up.</i>

4
00:03:17,184 --> 00:03:20,951
Craig, honey, time to get up.

5
00:03:21,184 --> 00:03:24,418
I'm sorry. I didn't know Orrin Hatch
was out of his cage.

6
00:03:24,651 --> 00:03:27,618
- Come here. Morning, sweetheart.
- Morning.

7
00:03:27,852 --> 00:03:29,485
What are you gonna do today, honey?

8
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:31,385
Working in the workshop.

9
00:03:31,619 --> 00:03:35,452
I was thinking, maybe you'd feel better
if you got a job.

10
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:36,786
We've been over this.

11
00:03:37,052 --> 00:03:41,753
Nobody's looking for a puppeteer
in today's wintry economic climate.

12
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:46,220
I know, honey, but I thought, you know...

13
00:03:46,453 --> 00:03:49,820
...maybe something else
until this puppet thing turns around.

14
00:03:50,054 --> 00:03:51,887
Derek Mantini doesn't need a day job.

15
00:03:52,154 --> 00:03:56,488
Not everybody can be Derek Mantini.

16
00:03:56,721 --> 00:04:00,188
I gotta get to the shop. We have
a shipment of kitty litter coming in.

17
00:04:00,421 --> 00:04:03,355
Will you do me a favor?
Will you take a look at Elijah today?

18
00:04:03,622 --> 00:04:08,322
- He's not feeling very good again.
- Which one is Elijah again?

19
00:04:08,556 --> 00:04:12,089
- The chimp, honey.
- Yeah, okay.

20
00:04:15,156 --> 00:04:18,257
<i>On the lighter side of the news
in Westchester County today...</i>

21
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:22,057
<i>... puppeteer Derek Mantini
thrilled onlookers as he performed...</i>

22
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:27,457
<i>...The Belle of Amherst
with a 60-foot Emily Dickinson puppet.</i>

23
00:04:28,424 --> 00:04:30,491
<i>"How dreary to be somebody!"</i>

24
00:04:30,758 --> 00:04:35,858
<i>"How public, like a frog
To tell your name the livelong day"</i>

25
00:04:36,092 --> 00:04:39,059
Gimmicky bastard.

26
00:04:41,092 --> 00:04:44,859
You don't know how lucky you are,
being a monkey.

27
00:04:45,093 --> 00:04:47,393
Because consciousness...

28
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,260
...is a terrible curse.

29
00:04:50,526 --> 00:04:55,627
I think, I feel, I suffer.

30
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:01,661
And all I ask in return
is the opportunity to do my work.

31
00:05:03,028 --> 00:05:06,361
And they won't allow it...

32
00:05:06,861 --> 00:05:10,195
...because I raise issues.

33
00:05:18,329 --> 00:05:20,829
<i>While we enjoyed the pleasures
of an uneasy love...</i>

34
00:05:21,096 --> 00:05:24,597
<i>... and abandoned ourselves to fornication...</i>

35
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,430
<i>... we were spared God's severity.</i>

36
00:05:27,697 --> 00:05:30,897
<i>Say no more, I beg you,
and cease from complaints like these...</i>

37
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:35,998
<i>... which are so far-removed
from the true depths of love.</i>

38
00:05:36,664 --> 00:05:39,431
Look, a puppet show!

39
00:05:39,698 --> 00:05:42,132
Okay, honey, just for a minute.
Mommy's waiting.

40
00:05:42,365 --> 00:05:46,532
<i>Even during the celebration of Mass
when our prayers should be pure...</i>

41
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:51,733
<i>... lewd visions of these pleasures
take such a hold upon my unhappy soul...</i>

42
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:55,433
<i>... that my thoughts are
on their very wantonness...</i>

43
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,967
<i>... instead of my prayers.</i>

44
00:06:02,467 --> 00:06:04,801
<i>Sometimes my thoughts are betrayed...</i>

45
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:08,134
<i>... by the movement of my body.</i>

46
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:11,835
<i>I took my fill
of my wretched pleasures in you...</i>

47
00:06:12,101 --> 00:06:16,235
<i>... and this was the sum total of my love.</i>

48
00:06:46,605 --> 00:06:49,538
You motherfucker!

49
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:58,573
Oh, Craig!

50
00:06:58,806 --> 00:07:01,473
Honey, not again!

51
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,773
Why do you do this to yourself, honey?

52
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,940
I'm a puppeteer.

53
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:40,016
Seven and a half, right?

54
00:08:40,283 --> 00:08:44,250
- Yeah.
- I'll take you through it.

55
00:09:02,252 --> 00:09:04,452
Seven and a half.

56
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:07,385
Thank you.

57
00:09:39,155 --> 00:09:41,989
Welcome to Lestercorp.
How may we meet your filing needs?

58
00:09:42,256 --> 00:09:44,756
No. My name's Craig Schwartz.

59
00:09:44,989 --> 00:09:47,456
I have an interview with Dr. Lester.

60
00:09:47,723 --> 00:09:50,923
- Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez.
- Schwartz.

61
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,090
- Pardon?
- Schwartz.

62
00:09:53,357 --> 00:09:57,657
I'm sorry, I have no idea
what you're saying to me right now.

63
00:09:57,891 --> 00:10:02,091
- My name is Schwartz.
- "My name is Warts."

64
00:10:10,392 --> 00:10:13,059
Mr. Juarez?

65
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:14,225
Yes?

66
00:10:14,492 --> 00:10:16,692
- Chest?
- I said, "Yes".

67
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,759
You suggest what?

68
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:23,693
I'm sorry. I have no time for piddling
suggestions from mumbling job applicants.

69
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,827
Besides, Dr. Lester will see you now.

70
00:10:28,827 --> 00:10:32,261
Come in, Mr. Juarez.

71
00:10:32,661 --> 00:10:35,961
My name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.

72
00:10:36,228 --> 00:10:36,961
Security!

73
00:10:37,228 --> 00:10:40,295
No, sir, it's just a little mix-up
with your secretary.

74
00:10:40,561 --> 00:10:43,395
My name is Craig Schwartz.
I tried to explain that to her.

75
00:10:43,628 --> 00:10:45,429
She's not my secretary.

76
00:10:45,695 --> 00:10:48,162
She's what they call an executive liaison.

77
00:10:48,396 --> 00:10:51,229
And I am not banging her,
if that's what you're implying.

78
00:10:51,496 --> 00:10:56,330
No, sir, not at all.
I think I must have simply misspoke.

79
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,731
Well, now, tell me, Dr. Schwartz...

80
00:11:06,997 --> 00:11:11,365
...what do you feel
you can bring to Lestercorp?

81
00:11:11,365 --> 00:11:13,531
Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.

82
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:18,165
Are you? All right. Let's see about that.

83
00:11:22,566 --> 00:11:28,100
Which of these two letters comes first?
This one or this one?

84
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,933
The symbol on the left is not a letter, sir.

85
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,934
Damn, you're good.

86
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,467
- I was trying to trick you.
- I see.

87
00:11:37,734 --> 00:11:43,534
- Well then, put these in order.
- Yes, sir.

88
00:11:47,702 --> 00:11:49,968
Floris, get Guinness on the phone.

89
00:11:50,202 --> 00:11:52,869
<i>Yes, sir. Genghis Khan Capone. Fine.</i>

90
00:11:53,135 --> 00:11:54,302
Damn fine woman, Floris.

91
00:11:54,536 --> 00:11:59,769
I don't know how she puts up
with this speech impediment of mine.

92
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:03,303
You don't have a speech impediment,
Dr. Lester.

93
00:12:03,536 --> 00:12:06,337
Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy.

94
00:12:06,603 --> 00:12:09,470
I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on that one.

95
00:12:09,737 --> 00:12:11,404
You see, she's got her doctorate...

96
00:12:11,637 --> 00:12:14,404
...in Speech Impedimentology
from Case Western.

97
00:12:14,638 --> 00:12:17,138
I apologize if you can't understand
a word I'm saying.

98
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,971
No, I understand perfectly.

99
00:12:20,238 --> 00:12:22,438
It's very kind of you to lie.

100
00:12:22,705 --> 00:12:24,472
You see, I've been very Ionely...

101
00:12:24,739 --> 00:12:29,706
...in my isolated tower
of indecipherable speech.

102
00:12:34,506 --> 00:12:36,573
You got the job.

103
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,740
- Any questions?
- Well, just one.

104
00:12:40,007 --> 00:12:42,140
Why are these ceilings so low?

105
00:12:42,374 --> 00:12:46,641
Low overhead, my boy!
We pass the savings on to you.

106
00:12:46,874 --> 00:12:51,508
But seriously, that'll all be covered
in orientation.

107
00:13:20,011 --> 00:13:22,711
<i>Welcome to the 7 1/2 floor
of the Mertin-Flemmer building.</i>

108
00:13:22,944 --> 00:13:25,078
<i>As you'll now be spending
your workday here...</i>

109
00:13:25,345 --> 00:13:29,345
<i>... it's important that you learn a bit
about the history of this famous floor.</i>

110
00:13:29,578 --> 00:13:31,179
<i>- Hello, Don.
- Hello, Wendy.</i>

111
00:13:31,412 --> 00:13:33,745
<i>Don, I was wondering, do you know why...</i>

112
00:13:34,012 --> 00:13:36,046
<i>... our workplace has such low ceilings?</i>

113
00:13:36,312 --> 00:13:40,013
<i>It's an interesting story.
Many years ago in the late 1800s...</i>

114
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:43,846
<i>... James Mertin, an Irish ship captain,
came to this town...</i>

115
00:13:44,113 --> 00:13:46,547
<i>... and decided to erect an office building.</i>

116
00:13:46,813 --> 00:13:50,147
<i>He called this building the Mertin-Flemmer
building after himself and...</i>

117
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:53,414
<i>... someone else, who local legend
has it was named Flemmer.</i>

118
00:13:53,647 --> 00:13:56,914
<i>Well, one day, old Captain Mertin received
an unexpected visitor.</i>

119
00:13:57,148 --> 00:14:00,748
<i>- Captain Mertin?
- Aye. What want ye, girl child?</i>

120
00:14:00,982 --> 00:14:04,915
<i>I'm not a child, but rather an adult lady
of miniature proportions.</i>

121
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:08,416
<i>I see. Well, if it's charity you're after...</i>

122
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:11,083
<i>... be gone with ye, you foul demon!</i>

123
00:14:11,349 --> 00:14:13,049
<i>I'm not asking for alms, Captain...</i>

124
00:14:13,283 --> 00:14:16,183
<i>... but, rather, the ear of a kind man
with a noble heart.</i>

125
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:19,017
<i>Well, speak then, if you must.</i>

126
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,917
<i>Captain Mertin, I'm afraid that the world
was not built with me in mind.</i>

127
00:14:23,184 --> 00:14:25,851
<i>Doorknobs are too high,
chairs are unwieldy...</i>

128
00:14:26,084 --> 00:14:28,818
<i>... and high-ceilinged rooms
mock my stature.</i>

129
00:14:29,051 --> 00:14:32,951
<i>Why cannot there be a place for me
to work that's safe and comfortable?</i>

130
00:14:33,185 --> 00:14:35,618
<i>Thy story has moved me like no other.</i>

131
00:14:35,852 --> 00:14:40,385
<i>Therefore, I shall make ye me wife.</i>

132
00:14:40,652 --> 00:14:42,952
<i>And I shall build a floor for ye...</i>

133
00:14:43,186 --> 00:14:46,919
<i>... between the seventh and the eighth
in me own building...</i>

134
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:50,653
<i>... so at least there'll be one place
on God's green earth...</i>

135
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,487
<i>... where ye and your accursed kind
can live in peace.</i>

136
00:14:55,987 --> 00:14:58,554
<i>So that's the story of 7 1/2.</i>

137
00:14:58,787 --> 00:15:02,188
<i>Since the rents are considerably lower,
this floor has been adopted...</i>

138
00:15:02,421 --> 00:15:05,788
<i>... by businesses which have been forced
to cut corners.</i>

139
00:15:06,055 --> 00:15:09,855
<i>After all, the overhead is low.</i>

140
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:22,890
Moving story, huh?

141
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:27,023
Unfortunately, the story's bullshit.

142
00:15:29,624 --> 00:15:32,591
Listen, I'm Craig Schwartz.
I'm just starting out at Lestercorp.

143
00:15:32,824 --> 00:15:36,191
Where are you starting out?

144
00:15:39,325 --> 00:15:41,658
<i>Shut up! Shut up!</i>

145
00:15:41,925 --> 00:15:43,892
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Hey, shut up!

146
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:47,425
- Shut up!
- I'm sorry, honey.

147
00:15:47,659 --> 00:15:49,626
Sorry, honey.

148
00:15:49,892 --> 00:15:51,793
Sorry, honey.

149
00:15:52,059 --> 00:15:53,926
- Shut up!
- Sorry!

150
00:15:54,193 --> 00:15:56,760
- Help! She's locking me in a cage.
- Isn't that cute?

151
00:15:57,026 --> 00:16:01,694
- I just taught him that today.
- Yeah, that's adorable.

152
00:16:02,427 --> 00:16:05,161
- You want to do some dishes for me?
- Put that down.

153
00:16:05,394 --> 00:16:07,494
Here, Elijah. Here you go.

154
00:16:07,728 --> 00:16:11,761
You know, I have an appointment
tomorrow with Elijah's shrink.

155
00:16:12,028 --> 00:16:14,495
I think we're finally getting down
to the bottom...

156
00:16:14,728 --> 00:16:19,362
...of this acid stomach, aren't we?
Come here.

157
00:16:21,196 --> 00:16:22,329
Get down from the...

158
00:16:22,562 --> 00:16:27,329
She thinks that it's some sort
of childhood trauma.

159
00:16:27,996 --> 00:16:31,663
Feelings of inadequacy as a chimp,
you know?

160
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:36,064
Careful. Isn't that interesting?

161
00:16:36,497 --> 00:16:39,997
I find it really interesting.

162
00:16:43,064 --> 00:16:48,065
So, honey, have you thought any more
about us having a baby?

163
00:16:50,865 --> 00:16:54,999
I think it's just so tough right now,
economically and all...

164
00:16:55,232 --> 00:17:00,833
...that I think maybe we should just wait
and see if this job thing pays off.

165
00:17:01,066 --> 00:17:03,700
You know?

166
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,901
I was thinking about what you said
the other day...

167
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:15,368
...about the orientation film being bullshit.
- Yes?

168
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,368
I think maybe you're on to something.

169
00:17:17,635 --> 00:17:21,502
- And 50 other lines to get in a girl's pants.
- No, no!

170
00:17:21,768 --> 00:17:25,235
No, I was just talking about the film.

171
00:17:25,469 --> 00:17:28,002
Here's the thing.

172
00:17:28,269 --> 00:17:34,370
If you ever got me, you wouldn't
have a clue what to do with me.

173
00:17:36,803 --> 00:17:40,870
I wasn't. I was talking about the film.

174
00:17:45,171 --> 00:17:49,538
What magic those fingers could work
on the right cabinet.

175
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:52,371
Maybe you could alphabetize me.

176
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:53,838
And don't forget...

177
00:17:54,071 --> 00:17:58,905
..."I" comes before "U".

178
00:17:59,805 --> 00:18:02,672
Floris, I think you're very nice...

179
00:18:02,906 --> 00:18:07,273
...but the truth is that I'm in love
with someone else.

180
00:18:07,506 --> 00:18:11,173
I'm afraid I have no idea
what you're saying to me.

181
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,374
- You bastard.
- What?

182
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,474
- Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz.
- No.

183
00:18:17,741 --> 00:18:20,474
If I was 80 years younger, I'd box your ears.

184
00:18:20,741 --> 00:18:23,808
I wasn't toying with her, sir. I wouldn't...

185
00:18:24,074 --> 00:18:27,775
- Pardon me. How old are you, sir?
- 105.

186
00:18:28,042 --> 00:18:30,475
Carrot juice, and lots of it.

187
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:34,342
I swear, sometimes it's not worth it.
I piss orange.

188
00:18:34,576 --> 00:18:36,376
And I have to piss sitting down...

189
00:18:36,609 --> 00:18:40,076
...like a goddamn girly-girl,
every 15 minutes.

190
00:18:40,343 --> 00:18:43,210
But nobody wants to die.

191
00:18:43,443 --> 00:18:46,477
To be a young man again.

192
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:50,510
Maybe then Floris would care for me.

193
00:18:50,744 --> 00:18:53,977
The elderly have so much to offer.
They're our link with history.

194
00:18:54,211 --> 00:18:56,478
I don't wanna be your goddamn link,
damn ya.

195
00:18:56,711 --> 00:19:00,511
I want to feel Floris's naked thighs
next to mine.

196
00:19:00,778 --> 00:19:02,945
I want my body to inspire lust...

197
00:19:03,178 --> 00:19:05,645
...in that beautiful, complex woman.

198
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:08,746
I want her to shiver
with a spasm of ecstasy...

199
00:19:08,979 --> 00:19:10,946
...as I penetrate her wet...

200
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:14,746
Dr. Lester, while I'm flattered
you would share your feelings with me...

201
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:19,380
...the workplace isn't the most suitable
environment for this type of discussion.

202
00:19:19,613 --> 00:19:21,214
You're right. I'll tell you what.

203
00:19:21,447 --> 00:19:25,347
Meet me after work today
at Jerry's Juiceteria on Lex...

204
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:29,681
...and I'll spill my goddamn guts for ya.

205
00:19:31,015 --> 00:19:34,081
No, I won't be late, Lotte.
I just have to, you know...

206
00:19:34,348 --> 00:19:37,882
...listen to Lester's sexual fantasies
and drink carrot juice for a while.

207
00:19:38,149 --> 00:19:41,416
It's a job thing, really.

208
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:46,349
So, I'll talk to you later, okay?
Yeah. You, too.

209
00:19:46,616 --> 00:19:50,216
Gotta go back to work. Okay, bye.

210
00:19:51,183 --> 00:19:55,117
Hi. Do you know that I don't even know
your name or where you work?

211
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,951
Yeah.

212
00:20:00,317 --> 00:20:01,584
How about this?

213
00:20:01,818 --> 00:20:07,585
If I can guess your name in three tries,
you have to have a drink with me tonight.

214
00:20:07,818 --> 00:20:09,718
Why not?

215
00:20:09,952 --> 00:20:12,419
Okay.

216
00:20:12,585 --> 00:20:15,586
You look like a...

217
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:20,719
...Bar...

218
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,786
...Ru...

219
00:20:24,053 --> 00:20:26,887
...Bell...

220
00:20:27,153 --> 00:20:29,820
...Carol...

221
00:20:30,054 --> 00:20:32,754
...Ta, Cher...

222
00:20:33,021 --> 00:20:35,154
...Susan...

223
00:20:35,388 --> 00:20:38,988
...Emily...

224
00:20:39,221 --> 00:20:41,888
...Marlar...

225
00:20:42,155 --> 00:20:45,222
...Maxine. Maxine?

226
00:20:45,489 --> 00:20:47,856
Yeah! Who told you?

227
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:53,989
Nobody told me.
That just came out. Isn't that odd?

228
00:20:54,123 --> 00:20:56,756
So where do you live and stuff?

229
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,590
I am dubious...

230
00:20:58,823 --> 00:21:00,457
...but I don't welsh.

231
00:21:00,723 --> 00:21:04,457
Okay, meet me at The Stuck Pig, 7:00.

232
00:21:04,724 --> 00:21:06,624
If you're late, I walk.

233
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:09,024
Nubile. Blonde.

234
00:21:09,258 --> 00:21:11,858
Wet with desire. Me in leather.

235
00:21:12,091 --> 00:21:13,425
A harness, if you like.

236
00:21:13,691 --> 00:21:17,092
And all eyes, Craig,
are upon me as I speak.

237
00:21:17,358 --> 00:21:19,025
"Ladies", I begin.

238
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:22,992
"I am the love god Eros." They like that.

239
00:21:23,226 --> 00:21:25,026
"I intoxicate you."

240
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:28,126
"My spunk is, to you, manna from heaven."

241
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,327
Dr. Lester, this is all really fascinating
and stuff...

242
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,227
...but I gotta get back home to my wife.

243
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:36,960
- You have a wife. I'd like to meet her.
- Yes, sir.

244
00:21:37,194 --> 00:21:39,961
Shall we say dinner Thursday?

245
00:21:40,194 --> 00:21:42,028
You can come, too, if you like.

246
00:21:42,294 --> 00:21:45,628
Get that? That was a joke.
You hear what I said? You can come, too.

247
00:21:45,861 --> 00:21:47,295
That was a good one.

248
00:21:47,562 --> 00:21:51,229
- All right. Thank you.
- Yeah.

249
00:21:59,229 --> 00:22:01,130
Maxine.

250
00:22:01,396 --> 00:22:03,463
- I made it, Maxine.
- Just.

251
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,630
Buy you a drink, Maxine?

252
00:22:05,897 --> 00:22:08,830
Are you married?

253
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:13,264
- Yeah. But enough about me.
- Yeah.

254
00:22:14,097 --> 00:22:17,198
- What'll you have?
- I'll have more of the same, please, Barry.

255
00:22:17,431 --> 00:22:21,865
And I'll have a light beer, or something.

256
00:22:24,832 --> 00:22:27,199
So...

257
00:22:27,566 --> 00:22:30,599
I don't know, I like you.

258
00:22:30,832 --> 00:22:33,466
- I don't know what it is about you. I just...
- My tits?

259
00:22:33,699 --> 00:22:35,933
- No!
- No?

260
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:38,600
It's your energy,
the way you carry yourself.

261
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:40,267
You're not a fag, are you?

262
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,334
No. I am really attracted to you.

263
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,934
"I am really attracted to you."
You are a fag.

264
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:47,234
Well, we can share recipes, Darlene.

265
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:52,268
- Wait! I love your tits. I wanna fuck 'em.
- Now we're gettin' somewhere.

266
00:22:52,535 --> 00:22:55,302
Not a chance.

267
00:22:55,602 --> 00:22:58,635
So tell me about yourself.

268
00:22:58,902 --> 00:23:02,902
If you can get your mind
out of the gutter long enough, dog boy.

269
00:23:03,169 --> 00:23:05,169
Well, I'm a puppeteer.

270
00:23:05,403 --> 00:23:08,503
- I've been...
- Check.

271
00:23:15,837 --> 00:23:20,871
I'm sorry I'm so late.
Lester just wouldn't let me get away.

272
00:23:21,138 --> 00:23:24,438
Hi, Elijah. We're supposed to have dinner
with him on Thursday...

273
00:23:24,671 --> 00:23:26,705
...but I can get us out of it, if you want.

274
00:23:26,971 --> 00:23:30,738
It's amazing. He's like this insane old lech,
and it's kind of amusing...

275
00:23:30,972 --> 00:23:33,605
...once you get past
how disgusting it actually is.

276
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:35,839
- Did you eat?
- No. I'm not hungry.

277
00:23:36,106 --> 00:23:38,773
I'm sorry I didn't call.
It was just hard to get away.

278
00:23:39,006 --> 00:23:42,773
- I was worried.
- I'm sorry.

279
00:23:44,206 --> 00:23:46,907
You know...

280
00:23:47,774 --> 00:23:51,074
...you wanted me to work.

281
00:23:53,174 --> 00:23:56,374
How was your evening?

282
00:23:56,608 --> 00:23:59,008
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.

283
00:23:59,241 --> 00:24:03,242
- The ferret?
- The iguana.

284
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:05,175
So I just dressed the wound...

285
00:24:05,409 --> 00:24:10,809
...and I've just been feeding everyone
and putting everybody to bed.

286
00:24:11,209 --> 00:24:14,676
- You want a beer?
- No. I think I'm going to go to bed.

287
00:24:14,943 --> 00:24:17,210
Elijah's gonna sleep with us tonight.

288
00:24:17,476 --> 00:24:21,677
- I don't think he's feeling very well.
- Okay.

289
00:24:22,677 --> 00:24:26,844
You know what? I'm gonna go
in my workshop for a little while.

290
00:24:27,111 --> 00:24:31,145
- But I'll be in in a little while.
- Okay.

291
00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:16,416
Tell me, why do you love puppeteering?

292
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:21,750
Well, Maxine, I'm not sure exactly.

293
00:25:21,983 --> 00:25:25,250
Perhaps it's the idea of becoming
someone else for a little while.

294
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:27,950
Being inside another skin...

295
00:25:28,217 --> 00:25:31,251
...thinking differently, moving differently...

296
00:25:31,517 --> 00:25:34,051
...feeling differently.

297
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:36,718
Interesting, Craig.

298
00:25:36,951 --> 00:25:39,618
Would you like to be inside my skin...

299
00:25:39,885 --> 00:25:45,019
...think what I think, feel what I feel?

300
00:25:46,852 --> 00:25:50,486
More than anything, Maxine.

301
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:55,386
It's good in here, Craig.

302
00:25:55,653 --> 00:25:59,787
It's better than your wildest dreams.

303
00:26:26,623 --> 00:26:28,856
<i>You're not somebody
I could get interested in.</i>

304
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:31,023
You play with dolls.

305
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:32,690
Puppets, Maxine.

306
00:26:32,923 --> 00:26:36,090
It's the idea of being inside
someone else's skin...

307
00:26:36,357 --> 00:26:39,857
...and seeing what they see
and feeling what they feel.

308
00:26:40,091 --> 00:26:41,258
Yikes!

309
00:26:41,524 --> 00:26:43,858
It's just that, well...
Please, let me explain.

310
00:26:44,124 --> 00:26:46,358
I've never done this before, but...

311
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:50,892
...I feel something for you,
and I've never felt this way before...

312
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:54,926
...you know, about anybody,
not even my wife.

313
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:56,826
And I just...

314
00:26:57,092 --> 00:27:01,693
I really feel that you and I belong together.

315
00:27:27,495 --> 00:27:29,929
Shit.

316
00:28:58,705 --> 00:29:01,638
What's the file number?

317
00:31:02,817 --> 00:31:06,484
You know what?
The puppeteer told me he loved me today.

318
00:31:06,717 --> 00:31:10,651
I know. I can't think
of anything more pathetic.

319
00:31:10,885 --> 00:31:13,551
I'm sorry.

320
00:31:14,452 --> 00:31:17,285
Afternoon, sir.

321
00:31:27,786 --> 00:31:31,387
The Broadhurst Theatre, please.

322
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:40,254
Say, ain't you that actor guy?

323
00:31:40,521 --> 00:31:42,288
Yes.

324
00:31:42,554 --> 00:31:46,221
John, what is, John...

325
00:31:47,121 --> 00:31:48,722
Don't tell me. Maplethorpe?

326
00:31:48,988 --> 00:31:53,189
- Malkovich.
- Malkovich. Right.

327
00:31:53,422 --> 00:31:55,989
Yeah. I thought you were all right
in that one movie.

328
00:31:56,222 --> 00:31:57,422
Thank you.

329
00:31:57,689 --> 00:31:59,889
The one where you played a jewel thief.

330
00:32:00,156 --> 00:32:03,556
- I never played a jewel thief.
- No?

331
00:32:03,823 --> 00:32:07,624
- Who am I thinkin' of?
- I don't know.

332
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:13,824
No, no, I'm pretty sure it was you.

333
00:32:51,361 --> 00:32:54,395
Yeah. Absolutely, doll.

334
00:32:54,395 --> 00:32:59,595
I'm just about to close up.
Wanna meet at The Pig in 20 minutes?

335
00:32:59,829 --> 00:33:02,129
Cool. Bye.

336
00:33:02,362 --> 00:33:05,663
I'm splittin' for the day, puppet man.
Lock up for me, okay?

337
00:33:05,929 --> 00:33:08,096
Don't you wanna know
what happened to me?

338
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:08,996
No.

339
00:33:09,263 --> 00:33:12,563
- Please, this is important.
- Better be.

340
00:33:12,797 --> 00:33:15,297
It is.

341
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:22,564
There's a tiny door in my office, Maxine.

342
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:27,231
It's a portal, and it takes you
inside John Malkovich.

343
00:33:27,465 --> 00:33:29,932
You see the world
through John Malkovich's eyes...

344
00:33:30,198 --> 00:33:32,599
...and then after 15 minutes,
you're spit out...

345
00:33:32,865 --> 00:33:35,432
...into a ditch on the side
of the New Jersey Turnpike.

346
00:33:35,699 --> 00:33:38,933
Sounds great!
Who the fuck is John Malkovich?

347
00:33:39,199 --> 00:33:42,800
He's an actor. He's one of the great
American actors of the 20th century.

348
00:33:43,033 --> 00:33:45,200
Oh, yeah? What's he been in?

349
00:33:45,467 --> 00:33:47,567
Lots of things. That jewel thief movie.

350
00:33:47,834 --> 00:33:50,967
He's very well-respected.
Anyway, the point is...

351
00:33:51,201 --> 00:33:54,101
...this is a very odd thing.

352
00:33:54,334 --> 00:33:57,134
It's supernatural, for lack of a better word.

353
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:01,735
I mean, it raises all sorts
of philosophical-type questions...

354
00:34:01,968 --> 00:34:05,335
...about the nature of self,
about the existence of a soul.

355
00:34:05,602 --> 00:34:09,336
You know, am I me?
Is Malkovich Malkovich?

356
00:34:09,602 --> 00:34:11,703
I had a piece of wood in my hand, Maxine.

357
00:34:11,936 --> 00:34:15,303
I don't have it any more. Where is it?

358
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:17,737
Did it disappear? How could that be?

359
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:22,504
Is it still in Malkovich's head?
I don't know!

360
00:34:23,004 --> 00:34:28,204
Do you see what a metaphysical
can of worms this portal is?

361
00:34:31,471 --> 00:34:37,172
I don't see how I could go on living my life
the way I've lived it before.

362
00:34:52,807 --> 00:34:53,307
Yeah?

363
00:34:53,573 --> 00:34:56,407
<i>So I've been thinking,
is this Malkovich fellow appealing?</i>

364
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,807
Maxine! Yes, of course, Maxine.
He's a celebrity.

365
00:35:00,074 --> 00:35:02,974
<i>Good. We'll sell tickets.</i>

366
00:35:03,241 --> 00:35:06,075
<i>- Tickets to Malkovich?
- Exactly.</i>

367
00:35:06,308 --> 00:35:09,642
<i>$200 a pop.</i>

368
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:12,909
But, Maxine, there's something,
I don't know, like, profound here.

369
00:35:13,175 --> 00:35:17,509
I don't know if we should exploit it.
You think?

370
00:35:17,743 --> 00:35:21,176
<i>I need you for this, Craigy.
You're my man on the inside.</i>

371
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:25,477
You need me? I'm your man?

372
00:35:26,243 --> 00:35:29,077
<i>Sure, whatever.</i>

373
00:35:29,577 --> 00:35:31,777
Hey everybody, I'm home.

374
00:35:32,011 --> 00:35:34,344
- Treats for everyone.
- Maxine?

375
00:35:34,611 --> 00:35:38,878
<i>- Yeah?
- We don't know the significance of this.</i>

376
00:35:39,145 --> 00:35:42,345
It might be dangerous to toy with?

377
00:35:42,612 --> 00:35:46,312
<i>I'll protect you, doll face.</i>

378
00:35:46,412 --> 00:35:48,979
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

379
00:35:51,513 --> 00:35:53,779
Who was that?

380
00:35:54,046 --> 00:35:57,380
I'm going to be working a lot of late nights
with this partner...

381
00:35:57,613 --> 00:36:01,414
...'cause Lestercorp's open during the day,
so I'll be working a lot of nights.

382
00:36:01,647 --> 00:36:04,581
It's a good thing. It'll get us
out of the hole financially...

383
00:36:04,847 --> 00:36:06,947
...'cause we're gonna turn it
into a business.

384
00:36:07,214 --> 00:36:09,948
But I don't understand.

385
00:36:10,214 --> 00:36:14,548
There's no such thing as a hole,
or a portal into somebody's brain.

386
00:36:14,815 --> 00:36:18,849
Yes, there is. A brain or soul or whatever.

387
00:36:19,082 --> 00:36:22,516
I was inside John Malkovich lookin' out.

388
00:36:22,782 --> 00:36:23,982
- Really?
- Yep.

389
00:36:24,216 --> 00:36:26,816
- I wanna try it then.
- Pardon?

390
00:36:27,049 --> 00:36:29,516
I want to be John Malkovich tomorrow.

391
00:36:29,783 --> 00:36:32,383
That'd be perfect,
'cause then I can meet your partner.

392
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:36,817
The thing is, Lestercorp's open during
the day, so we can't go during the day.

393
00:36:37,084 --> 00:36:40,117
But if you want to, we can do it right now.

394
00:36:40,351 --> 00:36:44,885
- Now? Right now?
- Tonight, on the way to Lester's.

395
00:36:56,086 --> 00:37:01,286
I'll meet you on the side of the road
by the New Jersey Turnpike.

396
00:37:05,687 --> 00:37:08,387
I'm scared.

397
00:37:08,587 --> 00:37:12,387
You don't have to do this, you know.

398
00:37:13,354 --> 00:37:14,788
No.

399
00:37:15,021 --> 00:37:17,488
No, I wanna go.

400
00:37:17,721 --> 00:37:21,055
- You sure?
- Yeah.

401
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:42,990
<i>It's wet.</i>

402
00:37:43,724 --> 00:37:46,224
<i>Weird.</i>

403
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:55,892
<i>That's nice.</i>

404
00:38:03,226 --> 00:38:07,359
<i>God, I feel sexy.</i>

405
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,027
Lotte, are you all right?

406
00:38:20,961 --> 00:38:22,694
Craig, I gotta go back!

407
00:38:22,961 --> 00:38:24,961
- No!
- Maybe tomorrow.

408
00:38:25,228 --> 00:38:30,895
- No! I gotta go back now!
- We'll talk about it later.

409
00:38:32,929 --> 00:38:36,029
Being inside did something to me.

410
00:38:36,262 --> 00:38:39,229
I knew who I was.

411
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:46,363
It's like everything made sense.
I knew who I was.

412
00:38:46,597 --> 00:38:49,264
But you weren't you.
You were John Malkovich.

413
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:53,831
God, I was. I was, wasn't I?

414
00:38:57,565 --> 00:39:00,698
I was John Malkovich.

415
00:39:01,498 --> 00:39:05,932
I was John fucking Malkovich!

416
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:12,799
- Take me back, Craig.
- We're late for Lester.

417
00:39:16,233 --> 00:39:20,567
So tell me, Lotte,
can you understand a word I'm saying?

418
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,600
Oh, yes, Dr. Lester. Absolutely.

419
00:39:22,834 --> 00:39:26,134
You were just explaining
the nutritional value...

420
00:39:26,401 --> 00:39:31,135
...of ingesting minerals through a colloidal
form which I couldn't agree more with.

421
00:39:31,401 --> 00:39:34,435
Be still, my heart.

422
00:39:37,335 --> 00:39:40,836
Dr. Lester, would you point me
in the direction of the restroom?

423
00:39:41,069 --> 00:39:46,736
With the greatest pleasure, my dear.
You go up the grand "escalier"...

424
00:39:46,803 --> 00:39:51,403
...and once atop the stairs you'll want
to enter the fifth door on my left.

425
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:56,837
- Watch the step down. It's sunken.
- Okay. Thank you.

426
00:41:09,711 --> 00:41:14,812
What do you think Lester's relationship
with John Malkovich is?

427
00:41:16,112 --> 00:41:17,912
That portal's been boarded up forever.

428
00:41:18,179 --> 00:41:22,912
I bet Lester's not even aware of it, him,
the portal. Why?

429
00:41:23,179 --> 00:41:24,713
No reason. I was just thinking.

430
00:41:24,946 --> 00:41:28,646
Do you think that it's kind of weird
that John Malkovich has a portal?

431
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,013
Do you think it might have some sort
of significance, for example?

432
00:41:32,247 --> 00:41:34,980
I don't know. Why do you think that?

433
00:41:35,214 --> 00:41:36,647
I don't even care.

434
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,347
I think it's kind of sexy
that John Malkovich has a portal.

435
00:41:40,614 --> 00:41:42,881
Sort of like he's a vagina.

436
00:41:43,148 --> 00:41:45,115
It's sort of vaginal, like he has a...

437
00:41:45,348 --> 00:41:48,582
...he has a penis and a vagina.

438
00:41:48,815 --> 00:41:50,682
It's sort of like...

439
00:41:50,949 --> 00:41:54,449
...Malkovich's feminine side.

440
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:58,116
I like that.

441
00:42:00,383 --> 00:42:02,416
"Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building...

442
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:05,450
...nightly from 9:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m."

443
00:42:05,717 --> 00:42:08,550
Sounds good. Oblique, but intriguing.
Phone it in.

444
00:42:08,784 --> 00:42:12,251
- Want me to phone it in?
- No.

445
00:42:13,617 --> 00:42:16,284
- Lotte!
- Hi.

446
00:42:16,551 --> 00:42:20,485
- I heard your voice.
- What are you doing here?

447
00:42:20,718 --> 00:42:23,885
Is this your partner? She's pretty.

448
00:42:24,152 --> 00:42:27,586
I had to do the Malkovich ride again,
you know? Is this her?

449
00:42:27,852 --> 00:42:29,619
- Hi. You're Craig's wife?
- Yeah. Hi.

450
00:42:29,852 --> 00:42:32,453
Lotte, Maxine. Maxine, Lotte.

451
00:42:32,686 --> 00:42:37,520
- Have you done Malkovich yet?
- Hi. Yeah, I want to place an ad.

452
00:42:37,787 --> 00:42:39,620
Okay. "Ever want to be someone else?"

453
00:42:39,853 --> 00:42:43,020
No, that's the ad, but we can talk
about you in a minute.

454
00:42:43,287 --> 00:42:45,254
"Ever want to be someone else?"

455
00:42:45,487 --> 00:42:48,321
"Now you can. Visit J.M. Inc."

456
00:42:48,588 --> 00:42:50,054
"Inc. Mertin."

457
00:42:50,288 --> 00:42:51,655
"M-E-R-T-I-N. Flemmer."

458
00:42:51,921 --> 00:42:55,422
You should really be at work.

459
00:42:57,122 --> 00:43:02,289
I've been going over and over
my experience last night, Craig.

460
00:43:02,922 --> 00:43:05,756
It was amazing.

461
00:43:06,523 --> 00:43:09,356
I've decided...

462
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:10,890
...that I'm a transsexual.

463
00:43:11,157 --> 00:43:14,257
- I know it's the craziest thing, Craig!
- Are you fuckin' nuts?

464
00:43:14,524 --> 00:43:19,957
No. It's just that for the first time,
everything just felt right.

465
00:43:19,957 --> 00:43:22,191
I've got to make sure.

466
00:43:22,458 --> 00:43:26,191
But if the feeling is still there...

467
00:43:26,858 --> 00:43:30,758
...I'm going to talk to Dr. Feldman
about sexual reassignment surgery.

468
00:43:30,992 --> 00:43:33,659
This is absurd!
Besides, Feldman is an allergist.

469
00:43:33,925 --> 00:43:36,492
If you're going to do something, do it right.

470
00:43:36,759 --> 00:43:39,493
You get these half-assed ideas
and do a half-assed job.

471
00:43:39,759 --> 00:43:40,626
Just drop it.

472
00:43:40,893 --> 00:43:44,160
It's just that I really like Dr. Feldman.
All right?

473
00:43:44,427 --> 00:43:46,993
So I thought
that I would ask him his opinion.

474
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:49,394
Is there something so terrible about that?

475
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:53,194
- Why do you always yell at me like this?
- Sweetie, I'm sorry.

476
00:43:53,427 --> 00:43:57,761
It's just a phase. It's the thrill of seeing
through somebody else's eyes.

477
00:43:58,028 --> 00:44:00,361
Okay? It'll pass.

478
00:44:00,595 --> 00:44:04,729
Don't stand in the way
of my actualization as a man.

479
00:44:04,995 --> 00:44:06,562
Let her go, Craig.

480
00:44:06,829 --> 00:44:09,529
- Okay.
- I mean him.

481
00:44:09,762 --> 00:44:12,463
Right now?

482
00:44:15,296 --> 00:44:18,297
It's the middle of the day.
How will I get her past Lester?

483
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:20,063
- Yawn. Figure it out.
- Okay.

484
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:22,530
Let's go. Come on.

485
00:44:22,797 --> 00:44:25,764
- Bye.
- Bye.

486
00:44:35,332 --> 00:44:37,665
Davey, it's Max.

487
00:44:37,932 --> 00:44:41,866
Listen, can you get me
John Malkovich's home phone?

488
00:44:42,099 --> 00:44:44,766
"But what I had been through."

489
00:44:45,033 --> 00:44:46,899
"I am hungry as the winter."

490
00:44:47,133 --> 00:44:51,867
"I am sick, anxious, poor as a beggar."

491
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,767
"Fate has tossed me hither and thither."

492
00:44:55,034 --> 00:44:57,667
"I have been everywhere. Everywhere."

493
00:44:57,901 --> 00:45:00,001
- "So strong."
- "But wherever I have been..."

494
00:45:00,234 --> 00:45:02,868
<i>- "...every minute, day and night..."
- I want that voice.</i>

495
00:45:03,134 --> 00:45:07,001
- "...my soul has been full..."
- "My soul has been full..."

496
00:45:07,235 --> 00:45:10,502
- "...of mysterious anticipation."
- "I feel the approach of happiness."

497
00:45:10,769 --> 00:45:14,836
"Anya, I see it coming."

498
00:45:18,503 --> 00:45:21,203
<i>- Yeah?
- Mr. John Malkovich?</i>

499
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:23,970
<i>- Yeah. Who's calling?
- Oh, my goodness!</i>

500
00:45:24,237 --> 00:45:26,737
<i>You don't know me, but I know you.</i>

501
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:29,337
<i>I'm a great admirer of yours.</i>

502
00:45:29,604 --> 00:45:31,304
How did you get this number?

503
00:45:31,571 --> 00:45:35,071
<i>It's just that...</i>

504
00:45:35,304 --> 00:45:36,471
<i>... I dream about you.</i>

505
00:45:36,738 --> 00:45:41,605
<i>And well, even speaking to you now
has gotten me sort of excited, you know?</i>

506
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:45,172
<i>The way this woman's talking to him.</i>

507
00:45:45,405 --> 00:45:50,539
Listen, I really don't find this amusing.
Don't call here anymore, okay?

508
00:45:50,773 --> 00:45:54,240
<i>My nipples are at attention,
General Malkovich, sir.</i>

509
00:45:54,506 --> 00:45:55,740
<i>What, her nipples?</i>

510
00:45:56,006 --> 00:45:58,507
<i>So why don't we have dinner tonight?</i>

511
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:01,240
<i>Bernardo's? 8:00?</i>

512
00:46:01,507 --> 00:46:06,974
<i>I really want to see you.
I just loved you in that jewel thief movie.</i>

513
00:46:10,274 --> 00:46:13,408
<i>You're not gonna meet her there?
Come on!</i>

514
00:46:13,641 --> 00:46:15,942
<i>Meet her. Meet here there.</i>

515
00:46:16,175 --> 00:46:17,942
<i>- Meet her there!
- "...as the winter."</i>

516
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:22,976
<i>"I am sick, anxious, poor as a beggar."</i>

517
00:46:23,242 --> 00:46:25,876
<i>- Meet her there!
- "Fate has tossed me hither and thither."</i>

518
00:46:26,109 --> 00:46:29,610
<i>"I have been everywhere. Everywhere."</i>

519
00:46:29,876 --> 00:46:33,110
<i>"But wherever I have been,
every minute, day and night..."</i>

520
00:46:33,377 --> 00:46:36,044
<i>Meet her there. Meet her there.</i>

521
00:46:36,277 --> 00:46:38,877
<i>Yes!</i>

522
00:46:43,744 --> 00:46:49,412
- How was it?
- I have to go back at 8:00 exactly tonight.

523
00:46:49,678 --> 00:46:54,146
- Why?
- Don't crowd me, Craig.

524
00:47:02,313 --> 00:47:05,447
- Excuse me. Are you John Malkovich?
- Yes, I am.

525
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:10,080
Wow. You really are great in that movie
where you play that retard.

526
00:47:10,314 --> 00:47:12,181
Thank you very much.

527
00:47:12,447 --> 00:47:15,214
- I have a cousin who's a retard.
- Thank you.

528
00:47:15,448 --> 00:47:18,715
So, as you might imagine,
it means a lot to me...

529
00:47:18,948 --> 00:47:21,382
...to see retards...

530
00:47:21,615 --> 00:47:24,615
...portrayed on the silver screen
so compassionately.

531
00:47:24,882 --> 00:47:27,849
Well, thank you very much. I appreciate it.

532
00:47:28,082 --> 00:47:30,849
Good night.

533
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:36,383
<i>- Maxine? It's Maxine.
- Hi.</i>

534
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:39,883
I'm so glad you decided to come.
I'm Maxine.

535
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:42,417
I'm John. How do you do?

536
00:47:42,684 --> 00:47:45,151
Good.

537
00:47:47,484 --> 00:47:53,618
I wasn't sure I was going to come,
but I felt oddly compelled.

538
00:47:54,185 --> 00:47:56,252
<i>You're so beautiful.</i>

539
00:47:56,485 --> 00:48:01,419
<i>The way you're looking at me,
I mean, at him, at us.</i>

540
00:48:04,919 --> 00:48:08,953
<i>I've never been looked at like this
by a woman before.</i>

541
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,620
<i>I think I'm sweating.</i>

542
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:14,053
I must say, I was intrigued by your voice.

543
00:48:14,287 --> 00:48:17,187
And the funny thing is, Mr. Malkovich...

544
00:48:17,421 --> 00:48:22,421
...my voice is probably
the least intriguing thing about me.

545
00:48:25,988 --> 00:48:30,222
So, I mean, how was it?
What was he doing?

546
00:48:30,488 --> 00:48:34,256
He wasn't doing anything, really.
He was just hanging around his apartment.

547
00:48:34,522 --> 00:48:38,789
I think he's probably
just a really Ionely guy.

548
00:48:39,023 --> 00:48:43,190
See, men can feel unfulfilled too, Lotte.
I'm glad you're finally realizing that.

549
00:48:43,456 --> 00:48:45,690
You shouldn't assume
that switching bodies...

550
00:48:45,957 --> 00:48:49,624
...is gonna be the answer to your problems.

551
00:48:49,857 --> 00:48:53,591
You're right, Craig. You're right.

552
00:48:54,591 --> 00:48:57,324
You know what I was thinking?
I was thinking that maybe...

553
00:48:57,591 --> 00:49:00,091
...we should invite Maxine
over for dinner one night...

554
00:49:00,325 --> 00:49:03,958
...because you're partners and
I thought it might be a really nice gesture.

555
00:49:04,225 --> 00:49:07,259
- I think she'd like that.
- Maxine?

556
00:49:07,526 --> 00:49:11,059
The thing is, there's been some tension
between us at work...

557
00:49:11,293 --> 00:49:14,326
...business stuff,
and I would hate to expose you to that.

558
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,026
It'll be okay.

559
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:20,693
I'll cook my lasagna,
we'll smoke a joint, and...

560
00:49:20,994 --> 00:49:24,027
...tensions will just melt away.

561
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:28,894
Now, when you say that I can be
somebody else, what do you mean exactly?

562
00:49:29,161 --> 00:49:32,461
Well, we mean exactly that.

563
00:49:32,695 --> 00:49:37,429
We can put you inside someone else's body
for 15 minutes.

564
00:49:37,662 --> 00:49:41,362
Can I be anybody that I wanna be?

565
00:49:44,029 --> 00:49:46,563
- Actually...
- You can be John Malkovich.

566
00:49:46,796 --> 00:49:52,930
That's perfect!
It's my second choice, but it's wonderful.

567
00:49:55,597 --> 00:49:58,597
I'm a fat man. I am sad and fat...

568
00:49:58,864 --> 00:50:01,531
$200?

569
00:50:02,931 --> 00:50:05,365
Yes.

570
00:50:12,332 --> 00:50:15,332
Okay. You gotta crawl in there.

571
00:50:15,566 --> 00:50:18,299
Oh, my God.

572
00:50:35,134 --> 00:50:38,968
No, that's what I'm saying.
See, I don't really need an extra bath mat.

573
00:50:39,235 --> 00:50:41,935
So if I get the set, would it be possible...

574
00:50:42,168 --> 00:50:44,302
...if I could just get maybe three...

575
00:50:44,569 --> 00:50:48,236
...extra hand towels...

576
00:50:48,469 --> 00:50:50,636
...if I get the set, instead of the bath mat?

577
00:50:50,903 --> 00:50:54,536
<i>- Yes, sir. Sure, we can do that.
- Great. That sounds good.</i>

578
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:58,270
And for the color: Periwinkle?

579
00:50:58,537 --> 00:51:03,337
<i>I'm sorry. We're out of stock in periwinkle.
Do you want to back order?</i>

580
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:07,371
No. I'll go with the Ioden.

581
00:51:07,638 --> 00:51:09,471
<i>Would you like to order anything else?</i>

582
00:51:09,704 --> 00:51:16,438
What is the difference between
the foot-pampering, looped cotton rug...

583
00:51:16,672 --> 00:51:19,705
...and the bath mat?

584
00:51:33,773 --> 00:51:36,240
You're my friends. Thank you.

585
00:51:36,474 --> 00:51:40,774
Did you know that Eskimos have not one...

586
00:51:41,041 --> 00:51:42,941
...but...

587
00:51:43,208 --> 00:51:46,441
...forty-nine words for snow?

588
00:51:47,108 --> 00:51:51,009
It's because they have so much of it.

589
00:51:53,909 --> 00:51:56,709
So much snow.

590
00:51:57,509 --> 00:52:00,676
After dinner, I'll show you my puppets.

591
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:05,710
After dinner, I'll introduce you
to my chimp Elijah.

592
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:10,177
He has an ulcer right now
due to suppressed childhood trauma...

593
00:52:10,444 --> 00:52:14,044
...but we're working through it.

594
00:52:15,311 --> 00:52:18,111
Psychotherapy.

595
00:52:37,447 --> 00:52:41,414
- This the bedroom?
- Yeah.

596
00:52:42,847 --> 00:52:45,514
<i>The thing is, the way that I see it...</i>

597
00:52:45,747 --> 00:52:48,548
...I think the world is divided...

598
00:52:48,814 --> 00:52:53,548
...into those who go after what they want
and then those who don't, right?

599
00:52:53,815 --> 00:52:55,248
- Right.
- The passionate ones...

600
00:52:55,515 --> 00:52:57,515
...the ones who go after what they want...

601
00:52:57,749 --> 00:53:02,516
...well, they may not get what they want.

602
00:53:04,049 --> 00:53:06,816
But at least they remain vital.

603
00:53:07,049 --> 00:53:07,883
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

604
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:14,150
So when they lie on their death beds,
they have few regrets.

605
00:53:14,417 --> 00:53:16,917
Right?

606
00:53:20,717 --> 00:53:23,584
And the ones who don't go after
what they want...

607
00:53:23,818 --> 00:53:29,018
...well, who gives a shit
about them anyway?

608
00:53:30,418 --> 00:53:33,885
- Lotte!
- Craig!

609
00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:36,786
I don't find you attractive.

610
00:53:37,052 --> 00:53:40,853
And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you.

611
00:53:41,086 --> 00:53:43,253
I am. But only when you're in Malkovich.

612
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,920
When I looked into his eyes last night,
I could feel you peering out.

613
00:53:47,187 --> 00:53:48,987
- Really?
- Yeah.

614
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:53,354
Behind the stubble and the too-prominent
brow and the male-pattern baldness...

615
00:53:53,621 --> 00:53:56,688
...I sensed your feminine longing.

616
00:53:56,954 --> 00:53:59,588
And it just slew me.

617
00:53:59,821 --> 00:54:02,522
Oh, my God!

618
00:54:03,955 --> 00:54:08,489
Only as John, sweetie. Sorry.

619
00:54:09,622 --> 00:54:13,156
Thanks for a wonderful dinner.

620
00:54:13,423 --> 00:54:16,756
No hard feelings, partner?

621
00:54:33,058 --> 00:54:33,891
J.M. Inc.

622
00:54:34,158 --> 00:54:36,092
<i>Hi. It's Lotte.</i>

623
00:54:36,358 --> 00:54:39,192
<i>I'd like very much to see you again.</i>

624
00:54:39,425 --> 00:54:43,559
<i>Can you call him and invite yourself over?</i>

625
00:54:43,959 --> 00:54:46,726
When?

626
00:54:48,726 --> 00:54:50,993
<i>Tonight after you close?</i>

627
00:54:51,227 --> 00:54:55,660
Okay, 4:11.

628
00:54:55,927 --> 00:54:57,594
4:11?

629
00:54:57,827 --> 00:55:02,128
<i>- Thank you, Maxine.
- You're welcome.</i>

630
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:32,997
Thanks so much for having me over,
sugarplum.

631
00:55:33,231 --> 00:55:34,898
I'm glad you called.

632
00:55:35,164 --> 00:55:38,398
Shall we to the "boudoir"?

633
00:55:40,798 --> 00:55:44,432
A couple of minutes. I'm early.

634
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:03,734
So do you enjoy being an actor?

635
00:56:05,267 --> 00:56:09,734
Sure. It's very rewarding.

636
00:56:26,069 --> 00:56:30,036
- Hi.
- Hi.

637
00:56:43,904 --> 00:56:46,305
<i>My sweet Maxine.</i>

638
00:56:46,571 --> 00:56:50,138
<i>- My darling.
- I love you, Lotte.</i>

639
00:56:55,272 --> 00:56:58,439
Did you call me Lotte?

640
00:57:02,606 --> 00:57:05,373
Do you mind?

641
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,874
No, not really.

642
00:57:10,774 --> 00:57:14,741
<i>- Oh, God.
- My sweet, beautiful Lotte.</i>

643
00:57:15,008 --> 00:57:16,674
<i>Maxine!</i>

644
00:57:16,908 --> 00:57:19,241
Yes, Maxine. Yes.

645
00:57:19,508 --> 00:57:23,708
<i>Maxine, this is so right.</i>

646
00:58:11,813 --> 00:58:15,047
- You were him, weren't you?
- Yeah.

647
00:58:15,314 --> 00:58:17,947
And he was with her!

648
00:58:18,181 --> 00:58:19,347
We love her, Craig.

649
00:58:19,614 --> 00:58:21,648
<i>- We?
- John and me.</i>

650
00:58:21,881 --> 00:58:23,014
Don't forget about me!

651
00:58:23,281 --> 00:58:27,582
You have the Maxine action figure
to play with!

652
00:58:27,748 --> 00:58:31,782
I'm sorry. That was nasty.

653
00:59:00,051 --> 00:59:03,652
You are late, my little cowboy.

654
00:59:05,219 --> 00:59:08,352
Are you torturing me on purpose?

655
00:59:08,619 --> 00:59:12,519
- I've fallen in love.
- I don't think so.

656
00:59:12,786 --> 00:59:15,520
You know why?
Because I've fallen in love!

657
00:59:15,786 --> 00:59:18,253
This is what people
who've fallen in love look like.

658
00:59:18,487 --> 00:59:24,087
You picked the unrequited variety.
It's very bad for the skin.

659
00:59:27,221 --> 00:59:29,454
You're evil, Maxine.

660
00:59:29,721 --> 00:59:32,955
Do you have any idea what it's like
to have two people look at you...

661
00:59:33,221 --> 00:59:34,922
...with total lust and devotion...

662
00:59:35,155 --> 00:59:38,889
...through the same pair of eyes?

663
00:59:41,356 --> 00:59:43,289
No, I don't suppose you would.

664
00:59:43,556 --> 00:59:47,023
It's quite a thrill, Craigy.

665
01:00:34,061 --> 01:00:35,694
What are you doing?

666
01:00:35,928 --> 01:00:38,395
- Oh, my God! Is that real? What is that?
- Yes!

667
01:00:38,661 --> 01:00:44,395
I don't know how to use it very well,
so don't make any sudden moves!

668
01:00:45,362 --> 01:00:48,029
I'm serious! I'm serious.

669
01:00:48,296 --> 01:00:51,196
Suck my dick!

670
01:00:51,529 --> 01:00:55,796
Shut up, okay? Just shut up.

671
01:01:10,131 --> 01:01:13,565
- Craig!
- Tell her you need to see her.

672
01:01:13,798 --> 01:01:17,965
<i>J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.</i>

673
01:01:18,032 --> 01:01:19,465
I need to see you.

674
01:01:19,732 --> 01:01:21,466
<i>Sweetie!</i>

675
01:01:21,732 --> 01:01:24,099
<i>I had so much fun with you last night.</i>

676
01:01:24,366 --> 01:01:27,933
<i>Shoot. But it's business hours.</i>

677
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:31,867
Tell her, "What the hell,
close early, live dangerously."

678
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:34,667
Say it.

679
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:39,567
What the hell, you know?

680
01:01:40,134 --> 01:01:43,034
Live dangerously. Close early.

681
01:01:43,301 --> 01:01:44,635
<i>Doll.</i>

682
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:48,768
<i>I love this new devil-may-care side of you.</i>

683
01:01:49,002 --> 01:01:53,302
<i>All right. I'll track down lover-boy
and see both of you in one hour.</i>

684
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:56,336
Exactamundo.

685
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:10,037
- What's the matter with you? Stop it!
- Sit up, okay? Just sit up. Just sit up.

686
01:02:16,571 --> 01:02:20,071
Help! He's locking me in a cage!

687
01:02:20,338 --> 01:02:23,772
Shut the hell up!

688
01:02:23,838 --> 01:02:27,105
Shut up!

689
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:40,140
<i>"Was ever woman in this humor wooed?"</i>

690
01:02:40,373 --> 01:02:45,174
"Was ever woman in this humor won?"

691
01:02:49,108 --> 01:02:52,641
Tommy, can I take 15?

692
01:02:53,241 --> 01:02:58,442
Good night, everybody.
See you back here at 9:00 p.m. tomorrow.

693
01:03:07,476 --> 01:03:11,410
Lotte, this is so good!

694
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:15,010
<i>My God! This is amazing.</i>

695
01:03:15,244 --> 01:03:18,211
<i>I want to touch her breast.
Touch her breast.</i>

696
01:03:18,477 --> 01:03:20,411
<i>Move right hand across left breast now.</i>

697
01:03:20,678 --> 01:03:23,044
<i>Move right hand across left breast now!</i>

698
01:03:23,311 --> 01:03:25,311
<i>Move right hand across left breast now!</i>

699
01:03:25,545 --> 01:03:28,078
<i>- Holy shit, yes!
- Holy shit, yes!</i>

700
01:03:28,345 --> 01:03:32,145
<i>- Holy shit, he said what I said!
- Shit, he said what I said!</i>

701
01:03:32,379 --> 01:03:36,146
<i>- Lotte? Is that you?
- Yes, yes, sweetheart.</i>

702
01:03:36,379 --> 01:03:38,813
Yes, sweetheart, yes.

703
01:03:39,079 --> 01:03:42,813
What the fuck is going on?
That's not me! I didn't say that.

704
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:46,180
<i>- Lotte.
- Maxine.</i>

705
01:03:47,647 --> 01:03:49,680
Something was making me talk.

706
01:03:49,947 --> 01:03:52,747
Some goddamn thing
was making me move.

707
01:03:52,981 --> 01:03:55,281
- I've gotta get out of here.
- Doll face!

708
01:03:55,548 --> 01:03:58,981
It was just your passion for me taking hold.

709
01:03:59,248 --> 01:04:03,948
No, doll face. I know what
my passion taking hold feels like.

710
01:04:04,215 --> 01:04:05,382
Bye!

711
01:04:05,615 --> 01:04:07,882
I did it!

712
01:04:08,116 --> 01:04:14,150
I made him move his arm
across your girlfriend's glorious tit!

713
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:17,883
And I made him talk, sort of.

714
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:20,717
It's just a matter of practice
before Malkovich...

715
01:04:20,984 --> 01:04:26,451
...is nothing more than another puppet
hanging next to my work table.

716
01:04:27,451 --> 01:04:30,184
I'll tell you about it when I get home, okay?
All right?

717
01:04:30,451 --> 01:04:34,652
Craig! I wanna...

718
01:04:43,652 --> 01:04:45,653
No, man, I'm sorry...

719
01:04:45,919 --> 01:04:50,687
...I'm sorry to have called you like that,
but I was just really scared.

720
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,187
I was so freaked out.

721
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:57,687
I mean, it was like, somebody was
just moving all the way through me...

722
01:04:57,921 --> 01:05:00,554
...moving my arms, moving my hands,
talking for me.

723
01:05:00,788 --> 01:05:03,821
I mean, literally,
I feel like I'm going crazy, Charlie.

724
01:05:04,055 --> 01:05:05,921
I'm sure you're not going crazy.

725
01:05:06,188 --> 01:05:10,022
You don't understand, man.
It was like nothing I've ever felt before.

726
01:05:10,288 --> 01:05:12,989
- Were you stoned?
- Yes, I was...

727
01:05:13,222 --> 01:05:15,722
Jesus.

728
01:05:16,389 --> 01:05:19,189
Yes, I was stoned.

729
01:05:19,456 --> 01:05:22,023
But that doesn't have
anything to do with it.

730
01:05:22,290 --> 01:05:24,590
Charlie, someone was talking
through my mouth.

731
01:05:24,823 --> 01:05:29,757
You were stoned.
Case closed. End of story.

732
01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:32,624
- How hot is this babe?
- You know what?

733
01:05:32,891 --> 01:05:35,458
Maybe it was this Lotte woman talking...

734
01:05:35,724 --> 01:05:38,391
...because it could have been her
talking through me.

735
01:05:38,625 --> 01:05:40,792
Because the weird thing is...

736
01:05:41,058 --> 01:05:44,259
...this Maxine likes to call me Lotte.

737
01:05:44,525 --> 01:05:47,259
Ouch. That is hot.

738
01:05:47,526 --> 01:05:50,893
Maybe she's using you
to channel some dead, lesbian lover.

739
01:05:51,126 --> 01:05:53,859
She's my kind of gal.
Tell me when you're done with her.

740
01:05:54,093 --> 01:05:57,827
What are you talking about,
"done with her"? Tonight freaked me out.

741
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:01,560
You're nuts to let a girl go
that calls you Lotte.

742
01:06:01,827 --> 01:06:06,494
I don't know anything about the girl.
She could be a fucking witch or something.

743
01:06:06,727 --> 01:06:08,294
That's even better!

744
01:06:08,528 --> 01:06:13,461
Hot, lesbian witches.
Think about it. It's fucking genius.

745
01:06:14,362 --> 01:06:17,529
I gotta know the truth, Charlie.

746
01:06:17,795 --> 01:06:21,662
The truth is for suckers, Johnny boy.

747
01:07:04,533 --> 01:07:06,167
Thanks.

748
01:07:06,433 --> 01:07:09,034
This way.

749
01:07:54,772 --> 01:08:00,139
Excuse me. Exactly what type of service
does this company provide?

750
01:08:00,372 --> 01:08:03,306
You get to be John Malkovich
for 15 minutes.

751
01:08:03,572 --> 01:08:06,573
200 clams.

752
01:08:08,073 --> 01:08:09,806
I see.

753
01:08:10,073 --> 01:08:14,607
- No cutting, by the way.
- No cutting!

754
01:08:18,441 --> 01:08:21,708
Come on! Break it up!
Break it up! Cut it out!

755
01:08:21,941 --> 01:08:24,608
Everybody gets...
It's him. It's John Malkovich.

756
01:08:24,875 --> 01:08:27,608
Sorry, Mr. Malkovich.
Hope we didn't hurt you too terribly.

757
01:08:27,875 --> 01:08:30,575
Get inside!

758
01:08:30,875 --> 01:08:34,676
- Darling!
- What the fuck is going on?

759
01:08:34,876 --> 01:08:38,543
John Malkovich. Mr. Malkovich, sir.

760
01:08:41,010 --> 01:08:44,843
- Mr. Malkovich, I think I can explain.
- Yeah, explain.

761
01:08:45,110 --> 01:08:47,110
My name is Craig Schwartz...

762
01:08:47,344 --> 01:08:49,777
...and we operate a little business here...

763
01:08:50,010 --> 01:08:53,677
...that simulates for our clientele...

764
01:08:53,944 --> 01:08:55,611
...the experience...

765
01:08:55,844 --> 01:08:58,111
...of being you, actually.

766
01:08:58,345 --> 01:09:01,112
- Simulates?
- Yeah, after a fashion.

767
01:09:01,345 --> 01:09:04,979
- What exactly does that mean?
- Well, it's hard to describe.

768
01:09:05,245 --> 01:09:06,245
I want to do it.

769
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:08,412
That'd pale compared
to the real experience.

770
01:09:08,646 --> 01:09:11,413
- I want to do it!
- Right now Mr. Hiroshi's in the tube...

771
01:09:11,646 --> 01:09:14,413
- Let him do it, Craig.
- Of course.

772
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:19,013
Right this way, Mr. Malkovich,
compliments of the house.

773
01:09:26,081 --> 01:09:28,581
Jesus.

774
01:09:43,182 --> 01:09:47,416
What happens when a man
goes through his own portal?

775
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:50,283
We'll see.

776
01:10:20,219 --> 01:10:22,686
Malkovich.

777
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:26,087
Malkovich. Malkovich.

778
01:11:29,593 --> 01:11:31,993
- How was it?
- It was amazing this time.

779
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:36,127
- That was no simulation!
- I know. I'm sorry.

780
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:37,160
It's an honor.

781
01:11:37,427 --> 01:11:41,261
I have been to the dark side.
I've seen a world that no man should see!

782
01:11:41,494 --> 01:11:44,628
Really? For most people,
it's a rather pleasant experience.

783
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:48,528
That portal is mine,
and it must be sealed forever...

784
01:11:48,762 --> 01:11:51,529
...for the love of God.

785
01:11:51,762 --> 01:11:55,362
But, Mr. Malkovich, sir,
with all due respect...

786
01:11:55,596 --> 01:11:57,763
...I discovered that portal.

787
01:11:58,029 --> 01:11:59,729
It's my livelihood. You understand?

788
01:11:59,996 --> 01:12:05,163
It's my head, Schwartz! It's my head!

789
01:12:05,397 --> 01:12:09,064
I will see you in court!

790
01:12:10,230 --> 01:12:13,131
What makes you think
I won't be seeing what you're seeing...

791
01:12:13,364 --> 01:12:14,564
...in court?

792
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:18,165
Hey, Malkovich, think fast!

793
01:12:19,165 --> 01:12:21,165
Fuck!

794
01:12:21,432 --> 01:12:23,598
Dinner.

795
01:12:23,832 --> 01:12:27,766
You know, Craig,
once this was a relationship...

796
01:12:27,999 --> 01:12:30,099
...built on love.

797
01:12:30,332 --> 01:12:32,099
Well, you gave up that claim...

798
01:12:32,333 --> 01:12:35,266
...after the first time you stuck your dick
in Maxine, Lotte.

799
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:37,533
You fell in love with her first, Craig.

800
01:12:37,767 --> 01:12:41,967
But I didn't do anything about it,
out of respect for our marriage.

801
01:12:42,234 --> 01:12:45,367
You didn't do anything about it, Craig...

802
01:12:45,601 --> 01:12:51,368
...because she wouldn't let you near her
with a 10-foot pole!

803
01:12:56,935 --> 01:12:59,702
That's true.

804
01:13:02,869 --> 01:13:06,403
God, Lotte, what have I become?

805
01:13:07,870 --> 01:13:11,503
My wife, in a cage with a monkey.

806
01:13:12,003 --> 01:13:16,304
I need to go to the bathroom
and take a shower.

807
01:13:21,804 --> 01:13:25,905
What am I, some kind of monster?

808
01:13:25,971 --> 01:13:28,638
I don't want to be a monster, Lotte,
I don't want to.

809
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:31,705
Craig, you're not a monster. No.

810
01:13:31,939 --> 01:13:34,039
I know you're not a monster, honey.

811
01:13:34,272 --> 01:13:36,439
You're just...

812
01:13:36,706 --> 01:13:42,273
...a very, very confused man.

813
01:13:43,273 --> 01:13:46,607
I love you so much.

814
01:13:49,007 --> 01:13:52,207
I love you.

815
01:14:00,308 --> 01:14:03,375
Come on, Craig.

816
01:14:10,342 --> 01:14:13,343
<i>- J.M. Inc.
- Maxine.</i>

817
01:14:13,609 --> 01:14:15,410
Lotte.

818
01:14:15,643 --> 01:14:18,077
I've been thinking about us, you know?

819
01:14:18,310 --> 01:14:20,577
<i>We have to meet.</i>

820
01:14:20,810 --> 01:14:23,544
Okay, I'll see you in Malkovich in one hour.

821
01:14:23,777 --> 01:14:26,977
Craig!

822
01:14:28,311 --> 01:14:31,011
I hate you.

823
01:15:50,219 --> 01:15:51,319
Elijah!

824
01:15:51,586 --> 01:15:55,120
You really are magnificent.

825
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,653
<i>- J.M. Inc.
- Maxine!</i>

826
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:02,554
Honey pie! I was just heading
out the door to meet you.

827
01:16:02,787 --> 01:16:03,720
<i>Listen, Maxine.</i>

828
01:16:03,954 --> 01:16:07,921
It hasn't been me in Malkovich last time.
It's been that son of a bitch Craig.

829
01:16:08,154 --> 01:16:11,355
He had me locked in a cage with my chimp,
holding a gun to my head.

830
01:16:11,588 --> 01:16:13,221
<i>- Oh, my God!
- He made me call you.</i>

831
01:16:13,455 --> 01:16:15,855
<i>I'm sorry, Maxine.
It's been him the whole time.</i>

832
01:16:16,088 --> 01:16:18,289
I'm so sorry. That's horrible.

833
01:16:18,555 --> 01:16:20,522
I miss you so much, Maxine.

834
01:16:20,756 --> 01:16:22,422
So, but...

835
01:16:22,689 --> 01:16:26,489
<i>...that was Craig inside of Malkovich?
- Yes, it was him.</i>

836
01:16:26,723 --> 01:16:28,890
It's because he's a puppeteer, I think.

837
01:16:29,156 --> 01:16:32,057
Well, boy, I'm...

838
01:16:32,357 --> 01:16:34,357
I'm surprised. That's pretty impressive.

839
01:16:34,624 --> 01:16:38,391
<i>- What?
- So if Craig can control Malkovich...</i>

840
01:16:38,657 --> 01:16:41,291
<i>- ... and I can control Craig...
- But, Maxine...</i>

841
01:16:41,524 --> 01:16:44,458
...I thought it was me that you loved!

842
01:16:44,691 --> 01:16:47,325
I do.

843
01:16:50,759 --> 01:16:55,126
It's confusing, you know?
This is a very confusing situation.

844
01:16:55,392 --> 01:16:57,926
<i>I know.</i>

845
01:17:00,226 --> 01:17:03,760
Listen, I should really get going, okay?

846
01:17:04,027 --> 01:17:06,427
'Cause I'm gonna be late
for Malkovich now.

847
01:17:06,693 --> 01:17:09,394
<i>- What?
- We'll talk about this later.</i>

848
01:17:09,627 --> 01:17:14,694
<i>- Maxine! Wait!
- Okay?</i>

849
01:17:46,397 --> 01:17:48,664
What the fuck do you want?

850
01:17:48,931 --> 01:17:52,965
I can explain about the portal, darling.

851
01:17:55,465 --> 01:17:57,432
Listen, don't con me, Maxine.

852
01:17:57,699 --> 01:18:01,899
I don't know who the hell you people are,
but this insanity is now over.

853
01:18:02,132 --> 01:18:04,733
Shut up.

854
01:18:04,866 --> 01:18:07,500
Craigy. Craig.

855
01:18:07,733 --> 01:18:11,233
Schwartzy, are you in there?

856
01:18:14,734 --> 01:18:17,034
How did you know it was me?

857
01:18:17,301 --> 01:18:21,868
Lotte called me.
She escaped your evil clutches.

858
01:18:22,134 --> 01:18:24,868
Really? Well, I'm really sorry
I did that, Maxine...

859
01:18:25,135 --> 01:18:31,035
...but I'm really in love with you,
and I didn't know how else to be with you.

860
01:18:32,335 --> 01:18:34,902
Apparently you can control
this Malkovich fellow now?

861
01:18:35,136 --> 01:18:37,269
Yes, I'm getting better all the time.

862
01:18:37,503 --> 01:18:39,003
I'll say you are.

863
01:18:39,269 --> 01:18:42,736
Hey, let's do it on his dining room table.

864
01:18:42,970 --> 01:18:45,137
Then we'll make him
eat an omelet off of it.

865
01:18:45,403 --> 01:18:46,370
No!

866
01:18:46,603 --> 01:18:50,404
Shut up, you overrated sack of shit!

867
01:18:51,437 --> 01:18:54,038
Craigy.

868
01:19:17,807 --> 01:19:20,007
Yes?

869
01:19:20,273 --> 01:19:21,174
Hi, Dr. Lester.

870
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:27,074
It's Lotte Schwartz, Craig's wife.

871
01:19:27,107 --> 01:19:27,674
Yes.

872
01:19:27,941 --> 01:19:30,108
Oh, my God.
You'll catch your death out here.

873
01:19:30,341 --> 01:19:35,242
Look at you. You're soaking wet.
Please come in, come in.

874
01:19:40,942 --> 01:19:45,376
- Here you are, my dear.
- Thank you.

875
01:19:45,609 --> 01:19:47,043
How's that?

876
01:19:47,276 --> 01:19:49,343
Much better, thank you.

877
01:19:49,576 --> 01:19:51,377
So, my dear...

878
01:19:51,610 --> 01:19:55,810
...what is it that brings you to my doorway
on such an inhospitable evening?

879
01:19:56,044 --> 01:19:57,744
Well, Dr. Lester...

880
01:19:58,011 --> 01:20:00,711
See, I...

881
01:20:00,978 --> 01:20:05,711
I have a very unhealthy obsession
with John Malkovich.

882
01:20:06,311 --> 01:20:07,645
I see.

883
01:20:07,878 --> 01:20:10,945
You mean, the performer.

884
01:20:11,179 --> 01:20:12,179
Yes.

885
01:20:12,445 --> 01:20:16,679
And what prompted you
to come to me with this issue?

886
01:20:16,946 --> 01:20:21,480
Well, when I was here
with my husband for dinner...

887
01:20:21,513 --> 01:20:26,580
...I came upon a room that seemed to be
some sort of John Malkovich museum.

888
01:20:26,813 --> 01:20:29,380
So I thought, perhaps, maybe you would...

889
01:20:29,614 --> 01:20:33,914
...have some appreciation
for my state of mind.

890
01:20:35,381 --> 01:20:37,381
You look so lovely, my dear...

891
01:20:37,615 --> 01:20:42,448
...standing before the fire
in my oversized man's robe.

892
01:20:43,848 --> 01:20:47,015
Thank you, Dr. Lester.

893
01:20:48,216 --> 01:20:50,082
Tell me...

894
01:20:50,349 --> 01:20:54,350
...what is this strange power
that Malkovich exudes?

895
01:20:54,583 --> 01:21:00,550
You've gotta help me understand.
All I think about is wanting to be him.

896
01:21:01,017 --> 01:21:03,717
- Wanting to what?
- Wanting to be him.

897
01:21:03,984 --> 01:21:07,451
Wanting to be John Malkovich.

898
01:21:08,084 --> 01:21:10,685
I see.

899
01:21:10,751 --> 01:21:14,452
Well, perhaps you can.

900
01:21:14,685 --> 01:21:15,685
But, Dr. Lester...

901
01:21:15,952 --> 01:21:19,719
I am not Dr. Lester.

902
01:21:19,952 --> 01:21:23,152
I am Captain Mertin.

903
01:21:23,219 --> 01:21:24,619
I don't understand.

904
01:21:24,886 --> 01:21:29,253
It was 90 years ago
that I discovered a strange portal.

905
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:33,587
And I found that this portal led
to a vessel body...

906
01:21:33,853 --> 01:21:39,321
...and that I could live forever
by leaping from vessel to vessel.

907
01:21:41,354 --> 01:21:46,321
- So Dr. Lester is such a vessel?
- Yes, he is.

908
01:21:46,688 --> 01:21:49,955
You still there, sweets?

909
01:21:52,889 --> 01:21:56,356
I figured out how to hang on
as long as I want.

910
01:21:56,622 --> 01:21:59,589
It's all a matter of making friends
with the Malkovich body.

911
01:21:59,823 --> 01:22:04,023
Rather than thinking of it as an enemy
that has to be pounded into submission...

912
01:22:04,290 --> 01:22:07,457
...I've begun imagining it
as a really expensive suit...

913
01:22:07,724 --> 01:22:10,957
...that I enjoy wearing.

914
01:22:17,591 --> 01:22:19,358
This illustrates...

915
01:22:19,591 --> 01:22:22,925
...how I will move
into my next vessel, Malkovich...

916
01:22:23,192 --> 01:22:25,092
...on his 44th birthday.

917
01:22:25,359 --> 01:22:26,892
That's when he becomes ripe.

918
01:22:27,125 --> 01:22:29,859
But I must enter by midnight on that day.

919
01:22:30,092 --> 01:22:35,093
After that, I'd get diverted
into the next newly forming infant vessel.

920
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:36,826
I don't want that to happen.

921
01:22:37,060 --> 01:22:40,727
- I'd be absorbed.
- Absorbed? What does that mean?

922
01:22:40,994 --> 01:22:45,294
Well, trapped, held prisoner,
if you like, in the host's brain...

923
01:22:45,527 --> 01:22:47,061
...unable to control anything...

924
01:22:47,328 --> 01:22:52,528
...forever doomed to watch the world
through someone else's eyes.

925
01:22:53,795 --> 01:22:55,862
Now I'd like you to meet some friends.

926
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:58,262
See, I got Ionely in Lester by myself...

927
01:22:58,495 --> 01:23:02,096
...so I figured out a way this time
to take others along with me.

928
01:23:02,329 --> 01:23:04,796
Come.

929
01:23:08,930 --> 01:23:10,863
Everyone, this is Lotte.

930
01:23:11,097 --> 01:23:15,930
- Hi, Lotte!
- She's a new friend of mine.

931
01:23:20,231 --> 01:23:24,031
Do a puppet show for me, Craig, honey.

932
01:23:24,265 --> 01:23:26,598
You mean, with Malkovich?

933
01:23:26,865 --> 01:23:30,699
- I'd love to see your work.
- Really?

934
01:23:32,832 --> 01:23:35,299
Okay.

935
01:23:43,166 --> 01:23:45,467
This is something that I call:

936
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:51,067
"Craig's Dance of Despair
and Disillusionment."

937
01:25:22,110 --> 01:25:26,277
That was incredible! You're brilliant!

938
01:25:26,510 --> 01:25:30,611
You see, Maxine,
it isn't just playing with dolls.

939
01:25:30,844 --> 01:25:32,944
My darling, it's so much more!

940
01:25:33,177 --> 01:25:36,478
It's playing with people.

941
01:25:41,078 --> 01:25:44,145
Stay in him forever.

942
01:25:45,712 --> 01:25:50,512
How will we make a living
if our clientele can't access to our product?

943
01:25:50,746 --> 01:25:54,413
Well, we'll have all the money
in Malkovich's bank account...

944
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:56,746
...plus he does get
acting work occasionally.

945
01:25:57,013 --> 01:25:58,913
No, please!

946
01:25:59,180 --> 01:26:03,314
Shut up! We're trying to think here.

947
01:26:04,181 --> 01:26:08,748
It is sort of like puppeteering.

948
01:26:09,014 --> 01:26:13,148
- I like that about it.
- Exactly!

949
01:26:13,381 --> 01:26:18,782
And no one would ever even
have to know it's not him.

950
01:26:19,982 --> 01:26:22,749
And I could use Malkovich's
existing notoriety...

951
01:26:22,982 --> 01:26:25,616
...to launch my own puppeteering career.

952
01:26:25,849 --> 01:26:29,850
Craigy, that's brilliant.

953
01:26:30,116 --> 01:26:33,917
So lovely. I've always wondered
what it would be like to have a penis.

954
01:26:34,150 --> 01:26:36,317
- Now I'll know.
- Really? I know it's very...

955
01:26:36,584 --> 01:26:39,917
Lotte? We like you.

956
01:26:40,151 --> 01:26:43,284
We can see you're a kind
and decent woman...

957
01:26:43,551 --> 01:26:45,018
...and so...

958
01:26:45,251 --> 01:26:49,918
...we've decided to offer you a place
in John Malkovich with us...

959
01:26:50,185 --> 01:26:53,019
...if you like.

960
01:26:56,386 --> 01:26:58,353
Dr. Lester...

961
01:26:58,586 --> 01:27:00,986
...you've been so kind to me...

962
01:27:01,220 --> 01:27:03,020
...and trusting.

963
01:27:03,286 --> 01:27:05,187
And...

964
01:27:05,453 --> 01:27:09,787
...there's something I think you should
know about the Malkovich vessel.

965
01:27:10,020 --> 01:27:11,987
<i>John's here to see you.
Should I send him in?</i>

966
01:27:12,221 --> 01:27:18,288
Of course send him right in. Don't ever
keep him waiting again, you understand?

967
01:27:19,521 --> 01:27:21,455
Hey, John.

968
01:27:21,688 --> 01:27:24,822
Great to see you.
Sorry about the cunt at reception.

969
01:27:25,089 --> 01:27:28,789
- This is my fiancée, Maxine.
- Great to see you, Maxine.

970
01:27:29,056 --> 01:27:33,756
Sorry about the cunt at reception.
Please, have a seat.

971
01:27:37,090 --> 01:27:40,257
Can I get you anything? Coffee? Water?

972
01:27:40,523 --> 01:27:42,224
No, thank you.

973
01:27:42,490 --> 01:27:44,591
<i>- Teresa, get me chicken soup.
- Okay.</i>

974
01:27:44,857 --> 01:27:48,191
Chicken soup?

975
01:27:53,325 --> 01:27:57,158
Larry? I want to get right to the point.

976
01:27:57,392 --> 01:28:01,692
From now on, I'm no longer an actor.
I'm a puppeteer.

977
01:28:01,959 --> 01:28:04,759
Okay. Great.

978
01:28:08,593 --> 01:28:11,660
And I would like to redirect my career...

979
01:28:11,927 --> 01:28:14,627
...so that from now on
the name John Malkovich...

980
01:28:14,894 --> 01:28:18,927
...will be synonymous with puppets.

981
01:28:19,161 --> 01:28:20,894
Sure. No problemo.

982
01:28:21,128 --> 01:28:26,261
Poof, you're a puppeteer.
Just let me make a couple calls.

983
01:28:48,130 --> 01:28:52,497
Honey? Maxine?

984
01:28:52,731 --> 01:28:53,998
Maxine?

985
01:28:54,264 --> 01:28:56,864
I'm busy.

986
01:28:58,498 --> 01:29:01,832
Maxine, honey, it's on!

987
01:29:09,232 --> 01:29:11,433
<i>Yeah, there's the truth, and there are lies...</i>

988
01:29:11,666 --> 01:29:14,933
<i>... and, art always tells the truth,
even when it's lying.</i>

989
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:17,467
<i>The enigmatic John Malkovich...</i>

990
01:29:17,733 --> 01:29:21,267
<i>... one of the world's greatest entertainers
and the man who reinvented...</i>

991
01:29:21,534 --> 01:29:22,900
<i>... how we view puppeteering.</i>

992
01:29:23,134 --> 01:29:25,667
<i>Tonight we look at the man
above the strings...</i>

993
01:29:25,901 --> 01:29:28,401
<i>... and the woman behind the man.</i>

994
01:29:28,668 --> 01:29:33,101
<i>Raised in Evanston, Illinois, Malkovich
had a lifelong interest in theatre arts...</i>

995
01:29:33,368 --> 01:29:35,968
<i>... and as a young man,
was one of the founding members...</i>

996
01:29:36,202 --> 01:29:39,302
<i>... of Chicago's world-renowned
Steppenwolf Theatre Company.</i>

997
01:29:39,535 --> 01:29:42,902
<i>From there, it was a simple transition
to Broadway accolades...</i>

998
01:29:43,169 --> 01:29:44,536
<i>... and Hollywood stardom.</i>

999
01:29:44,803 --> 01:29:49,436
<i>But nothing could prepare the public
for what was to come next.</i>

1000
01:29:49,670 --> 01:29:52,037
<i>And so it was,
that just eight short months ago...</i>

1001
01:29:52,303 --> 01:29:55,370
<i>... John Malkovich dropped the bombshell
that sent shock waves...</i>

1002
01:29:55,637 --> 01:29:57,504
<i>... through the entertainment community.</i>

1003
01:29:57,771 --> 01:30:01,838
<i>Turning his back on his former profession,
Malkovich had to start from scratch...</i>

1004
01:30:02,104 --> 01:30:06,038
<i>... and pay his dues all over again
as a fledgling puppeteer.</i>

1005
01:30:06,271 --> 01:30:10,605
<i>Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm John Malkovich.</i>

1006
01:30:12,739 --> 01:30:14,372
<i>I'm really John Malkovich.</i>

1007
01:30:14,606 --> 01:30:16,506
<i>From these inauspicious beginnings...</i>

1008
01:30:16,739 --> 01:30:20,906
<i>... John Malkovich's rise to stardom
was fast and furious.</i>

1009
01:30:21,173 --> 01:30:24,073
<i>His breakout performance was
at this year's Emmy Awards...</i>

1010
01:30:24,340 --> 01:30:27,307
It's really good! I look really amazing.

1011
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:28,740
I'd fuck me.

1012
01:30:29,007 --> 01:30:31,174
<i>If there's anything that upsets me
about it...</i>

1013
01:30:31,407 --> 01:30:33,908
<i>... it's feeling like if I move
into it too quickly...</i>

1014
01:30:34,174 --> 01:30:36,474
<i>... l'll be, you know, deemed an imitator.</i>

1015
01:30:36,708 --> 01:30:39,541
<i>But, I think that
once we all get the courage...</i>

1016
01:30:39,808 --> 01:30:42,775
<i>... to follow through on our instincts,
like Malkovich has...</i>

1017
01:30:43,008 --> 01:30:45,542
<i>... I think that a lot of us
will move into puppetry.</i>

1018
01:30:45,809 --> 01:30:49,609
<i>Malkovich's rise to fame brought about
a renaissance in puppeteering.</i>

1019
01:30:49,842 --> 01:30:52,476
<i>No, no, no. What are you doing?</i>

1020
01:30:52,743 --> 01:30:54,010
<i>I'm making him weep, John.</i>

1021
01:30:54,276 --> 01:30:57,076
<i>You're making him weep,
but you're not weeping.</i>

1022
01:30:57,310 --> 01:30:58,910
<i>Don't ever... with your audience.</i>

1023
01:30:59,143 --> 01:31:02,110
<i>Until the puppet becomes...</i>

1024
01:31:02,377 --> 01:31:04,944
<i>... an extension of you, it's a novelty act.</i>

1025
01:31:05,211 --> 01:31:07,878
<i>It's Topo Gigio.</i>

1026
01:31:08,111 --> 01:31:10,511
<i>No?</i>

1027
01:31:12,278 --> 01:31:14,278
<i>He's a technical genius.</i>

1028
01:31:14,545 --> 01:31:17,512
<i>He breathes life into inanimate objects.</i>

1029
01:31:17,745 --> 01:31:19,712
<i>It's a very godlike thing...</i>

1030
01:31:19,979 --> 01:31:23,979
<i>... to be able to take something and,
you know, make it live.</i>

1031
01:31:24,213 --> 01:31:26,379
<i>He was the talk of the town...</i>

1032
01:31:26,646 --> 01:31:29,180
<i>... from the Beltway to Broadway...</i>

1033
01:31:29,446 --> 01:31:33,847
<i>... aided in no small part by his new wife
and manager, Maxine Lund.</i>

1034
01:31:34,114 --> 01:31:36,780
<i>In Maxine,
Malkovich had found his mentor...</i>

1035
01:31:37,014 --> 01:31:39,847
<i>... his muse, his inspiration.</i>

1036
01:31:40,114 --> 01:31:45,481
<i>In Malkovich,
Maxine had found the love of her life.</i>

1037
01:31:45,848 --> 01:31:48,648
There, there, my dear. Relax.

1038
01:31:48,915 --> 01:31:52,082
This travesty will all be over with
by morning.

1039
01:31:52,315 --> 01:31:54,816
<i>And the crowds have been
absolutely sensational...</i>

1040
01:31:55,082 --> 01:31:58,416
<i>... and I'djust like to thank God
for giving us this opportunity...</i>

1041
01:31:58,683 --> 01:32:00,416
<i>... to share our creative vision.</i>

1042
01:32:00,683 --> 01:32:04,217
<i>Nothing was impossible for John
and Maxine in the early days.</i>

1043
01:32:04,450 --> 01:32:07,884
<i>Their union was a joyous one,
and together they worked tirelessly...</i>

1044
01:32:08,150 --> 01:32:10,350
<i>... to further Malkovich's
puppeteering career.</i>

1045
01:32:10,584 --> 01:32:12,717
<i>John Malkovich, the artist...</i>

1046
01:32:12,984 --> 01:32:15,151
<i>... and Maxine, the entrepreneur...</i>

1047
01:32:15,384 --> 01:32:17,351
<i>... they make this character...</i>

1048
01:32:17,618 --> 01:32:20,985
<i>... this protean figure
that we call John Malkovich.</i>

1049
01:32:21,218 --> 01:32:25,219
<i>But some say Maxine has changed
since becoming pregnant...</i>

1050
01:32:25,485 --> 01:32:27,352
<i>... recoiling from the limelight...</i>

1051
01:32:27,619 --> 01:32:32,353
<i>... and, rumor has it,
from her husband's affections.</i>

1052
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:42,487
I'm so sorry.

1053
01:32:47,154 --> 01:32:49,954
<i>Malkovich shows us...</i>

1054
01:32:50,221 --> 01:32:53,521
<i>... a reflection of ourselves, our frailties...</i>

1055
01:32:53,755 --> 01:32:59,355
<i>... and our, you know, desperate humanity.</i>

1056
01:32:59,589 --> 01:33:04,189
<i>That's what makes him one
of the most relevant artists of our time.</i>

1057
01:33:04,423 --> 01:33:07,956
<i>And what does the future hold
for John Horatio Malkovich?</i>

1058
01:33:08,190 --> 01:33:12,490
<i>Well, to quote the Bard,
"He's got the world on a string."</i>

1059
01:33:12,723 --> 01:33:17,857
<i>As the poet said, "The puppeteer's voice
need not merely be the record of man."</i>

1060
01:33:18,124 --> 01:33:20,257
<i>"It can be one of the pillars, the props...</i>

1061
01:33:20,491 --> 01:33:24,958
<i>...to help him endure and prevail",
and I believe that.</i>

1062
01:33:25,191 --> 01:33:27,858
It's over!

1063
01:33:29,058 --> 01:33:30,792
Max?

1064
01:33:31,059 --> 01:33:33,625
I've gotta head down to ABT now.

1065
01:33:33,892 --> 01:33:36,592
I've got the "Swan Lake" benefit tonight.

1066
01:33:36,826 --> 01:33:39,693
But when I come back,
we can maybe celebrate...

1067
01:33:39,926 --> 01:33:43,293
...Malkovich's big four-four.

1068
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:45,260
Okay?

1069
01:33:45,527 --> 01:33:49,194
Jesus! Why couldn't I have found
the portal to a younger body?

1070
01:33:49,427 --> 01:33:53,661
What if I fall tonight and break my hip?

1071
01:34:43,766 --> 01:34:47,033
Like that, little girl?

1072
01:34:47,333 --> 01:34:50,000
Huh, lamb?

1073
01:34:51,033 --> 01:34:53,800
I love you.

1074
01:35:26,937 --> 01:35:29,704
Bravo!

1075
01:35:35,904 --> 01:35:38,438
Maxine?

1076
01:35:57,140 --> 01:35:58,940
Hello? Hello?

1077
01:35:59,173 --> 01:36:01,274
<i>- We have Maxine.
- Oh, my God.</i>

1078
01:36:01,507 --> 01:36:03,674
Please, please, don't hurt her.

1079
01:36:03,941 --> 01:36:07,007
Listen, I'll give you
anything you want. Please.

1080
01:36:07,274 --> 01:36:10,141
<i>You listen to me, asshole.
I don't want your fucking money.</i>

1081
01:36:10,408 --> 01:36:14,442
<i>What I want is for you
to leave John Malkovich now!</i>

1082
01:36:14,708 --> 01:36:17,108
<i>- Who is this, Lester?
- Does it matter?</i>

1083
01:36:17,375 --> 01:36:20,776
<i>We're gonna kill Maxine
if you don't leave the body immediately!</i>

1084
01:36:21,042 --> 01:36:23,076
But I can't do that.

1085
01:36:23,342 --> 01:36:27,009
I mean, if I leave Malkovich,
then I'm Craig Schwartz again.

1086
01:36:27,243 --> 01:36:30,043
No career, no money.
Maxine will have nothing to do...

1087
01:36:30,276 --> 01:36:32,377
She barely has anything
to do with me now.

1088
01:36:32,643 --> 01:36:37,511
<i>Jesus, we're going to kill your wife,
you fucking lunatic!</i>

1089
01:36:37,711 --> 01:36:38,411
God.

1090
01:36:38,677 --> 01:36:41,611
<i>Listen, Schwartz, Malkovich is our vessel.
We're old.</i>

1091
01:36:41,844 --> 01:36:46,511
<i>We're going to die if we don't
get into him by midnight...</i>

1092
01:37:00,746 --> 01:37:03,813
He called our bluff.

1093
01:37:04,780 --> 01:37:06,580
Shit!

1094
01:37:06,813 --> 01:37:09,914
Can't we just go inside the portal
and push Craig out?

1095
01:37:10,147 --> 01:37:11,881
No, he's much too powerful.

1096
01:37:12,114 --> 01:37:17,215
Schwartz would just jam us down
into Malkovich's subconscious.

1097
01:37:40,283 --> 01:37:42,784
Lotte.

1098
01:37:45,251 --> 01:37:49,418
If I can't have you, no one will.

1099
01:37:50,685 --> 01:37:53,718
Lotte, no!

1100
01:37:53,718 --> 01:37:56,318
No, Lotte!
God, no, we can't really kill her!

1101
01:37:56,585 --> 01:38:01,886
She's carrying Malkovich's seed!
My next vessel!

1102
01:38:08,286 --> 01:38:11,587
Hey! Help me!

1103
01:38:14,054 --> 01:38:18,354
- Where the fuck am I?
- We're in Malkovich's subconscious.

1104
01:38:18,587 --> 01:38:22,554
The last thing you'll ever see, Maxine.

1105
01:38:23,554 --> 01:38:25,155
Fag-o-vitch!

1106
01:38:25,388 --> 01:38:28,488
Johnny, baby, Johnny.

1107
01:38:31,889 --> 01:38:35,522
Bad. I am bad. I am bad.

1108
01:38:57,725 --> 01:39:01,792
Maxine, I am gonna kill you!

1109
01:39:04,359 --> 01:39:07,092
<i>You're creepy.</i>

1110
01:39:16,893 --> 01:39:20,360
<i>Little Johnny Malk-o-pee!</i>

1111
01:39:47,463 --> 01:39:51,030
I loved you so much!

1112
01:39:51,197 --> 01:39:54,597
Why did you have to hurt me like that?

1113
01:39:54,864 --> 01:39:56,530
I'm sorry, Lotte.

1114
01:39:56,764 --> 01:40:00,998
I guess I loved you, too, in my way.

1115
01:40:01,231 --> 01:40:05,498
You are so full of shit, Maxine!

1116
01:40:05,731 --> 01:40:07,898
I know.

1117
01:40:08,165 --> 01:40:10,699
I know!

1118
01:40:14,232 --> 01:40:16,866
It's your baby, okay?

1119
01:40:17,132 --> 01:40:18,866
What?

1120
01:40:19,133 --> 01:40:22,933
The baby, it's yours.

1121
01:40:23,166 --> 01:40:26,400
It's ours. I got pregnant
when you were in Malkovich.

1122
01:40:26,633 --> 01:40:31,401
- You can't fuck with me any more, Maxine!
- I'm not!

1123
01:40:31,634 --> 01:40:35,934
I kept it because I knew
you were the father...

1124
01:40:37,535 --> 01:40:39,135
...the other mother, whatever...

1125
01:40:39,401 --> 01:40:43,135
...because it was yours.

1126
01:40:45,202 --> 01:40:48,169
So, we're parents?

1127
01:40:49,069 --> 01:40:51,703
Together?

1128
01:40:52,669 --> 01:40:55,103
Yeah.

1129
01:41:15,705 --> 01:41:17,939
- Aren't you John Malkovich?
- No.

1130
01:41:18,172 --> 01:41:20,439
- Yeah, you are.
- No.

1131
01:41:20,672 --> 01:41:22,839
I can't believe you're in this shithole, man.

1132
01:41:23,106 --> 01:41:26,306
- This is John Malkovich.
- I'm not John Malkovich.

1133
01:41:26,573 --> 01:41:32,040
- This is John Malkovich.
- I am not John Malkovich!

1134
01:41:47,308 --> 01:41:47,975
Yes?

1135
01:41:48,208 --> 01:41:51,142
<i>Lester, please don't do it.
Please don't kill Maxine.</i>

1136
01:41:51,375 --> 01:41:54,376
<i>- So you'll leave?
- Yes, I am leaving.</i>

1137
01:41:54,642 --> 01:41:58,509
All right. Do it now
while I'm on the phone so I can hear...

1138
01:41:58,776 --> 01:42:01,043
...and your lovely bride walks.

1139
01:42:01,310 --> 01:42:03,943
Okay. Okay.

1140
01:42:04,177 --> 01:42:06,843
I'm going.

1141
01:42:15,778 --> 01:42:19,911
Now, my friends. The time is now.

1142
01:42:50,981 --> 01:42:53,548
I'm free.

1143
01:42:56,215 --> 01:42:59,815
I'm back!

1144
01:43:14,750 --> 01:43:17,551
Lotte.

1145
01:43:53,121 --> 01:43:56,521
Hello. Hello, young lady.

1146
01:43:58,955 --> 01:44:02,788
We're Malkovich.

1147
01:44:04,389 --> 01:44:06,555
Maxine! I did it, Maxine!

1148
01:44:06,789 --> 01:44:08,589
I left Malkovich for you, sweetie!

1149
01:44:08,822 --> 01:44:10,889
It's no good being Malkovich without you.

1150
01:44:11,123 --> 01:44:12,923
- It proves I love you!
- Fuck off!

1151
01:44:13,189 --> 01:44:16,723
- Doesn't it?
- He's not with us.

1152
01:44:25,424 --> 01:44:28,258
Maxine, I love you!

1153
01:44:28,524 --> 01:44:31,391
I'm gonna go right back into Malkovich,
and kick Lester out!

1154
01:44:31,658 --> 01:44:35,792
And then you'll love me again! Maxine!

1155
01:44:50,260 --> 01:44:54,594
- Machine.
- Hey. Malcatraz.

1156
01:44:54,827 --> 01:44:56,760
- How are you?
- I'm very well. And you?

1157
01:44:56,994 --> 01:44:58,461
- Good, good.
- You look well.

1158
01:44:58,727 --> 01:45:00,394
Thank you. How's Celeste?

1159
01:45:00,628 --> 01:45:03,194
She's good.
She's sorry she couldn't make it today.

1160
01:45:03,428 --> 01:45:05,461
- She had to go to the store.
- That's okay.

1161
01:45:05,728 --> 01:45:08,262
Charlie, hi! I didn't even hear the door.

1162
01:45:08,528 --> 01:45:13,529
- Lookin' great, Flo.
- I'm looking grateful?

1163
01:45:14,596 --> 01:45:17,563
Charlie, we are not getting any younger.

1164
01:45:17,829 --> 01:45:19,996
Well, don't rub it in.

1165
01:45:20,229 --> 01:45:22,963
Listen, Charlie,
I know this is going to sound crazy...

1166
01:45:23,196 --> 01:45:26,297
...but what would you think
if I told you that I'd found a way...

1167
01:45:26,530 --> 01:45:28,730
...for us to live forever?

1168
01:45:28,997 --> 01:45:30,864
All of us.

1169
01:45:31,131 --> 01:45:33,597
- Johnny boy, what are you talking about?
- All of us.

1170
01:45:33,831 --> 01:45:38,265
Celeste, Floris, you, me.
Gary Sinise, maybe.

1171
01:45:39,498 --> 01:45:42,832
I don't really understand.

1172
01:45:48,732 --> 01:45:53,900
Charlie, this is Emily.

1173
01:46:02,734 --> 01:46:05,701
Isn't she lovely?

1174
01:46:05,934 --> 01:46:06,934
Pass the Cheetos.

1175
01:46:07,201 --> 01:46:09,434
- You need more puffs?
- No, I want more.

1176
01:46:09,701 --> 01:46:12,635
- Okey-doke. They're covered in grease.
- Shut up.

1177
01:46:12,868 --> 01:46:15,702
- Can I swim yet?
- Can you swim yet?

1178
01:46:15,968 --> 01:46:19,035
- What time is it?
- Shall we do the cramp test?

1179
01:46:19,302 --> 01:46:21,969
Check her.

1180
01:46:22,302 --> 01:46:25,603
Let me see.
Are you gonna throw up? Let me see!

1181
01:46:25,836 --> 01:46:28,670
Are you gonna throw up?
Are you gonna vomit?

1182
01:46:28,936 --> 01:46:31,970
Okay, you can swim.

1183
01:46:35,170 --> 01:46:37,304
<i>Maxine.</i>

1184
01:46:37,571 --> 01:46:39,904
<i>Maxine.</i>

1185
01:46:40,137 --> 01:46:43,204
<i>I love you, Maxine.</i>

1186
01:46:43,971 --> 01:46:46,738
<i>Oh, look away.</i>
