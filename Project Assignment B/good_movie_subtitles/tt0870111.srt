1
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:46,578
<i>They'd better not</i>
<i>push me on him,</i>

2
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:48,079
<i>or I'll just kick</i>
<i>them in the teeth on it.</i>

3
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:50,446
<i>Well, I think, if they...</i>

4
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,654
<i>Internal Revenue</i>
<i>people that are kicking</i>

5
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,316
<i>Billy Graham around</i>
<i>is Rosenberg.</i>

6
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,188
<i>He is to be out.</i>

7
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,353
<i>I don't give a goddamn</i>
<i>what the story is.</i>

8
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:03,987
<i>He went on television.</i>

9
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:07,795
<i>I have not.</i>
<i>I've already ordered Connally,</i>

10
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:09,562
<i>we're going</i>
<i>after the Chandlers,</i>

11
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:11,695
<i>every one individually,</i>
<i>collectively,</i>

12
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,762
<i>their income taxes</i>
<i>are starting this week.</i>

13
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,536
<i>Every one of those</i>
<i>sons of bitches.</i>

14
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,710
<i>Well, this is</i>
<i>something that we can</i>
<i>really hang Teddy or...</i>

15
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:22,770
<i>Yeah.</i>

16
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,146
<i>Or the</i>
<i>Kennedy clan with.</i>

17
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:26,481
<i>I'm gonna want to put that</i>
<i>in Colson's hands.</i>

18
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:28,714
<i>And we're gonna</i>
<i>want to run with it.</i>

19
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:32,922
<i>A controversial</i>
<i>day in politics.</i>

20
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:35,358
<i>A man arrested trying</i>
<i>to bug the offices</i>

21
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,090
<i>of the Democratic</i>
<i>National Committee</i>
<i>in Washington</i>

22
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:39,461
<i>turns out to be an employee</i>

23
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:42,626
<i>of President Richard Nixon's</i>
<i>re-election</i>
<i>campaign committee.</i>

24
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:46,103
<i>He is one of five</i>
<i>persons surprised</i>
<i>and arrested yesterday</i>

25
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:48,606
<i>inside the headquarters</i>
<i>of the Democratic</i>
<i>National Committee</i>

26

<i>in Washington.</i>

27
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,433
<i>And guess what else he is.</i>

28
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,479
<i>A consultant of</i>
<i>President Richard Nixon's</i>

29
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:55,480
<i>re-election</i>
<i>campaign committee.</i>

30
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:57,539
<i>The trial started today</i>
<i>at the federal courthouse</i>

31
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,244
<i>for the five burglars</i>
<i>caught breaking into</i>

32
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:02,117
<i>the Democratic National</i>
<i>Party headquarters.</i>

33
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:03,280
Stand by for camera.

34
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:05,881
<i>John Dean,</i>
<i>the ex-White House Counsel,</i>
<i>testified today</i>

35
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,985
<i>that President Nixon</i>
<i>knew about</i>
<i>the Watergate cover-up.</i>

36
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:11,319
<i>At one point in</i>
<i>the conversation,</i>

37
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:12,830
<i>I recall the President</i>
<i>telling me</i>

38
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:16,335
<i>to keep a good list</i>
<i>of the press people</i>
<i>giving us trouble</i>

39
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:19,701
<i>because we will make</i>
<i>life difficult for them</i>
<i>after the election.</i>

40
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:22,536
<i>Dean read through</i>
<i>a 245-page statement</i>

41
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:25,169
<i>characterizing a president</i>
<i>who was easily outraged</i>

42
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:28,009
<i>over war protesters</i>
<i>and political adversaries,</i>

43
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:29,912
<i>and outlining</i>
<i>a range of offenses,</i>

44
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,746
<i>including wiretapping</i>
<i>of newsmen,</i>

45
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,945
<i>a Charles Colson</i>
<i>plan to firebomb</i>

46
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,079
<i>and burglarize</i>
<i>the Brookings Institution,</i>

47
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,125
<i>and spying on</i>
<i>Senator Kennedy</i>
<i>and other Democrats.</i>

48
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:42,628
<i>The misuse</i>
<i>of power is the very</i>
<i>essence of tyranny.</i>

49
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:44,754
<i>And consider, if you will,</i>

50
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,790
<i>the frightening</i>
<i>implications of that</i>
<i>for a free society.</i>

51
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:53,003
<i>The President</i>
<i>today accepted the resignation</i>
<i>of three of his closest aides.</i>

52
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:55,666
<i>Out is H.R. Haldeman,</i>
<i>Chief of Staff.</i>

53
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:58,233
<i>Also quitting under fire</i>
<i>is John Ehrlichman.</i>

54
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:00,575
<i>Ehrlichman was</i>
<i>a key political advisor.</i>

55
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:01,875
<i>Good morning.</i>
<i>The Supreme Court</i>

56
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,575
<i>has just ruled on</i>
<i>the tapes controversy,</i>

57
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,982
<i>and here is Carl Stern,</i>
<i>who has that ruling.</i>

58
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:08,384
<i>It is a unanimous</i>
<i>decision, Doug, eight to zero.</i>

59
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:10,752
<i>Justice Rehnquist</i>
<i>took no part in the decision</i>

60
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:14,691
<i>ordering the President</i>
<i>of the United States</i>
<i>to turn over the tapes.</i>

61
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,124
<i>It's an eight-to-zero</i>
<i>unanimous opinion.</i>

62
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,928
<i>A White House aide</i>
<i>told NBC News today</i>

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,695
<i>that impeachment</i>
<i>of the President</i>

64
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:26,569
<i>by the full</i>
<i>House of Representatives</i>
<i>now is a virtual certainty.</i>

65
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:30,375
<i>These are,</i>
<i>with no serious doubt,</i>

66
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:33,879
<i>the last hours</i>
<i>of the 37th presidency</i>
<i>of the United States.</i>

67
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,346
<i>This is indeed</i>
<i>an historic day,</i>

68
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,049
<i>the only time</i>
<i>a president has ever</i>
<i>resigned from office</i>

69
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:46,785
<i>in our nearly 200</i>
<i>years of history.</i>

70
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:49,760
<i>You see the White House</i>
<i>there, and in the White House,</i>

71
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,160
<i>in just a few moments now,</i>

72
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,325
<i>President Nixon</i>
<i>will be appearing</i>
<i>before the people,</i>

73
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,302
<i>perhaps for the last</i>
<i>time as President</i>
<i>of the United States.</i>

74
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,867
<i>15 seconds, Mr. President.</i>

75
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:11,444
Okay, that's five,
four, three...

76
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:18,416
Good evening.
This is the 37th time

77
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:21,221
I have spoken to you
from this office

78
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,854
where so many decisions
have been made

79
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,455
that have shaped
the history of our nation.

80
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:28,523
I remember exactly
where I was.

81
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:33,303
My father called.
The phone rang, my father
called and he said,

82
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:36,638
"Turn on the TV right now.
Richard Nixon's going down."

83
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:40,440
I was at home with friends,
and we were watching
television at home.

84
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:43,311
We stayed up and,
like everyone else,
I'd been glued to

85
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,874
the Select and Judiciary
Committee hearings
night after night.

86
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,079
And then finally,
it had come to this.

87
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:53,956
Therefore, I shall resign
the presidency effective
at noon tomorrow.

88
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:57,019
But instead of
the satisfaction
I imagined I'd feel,

89
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:59,360
I just got angrier
and angrier,

90
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:02,196
because there was
no admission of guilt.

91
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:03,701
There was no apology.

92
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,169
Little did I know

93
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,365
that I would one day
be part of the team

94
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,840
that would try and
elicit that apology.

95
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,935
<i>To leave office
before my term is completed</i>

96
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:16,004
is abhorrent to every
instinct in my body.

97
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:18,573
I have never been a quitter.

98
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,312
And that that team
would be led

99
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:24,083
by the most unlikely
of white knights,

100
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,091
a man with no
political convictions
whatsoever,

101
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:30,391
a man who, as far as I know,
had never even voted
once in his life.

102
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:35,327
But he was a man who had
one big advantage
over the rest of us.

103
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:38,900
He understood television.

104
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:50,508
<i>And now, the host of</i>
Frost Over Australia,

105
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,211
<i>Mr. David Frost!</i>

106
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:57,081
Thank you, thank you.

107
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:00,483
Hello. Good evening.

108
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,688
And with the eyes of the world
focused on the White House,

109
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:06,391
here in Australia,
burglars have broken into

110
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,798
a meat factory in Brisbane

111
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,701
and stolen a ton
of pork sausages.

112
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:17,603
The Queensland police are
looking for men
in a long, thin getaway car.

113
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,341
Now, my first guest tonight...

114
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:23,575
Well, we in the Nixon camp

115
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,116
really didn't know that much
about David Frost,

116
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:28,176
other than he was
a British talk show host

117
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,017
with something of
a playboy reputation.

118
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:33,820
He'd had a talk show
here in the US that
had won some awards

119
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:38,990
but hadn't syndicated well
and had been dropped
by the network.

120
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,555
He ended up taking
it down to Australia,

121
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:44,364
which is, I believe,
where he was when
the President resigned.

122
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:47,128
<i>Next week's guest
will be Evonne Goolagong.</i>

123
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:49,106
We'll see you then.
God bless.

124
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,606
Great show, David.
Thanks, Noah.

125
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:54,873
<i>Come and look at this.</i>

126
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:56,073
Nixon leaving
the White House.

127
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,879
<i>A dark day for Richard Nixon,</i>
<i>who has drawn crowds</i>

128
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:00,316
<i>to the vast Ellipse south</i>
<i>of the White House before.</i>

129
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:01,910
What, this is live?
Yeah.

130
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,650
<i>But those were triumphs.</i>
<i>This is not.</i>

131
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:07,215
What time is it
in Washington?

132
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,726
9:00 a.m.

133
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:09,921
Why didn't he wait?

134
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:11,463
It's 6:00 in the morning
on the West Coast.

135
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,624
Half his audience
is still asleep.

136
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:18,001
All right,
you blokes, let's get
the set broken down.

137
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:22,131
<i>Are witnesses to the saddest day</i>
<i>in the life of Richard Nixon,</i>

138
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:26,144
<i>his last moments</i>
<i>as President</i>
<i>of the United States,</i>

139
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:29,841

<i>any other in the history</i>
<i>of this country.</i>

<i>Richard Nixon, who goes now</i>

<i>from the power</i>
<i>of the presidency</i>

142
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:53,333
<i>to a form of exile</i>
<i>in California.</i>

143
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:56,204
Find out the numbers
for this, will you?
Worldwide.

144
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,589
<i>I remember his face.</i>

145
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:15,424
<i>Staring out the window.</i>

146
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:20,159
<i>Down below him,</i>

<i>cheered, gloated.</i>

147
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:24,393
Hippies, draft dodgers,
dilettantes,

148
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,837
the same people
who'd spit on me when
I got back from Vietnam.

149
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:33,035
They'd gotten rid
of Richard Nixon,
their bogeyman.

150
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:48,751
So what's so important
that it couldn't wait,
that it had to be today?

151
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:53,265
I've had an idea, John,
rather a bold idea
for an interview.

152
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:54,799
Fish and chips, please.

153
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,266
And in a moment...

154
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:57,700
Well, it's too late now.
It's done.

155
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,101
I've called his people...

156
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:00,331
You?

157
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,772
Beans, peas and lamb, please.

158
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,309
And made an offer.

159
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:08,837
Now, if the subject
were to say yes,

160
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:16,245
well, he's rather
a big fish that swims
in not-untricky waters.

161
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:20,522
So it goes without saying
that I'd want a dear friend

162
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:23,426
and the finest producer
I know by my side.

163
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,762
So who is it?

164
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,967
Richard Nixon.

165
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,700
Richard Nixon?

166
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:38,175
Well, come on,
don't look like that.

167
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,905
Well, how would you
expect me to look?

168
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:43,244
I spent yesterday
evening watching you
interview the Bee Gees.

169
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,181
Weren't they terrific?

170
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:49,244
Come on, John,
we've done political
interviews before.

171
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:53,014
So, okay, so what
kind of interview?

172
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:58,325
A full, extensive
look-back over his life,
his presidency.

173
00:09:58,397 --> 00:09:59,955
And?

174
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,465
And what?
Come on, David.

175
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,001
Surely the only thing
that would interest anyone

176
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,401
about Richard Nixon
would be a confession.

177
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:07,234
A full,
no-holds-barred
confession.

178
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:09,536
Well, we'll get that, too.

179
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,598
From Richard Nixon?

180
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:12,007
Come on, John.

181
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,376
Just think of the
numbers it would get.

182
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,775
Do you know how
many people watched

183
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:18,476
his farewell speech
in the White House?

184
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,576
Four hundred million.

185
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,945
But in the end,
David heard nothing.

186
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:25,684
And soon after
arriving in California,

187
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:29,353
Nixon was rushed
to hospital with an acute
attack of phlebitis.

188
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,242
<i>I think it was</i>
<i>around this time</i>
<i>that Gerald Ford,</i>

189
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,335
who was the new President,

190
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:48,471
and who was desperate
to move the agenda
on from Watergate,

191
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:51,641
gave Nixon a full,
free and absolute pardon.

192
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:54,447
<i>Now therefore, I,</i>
<i>Gerald R. Ford,</i>

193
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,182
<i>President of</i>
<i>the United States,</i>

194
00:10:57,256 --> 00:11:01,192
<i>have granted,</i>
<i>and by these presents</i>
<i>do grant,</i>

195
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,785
<i>a full,</i>
<i>free and absolute pardon</i>

196
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:09,062
<i>unto Richard Nixon</i>
<i>for all offenses</i>
<i>against the United States.</i>

197
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:11,535
It meant that the man
who had committed
the greatest felony

198
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:14,266
in American political history
would never stand trial.

199
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,740
It was like he slipped
out the back door.

200
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:19,740
<i>A public opinion</i>
<i>poll indicates</i>

201
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:23,179
<i>a two-to-one disapproval</i>
<i>of the pardoning</i>
<i>of Richard Nixon.</i>

202
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:26,446
<i>One telegram</i>
<i>from Virginia said,</i>
<i>"Roosevelt had his New Deal,</i>

203
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,114
<i>"Truman had his Fair Deal,</i>
<i>now Ford has</i>
<i>his crooked deal. "</i>

204
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,180
<i>There was no deal, period.</i>

205
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:34,624
<i>I don't think the truth</i>
<i>will ever come out.</i>

206
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,355
<i>The American people</i>
<i>need to know the truth,</i>

207
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:39,660
<i>and I don't think</i>
<i>it will ever now</i>
<i>be fully known.</i>

208
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:05,621
<i>So how do we want to
address the college protests?</i>

209
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:06,885
Well, do we want
to lift some quotes

210
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,087
from the "stand up
and be counted" speech
in 1970?

211
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:11,789
- Sir?
- <i>You know, maybe we're just better off</i>

212
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,388
using the whole
Lincoln Memorial memo.

213
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:14,933
<i>Just include
the whole thing.</i>

214
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,468
Mr. President,
Swifty Lazar is here.

215
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,800
Okay. No, no, stick around.

216
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:22,067
You're gonna get
a kick out of this.

217
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:25,372
This is my literary agent
from Hollywood.

218
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,639
Hygiene obsessive.

219
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:33,109
Mr. President,
good to see you.

220
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:34,812
Nice to see you.

221
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:37,481
These are folks
helping me with my book.

222
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:40,457
Diane Sawyer,
Frank Gannon,
Irving Lazar.

223
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,084
Nice to meet you.
Miss Sawyer.

224
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,890
Pleasure.
Mr. Gannon.

225
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,825
Okay, that's it.
I'll see you after lunch.

226
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,893
<i>So how you feeling, sir?</i>

227
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:56,866
I'm better, thank you.
Though not yet
well enough to golf,

228
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,577
thank God.
I despise that game.

229
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,105
Imagine, six weeks
out of office

230
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:06,708
as President
of the United States,

231
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,653
and they'd have me putting
in my hospital room.

232
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,713
Never retire, Mr. Lazar.

233
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:17,095
To me, the unhappiest
people of the world
are retired.

234
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:18,960
No purpose.

235
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:21,795
What makes life mean
something is purpose.

236
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:24,768
A goal. A battle. A struggle.

237
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:27,067
Well, even if
you don't win it.

238
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:30,064
When my doctor
declared me unfit

239
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,973
to give testimony
in the Watergate trial,

240
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:34,274
everybody thought
I'd be relieved.

241
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:35,938
Well, they were wrong.

242
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,539
That was the lowest I got.

243
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:42,053
Well, if it's a challenge
you want, here's one
you might enjoy.

244
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:46,057
How to spend $2 million,
2.3 to be precise.

245
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,922
It's what I got
for your memoirs.

246
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,460
Well, thank you.

247
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:50,790
Eh...

248
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:52,626
It might be a little short
of what I wanted,

249
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:56,259
but let me assure you,
it's a whole lot more
than they wanted.

250
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,360
That book is important to me.

251
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:02,134
It's probably the only
chance I'm gonna get
to put the record straight

252
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:05,575
and remind people
the Nixon years
weren't all bad.

253
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:10,948
You know, if you're trying
to put the record straight,

254
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,483
I'd at least talk to him.

255
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:13,677
<i>Who?</i>

256
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:17,452
David Frost.
English talk show guy.

257
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,091
Why would I want to
talk to David Frost?

258
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,958
Well, a while back,
he wrote asking
for an interview.

259
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,360
No.

260
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:26,762
Well, we didn't
get back to him.

261
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:29,164
Frankly, we didn't
find him appropriate.

262
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,999
Well, I thought
that we were
doing one with CBS.

263
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:34,039
We are. I just figured
doing it with Frost

264
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:36,233
would be a whole lot
easier than doing it
with Mike Wallace.

265
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:40,642
It would, but it would
have a lot less,
you know, credibility.

266
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,240
True, true. Could
probably get more money.

267
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,815
Really?
Look.

268
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,289
We'll always have
350 on the table
from CBS.

269
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:56,089
But if I could get
Frost to pay more
and secure better terms,

270
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:58,688
it might be a shame to pass.

271
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:02,462
It'd be interesting to know
where he is right now.

272
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,496
We tied him to
railway tracks,
and he escaped.

273
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:08,836
We buried him alive,
and he walked free.

274
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:13,311
Today we're lowering
escape artist Derek Harrison
into the water

275
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:17,713
to see if he can
miraculously
cheat death once more.

276
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:20,217
Good evening,
and welcome to
<i>Great Escapes.</i>

277
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,220
My name is David Frost.

278
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,848
<i>Okay, that is a cut.</i>

279
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,017
Thank you.

280
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:30,391
In any deal, you need to
know your opponent's
breaking point.

281
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:33,492
To assess that,
you might call them

282
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:35,795
late at night
or at the weekend.

283
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,268
If they take the call,
you know they're desperate.

284
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:42,774
And from that moment on,
you know you have
the upper hand.

285
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:55,012
Hello?

286
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,782
<i>Mr. Frost? Irving Lazar.</i>

287
00:15:58,157 --> 00:15:59,647
Who?

288
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:02,888
Swifty Lazar.
I represent
President Nixon.

289
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,224
What time is it?

290
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,285
<i>Bad time?</i>

291
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:08,162
No! Not at all.

292
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:15,070
I'm calling with regard to
your request for an interview

293
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,132
and to say,
having considered it,

294
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:22,203
my client is not necessarily
opposed to the idea.

295
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:26,012
Really?
Well, that's terrific news!

296
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:27,814
For God's sake.

297
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,945
<i>I got $500,000.</i>

298
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,421
Is that good?

299
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:36,120
Mr. President, it's a half a
million dollars for a news interview.

300
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:37,457
It's unprecedented.

301
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,724
Yeah? Well, what's the catch?

302
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:42,961
<i>With Frost? None.</i>
<i>It'll be a big wet kiss.</i>

303
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:46,163
This guy'll be so grateful
to be getting it at all,

304
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:47,933
he'll pitch
puffballs all night

305
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,840
and pay a half a million
dollars for the privilege.

306
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,579
Well, you think
you could get 550?

307
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:59,214
I got 6.

308
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,784
- David, how could you have done that?
- What?

309
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,789
$600,000. That's a fortune.

310
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,846
200 on signature?

311
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:07,391
Don't worry about the money.

312
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,825
My God.
Most Americans think
he belongs in jail.

313
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:11,590
You're making him
a rich man.

314
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:13,597
Plus, by outbidding them,
you've already made enemies

315
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:15,155
of the networks.
They're just jealous.

316
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:17,759
They're already sounding off
about checkbook journalism.

317
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:19,269
And if the networks
are against you,

318
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:20,737
syndication's always
going to be a struggle.

319
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,364
No syndication,
no advance sales.

320
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:23,965
No advance sales,
no commercials.

321
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,476
No commercials, no revenue.

322
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:29,207
And here's the bigger
question, why do it?
You don't need it.

323
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:30,407
Your career's
in great shape.

324
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:32,643
This will just spread you
across three continents,

325
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,310
jeopardize the other shows.

326
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,785
Isn't it true that
Channel Nine in Australia

327
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:37,549
want you to do
another season
of your talk show for them?

328
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:38,681
Yes.
And London, too?

329
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,884
Yes, but that would be
London and Australia.

330
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,722
This would be...
What?

331
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:44,818
You wouldn't
understand, John.

332
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,730
You were never
part of the show
in New York,

333
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,164
but it's indescribable.

334
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:55,298
Success in America
is unlike success
anywhere else.

335
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,767
And the emptiness
when it's gone.

336
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:05,617
And the sickening
thought that it may
never come back.

337
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,918
You know, there's
a restaurant in New York
called Sardi's.

338
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,750
Ordinary mortals
can't get a table.

339
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,518
John, the place
was my canteen!

340
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,683
You know, I'd be happier

341
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,987
if I heard
some kind of vision

342
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,220
that you had
for this interview.

343
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:17,455
<i>Excuse me, Mr. Frost.

344
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:18,655
I'd heard you were
going to be here.

345
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,664
Would you mind?
Of course.

346
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:22,222
But I don't.
I just hear
a man doing it

347
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:23,563
because it would
create headlines

348
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,728
or give him a place
at the top table.

349
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:27,169
And that is what
makes me nervous.

350
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:29,969
And you do nervous
so beautifully, John.

351
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:33,341
"Hello, good evening
and welcome."

352
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:38,482
I don't actually say that.

353
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,108
Hello, Mr. Frost.

354
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:47,920
Champagne?

355
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:49,688
<i>No, thank you.</i>

356
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,755
<i>Another glass, sir?</i>

357
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,443
You don't like champagne?

358
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,477
Not on airplanes.

359
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:17,852
Yes, it dehydrates
one terribly.

360
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,352
The trick is to have
a glass of water
on the go, too.

361
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:23,951
Like the Viennese
serve coffee.

362
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:26,293
Well, I've never
been to Vienna.

363
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,833
Oh. Well, you'd like it.

364
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,927
It's like Paris
without the French.

365
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,498
What's your name?

366
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,769
Caroline.

367
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:38,867
David.

368
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:41,640
Yes, I know. David Frost.

369
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:45,446
"Hello and good evening
and welcome."

370
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,886
You know, I heard
an interview with you
recently on the radio.

371
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:56,291
You were giving it
from the back
of your Rolls-Royce.

372
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,487
Bentley.

373
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:58,621
On the phone.

374
00:19:58,697 --> 00:19:59,959
They said that
you were a person

375
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,058
who defined
the age we live in.

376
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,727
Really?
Mmm.

377
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,862
You and Vidal Sassoon.

378
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:11,543
But what made you
exceptional, they said,

379
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:15,546
was that you were a person
who had achieved great fame

380
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:18,981
without possessing
any discernible quality.

381
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,279
How kind.
Mmm-hmm.

382
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:23,651
And that you fly
around a great deal.

383
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,020
Well, that's true.

384
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:27,914
Why?

385
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,483
I like to keep busy.

386
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:31,527
Why?

387
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:34,157
I find it
more interesting
than keeping still.

388
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,168
You know,
you have very sad eyes.

389
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,666
Do I?
Mmm.

390
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,729
Has anyone told
you that before?

391
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:43,536
No.

392
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,270
Are you a sad person?

393
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:51,707
Let's talk about
you a little bit.

394
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:54,274
Of course, you feel more
comfortable asking questions.

395
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,287
How right you are!

396
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,351
<i>This is your</i>
<i>captain speaking.</i>

397
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,412
<i>You may have</i>
<i>noticed we've begun</i>

398
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:01,618
<i>our final descent</i>
<i>into Los Angeles.</i>

399
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:05,587
<i>If you could please</i>
<i>return to your seats</i>
<i>and fasten your seat belts,</i>

400
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:07,723
<i>we'll be landing</i>
<i>very shortly. Thank you.</i>

401
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,097
<i>So how about you?
Where are you going?</i>

402
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:12,534
To meet Richard Nixon.

403
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:13,832
Really?

404
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:18,305
You know, they say he has
the most enormous head,

405
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,335
but the sexiest voice.

406
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:21,777
Where is he now?

407
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:25,574
In some dark underground cave
licking his wounds?

408
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,215
Actually, no.
In his rather smart beachside villa

409
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,346
in California.

410
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:33,152
Really? Richard Nixon
in a beachside villa?

411
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:34,817
How incongruous.

412
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:36,861
You can come if you'd like.

413
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:39,023
To meet Nixon?

414
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:41,460
Why not?

415
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:44,131
Are you sure?

416
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:48,867
You know, I would love that.

417
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,101
<i>Cabin crew,</i>
<i>please prepare for arrival.</i>

418
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:54,043
Well, I'll get
my office to call you
first thing in the morning

419
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:56,672
and send a car with a phone.

420
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:57,737
Oh.

421
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:03,245
He did, too. Money no object.

422
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:07,315
Everything glittered
and was golden.

423
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:08,859
Well, on the outside.

424
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:11,760
<i>Of course, what I didn't know</i>
<i>was that in the meantime,</i>

425
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,991
<i>he'd gone to all</i>
<i>the major networks</i>

426
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:16,534
<i>to try and get</i>
<i>interest in the interviews.</i>

427
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:19,936
I'm sorry, David,
but we have a policy

428
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,439
of not paying
for a news interview.

429
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:25,670
Look, we love your work
as an entertainer.

430
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:26,870
That <i>Guinness</i> show?

431
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:28,435
Love it. You're a funny guy.

432
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,708
But an interview like this?

433
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:33,683
You're asking us to pay
a British talk show host

434
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,982
to interview
an American president

435
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:39,717
with absolutely no editorial
controls whatsoever in return?

436
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,759
Well, you can't say
it's not a fresh approach.

437
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:43,556
I know you're very busy.

438
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,629
I'm not gonna
keep you from it.

439
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:47,856
Thank you for coming in.

440
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:50,026
I'm gonna have to
get back to you.

441
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:52,969
Okay, thank you so
much for your time.

442
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,096
David, good luck.

443
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:56,538
He never let on
to anyone at the time,

444
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:57,802
not even me.
You know,
that would have meant...

445
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,699
Thanks.

446
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:03,339
...<i>admitting failure,</i>
<i>and David doesn't do failure.</i>

447
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,380
<i>There you are.</i>

448
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,939
See, you don't have
to do a thing yourself.

449
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,362
Well.

450
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:01,165
You found it okay.

451
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:02,365
Yes, thank you.

452
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,601
Pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Frost.

453
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:04,767
And you, sir.

454
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:06,367
May I present
Caroline Cushing?

455
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,503
Miss Cushing.

456
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,672
Hello.
Your house is
very beautiful.

457
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:10,908
Really. Very romantic.

458
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:12,074
Well, thank you.

459
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,981
And my producer, John Birt.

460
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:15,576
Nice to meet you.
How do you do?

461
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:19,090
This is Mr. Lazar,
and this is Jack Brennan.

462
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:21,489
Now, Miss Cushing,
would you like
to take a tour,

463
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,858
you know,
maybe stretch your legs
after your long journey?

464
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:26,591
Yes, please.
I'd love that. Thank you.

465
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,691
Come on in.
This is my office.

466
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:33,898
Now, this is where Brezhnev
and I had our summit.

467
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:38,341
Yeah. Brezhnev was there,
and Gromyko there,
Dobrynin there.

468
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:42,502
We talked for
nine hours straight.

469
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:47,207
After the meeting,
as a souvenir of the visit,

470
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:51,551
I remember that we had
a Lincoln specially made.

471
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:54,820
Dark blue,
cherry wood, leather.

472
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:57,555
Well, we got inside
for the photographers,

473
00:24:57,629 --> 00:25:01,895
when the next thing you know,
he steps on the gas.

474
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:06,700
Now, the first rule
of political life is

475
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:11,208
you never let a president
get behind the wheel
of a car, ever.

476
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:13,267
I mean, we're not
used to doing anything

477
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,313
for ourselves,
let alone drive.

478
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,577
And the Chairman, Jesus,
the way he put his foot down,

479
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,414
my guess is
the last thing he drove was

480
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:24,512
a tractor on some
Ukrainian potato farm.

481
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:27,982
He crashed into curbs.

482
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:29,549
He went over speed bumps.

483
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:32,529
He went twice
around my whole estate.

484
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:37,398
Finally, we ended up
at some remote point
on the coast,

485
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:40,404
out there
overlooking the sea.

486
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:44,670
He turns off the gas,
and he talks for two hours

487
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:48,201
about his favorite subject,
steel mills.

488
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,044
He said, "Mr. President,
most politicians

489
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:53,812
"have tragedy
in their early lives."

490
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:58,917
Well, I told him that
I lost two brothers
to tuberculosis.

491
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:03,984
And he watched his father
die from the cancer
he caught in the steelworks.

492
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:09,265
He was a sad man
and a noble adversary.

493
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:12,301
I wouldn't want to
be a Russian leader.

494
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:15,170
They never know when
they're being taped.

495
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:22,610
Okay, I guess that's
it then, huh?

496
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:24,478
Until March.
I look forward to it.

497
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:26,414
Well, thank you,
Mr. President. So do I.

498
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:28,111
You know,
it's a funny thing that

499
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:31,883
I've never been
challenged to a duel before.

500
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:33,219
I guess that's what this is.

501
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:35,225
<i>Yeah, well, not really.</i>

502
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:37,886
Of course it is.

503
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:41,692
And I like that.

504
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:46,937
No holds barred, eh?
No holds barred.

505
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:54,973
Mr. Frost, there's still
the small matter of the...

506
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:57,743
Of course.

507
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:01,652
I do beg your pardon.

508
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:17,230
Right. $200,000.

509
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:20,469
I do hope that isn't coming
out of your own pocket.

510
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:23,632
Well, believe me,
sir, I wish my pockets
were that deep.

511
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,338
Made out in the name of?

512
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:27,537
Irving Paul Lazar.

513
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:29,443
Richard M. Nixon.

514
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:39,582
Here you go.

515
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:42,757
<i>Okay, smile.</i>

516
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:47,394
There. Now you can put that
in your apartment in New York,

517
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:51,026
and all your liberal friends
can use it as a dartboard.

518
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:54,799
Well, actually,
I'm living in Monte Carlo
at the moment.

519
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:56,272
Really?

520
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,172
Yes. Goodbye, Mr. President.

521
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:02,646
Hey. Take my advice.

522
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:04,272
You should marry that woman.

523
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:07,580
Yes. Lovely, isn't she?

524
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:10,621
More important than that,
she comes from Monaco.

525
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,714
They pay no taxes there.

526
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,959
Bye-bye.
Goodbye.

527
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:26,097
I bet you it did.

528
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:27,195
What?

529
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:28,671
Come out of his own pocket.

530
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,867
You know, he couldn't
look me in the eye.

531
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:32,569
Well, I hear
the networks
aren't biting.

532
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:34,737
Without the networks,
the ad agencies
don't want to know.

533
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:36,041
So if you ask me,
there's a good chance

534
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:37,274
this whole thing
may never happen.

535
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:42,547
Really? So that meeting we just
had might have cost him $200,000?

536
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,712
Correct.

537
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:48,047
Had I known that,
I would have offered
him a cup of tea.

538
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:50,926
Say, did you
notice his shoes?

539
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:52,019
No.

540
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:55,589
Italian. No laces.
What do you think?

541
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,801
My people tried to get me
to wear a pair like that.

542
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,430
I think a man's shoes
should have laces, sir.

543
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:02,663
You do?

544
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:06,302
Yeah. Personally,
I find those Italian
shoes very effeminate.

545
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:09,438
Yes, quite right.

546
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:14,444
<i>I'm sorry,</i>
<i>David, but it's a no.</i>

547
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:16,248
<i>Try to look at it</i>
<i>from our point of view.</i>

548
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:19,256
<i>Why would an American network</i>
<i>hire a total outsider,</i>

549
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:22,589
and someone who's already
had his own show canceled,
incidentally?

550
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,184
I see. Well, I'm sorry
you feel this way.

551
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:27,129
Obviously,
I think you're making
a terrible mistake.

552
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:31,099
NBC.

553
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:36,598
Well, that's
the networks out,
all of them.

554
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,269
Well, that's the
end of that, then.

555
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,247
I'm sorry, David.

556
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,716
Not so fast.

557
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,647
Where's your
adventurer's spirit?

558
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:55,693
The idea is
we pay for the program

559
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,788
and syndicate it
ourselves, completely
bypassing the networks.

560
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:03,459
Just imagine it,
we'd be our own
network for the night.

561
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:05,435
- Hey, Bob.
- How does that grab you?

562
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:07,368
Hey, come on in.
David's on the phone.

563
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:09,269
<i>No, never been
done before.</i>

564
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,932
Historic stuff.

565
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:17,406
Just think about it, okay?
And call me back.

566
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:19,539
Yeah?
Yeah.

567
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:22,643
David, I'd like you
to meet Jim Reston
and Bob Zelnick,

568
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,914
our two prospective
corner men.

569
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,080
Delighted to meet you.

570
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,953
Come on in.
Make yourselves at home.

571
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:28,356
Bob's been
Washington correspondent

572
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:29,723
for Public Radio
for the past 10 years.

573
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:31,989
Moving to ABC
in the new year.

574
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:33,394
The general feeling, David,

575
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:37,264
is that I have been
wasting my matinee idol
looks on radio.

576
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:39,893
Jim here teaches
at the University
of North Carolina

577
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:43,805
and is writing a book
about the criminal
dishonesty, corruption,

578
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,943
paranoia and abuses of
power of Richard Nixon.

579
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,478
Second on the subject.

580
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:49,604
Fourth.

581
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,740
Well, delighted to
have you both aboard.

582
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:54,250
Actually, before I sign on,
I would like to hear

583
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,186
what you were
hoping to achieve
with this interview.

584
00:30:57,789 --> 00:30:59,780
What I want to achieve?

585
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,120
Yeah.

586
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:05,290
Jim, well,
I've secured 12 taping days.

587
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,297
That's close to 30 hours

588
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,560
with the most compelling
and controversial politician

589
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:11,397
of our times.

590
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:12,936
Isn't that enough?

591
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:16,170
Well, not for me.

592
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:20,841
Look, I'd be giving up
a year of my life.
I'm leaving my family

593
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:23,574
to work on
a subject matter
that means more

594
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,343
than you can
probably imagine,

595
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:26,508
and the idea
of doing all that

596
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:30,020
without achieving what
I want to, personally,

597
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:31,851
would be unthinkable to me.

598
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:33,151
<i>No, all right.</i>

599
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,588
Well, what is it that
you want to achieve?

600
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:45,202
I'd like to
give Richard Nixon
the trial he never had.

601
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:48,535
Of course,
we'll be asking
difficult questions.

602
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:50,267
Difficult questions.

603
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:53,404
The man lost 21,000 Americans

604
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:55,912
and a million Indo-Chinese
during his administration.

605
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,778
He only escaped jail
because of Ford's pardon.

606
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:02,149
Yes, but equally,
going after him
in some knee-jerk way,

607
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,747
you know, assuming
he's a terrible guy,

608
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:09,520
wouldn't that only create
more sympathy for him
than anything else?

609
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,061
You know...

610
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,061
Right now,
I submit it's impossible

611
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:18,625
to feel anything
close to sympathy
for Richard Nixon.

612
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:20,830
He devalued the presidency,

613
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:24,500
and he left the country
that elected him in trauma.

614
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:29,340
The American people
need a conviction,
pure and simple.

615
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:32,110
The integrity of
our political system,

616
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:38,019
of democracy as an idea,
entirely depends on it.

617
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:40,387
And if in years to come,
people look back

618
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,857
and say it was
in this interview

619
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:43,518
that Richard Nixon
exonerated himself,

620
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:45,789
that would be
the worst crime of all.

621
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:58,566
Did you know that
Mike Wallace is doing
a piece on this?

622
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:03,207
And that in the bars around
Capitol Hill and Georgetown

623
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:05,044
this entire project is a joke?

624
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:07,778
<i>Come on.
Jim, come on.</i>

625
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:10,184
Thanks for that, Jim.

626
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:13,554
Could you give us
a couple of minutes?

627
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:22,288
You're unbelievable.
I'm sorry, Bob.

628
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:24,597
You know, Jim,
I went way out
on a limb for you.

629
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,261
I mean, some of us
actually want this job.

630
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,827
I want it, too,
if it's done right.

631
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:29,702
Well, how do you know
they're not
gonna do it right?

632
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:31,002
Little Lord Fauntleroy
in there?

633
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:32,269
Sympathy for Richard Nixon?

634
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,970
What the...
He's full of shit, man!

635
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:35,569
How do you know that?

636
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:40,751
Is Mike Wallace
doing a piece on this?

637
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,044
Apparently.

638
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:44,748
Why didn't you tell me?

639
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:46,889
It isn't relevant.

640
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:51,723
What's the angle?
"British talk show host,

641
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:56,228
"good with actresses,
not so good with
stonewalling presidents."

642
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,331
That's the general idea, yeah.

643
00:33:58,403 --> 00:33:59,597
Right.

644
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:03,568
It's hard not to feel
a little insulted by that.

645
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:07,744
Well, Bob's obviously a pro.

646
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:09,006
What are we gonna
do about Reston?

647
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,638
Well, the man's an idiot.
He's overemotional.

648
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:11,977
Send him home.

649
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,352
Well, I think
he should stay.
Why?

650
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,719
I liked his passion.

651
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,781
He will drive us
all bloody mad.

652
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:24,055
Well, maybe, but sometimes
being out of your comfort zone

653
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:26,790
is a good thing, I'm told.

654
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:29,094
He stays.

655
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:43,806
<i>I took my seat</i>
<i>next to Mrs. Mao</i>
<i>at the banquet table.</i>

656
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:49,148
<i>Now, one of the challenges</i>
<i>of life as a president</i>

657
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:56,783
<i>is the endless round</i>
<i>of cocktail parties,</i>
<i>social engagements, banquets.</i>

658
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:59,519
<i>And people who</i>
<i>know me would tell you</i>

659
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:03,829
<i>that small talk is not one of</i>
<i>my strong suits, either. No.</i>

660
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:07,596
<i>Particularly not in Mandarin.</i>

661
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:15,602
<i>So Mrs. Mao and I,</i>
<i>we just, well, you know,</i>
<i>stared at one another.</i>

662
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:21,047
<i>And then across the table,</i>
<i>Mrs. Nixon and</i>
<i>Chairman Mao himself, well,</i>

663
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:24,252
<i>they stared</i>
<i>at one another, too.</i>

664
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:27,189
<i>And then further down,</i>
<i>Dr. Kissinger</i>

665
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:30,091
<i>and their</i>
<i>foreign minister, well,</i>

666
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:33,621
<i>you're getting</i>
<i>the picture now.</i>

667
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,270
I can't stand it, Jack!

668
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:46,737
Reducing the presidency
to a series
of banal anecdotes.

669
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:49,744
I feel like
a circus animal
doing tricks.

670
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:51,710
And I thought
I made it clear!

671
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:56,310
I didn't want to take
any questions
on Watergate, damn it!

672
00:35:57,755 --> 00:36:00,121
Soon as it came
to question time,

673
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:04,821
all those sons of bitches
ever want to hear about
is Watergate!

674
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:09,389
It's as if all
my other achievements
have ceased to exist.

675
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:10,729
Well, sir, you're
gonna get a chance

676
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:12,098
to talk about them
sooner than you think.

677
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,831
Yeah? How?

678
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:16,305
Frost got there.
He got the money.

679
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:19,007
What?

680
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:20,543
I understand
most of it's borrowed,

681
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:22,374
that his friends
have bailed him out.

682
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:24,641
But the point is,
we start taping
at the end of March.

683
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:27,445
Really? Now, that's terrific.

684
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,281
How much time is
devoted to Watergate?

685
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:32,220
25%. Just one of
four 90-minute shows.

686
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,281
What are the other
three divided into?

687
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,383
Domestic Affairs,
Foreign Policy,

688
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,518
and Nixon the Man.

689
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:38,584
"Nixon the Man"?

690
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:40,824
As opposed to what?
Nixon the horse?

691
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:44,061
Well, I imagine
it's some kind of
biographical piece.

692
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:49,997
I can see it now.
The father that neglected me,
the brothers that died.

693
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:52,133
Spare me.

694
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:57,273
Still, now, the fact
it's come together, now,
that's a good thing, no?

695
00:36:57,348 --> 00:37:00,579
Mr. President, it's fantastic.

696
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:02,949
Frost is just not in
your intellectual class, sir.

697
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,478
You're gonna be
able to dictate terms,
rebuild your reputation.

698
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:11,494
If this went well,
if enough people saw it,
revised their opinion,

699
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,827
you could move back East
way, way earlier
than we expected.

700
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,764
You think?
I'm certain.

701
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:24,367
It would be so good
to go back to where
the action is.

702
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:25,739
You know?

703
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:29,337
The hunger in my belly
is still there, Jack.

704
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:35,310
I guess it all boils down
to Watergate, huh?

705
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:38,048
Well, that's nothing
to worry about, sir.

706
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:40,852
It's not as if
there's gonna be
any revelations.

707
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,655
That stuff's been combed over
a million times.

708
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:46,026
No one has pinned
anything on you.

709
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,565
Yeah, still,
it's been a while

710
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,157
since I spoke about it
on the record.

711
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:51,997
I'm gonna start
doing my homework.

712
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:54,833
Hey, you know what would
be an interesting
thing to find out?

713
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:55,997
What his strategy is.

714
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:57,131
Now, where's he staying?

715
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:58,732
I believe The Beverly Hilton.

716
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:00,333
The Beverly Hilton, you say.

717
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:02,845
Well, I got
the numbers someplace

718
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:05,313
of some fellows
that we could send in.

719
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:07,977
Cubans with CIA training.

720
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,394
Jesus, Jack, it was a joke.

721
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:21,296
Yes, sir.

722
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,161
<i>A week later, we said goodbye</i>
<i>to our families,</i>

723
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:30,332
<i>we hopped on a plane,</i>
<i>and we moved into</i>
<i>The Beverly Hilton.</i>

724
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:32,399
<i>And that's where we</i>
<i>started to dig into</i>
<i>our research</i>

725
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,001
<i>and prepare</i>
<i>for the interviews.</i>

726
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,174
Yeah, as it happens, we took

727
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:39,409
the whole question
of security very seriously.

728
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:45,187
<i>And from day one, we kept all</i>
<i>our files in a locked safe.</i>

729
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:52,191
Who was the guy
that Mike interviewed?
Was that Haldeman?

730
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:53,855
-  Haldeman.
- Haldeman. And Ehrlichman, too.

731
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:56,422
I always get
the Germans mixed up.

732
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,094
I'm a little
confused by that.

733
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,934
What is Haldeman's
official...
Hello, darling.

734
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:05,701
As for the work over
the months, we divided it
into three sections.

735
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:09,337
Birt took Vietnam,
Bob took Foreign
and Domestic Policy,

736
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:12,576
and I got Watergate
and the abuses of power.

737
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:15,550
<i>And David,</i>
<i>we never really</i>
<i>saw much of David.</i>

738
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:17,109
<i>All right, so what
about the Huston Plan?</i>

739
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,019
You can see the seeds
of dirty tricks.

740
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:22,491
Essentially,
it's an attempt to
legalize dirty tricks.

741
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,687
That's why you gotta
get David to put it
in the question.

742
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:25,854
Wiretapping students.

743
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,363
<i>NIXON ON TAPE: But they've</i>
<i>traced the money to him.</i>

744
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:28,955
<i>Opening people's mail.</i>

745
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,057
What about wiretapping?

746
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:31,123
How many people
has he wiretapped?

747
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,466
This guy wiretapped
17 people.

748
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:34,595
<i>Seventeen?</i>

749
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:35,696
Including his own brother.

750
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:37,673
But you know what?
We can't ask him
about his brother,

751
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:40,540
'cause frankly,
if Donald Nixon
was my brother,

752
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:42,704
I'd wiretap him, too.

753
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:47,076
<i>But wait, okay, so we
have breaking and entering.</i>

754
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:50,809
We have wiretapping,
conspiracy to
foster prostitution.

755
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,150
And that's Liddy, right?

756
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,487

finest deli selection.

758
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,885
We're going to need napkins.
We'd better have some napkins.

759
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:00,828
How do we frame a question
about Cambodia,

760
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:01,922
about the illicit
bombing of Cambodia?

761
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:02,988
I think you should say,

762
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,694
"How far do you take
executive privilege

763
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:06,430
"before it becomes
an undemocratic event?"

764
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:08,768
I think you frame
the question to him
as a Quaker.

765
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:12,536
"How do you feel as
a Quaker about annihilating
an entire people?"

766
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:18,640
<i>Come on. Are they really
interested in buying time?</i>

767
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:20,308
Are they going to
give us the money?

768
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:21,908
How serious are they?

769
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:25,478
You have to set up that
he has an anti-democratic
personality.

770
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:27,217
There's a reason they
call him Tricky Dick.

771
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:30,818
Because I had written about
and watched Nixon for years,

772
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:33,022
I got to play him
in our rehearsals.

773
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,156
<i>You know,</i>
<i>the fellas would</i>
<i>throw me a question,</i>

774
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:38,133
<i>and I would try and anticipate</i>
<i>what his response might be.</i>

775
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:40,227
<i>Okay,
the White House taping system.</i>

776
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:43,637
Ours is not
the first administration
to use taping systems.

777
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:45,538
Lyndon Johnson's
White House used them.
So did Kennedy's.

778
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,237
Huston Plan.
Wiretapping and alleged
abuses of power.

779
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:52,180
Let me tell you,
other administrations
were up to far worse.

780
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:55,579
And just for fun,
your close
friend Jack Kennedy.

781
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:58,847
That man, he screwed
anything that moved,

782
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:01,617
fixed elections
and took us into Vietnam.

783
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:03,990
And the American people,
they loved him for it!

784
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:06,996
Whereas I,
Richard Milhous Nixon,

785
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:10,966
worked around the clock
in their service,
and they hated me!

786
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:15,394
Look. Look. Now I'm sweating.

787
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,907
Damn it! Damn it!

788
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:21,069
And Kennedy's
so goddamn handsome
and blue-eyed!

789
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,635
And women all over him!

790
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:25,011
He screwed anything
that moved, and everything.

791
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:26,344
Had a go at Checkers once.

792
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,817
The poor little bitch
was never the same!

793
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:34,590
Gentlemen, finally a friend
in the American press.

794
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:37,320
Jack Anderson
in <i>The Washington Post,</i>

795
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:39,760
"When Richard Nixon faces
the television cameras

796
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,594
"for his first interview
since he abandoned
the White House,

797
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:46,067
"he'll be cross-examined
as if he were on
the witness stand.

798
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:49,367
"Frost has hired
three crack investigators

799
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,101
"to help him
with the research.

800
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:54,406
"Clearly
the famous TV interviewer
will pull no punches."

801
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:55,911
"Crack investigators"?

802
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,038
Can I be Crack One?

803
00:41:57,114 --> 00:41:58,581
Can I be Deep Crack?

804
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:02,616
David, can I talk
to you for a sec?

805
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,085
After researching
my last book,

806
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:05,485
I was pretty
certain Colson...

807
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:07,888
You know, Charles Colson?
His darkest henchman?

808
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:09,255
Colson, right.
Colson had a
meeting with Nixon

809
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:11,553
Sometime before June 23,

810
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:13,062
but I never knew
the exact date,

811
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:14,825
so I couldn't
find the transcript.

812
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:17,094
But if you gave me
a week back in the
Federal Courthouse library...

813
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:20,830
A week? Goodness, Jim,
we can't lose you
for that long.

814
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:22,304
I think this is
really good stuff, Dave.

815
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,341
Would there be something
I could help you with?

816
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:26,876
You know, if we're
gonna nail Nixon
in these interviews,

817
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:28,343
we're gonna
have to ambush him.

818
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:29,777
We're gonna have to
take him by surprise.

819
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:32,042
Don't worry, Jim.
We'll get him anyway.

820
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:34,676
Hang on a second.
David, Jack Brennan.

821
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:36,242
He sounds a little emotional.

822
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,787
I'll take it in here.

823
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:39,755
He'll be right
with you. Yeah.

824
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:44,585
Jack.
<i>Watergate.</i>

825
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:45,754
Yes, Jack.

826
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:49,424
Our lawyers want us to agree
on a definition of the word.

827
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,365
Well, I believe
it's a large hotel

828
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:53,562
and office complex
in Washington, Jack.

829
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:54,695
<i>You know what</i>
<i>I'm talking about.</i>

830
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:56,239
<i>For the interviews.</i>

831
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:58,373
We want to propose
that Watergate

832
00:42:58,442 --> 00:43:00,967
be an umbrella term
for everything negative.

833
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,245
Hold on a minute.

834
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:10,948
So all the other
domestic charges

835
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:12,386
against him,
the Brookings Institute,

836
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:14,583
the Plumbers Union,
the Enemies List,

837
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:17,149
you're saying all that
goes into Watergate?

838
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:19,487
Correct.

839
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:22,088
That is absurd
and a clear breach

840
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:24,157
of the terms
of our agreement.

841
00:43:24,234 --> 00:43:27,294
Okay. How would
you define Watergate?

842
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:28,599
Well, that it covers
just that.

843
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:30,435
The Watergate
break-in of June 17th

844
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:32,805
and the subsequent
cover-up and investigation.

845
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:34,571
Fine. In which case,
the deal is off.

846
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:38,172
Fine. In which case,
you can expect a lawsuit

847
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,409
for something
in excess of $20 million

848
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:42,543
in damages and
loss of earnings.

849
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,487
The terms of the contract
clearly stipulate

850
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:49,185
that Watergate take up
no more than 25% of the time.

851
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:52,160
Yes, but nowhere does it say
that for the rest of the 75%

852
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:54,720
he gets to drone on
and sound presidential.

853
00:43:56,367 --> 00:44:00,565
"Drone on"? Jesus Christ.
Where's your respect?

854
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,436
You remember
who you're
talking about here.

855
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:07,238
You know as well as I do
that 60% of what he did
in office was right,

856
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:11,179
and 30% may have been wrong,
but he thought it was right
at the time.

857
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:13,182
Yes, but that
still leaves 10%

858
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,650
where he was doing
the wrong thing and knew it.

859
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,481
You goddamn media people.
You are so smug.

860
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:24,752
Well, I can guarantee you
if you screw us on the 60%,

861
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:28,355
I will ruin you if it takes
the rest of my life.

862
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:31,690
Prick.

863
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:52,917
Look at you. Gorgeous.

864
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:56,587
Good night, sweet princes.

865
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,287
Cheerio.
Bye.

866
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,592
See you in the morning.

867
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:05,226
Why the monkey suit?

868
00:45:05,302 --> 00:45:07,270
David has a film premiere
he needs to attend.

869
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:09,862
What? The night
before we start taping?

870
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,567
What's the movie?

871
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:15,543
It's <i>The Slipper and the Rose.</i>

872
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,108
The Cinderella movie?

873
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:20,377
Yeah. David's
the executive producer.

874
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:23,046
You don't think it might be
an idea for our interviewer

875
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,384
to be rested and focused
on the job in hand?

876
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:27,083
<i>Don't worry.</i>

877
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:29,591
David is a performer
of the highest caliber.

878
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:32,128
He's been in these
pressure situations
many times before.

879
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:35,393
Come the hour,
he'll be fine. Okay?

880
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:42,704
What did he say?
Did he say "performer"?

881
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:44,604
Yeah.
That's the word he used?

882
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:45,869
Yeah, he said "performer."

883
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:47,103
Not "journalist"
or "interviewer"?

884
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:50,271
No. He said "performer."

885
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:54,443
Out of curiosity,
where are you at this
moment? Psychically?

886
00:45:56,553 --> 00:46:01,286
I am imagining the dust,
the darkness,

887
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:04,885
the agony and the
unimaginable Ioneliness

888
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:08,090
of the wilderness
I am about to
be dispatched to

889
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:10,895
by my Washington
political colleagues.

890
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:24,880
So any opportunity you get,
go right to foreign policy,
go right to Mao,

891
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,176
go right to Khrushchev.

892
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:27,410
Just go right!

893
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:29,281
<i>You could do all day
on foreign policy, sir.</i>

894
00:46:29,353 --> 00:46:30,911
<i>I disagree that the Mao
banquet story is stale.</i>

895
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:32,512
Excuse me, sir.
Something I think
you should see.

896
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:33,647
<i>People love that story.</i>

897
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:34,748
<i>Why don't we
save it for the book?</i>

898
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:36,850
<i>Yeah, right, come on.</i>

899
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:40,588
<i>- David.</i>
<i>- Mr. Frost.</i>

900
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:42,723
<i>David, some people in the media</i>
<i>have suggested</i>

901
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,563
<i>that you're not</i>
<i>the right man for the job,</i>

902
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,364
<i>that you'll be</i>
<i>too soft on the President.</i>

903
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:48,301
<i>What will you do</i>
<i>if he stonewalls you?</i>

904
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:50,067
<i>Well, I shall</i>
<i>say so again and again.</i>

905
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,631
<i>But I should say right now</i>
<i>that I'm not expecting</i>

906
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:55,576
<i>his approach</i>
<i>to be to stonewall.</i>

907
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:59,309
<i>I'm hoping that</i>
<i>it'll be that of</i>
<i>a cascade of candor.</i>

908
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:01,044
<i>"A cascade of candor"?</i>

909
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:02,745
<i>From Richard Nixon?</i>

910
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,845
<i>You think that's</i>
<i>what you'll get?</i>

911
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:08,187
<i>No, I just</i>
<i>thought it was a phrase</i>
<i>that might appeal to you.</i>

912
00:47:08,258 --> 00:47:09,816
<i>So what</i>
<i>about the money?</i>

913
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:11,588
That's a strange fellow.

914
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,653
Started life as a comic,
you know.

915
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:14,856
- Is that so?
- Mmm-hmm.

916
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:16,797
Almost married
Diahann Carroll.

917
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:17,856
Who?

918
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:19,664
<i>The singer.</i>

919
00:47:21,138 --> 00:47:22,730
Isn't she black?

920
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,505
Yes, sir.

921
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:29,103
Right here
in the Frost file,
which we put together

922
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,807
as part of
our general preparations.

923
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:35,476
Okay. Let's get back to work.

924
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:37,850
<i>That's fact,</i>
<i>this is fiction.</i>

925
00:47:37,921 --> 00:47:39,650
<i>So now it's about</i>
The Slipper and the Rose.

926
00:47:39,723 --> 00:47:41,088
<i>It's a cracker of a movie.</i>

927
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:43,023
<i>I hope you'll all</i>
<i>come and see it, and...</i>

928
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,263
I shouldn't have
ordered that coffee.

929
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:54,031
Just don't drink any more.

930
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:01,572
Good luck.
Thank you.

931
00:48:03,847 --> 00:48:05,838
I'll be thinking of you.

932
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,245
Dick. Wait.

933
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:30,568
<i>For the record, I'm gonna
be starting with John's idea.</i>

934
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:32,404
"Why didn't you
burn the tapes?"

935
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:33,704
No.
Fuck.

936
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:36,507
Please, God, no! You can't.

937
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,242
David, you can't do that.
It would be a disaster.

938
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:42,410
It would get us
into Watergate way ahead
of the agreed time.

939
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:45,148
What is the point of
having contractually set

940
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:47,383
specific times to deal
with certain subjects

941
00:48:47,457 --> 00:48:49,118
if you're just
going to ignore it
right off the bat?

942
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:50,420
'Cause it's war, isn't it?
Gloves off.

943
00:48:50,494 --> 00:48:51,688
I like it. It's ballsy.

944
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:52,990
Strategically,
it'll give us the upper hand.

945
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:55,122
It's insanely risky.

946
00:48:55,198 --> 00:48:56,631
He could walk
right off the set,

947
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,065
and there's nothing
we could do about it.

948
00:48:58,135 --> 00:48:59,932
Worse, he could sue you!

949
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:02,665
We were sadly
unable to do the taping
at Casa Pacifica

950
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:05,037
because of the Coast Guard
radio interference,

951
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:08,134
so we ended up
at the rather more
modest Smith house,

952
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:10,702
<i>which was owned</i>
<i>by a local Republican</i>
<i>businessman.</i>

953
00:49:11,882 --> 00:49:13,406
<i>Right here!</i>

954
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:14,711
Mr. Frost, look over here.

955
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,013
Over here, sir!

956
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:17,280
- Here we go.
- Back up behind the curb.

957
00:49:17,354 --> 00:49:18,480
<i>A few questions, please.

958
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:19,647
<i>Right here, Mr. Frost.

959
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:22,021
<i>David!
David! David!

960
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:28,864
<i>Well, hello there.</i>

961
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:34,402
Excuse me, fellas.

962
00:49:50,187 --> 00:49:52,747
<i>Nixon, there's
blood on your hands!</i>

963
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:54,283
<i>Liar!</i>

964
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:05,759
<i>Here comes the President!</i>

965
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,167
Mr. President!

966
00:50:07,237 --> 00:50:08,966
Mr. President!

967
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:12,100
How are you
feeling, Mr. President?

968
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:16,679
The Smith family requested
that the furniture
be put back in place.

969
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:18,374
They talked to you
about that, too?

970
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:20,211
They're bugging everybody.

971
00:50:25,222 --> 00:50:27,019
<i>You know, I've written
four books about him,</i>

972
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:29,752
but this is the first
time I've actually seen
him in the flesh.

973
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:32,920
He's taller than I imagined,
and tanned.

974
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,294
The least he could
do is look ravaged.

975
00:50:37,834 --> 00:50:38,994
You gonna shake his hand?

976
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:40,263
Am I gonna shake...

977
00:50:40,337 --> 00:50:41,634
Are you kidding me?

978
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,366
After everything
that prick's done
to this country?

979
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,737
I'm not gonna shake his hand.

980
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:46,332
Gentlemen.

981
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:50,703
May I present Bob Zelnick,
my executive editor?

982
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:52,112
How do you do?

983
00:50:52,182 --> 00:50:53,479
Pleasure, Mr. President.

984
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,383
<i>And Jim Reston,
one of my researchers.</i>

985
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:58,683
Pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Reston.

986
00:51:02,025 --> 00:51:03,515
Mr. President.

987
00:51:03,593 --> 00:51:06,255
Excuse me, sir?
Got a room for
you right here.

988
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:13,965
Wow. That was
devastating, withering.

989
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:15,504
I mean, I don't think he's
ever gonna get over that.

990
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:16,800
Yeah, fuck off.

991
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:21,173
I got you guys
set up back here.

992
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:25,180
Now this is your green room.

993
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:27,739
And the President will be
on the large monitor.

994
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:29,513
Craft services is that way.

995
00:51:38,328 --> 00:51:39,761
Keep it about
that temperature, okay?

996
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:40,819
Mr. President?

997
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:41,921
Yeah.

998
00:51:41,998 --> 00:51:43,363
Before we start,
I just want to say

999
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:46,527
how delighted we all are
by Mrs. Nixon's recovery.

1000
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,503
Well, thank you.
It's true.

1001
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:50,563
She's much better now.

1002
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:55,168
She's just getting
round to the business
of replying to all the cards.

1003
00:51:55,979 --> 00:51:58,470
And from our
point of view, well,

1004
00:51:58,548 --> 00:52:01,210
I'd just like to say
how pleased we are

1005
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:02,717
that you got
this all together.

1006
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:03,844
Thank you.

1007
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,048
As I understand it,
it's been quite a struggle.

1008
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,182
Well...

1009
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:10,453
How much has it cost?

1010
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:13,860
You mind me asking?
Hey, come on.

1011
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:16,524
Come on,
it's just between us.

1012
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,501
Very well. Two million.

1013
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:23,164
Two million? Jeez. I didn't realize
we were making <i>Ben-Hur.</i>

1014
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:28,505
But tell me something.

1015
00:52:28,578 --> 00:52:30,876
You raised it all now?

1016
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:36,014
Not quite.
But we're getting there.

1017
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:38,577
Everyone's been kind
and deferred fees.

1018
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:41,685
Well, not quite everyone.

1019
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,517
David, I'm gonna go in
with you on camera.

1020
00:52:44,594 --> 00:52:46,289
Excuse me.

1021
00:52:46,363 --> 00:52:48,524
I want to put
a handkerchief here,
if I may.

1022
00:52:48,598 --> 00:52:50,429
Is that out of shot?

1023
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,263
That's fine, Mr. President.

1024
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,599
Contractually,
I think that we made

1025
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:57,970
an agreement that
after each question

1026
00:52:58,041 --> 00:53:00,601
I might dab my upper lip
before answering it.

1027
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:03,646
Which you won't show,
you know,
when you cut it together.

1028
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:07,205
You're probably aware
of my history
with perspiration.

1029
00:53:07,284 --> 00:53:10,549
If you're
referring to your TV debate
with Jack Kennedy in 1960.

1030
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:15,387
They say that
moisture on my upper lip
cost me the presidency.

1031
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:19,588
People who heard
it on the radio,
well, they thought I'd won.

1032
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:22,154
But television
and the close-up,

1033
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:24,700
they create their
own sets of meanings.

1034
00:53:24,768 --> 00:53:27,965
So now they insist
I bring a handkerchief

1035
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,165
and that I have
my eyebrows trimmed.

1036
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,969
Sixty seconds, everyone.

1037
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:35,135
You trim yours?
No.

1038
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:36,975
No, of course not.

1039
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,515
Yeah, you're light-skinned.
Yeah.

1040
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:43,417
You got blue eyes. You've got no
troubles with perspiration, I imagine.

1041
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:45,454
No, not that I'm aware.

1042
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:47,956
You were obviously
born to be on the tube.

1043
00:53:49,625 --> 00:53:52,059
<i>Stand by
to roll tape in 30 seconds.</i>

1044
00:53:52,628 --> 00:53:54,220
Settling.

1045
00:53:59,635 --> 00:54:01,535
Those shoes.

1046
00:54:03,105 --> 00:54:05,005
They're Italian, aren't they?

1047
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:06,936
My shoes? I believe so.

1048
00:54:07,643 --> 00:54:09,668
Yeah, that's interesting.

1049
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:16,113
You don't find
them too effeminate?

1050
00:54:18,821 --> 00:54:20,288
No.

1051
00:54:20,356 --> 00:54:22,187
Well, I guess
somebody in your field

1052
00:54:22,258 --> 00:54:24,089
can get away
with them, you know.

1053
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,752
Manolo, just check
my collar, will you?

1054
00:54:25,828 --> 00:54:27,489
<i>David,
starting with camera two,</i>

1055
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:33,960
in four, three, two.
Cue David. And...

1056
00:54:36,205 --> 00:54:40,801
Mr. President. Now,
we're going to be
covering a lot of subjects

1057
00:54:40,876 --> 00:54:44,277
in a great deal of detail
over the course
of these interviews,

1058
00:54:44,346 --> 00:54:48,248
but I'd like to
begin completely
out of context

1059
00:54:48,317 --> 00:54:49,944
by asking you
one question,

1060
00:54:50,019 --> 00:54:52,954
more than any other,
almost every American

1061
00:54:53,022 --> 00:54:56,185
and people all over
the world want me to ask.

1062
00:54:58,294 --> 00:55:00,159
Why didn't you
burn the tapes?

1063
00:55:03,365 --> 00:55:05,196
Son of a bitch!

1064
00:55:08,003 --> 00:55:13,964
Well, Mr. Frost,
I'm surprised
by your question

1065
00:55:14,243 --> 00:55:19,146
since we have an agreement,
a contractual agreement,
I believe,

1066
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:23,447
that we would cover Watergate
in our last taping session.

1067
00:55:32,761 --> 00:55:37,255
But if your viewers
really do have
a major concern,

1068
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:42,361
then perhaps I should
briefly respond to it now.

1069
00:55:42,438 --> 00:55:45,566
What probably very
few people realize

1070
00:55:45,641 --> 00:55:47,871
is that the taping system
in the White House

1071
00:55:47,943 --> 00:55:51,208
was set up
by my predecessor,
President Johnson,

1072
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,410
partly to avoid
the necessity of having
a secretary in every meeting,

1073
00:55:55,484 --> 00:55:58,009
and partly
to ensure there was

1074
00:55:58,087 --> 00:56:00,578
a record kept of
every verbal agreement,

1075
00:56:00,656 --> 00:56:03,625
no matter how
off the cuff or casual.

1076
00:56:04,293 --> 00:56:06,887
Now, initially, on coming
into the White House,

1077
00:56:06,962 --> 00:56:09,795
I insisted on
dismantling the system.

1078
00:56:09,865 --> 00:56:13,164
I hadn't liked
the idea at all,
but the former President,

1079
00:56:13,235 --> 00:56:15,499
President Johnson,
had repeatedly said

1080
00:56:15,571 --> 00:56:18,836
how crazy it would be
to remove the system,

1081
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:20,500
which he felt
was the best way...

1082
00:56:20,576 --> 00:56:22,840
<i>Well, in boxing, you know,
<i>there's always that first moment,</i>

1083
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:25,039
and you see it in
the challenger's face.

1084
00:56:25,114 --> 00:56:27,241
It's that moment
that he feels

1085
00:56:27,316 --> 00:56:29,648
the impact from
the champ's first jab.

1086
00:56:29,985 --> 00:56:33,751
It's kind of
a sickening moment,
when he realizes that

1087
00:56:33,822 --> 00:56:37,121
all those months
of pep talks and the hype,

1088
00:56:37,193 --> 00:56:40,356
the psyching yourself up,
had been delusional all along.

1089
00:56:40,429 --> 00:56:42,397
You could see it
in Frost's face.

1090
00:56:42,464 --> 00:56:44,659
If he didn't know
the caliber of the man

1091
00:56:44,733 --> 00:56:46,860
that he was up against
before the interview started,

1092
00:56:46,936 --> 00:56:49,427
he certainly knew
it halfway through
the President's first answer.

1093
00:56:49,505 --> 00:56:52,372
<i>You see,
since the best advice is</i>

1094
00:56:52,441 --> 00:56:56,036
almost always
of the confidential variety,

1095
00:56:56,111 --> 00:56:58,272
now the tapes have
been made public,

1096
00:56:58,347 --> 00:57:00,838
people are unlikely
ever to feel comfortable

1097
00:57:00,916 --> 00:57:03,476
speaking in confidence
at the White House.

1098
00:57:03,552 --> 00:57:07,386
They're less likely
to offer that advice.
So in the end,

1099
00:57:07,456 --> 00:57:09,686
it's the whole
political system and,

1100
00:57:09,758 --> 00:57:12,693
by implication, it's
the country that suffers.

1101
00:57:12,761 --> 00:57:14,786
So much for
our "ballsy" opening.

1102
00:57:17,666 --> 00:57:20,760
So when did you
actually decide...

1103
00:57:20,836 --> 00:57:23,771
At what moment did you know
you were going to resign?

1104
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:25,807
That's good. That's good.

1105
00:57:27,009 --> 00:57:31,105
I remember exactly.
It was July 23.

1106
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:34,013
After it was clear
the Southern Democrats

1107
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:35,573
that were still against
impeachment had

1108
00:57:35,651 --> 00:57:38,711
had the screws put on them
by the Speaker of the House.

1109
00:57:39,521 --> 00:57:46,154
That night I said to
Al Haig, "Well, that's it.
There goes the presidency."

1110
00:57:46,562 --> 00:57:48,154
And, of course,
you know, being Al,

1111
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:49,788
he tried to
talk me out of it.

1112
00:57:49,865 --> 00:57:52,629
<i>And Vice President Ford,</i>
<i>I mean, let's not forget</i>

1113
00:57:52,701 --> 00:57:56,296
he had the most
to gain personally
from my stepping down,

1114
00:57:56,372 --> 00:57:58,203
he was still
absolutely convinced that

1115
00:57:58,274 --> 00:58:00,071
we were gonna win
the impeachment vote,

1116
00:58:00,142 --> 00:58:01,905
<i>and comfortably.</i>
John, we have to do something.

1117
00:58:01,977 --> 00:58:02,966
We have to move this along.

1118
00:58:03,045 --> 00:58:04,740
This is desperate, John.
Do something.

1119
00:58:04,813 --> 00:58:07,213
Twenty-three minutes
on one question?

1120
00:58:07,283 --> 00:58:08,341
Okay, let's take a break.

1121
00:58:08,417 --> 00:58:09,782
Let's change the tapes.
Come on, man.

1122
00:58:09,852 --> 00:58:11,046
Stop tape.

1123
00:58:12,621 --> 00:58:13,883
<i>I'm sorry, gentlemen.</i>

1124
00:58:13,956 --> 00:58:15,617
We have to take a break.
Tape change.

1125
00:58:15,691 --> 00:58:18,489
Oh. Okay, how's that?
You getting what you need?

1126
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:19,822
It's fantastic.

1127
00:58:19,895 --> 00:58:21,487
Good. Good. Thank you.

1128
00:58:23,065 --> 00:58:24,225
Excuse me. One moment, sir.

1129
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:26,393
<i>Yeah, sure.
Take your time.</i>

1130
00:58:26,769 --> 00:58:28,737
What are you doing, David?
You've got to
stop him rambling.

1131
00:58:28,804 --> 00:58:30,999
It's all right.
These are just
introductory exchanges.

1132
00:58:31,073 --> 00:58:32,540
But this session
only lasts two hours.

1133
00:58:32,608 --> 00:58:35,304
Nearly half of it's gone,
and we're wasting
valuable material, okay?

1134
00:58:35,377 --> 00:58:37,641
The moment that he made
the decision to resign,

1135
00:58:37,713 --> 00:58:39,010
we should be scoring
points with that stuff.

1136
00:58:39,081 --> 00:58:40,241
Want me to switch to Vietnam?

1137
00:58:40,316 --> 00:58:41,806
No. No.
We've got to
get something

1138
00:58:41,884 --> 00:58:43,613
out of that
resignation night.
All right?

1139
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:47,247
That was Nixon at
his lowest point,
a total wreck. On his knees?

1140
00:58:47,323 --> 00:58:49,814
Praying with Kissinger?
Come on, you can nail
him with that stuff.

1141
00:58:49,892 --> 00:58:51,257
Listen, was that okay?

1142
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:52,624
Perfect, sir.

1143
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:55,357
It didn't sound too
arrogant or self-serving?

1144
00:58:55,431 --> 00:58:58,923
Not at all.
You sounded controlled,
even-handed, statesmanlike.

1145
00:58:59,001 --> 00:59:00,195
Good.

1146
00:59:00,269 --> 00:59:01,429
Now continue
exactly the same way.

1147
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:03,403
Long answers.
Control the space.

1148
00:59:03,472 --> 00:59:04,461
Don't let him in.

1149
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:05,802
Okay, got you.

1150
00:59:09,044 --> 00:59:11,069
<i>Set. And roll.</i>

1151
00:59:15,918 --> 00:59:20,981
We're coming
back on camera three
in four, three, two and...

1152
00:59:23,425 --> 00:59:27,486
Reading the account
of those extraordinary
final days,

1153
00:59:27,563 --> 00:59:30,031
it seems your most
emotional moment came

1154
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:33,432
in that
heart-to-heart you had
with Henry Kissinger.

1155
00:59:33,502 --> 00:59:37,131
Was that perhaps
the most emotional moment
of your career?

1156
00:59:37,606 --> 00:59:39,198
- Good, good.
<i>- Yes.</i>

1157
00:59:39,942 --> 00:59:45,244
I would say it was
about as emotional
a moment as I've ever had.

1158
00:59:47,416 --> 00:59:49,543
Except, well,
you know,
it's hard to say

1159
00:59:49,618 --> 00:59:51,711
what is the most
emotional moment,

1160
00:59:51,787 --> 00:59:54,381
because each is different.

1161
00:59:54,823 --> 00:59:57,917
<i>I remember the day</i>
<i>Eisenhower died.</i>

1162
00:59:57,993 --> 00:59:59,290
For God's sake.

1163
00:59:59,361 --> 01:00:03,627
<i>And the day I walked</i>
<i>my eldest daughter</i>
<i>Tricia down the aisle.</i>

1164
01:00:03,699 --> 01:00:06,395
And the day during
the impeachment hearings

1165
01:00:06,468 --> 01:00:10,097
when Julie,
that's my youngest,
she came into my office,

1166
01:00:10,172 --> 01:00:14,666
she threw her arms around me,
she kissed me.
She cried, you know?

1167
01:00:14,743 --> 01:00:17,644
And she so seldom cries.

1168
01:00:17,846 --> 01:00:20,178
<i>She said, "Daddy, you're</i>
<i>the finest man I know. "</i>

1169
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:22,240
"Daddy, you're
the finest man I know"?

1170
01:00:22,718 --> 01:00:26,210
"And whatever you do,
I will support you.

1171
01:00:27,289 --> 01:00:31,623
"You just gotta
go through the fire,
you know, a little longer."

1172
01:00:33,996 --> 01:00:35,759
This is beautiful.

1173
01:00:35,831 --> 01:00:38,994
So Kissinger and I were
in the Lincoln Sitting Room,

1174
01:00:39,067 --> 01:00:42,059
and together we began
to reminisce

1175
01:00:42,137 --> 01:00:45,971
about some of
the great decisions that
we'd participated in.

1176
01:00:46,041 --> 01:00:49,238
There was China,
the Soviet Union,

1177
01:00:49,311 --> 01:00:51,836
the peace settlement
in Vietnam.

1178
01:00:51,914 --> 01:00:55,941
<i>Now, let me</i>
<i>tell you something that</i>
<i>I never told anybody.</i>

1179
01:00:56,018 --> 01:01:00,455
Whenever I have had
a really tough
decision to make...

1180
01:01:00,789 --> 01:01:03,553
Now, we were in
the Lincoln Sitting Room
at that time.

1181
01:01:03,625 --> 01:01:07,322
I have come into this room
for the purpose of praying.

1182
01:01:08,363 --> 01:01:12,231
"Now, Henry,
I'm a Quaker.
You're a Jew.

1183
01:01:12,301 --> 01:01:14,269
"Neither of us is
particularly orthodox,

1184
01:01:14,336 --> 01:01:17,362
"but I'd like to think
that each of us
in our own way

1185
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:20,431
"has a deep
religious sensitivity.

1186
01:01:20,509 --> 01:01:25,606
"So if you don't mind,
could we just have a moment
of silent prayer?"

1187
01:01:25,681 --> 01:01:29,913
So we knelt down.
Now, this was in front
of that table where

1188
01:01:29,985 --> 01:01:34,149
Lincoln signed
the Emancipation
Proclamation.

1189
01:01:34,223 --> 01:01:37,659
And then after a few moments,
we both got up again,
and Henry says...

1190
01:01:37,759 --> 01:01:39,317
Is there... I'm sorry.

1191
01:01:39,461 --> 01:01:40,621
Is there a problem?

1192
01:01:40,696 --> 01:01:41,720
That's time.

1193
01:01:42,297 --> 01:01:44,424
We're over two hours.

1194
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,593
Really? So soon?

1195
01:01:47,302 --> 01:01:50,271
Well, Mr. President,
I gather our time is up.

1196
01:01:50,472 --> 01:01:52,269
Gee, now, that's a pity.

1197
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:54,832
You know,
I was beginning
to enjoy that.

1198
01:01:58,814 --> 01:02:01,180
That was terrific,
both of you.

1199
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:02,615
We're getting some
great material.

1200
01:02:02,684 --> 01:02:04,049
You know,
it's so funny, too,

1201
01:02:04,119 --> 01:02:07,555
because I was expecting
questions on Vietnam.

1202
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:10,114
And we prepared for that,
hadn't we, Jack?

1203
01:02:10,192 --> 01:02:11,591
Yes, so did I.

1204
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:14,788
I guess we
just got caught up,
you know, reminiscing.

1205
01:02:14,863 --> 01:02:15,887
Indeed.

1206
01:02:15,964 --> 01:02:18,228
So, day after tomorrow,
10:00, right?

1207
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:19,392
Yes, indeed.

1208
01:02:19,468 --> 01:02:21,163
I look forward to it.
Bye-bye.

1209
01:02:28,644 --> 01:02:30,703
There's no need
to say anything.

1210
01:02:37,286 --> 01:02:39,413
- Mr. President!
- Mr. President!

1211
01:02:42,491 --> 01:02:43,753
<i>Mr. President!</i>

1212
01:02:43,825 --> 01:02:45,156
<i>Mr. President, please!</i>

1213
01:02:46,161 --> 01:02:47,389
What are you
gonna tell him?

1214
01:02:47,462 --> 01:02:49,157
I'm gonna tell him
he's gotta get involved.

1215
01:02:49,231 --> 01:02:51,062
He's gotta be able
to shut him up.
Shh.

1216
01:02:51,133 --> 01:02:54,159
David, we have some
fundamental problems in
our approach that I think...

1217
01:02:54,236 --> 01:02:55,635
Don't worry, Bob.
I'm on it.

1218
01:02:55,704 --> 01:02:56,728
We can use some of
the Kissinger stuff.

1219
01:02:56,805 --> 01:02:58,534
Yeah, but we need
to discuss it sooner
rather than later...

1220
01:02:58,607 --> 01:02:59,972
Look,
I'm disappointed, too.

1221
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:02,772
But I wonder,
could we possibly spare
the post-mortem for now?

1222
01:03:02,844 --> 01:03:04,903
I don't mean to minimize it.
It's just I've got to
get back to LA

1223
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:06,379
to meet some people
from Weed Eater.

1224
01:03:06,448 --> 01:03:08,279
Thanks, everyone!
Great work!

1225
01:03:08,350 --> 01:03:10,545
Marv, Lloyd, great day.
Bye, David.

1226
01:03:10,619 --> 01:03:13,486
I'll see you soon.
God bless!

1227
01:03:16,525 --> 01:03:18,925
What the hell
is Weed Eater?

1228
01:03:19,227 --> 01:03:21,457
It's a horticultural
mechanism.

1229
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:22,554
One of our sponsors.

1230
01:03:22,631 --> 01:03:23,996
What happened to Xerox?

1231
01:03:24,066 --> 01:03:26,330
What about
General Motors
or IBM?

1232
01:03:26,401 --> 01:03:29,461
I gather that not all of
the blue-chip accounts
came through.

1233
01:03:29,538 --> 01:03:31,733
We do have Alpo.

1234
01:03:31,807 --> 01:03:33,206
Dog food?

1235
01:03:33,275 --> 01:03:35,641
Wait, John.
We're already taping.

1236
01:03:36,144 --> 01:03:37,839
So we're close, right?
We're very close?

1237
01:03:37,913 --> 01:03:39,346
That's probably a question
you should ask David.

1238
01:03:39,414 --> 01:03:41,279
Are we close, John?

1239
01:03:44,186 --> 01:03:46,279
I believe we're at 30%.

1240
01:03:47,055 --> 01:03:48,545
To go? Or 30% sold?

1241
01:03:48,624 --> 01:03:51,320
Again, that's probably
a question you should...

1242
01:03:52,394 --> 01:03:53,986
Sold, 30% sold.

1243
01:03:54,696 --> 01:03:56,220
Jesus...

1244
01:03:56,365 --> 01:03:57,923
I thought
we were practically
fully financed.

1245
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,128
We were. But the financing
was always conditional
on advertising sales,

1246
01:04:01,203 --> 01:04:02,898
and no one predicted
that they'd fall apart
like this.

1247
01:04:02,971 --> 01:04:04,871
Well, why have
they fallen apart?
Based on what?

1248
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:07,738
Credibility of the project.
What else are advertising
sales based on?

1249
01:04:07,809 --> 01:04:09,970
Listen,
I understand your concern.

1250
01:04:10,045 --> 01:04:13,242
But could I ask you
to go a little easier on David
over the next couple of days,

1251
01:04:13,315 --> 01:04:15,783
bearing in mind
the extraordinary pressure
that he's under?

1252
01:04:15,851 --> 01:04:19,343
'Cause at the moment,
he's effectively paying
for all this himself.

1253
01:04:19,421 --> 01:04:23,084
So he's in it
for a lot more than
just his reputation.

1254
01:04:23,425 --> 01:04:24,722
And we're not?

1255
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:35,395
<i>You seemed</i>
<i>very confident last time.</i>

1256
01:04:35,470 --> 01:04:38,405
<i>I don't understand.</i>
<i>Why this sudden</i>
<i>change of heart?</i>

1257
01:04:38,473 --> 01:04:41,033
All right,
this is just madness.
It's Richard Nixon.

1258
01:04:41,109 --> 01:04:45,341
These interviews
will do mid-30s
audience share, minimum.

1259
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:52,047
Jimmy! Yes.
Yes, back again, like
the proverbial bad penny.

1260
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,678
Look, I hate to do
this to a friend,

1261
01:04:53,755 --> 01:04:56,986
and I know you're already in
for more than I asked for,

1262
01:04:57,059 --> 01:05:00,495
but I need you to dig
a little deeper.

1263
01:05:02,030 --> 01:05:04,191
I'm right up against it now.

1264
01:05:07,769 --> 01:05:10,966
So, I had
a chance to review
yesterday's tapes.

1265
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:12,267
And?

1266
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:16,367
Honestly?
Far too soft, David.

1267
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:18,538
Go on. Beat me, John.
Beat me with a stick.

1268
01:05:18,613 --> 01:05:21,605
Look. No, I'm serious.

1269
01:05:21,683 --> 01:05:24,083
You have got to make it
more uncomfortable for him.

1270
01:05:24,152 --> 01:05:26,882
You can start by
sitting forward.
You've gotta attack more.

1271
01:05:26,955 --> 01:05:28,547
If he starts
tailing off, bang,

1272
01:05:28,623 --> 01:05:30,022
jump in with
another question.

1273
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:32,117
Don't trade
generalizations.

1274
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:33,218
Be specific.

1275
01:05:33,295 --> 01:05:36,389
And above all, don't let
him give these self-serving,
23-minute homilies.

1276
01:05:36,465 --> 01:05:37,489
Right.
And keep your distance

1277
01:05:37,566 --> 01:05:38,828
before the tape
starts running.

1278
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:40,197
He was toying
with you yesterday.

1279
01:05:40,268 --> 01:05:42,532
All that shit about <i>Ben-Hur</i>
and struggling to raise
the money.

1280
01:05:42,604 --> 01:05:46,665
Those are mind games.
Don't engage.

1281
01:05:46,742 --> 01:05:50,200
Never forget,
you are in there
with a major operator.

1282
01:05:51,446 --> 01:05:52,845
Got it.

1283
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:01,146
Ah.

1284
01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:03,924
The Grand Inquisitor!

1285
01:06:05,093 --> 01:06:07,527
No, just your friendly
neighborhood confidant.

1286
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,493
It's okay.
We just blew a bulb.

1287
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:17,761
<i>This is why I got all these
Secret Service guys around.</i>

1288
01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:19,204
There's nothing
to worry about.

1289
01:06:19,274 --> 01:06:22,641
As a president, you get
used to this kind of stuff.

1290
01:06:22,811 --> 01:06:26,303
<i>Ed, we gotta get in here and
change out this 750, ASAP.</i>

1291
01:06:31,753 --> 01:06:33,414
- Focus, sir.
- Yeah.

1292
01:06:35,991 --> 01:06:39,620
Okay, we are back.
Okay, take it
on my count.

1293
01:06:40,462 --> 01:06:43,397
Okay, stand by
to roll tape.
30 seconds.

1294
01:06:43,698 --> 01:06:44,926
<i>Settling.</i>

1295
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,661
You have a pleasant
evening last night?

1296
01:06:46,735 --> 01:06:48,327
Yes, thank you.

1297
01:06:56,478 --> 01:06:58,776
Did you do
any fornicating?

1298
01:06:59,047 --> 01:07:02,073
David, we're starting
with camera two in four,

1299
01:07:03,218 --> 01:07:05,413
Three, two and...

1300
01:07:10,025 --> 01:07:13,256
Mr. President, you came
to office promising peace,

1301
01:07:13,328 --> 01:07:15,319
but no sooner did you
get into the White House

1302
01:07:15,397 --> 01:07:19,834
than US involvement in Vietnam
deepened and the war was prolonged

1303
01:07:19,901 --> 01:07:21,493
with calamitous
consequences.

1304
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:25,028
Did you feel that you'd betrayed
the people that had elected you?

1305
01:07:25,106 --> 01:07:28,872
Well, Vietnam
was not my war.

1306
01:07:28,944 --> 01:07:30,605
It was my inheritance.

1307
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:32,544
<i>And it looked to me...</i>
Jump in.

1308
01:07:32,614 --> 01:07:35,640
...as if the reason
for our being there

1309
01:07:35,717 --> 01:07:40,416
had perhaps not been adequately
understood by the American people.

1310
01:07:40,822 --> 01:07:42,847
It seemed to me
they hadn't realized

1311
01:07:42,924 --> 01:07:48,123
how important a test this
was of American credibility.

1312
01:07:48,830 --> 01:07:50,855
The whole world
was watching to see

1313
01:07:50,932 --> 01:07:53,958
if we have the character
to see it through.

1314
01:07:54,035 --> 01:07:56,799
Now, look, I could have bugged out.
I could have.

1315
01:07:56,872 --> 01:07:59,534
I could have blamed it
on my predecessors.

1316
01:07:59,608 --> 01:08:02,099
I could have pulled the
troops out of Vietnam early,

1317
01:08:02,177 --> 01:08:04,509
and very possibly,
I would have won

1318
01:08:04,579 --> 01:08:07,810
some Scandinavian peace prize
into the bargain.

1319
01:08:07,883 --> 01:08:09,544
But I believed
in the cause.

1320
01:08:09,618 --> 01:08:14,954
And sometimes, you know, what you
believe in, it's the harder path.

1321
01:08:15,023 --> 01:08:19,858
You might even say that I was the
last casualty of the Vietnam War.

1322
01:08:19,928 --> 01:08:22,692
Yeah, tell that
to the paraplegics.

1323
01:08:22,797 --> 01:08:24,128
Come on, David,
Cambodia.

1324
01:08:24,199 --> 01:08:27,362
And Cambodia? An invasion which
everybody advised you against.

1325
01:08:27,435 --> 01:08:30,461
All the CIA
and Pentagon intelligence
suggested it would fail.

1326
01:08:30,538 --> 01:08:31,630
So why did you do it?

1327
01:08:31,706 --> 01:08:32,764
Well, first of all,

1328
01:08:32,841 --> 01:08:39,269
as a result of
our incursion into Cambodia,
we picked up 22,000 rifles,

1329
01:08:39,347 --> 01:08:43,841
15 million rounds
of ammunition,
150,000 rockets, mortars.

1330
01:08:43,919 --> 01:08:46,149
That's all belonging
to the North Vietnamese,

1331
01:08:46,221 --> 01:08:49,247
which would only otherwise
have been directed

1332
01:08:49,324 --> 01:08:51,451
right onto
American soldiers.

1333
01:08:51,526 --> 01:08:54,791
But one of
the principal justifications
you gave for the incursion

1334
01:08:54,863 --> 01:08:56,524
was the supposed
existence of

1335
01:08:56,598 --> 01:09:01,501
the "headquarters of
the entire Communist military
operation in South Vietnam,"

1336
01:09:01,569 --> 01:09:05,335
a sort of "bamboo Pentagon"
which proved
not to exist at all.

1337
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:07,068
No, no. Wait a minute
there. No, I was...
And by sending...

1338
01:09:07,142 --> 01:09:10,373
And by sending B-52s
to carpet bomb a country,

1339
01:09:10,445 --> 01:09:13,005
wiping out
whole civilian areas,

1340
01:09:13,081 --> 01:09:16,107
you end up radicalizing
a once moderate people,

1341
01:09:16,184 --> 01:09:18,778
uniting them in
anti-American sentiment

1342
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:21,514
<i>and creating a monster</i>
<i>in the Khmer Rouge</i>

1343
01:09:21,589 --> 01:09:22,920
<i>that would lead</i>
<i>to civil war...</i>

1344
01:09:22,991 --> 01:09:24,652
All right!
...<i>and genocide.</i>

1345
01:09:24,793 --> 01:09:26,260
Yes, good, good, good.
There it is.

1346
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:27,488
Okay, run VT.

1347
01:09:27,562 --> 01:09:28,551
Roll tape.

1348
01:10:25,186 --> 01:10:26,414
Well, sir,
I'm sure you'd agree,

1349
01:10:26,488 --> 01:10:28,547
some pretty
stirring images there.

1350
01:10:28,623 --> 01:10:34,391
Look, it was never US policy
to kill civilians.
That's the enemy's way.

1351
01:10:34,462 --> 01:10:35,451
Well, I'm not suggesting...

1352
01:10:35,530 --> 01:10:36,588
And if you're
asking the question

1353
01:10:36,664 --> 01:10:40,760
do I regret the casualties
on both sides in the war,
yeah, sure, of course I do.

1354
01:10:40,835 --> 01:10:42,894
Let me tell you something.
It can just wear you down.

1355
01:10:42,971 --> 01:10:44,905
Well, all right, sir,
when you are faced
with someone who...

1356
01:10:44,973 --> 01:10:47,032
But whenever
I have had my doubts,

1357
01:10:47,108 --> 01:10:49,235
I remembered
the construction worker
in Philadelphia,

1358
01:10:49,310 --> 01:10:50,538
because he came up to me

1359
01:10:50,612 --> 01:10:54,173
and he said, "Sir,
I got only one criticism
of that Cambodia thing.

1360
01:10:54,249 --> 01:10:55,978
"If you'd gone in earlier,

1361
01:10:56,051 --> 01:10:57,814
"you might have
captured the gun

1362
01:10:57,886 --> 01:10:59,911
"that killed my boy
three months ago."

1363
01:10:59,988 --> 01:11:02,980
So you're asking me,
do I regret
going into Cambodia?

1364
01:11:03,058 --> 01:11:05,322
No! I don't.
You know what?

1365
01:11:05,393 --> 01:11:08,453
I wish I'd gone in
sooner and harder.

1366
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:09,588
- Got him.
- Safe!

1367
01:11:16,071 --> 01:11:20,940
It was horrifying.
It was horrifying.
And he was so confident.

1368
01:11:23,945 --> 01:11:26,379
<i>What are you gonna say
about Watergate?</i>

1369
01:11:26,714 --> 01:11:30,013
Sorry, boys,
just all talked out,
you know?

1370
01:11:36,758 --> 01:11:38,157
Better?

1371
01:11:41,763 --> 01:11:43,856
It was.
Unquestionably better.

1372
01:11:49,304 --> 01:11:50,532
What's next?

1373
01:11:51,172 --> 01:11:52,400
Foreign policy.

1374
01:11:54,943 --> 01:12:00,006
Great. Russia, China,
the big power stuff.

1375
01:12:00,081 --> 01:12:02,379
Yeah, so?

1376
01:12:02,450 --> 01:12:04,213
So if he beats him up
like that on Vietnam,

1377
01:12:04,285 --> 01:12:07,186
imagine what he's gonna do
with his real achievements.

1378
01:12:09,791 --> 01:12:12,157
It ain't gonna be pretty.

1379
01:12:12,227 --> 01:12:14,957
The answer was
grow by six inches.

1380
01:12:15,029 --> 01:12:17,930
It was agony to watch.

1381
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:21,601
Now, that's when
Khrushchev called me,
begging me to intervene.

1382
01:12:21,669 --> 01:12:23,694
You see, he and Mao
didn't get along,

1383
01:12:23,771 --> 01:12:26,103
and Khrushchev
knew that the Chairman

1384
01:12:26,174 --> 01:12:28,165
would talk to me,
no one else.

1385
01:12:28,243 --> 01:12:33,010
You see, I was the only one
that Mao would trust
personally, man-to-man.

1386
01:12:33,081 --> 01:12:35,606
When David tried to
lay a finger on him,

1387
01:12:35,683 --> 01:12:38,049
Nixon made mincemeat
out of him.

1388
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:40,715
<i>What "revolution," David?</i>

1389
01:12:40,788 --> 01:12:42,585
You just let
Richard Nixon claim

1390
01:12:42,657 --> 01:12:44,887
the country was in
a state of revolution?

1391
01:12:44,959 --> 01:12:48,224
What, with protestors
"bombing" and "assaulting"
police officers?

1392
01:12:48,296 --> 01:12:49,524
That's not how
I remember it.

1393
01:12:49,597 --> 01:12:52,532
What I remember
is people protesting
peacefully and legitimately

1394
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:53,760
against the Vietnam War!

1395
01:12:53,835 --> 01:12:55,393
That's what I remember.
Music off, please. Off.

1396
01:12:55,470 --> 01:12:58,166
By the end, wiretapping
students and breaking
into journalists' homes

1397
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:00,469
was beginning to sound
like a rational response.

1398
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:01,907
Well, I'm sorry
you feel this way,

1399
01:13:01,976 --> 01:13:04,069
but I simply cannot
share your view.

1400
01:13:04,145 --> 01:13:05,237
About what exactly?

1401
01:13:05,313 --> 01:13:06,678
About any of it, frankly!

1402
01:13:06,748 --> 01:13:09,376
I thought today was
a huge improvement.

1403
01:13:09,450 --> 01:13:10,474
Are you nuts?

1404
01:13:10,552 --> 01:13:12,543
Let me tell you how
bad things were today.

1405
01:13:12,620 --> 01:13:15,646
After the taping finished,
I overheard two members
of the crew say

1406
01:13:15,723 --> 01:13:18,089
they never voted for him
when they had the chance,

1407
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:21,560
but if he ran
for office again today,
he'd get their support.

1408
01:13:21,629 --> 01:13:24,359
You're making him
look presidential,
for Christ's sake!

1409
01:13:24,432 --> 01:13:26,957
And forget about
the trivia, David.

1410
01:13:27,035 --> 01:13:29,902
Who cares whether Nixon
took the White House bed
to Europe

1411
01:13:29,971 --> 01:13:31,802
when he traveled?
I do!

1412
01:13:31,873 --> 01:13:33,534
Well, it's irrelevant!

1413
01:13:33,608 --> 01:13:37,305
And it's just
the sort of banal anecdote
that would distract a talk...

1414
01:13:38,646 --> 01:13:39,874
A what?

1415
01:13:42,850 --> 01:13:44,750
Go on. No, say it.

1416
01:13:44,819 --> 01:13:47,310
What, you were gonna
say "talk show host"?

1417
01:13:48,656 --> 01:13:51,090
Yeah. Yeah, I was.

1418
01:13:58,933 --> 01:14:03,199
All right, look,
it's useless me trying
to answer your points.

1419
01:14:03,404 --> 01:14:07,340
Frankly, I don't share
any of your sense of
pessimism or alarm.

1420
01:14:09,143 --> 01:14:12,203
And this ridiculous
self-flagellation,

1421
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:14,748
in my view,
is just depressing.

1422
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:16,942
No!

1423
01:14:18,820 --> 01:14:23,257
And threatening to derail
the whole enterprise.

1424
01:14:24,926 --> 01:14:30,057
Look. If there is
anyone here who thinks
we're gonna fail,

1425
01:14:31,032 --> 01:14:33,057
they better leave now,

1426
01:14:34,135 --> 01:14:36,365
or it'll infect
everyone else.

1427
01:14:43,411 --> 01:14:44,742
No one?

1428
01:14:48,182 --> 01:14:49,581
Right.

1429
01:14:50,952 --> 01:14:52,078
Good.

1430
01:14:54,555 --> 01:14:58,355
Now, I suggest instead of
festering around the hotel
for the next five days,

1431
01:14:58,426 --> 01:15:01,395
we all go
our separate ways
over Easter.

1432
01:15:03,097 --> 01:15:05,588
But before we go,
Caroline and I
would like you

1433
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:08,067
to join us for a little
celebratory dinner

1434
01:15:08,136 --> 01:15:11,196
at Patrick Terrail's
new place.

1435
01:15:11,272 --> 01:15:14,036
Celebrate?
Celebrate what, David?

1436
01:15:14,108 --> 01:15:15,871
The fact that we're
all gonna be working
at Burger King?

1437
01:15:15,943 --> 01:15:19,140
What are we celebrating?
It's my birthday, Bob!

1438
01:15:23,818 --> 01:15:29,188
I'd like to
celebrate my birthday
with a few friends.

1439
01:15:41,102 --> 01:15:42,364
Look, is that
Neil Diamond?

1440
01:15:42,437 --> 01:15:44,337
<i>Frost and Nixon,</i>
<i>Frost and Nixon</i>

1441
01:15:44,405 --> 01:15:45,736
And is that Sammy Cahn?

1442
01:15:45,807 --> 01:15:46,933
<i>Go together like</i>
<i>Prancer and Vixen</i>

1443
01:15:47,008 --> 01:15:48,373
David,
did you hear that?

1444
01:15:48,443 --> 01:15:50,172
<i>Soaring through the airwaves</i>

1445
01:15:50,244 --> 01:15:52,542
Jesus, that's Hugh Hefner.

1446
01:15:52,613 --> 01:15:53,637
Oh, my God.

1447
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:54,943
<i>Hoping for several</i>
<i>hefty paydays</i>

1448
01:15:55,016 --> 01:15:56,449
Yeah, I think it is.
With Michael York.

1449
01:15:56,517 --> 01:15:57,814
That's gotta be Bunnies.

1450
01:15:57,885 --> 01:15:59,512
Those are Bunnies?
Those are real Bunnies?

1451
01:15:59,587 --> 01:16:00,986
<i>Frost and Nixon,</i>
<i>Frost and Nixon</i>

1452
01:16:01,055 --> 01:16:02,181
<i>Go together</i>
<i>like Mason and Dixon</i>

1453
01:16:02,256 --> 01:16:05,748
David, just putting it
all together it's the most
extraordinary accomplishment.

1454
01:16:05,827 --> 01:16:07,385
<i>Frost lines up with Dicky...</i>

1455
01:16:07,462 --> 01:16:08,690
No one else
could have done that.

1456
01:16:08,763 --> 01:16:11,493
And these interviews
are always gonna be around
for future generations

1457
01:16:11,566 --> 01:16:13,864
of academics and
political historians.

1458
01:16:13,935 --> 01:16:14,924
That bad?

1459
01:16:15,002 --> 01:16:16,731
<i>He saved it</i>

1460
01:16:16,804 --> 01:16:19,932
<i>He wrote a book</i>

1461
01:16:20,007 --> 01:16:21,531
David!

1462
01:16:21,609 --> 01:16:22,633
Patrick.

1463
01:16:22,710 --> 01:16:25,679
<i>He's not a crook</i>
<i>He's paid by David</i>

1464
01:17:07,922 --> 01:17:12,382
My, what
a festive atmosphere.
Please, don't get up.

1465
01:17:12,460 --> 01:17:16,055
I take it from this
that the interviews
have gone well?

1466
01:17:16,130 --> 01:17:17,791
Better than that, ma'am.
It's a shutout.

1467
01:17:17,865 --> 01:17:20,060
The President's sitting
on an 11-0 lead.

1468
01:17:20,134 --> 01:17:22,159
Really? Well.
Yeah.

1469
01:17:22,236 --> 01:17:24,466
Well, that is
most gratifying.

1470
01:17:28,776 --> 01:17:31,973
I'm so glad it's all
gone according to plan.

1471
01:17:47,228 --> 01:17:48,525
I see.

1472
01:17:50,198 --> 01:17:52,223
Is there nothing
we can do?

1473
01:17:53,868 --> 01:17:55,028
Really?

1474
01:17:57,238 --> 01:18:00,366
Right. Well, thanks
for letting me know.

1475
01:18:07,448 --> 01:18:10,417
It's true.
They've dropped
the Australian show.

1476
01:18:10,485 --> 01:18:12,817
Oh, no, David.

1477
01:18:12,887 --> 01:18:16,653
They felt that I needed
to reevaluate my priorities.

1478
01:18:19,026 --> 01:18:22,086
Now my producer's worried
that the London show
will follow.

1479
01:18:25,366 --> 01:18:26,697
I'm in this
for everything I've got,

1480
01:18:26,767 --> 01:18:30,464
and there's still
no guarantee it'll ever
see the light of day.

1481
01:18:32,573 --> 01:18:37,101
What have I done?
What was I thinking?
Why didn't anyone stop me?

1482
01:18:37,178 --> 01:18:38,839
They should have
physically stopped me!

1483
01:18:38,913 --> 01:18:40,505
No, no, no. Shh.

1484
01:18:48,022 --> 01:18:51,924
Look, we don't have
to go out tonight.
Why don't we stay in?

1485
01:18:53,995 --> 01:18:55,087
Hmm?

1486
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:02,801
I'll go down to Trader Vic's
and bring something back.

1487
01:19:04,505 --> 01:19:06,097
Steak or fish?

1488
01:19:07,608 --> 01:19:08,939
David?

1489
01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:15,774
Don't worry. I'll call
from the restaurant.

1490
01:20:00,861 --> 01:20:04,888
I'll have a cheeseburger.

1491
01:20:05,333 --> 01:20:09,565
<i>Mmm. That sounds good.</i>
<i>I used to love cheeseburgers,</i>

1492
01:20:10,638 --> 01:20:12,799
<i>but Dr. Lundgren</i>
<i>made me give them up.</i>

1493
01:20:12,873 --> 01:20:16,400
<i>He switched me</i>
<i>to cottage cheese</i>
<i>and pineapple instead.</i>

1494
01:20:17,478 --> 01:20:19,810
He calls them
my Hawaiian burgers,

1495
01:20:20,381 --> 01:20:22,281
but they don't taste
like burgers at all.

1496
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:24,511
<i>They taste like Styrofoam.</i>

1497
01:20:28,289 --> 01:20:30,189
I hope I'm not disturbing.

1498
01:20:31,025 --> 01:20:32,424
No.

1499
01:20:32,493 --> 01:20:34,120
<i>It's a Friday night.</i>

1500
01:20:34,195 --> 01:20:38,723
You've probably
got somebody there
whom you're entertaining.

1501
01:20:40,167 --> 01:20:41,395
No.

1502
01:20:41,535 --> 01:20:43,230
Well, then
what are you doing?

1503
01:20:43,971 --> 01:20:45,939
<i>A handsome</i>
<i>young fellow,</i>

1504
01:20:46,474 --> 01:20:51,537
an eligible young bachelor
alone on a Friday night.

1505
01:20:53,214 --> 01:20:58,675
If you must know,
I'm preparing
for our final session.

1506
01:20:59,553 --> 01:21:01,714
The all-important
final session.

1507
01:21:01,789 --> 01:21:03,916
<i>Yes.</i>
Watergate.

1508
01:21:04,959 --> 01:21:08,156
<i>'Cause I guess</i>
<i>the way you handle</i>
<i>Watergate's gonna determine</i>

1509
01:21:08,229 --> 01:21:11,528
whether these interviews
are a success or a failure.

1510
01:21:13,801 --> 01:21:15,632
Should I be nervous?

1511
01:21:17,438 --> 01:21:21,534
Well, I'm gonna
give it my best shot.

1512
01:21:21,909 --> 01:21:26,903
Quite right.
No holds barred.
No holds barred.

1513
01:21:27,782 --> 01:21:29,682
You know, it's strange.

1514
01:21:30,551 --> 01:21:34,009
Now, we have sat in chairs
opposite one another,

1515
01:21:34,121 --> 01:21:37,386
talking for hours,
it seems, days on end,

1516
01:21:37,458 --> 01:21:40,655
and yet I've hardly
gotten to know you.

1517
01:21:41,729 --> 01:21:44,789
One of my people,
as part of the preparation

1518
01:21:44,865 --> 01:21:47,527
for this interview,
she did a profile on you.

1519
01:21:48,102 --> 01:21:52,129
And I'm sorry to say
that I just got around
to reading it tonight.

1520
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:57,874
There's some
interesting stuff
in there.

1521
01:21:57,945 --> 01:22:01,039
Your Methodist background,
the modest circumstances,

1522
01:22:01,115 --> 01:22:07,452
and then you're off
to a grand university
full of richer, posher types.

1523
01:22:07,521 --> 01:22:10,012
What was it? Oxford?

1524
01:22:11,358 --> 01:22:12,848
Cambridge.

1525
01:22:13,828 --> 01:22:17,992
Did the snobs there
look down on you, too?

1526
01:22:19,366 --> 01:22:23,928
Of course they did.
That's our tragedy,
isn't it, Mr. Frost?

1527
01:22:24,772 --> 01:22:30,005
No matter how high we get,
they still look down at us.

1528
01:22:31,112 --> 01:22:33,080
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

1529
01:22:33,147 --> 01:22:34,808
Yes, you do.

1530
01:22:35,349 --> 01:22:39,251
Now, come on.
No matter how many awards

1531
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:42,551
or column inches
are written about you

1532
01:22:42,623 --> 01:22:47,185
<i>or how high</i>
<i>the elected office is for me,</i>
<i>it's still not enough.</i>

1533
01:22:48,062 --> 01:22:50,326
We still feel
like the little man,

1534
01:22:50,397 --> 01:22:55,164
the loser they told us
we were a hundred times.

1535
01:22:55,836 --> 01:23:00,535
The smart-asses at college,
the high-ups, the well-born,

1536
01:23:01,408 --> 01:23:05,868
the people whose
respect we really wanted,
really craved.

1537
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:12,446
And isn't that
why we work so hard now,
why we fight for every inch,

1538
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:16,183
<i>scrambling our way up</i>
<i>in undignified fashion?</i>

1539
01:23:16,257 --> 01:23:21,354
If we're honest for a minute,
if we reflect privately
just for a moment,

1540
01:23:21,428 --> 01:23:28,300
if we allow ourselves
a glimpse into that shadowy
place we call our soul,

1541
01:23:28,569 --> 01:23:33,336
isn't that why
we're here now?
The two of us?

1542
01:23:33,574 --> 01:23:37,169
Looking for a way
back into the sun,

1543
01:23:37,678 --> 01:23:42,012
<i>into the limelight,</i>
<i>back onto the winner's podium.</i>

1544
01:23:42,082 --> 01:23:45,643
Because we could feel
it slipping away.

1545
01:23:45,719 --> 01:23:48,688
We were headed,
both of us, for the dirt!

1546
01:23:48,756 --> 01:23:53,216
A place the snobs
always told us
that we'd end up.

1547
01:23:53,294 --> 01:23:54,420
Face in the dust.

1548
01:23:54,495 --> 01:23:58,625
Humiliated all the more
for having tried
so pitifully hard.

1549
01:23:58,699 --> 01:24:01,099
Well, to hell with that!

1550
01:24:01,168 --> 01:24:03,398
We're not gonna
let that happen,
either of us.

1551
01:24:03,470 --> 01:24:05,165
We're gonna
show those bums.

1552
01:24:05,239 --> 01:24:08,766
We're gonna make them choke
on our continued success,

1553
01:24:08,843 --> 01:24:14,509
our continued headlines,
our continued awards
and power and glory!

1554
01:24:14,582 --> 01:24:18,609
We are gonna make
those motherfuckers choke!

1555
01:24:29,864 --> 01:24:31,229
Am I right?

1556
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:36,400
You are.
Except only one of us can win.

1557
01:24:37,571 --> 01:24:38,560
Yes.

1558
01:24:41,442 --> 01:24:46,778
And I shall be
your fiercest adversary.

1559
01:24:47,348 --> 01:24:51,444
I shall come at you
with everything I got,

1560
01:24:52,386 --> 01:24:58,985
because the limelight
can only shine on one of us.

1561
01:25:00,561 --> 01:25:04,895
And for the other,
it'll be the wilderness,

1562
01:25:06,767 --> 01:25:11,966
with nothing and no one
for company

1563
01:25:13,674 --> 01:25:17,235
but those voices
ringing in our head.

1564
01:25:32,026 --> 01:25:36,986
You can probably tell
I've had a drink.

1565
01:25:38,866 --> 01:25:41,232
<i>It's not too many.</i>
<i>Just one or two.</i>

1566
01:25:42,670 --> 01:25:45,833
But you believe me,

1567
01:25:48,175 --> 01:25:54,978
when the time comes,
I'm gonna be focused
and ready for battle.

1568
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:01,185
Good night, Mr. Frost.

1569
01:26:03,190 --> 01:26:04,521
<i>Good night,</i>

1570
01:26:06,393 --> 01:26:08,054
Mr. President.

1571
01:26:25,179 --> 01:26:28,205
So with or without cheese?
I brought burgers.

1572
01:26:29,183 --> 01:26:30,275
David?

1573
01:26:30,351 --> 01:26:31,511
I've got to work.

1574
01:26:34,621 --> 01:26:37,419
<i>Well,</i>
<i>who was the asshole that did?</i>

1575
01:26:38,392 --> 01:26:40,189
<i>Jesus, is that Liddy?</i>

1576
01:26:41,161 --> 01:26:42,628
<i>He must be a little nuts.</i>

1577
01:26:42,696 --> 01:26:43,958
<i>Yeah, he is.</i>

1578
01:26:44,031 --> 01:26:46,625
<i>I mean, he just isn't</i>
<i>well screwed on, is he?</i>

1579
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:48,634
<i>Isn't that the problem?</i>

1580
01:26:48,702 --> 01:26:51,193
<i>Yeah, screw the Cabinet</i>
<i>and the rest of those.</i>

1581
01:26:51,271 --> 01:26:54,798
<i>But no more sucking around.</i>
<i>From now on, they come to me.</i>

1582
01:26:54,875 --> 01:26:56,900
<i>There is one thing</i>
<i>that I want done,</i>

1583
01:26:56,977 --> 01:26:58,968
<i>and I don't want</i>
<i>any argument about it.</i>

1584
01:26:59,847 --> 01:27:02,941
<i>I want you to direct</i>
<i>the most trusted</i>
<i>person you have</i>

1585
01:27:03,017 --> 01:27:04,712
<i>in the Immigration Service</i>

1586
01:27:04,785 --> 01:27:08,881
<i>that they are to look over</i>
<i>all the activities</i>
<i>at the</i> Los Angeles Times.

1587
01:27:08,956 --> 01:27:12,653
<i>AII, underlined.</i>
<i>And they are to send</i>
<i>their teams in to see</i>

1588
01:27:12,726 --> 01:27:15,661
<i>whether they are violating</i>
<i>the wetback thing.</i>

1589
01:27:15,729 --> 01:27:17,390
<i>- Is that clear?</i>
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

1590
01:27:20,634 --> 01:27:23,364
<i>You open that scab, there's a
<i>hell of a lot of things that</i>

1591
01:27:23,437 --> 01:27:25,803
<i>we just feel that</i>
<i>it would be very detrimental</i>

1592
01:27:25,873 --> 01:27:28,137
<i>to have this thing</i>
<i>go any further.</i>

1593
01:27:35,149 --> 01:27:36,138
Hello?

1594
01:27:36,216 --> 01:27:37,740
<i>Jim, it's David.</i>

1595
01:27:38,852 --> 01:27:40,979
Hey. What time is it?

1596
01:27:41,055 --> 01:27:44,081
How much longer
are you gonna be
in D.C. For?

1597
01:27:44,158 --> 01:27:45,557
Tuesday. Till Tuesday.

1598
01:27:45,626 --> 01:27:47,719
Great. Well,
you remember
you mentioned

1599
01:27:47,795 --> 01:27:50,320
going to the Federal
Courthouse library?

1600
01:27:50,397 --> 01:27:52,729
Honey, can you
check on him, please?

1601
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,597
Yes, for the Colson stuff?

1602
01:27:54,668 --> 01:27:57,865
Well, I've been doing
a little light reading
this end,

1603
01:27:59,006 --> 01:28:01,668
<i>and you remember</i>
<i>that hunch you had</i>
<i>about the meeting</i>

1604
01:28:01,742 --> 01:28:03,300
<i>between Nixon and Colson?</i>

1605
01:28:03,377 --> 01:28:05,072
Uh-huh. What are you thinking?

1606
01:28:34,074 --> 01:28:35,541
Hey.
Hey.

1607
01:28:35,609 --> 01:28:36,735
Good morning.

1608
01:28:36,810 --> 01:28:37,799
And?

1609
01:28:49,656 --> 01:28:51,681
Excuse me, sir.

1610
01:29:08,175 --> 01:29:10,439
It's 8:30.
Bob, have you seen David?

1611
01:29:10,577 --> 01:29:12,875
No. No Frost, no Reston.

1612
01:29:23,056 --> 01:29:25,786
Morning.
Good morning.
Come on, let's go.

1613
01:29:29,796 --> 01:29:31,525
What's that about?

1614
01:29:39,506 --> 01:29:41,201
<i>First time he's late.</i>

1615
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:55,685
<i>Mr. President!</i>

1616
01:30:12,439 --> 01:30:13,633
Morning.

1617
01:30:52,212 --> 01:30:53,543
Mr. President.

1618
01:30:54,081 --> 01:30:55,446
Mr. Frost.

1619
01:31:10,297 --> 01:31:12,527
<i>Thirty seconds
to tape roll!</i>

1620
01:31:15,102 --> 01:31:19,505
Thirty seconds.
Settling. Settle.

1621
01:31:29,149 --> 01:31:35,179
Well, if today's session is
anything like our phone call,
it should be explosive.

1622
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:38,358
What phone call?

1623
01:31:38,859 --> 01:31:40,850
The phone call
to my hotel room.

1624
01:31:44,031 --> 01:31:48,331
<i>David, starting on camera three
in four, three, two and...</i>

1625
01:31:56,076 --> 01:31:59,341
Now, looking back
on your final year
in office,

1626
01:31:59,579 --> 01:32:01,809
do you feel you ever
obstructed justice

1627
01:32:01,882 --> 01:32:05,215
or were part of
a conspiracy to cover up
or obstruct justice?

1628
01:32:05,285 --> 01:32:06,377
No.

1629
01:32:07,354 --> 01:32:12,189
And I'm interested
that you used the term
"obstruction of justice."

1630
01:32:12,259 --> 01:32:14,352
Now, you perhaps have not
read the statute

1631
01:32:14,494 --> 01:32:16,587
with regard to
the obstruction
of justice.

1632
01:32:16,697 --> 01:32:19,222
As it happens, I have.

1633
01:32:19,299 --> 01:32:25,932
You have, you say?
Well, then, you'll know it
doesn't just require an act.

1634
01:32:26,006 --> 01:32:29,601
It requires a specific
corrupt motive.

1635
01:32:29,676 --> 01:32:33,009
And in this case,
I didn't have
a corrupt motive.

1636
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:36,607
What I was doing
was in the interests
of political containment.

1637
01:32:36,683 --> 01:32:38,878
Be that as it may,
the direct consequences

1638
01:32:38,952 --> 01:32:40,544
of your actions
would have been

1639
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:42,281
that two of
the convicted burglars

1640
01:32:42,356 --> 01:32:44,256
would have escaped
criminal prosecution.

1641
01:32:44,324 --> 01:32:47,657
Now, how can that
not be a cover-up or
obstruction of justice?

1642
01:32:47,728 --> 01:32:49,491
Well, I think
the record shows,
Mr. Frost,

1643
01:32:49,563 --> 01:32:52,760
that far from
obstructing justice,

1644
01:32:52,833 --> 01:32:55,358
I was actively
facilitating it.

1645
01:32:55,435 --> 01:32:59,838
When Pat Gray of the FBI
telephoned me,
this was July 6,

1646
01:32:59,906 --> 01:33:03,342
I said,
"Pat, you go right ahead
with your investigation."

1647
01:33:03,410 --> 01:33:05,640
That's hardly
what you'd call
obstructing justice.

1648
01:33:05,712 --> 01:33:08,840
Well, that may be,
but for two weeks
prior to July 6,

1649
01:33:08,915 --> 01:33:10,405
we now know that
you were desperately

1650
01:33:10,484 --> 01:33:11,917
trying to contain or block
the investigation.

1651
01:33:11,985 --> 01:33:13,680
No, no. Hang on
a minute there.
I wasn't...

1652
01:33:13,754 --> 01:33:15,551
No, no.
Obstruction of justice
is obstruction of justice,

1653
01:33:15,622 --> 01:33:17,522
whether it's for
a minute or five minutes,

1654
01:33:17,591 --> 01:33:19,616
and it's no defense
to say that your plan failed.

1655
01:33:19,693 --> 01:33:22,457
I mean, if I try to
rob a bank and fail,
that's no defense.

1656
01:33:22,529 --> 01:33:23,996
I still tried
to rob the bank.

1657
01:33:24,064 --> 01:33:26,726
Will you just wait
one minute there,
Mr. Frost?

1658
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:29,234
There is no evidence
of any kind that I was...

1659
01:33:29,302 --> 01:33:30,735
Well, the reason
there is no evidence

1660
01:33:30,804 --> 01:33:32,465
is because
18 and a half minutes

1661
01:33:32,539 --> 01:33:35,770
of the conversation
with Bob Haldeman
from this June period

1662
01:33:35,842 --> 01:33:37,503
have mysteriously
been erased.

1663
01:33:37,577 --> 01:33:40,478
That was
an unfortunate
oversight.

1664
01:33:40,547 --> 01:33:42,037
And Bob Haldeman
is a rigorous

1665
01:33:42,115 --> 01:33:44,606
and a conscientious
note taker.

1666
01:33:44,684 --> 01:33:46,549
His notes are there
for all to see.

1667
01:33:46,620 --> 01:33:49,350
Well, we found
something rather better
than his notes,

1668
01:33:49,423 --> 01:33:52,984
a conversation
with Charles Colson,

1669
01:33:53,927 --> 01:33:56,862
which I don't think
has ever been published.

1670
01:33:58,598 --> 01:34:00,429
Okay, here we go.

1671
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:02,434
It hasn't been
published, you say?

1672
01:34:02,502 --> 01:34:05,596
No, but one
of my researchers
found it in Washington

1673
01:34:06,239 --> 01:34:09,333
where it's available
to anyone who consults
the records.

1674
01:34:09,409 --> 01:34:14,073
Well, I just wondered,
you know, if we'd seen it.

1675
01:34:14,147 --> 01:34:15,614
More than seen it,
Mr. President.

1676
01:34:15,682 --> 01:34:17,343
You spoke the actual words.

1677
01:34:17,417 --> 01:34:21,683
Now, you've always claimed
you first learned of
the break-in on June 23.

1678
01:34:21,755 --> 01:34:22,813
Yeah.

1679
01:34:22,889 --> 01:34:26,518
But this transcript of a tape
made three days earlier

1680
01:34:26,593 --> 01:34:29,061
clearly shows that
to be a falsehood.

1681
01:34:29,663 --> 01:34:35,158
Now, in it you say
to Colson, "This whole
investigation rests

1682
01:34:36,236 --> 01:34:41,731
"unless one of the seven
begins to talk.

1683
01:34:44,544 --> 01:34:46,273
"That's the problem."

1684
01:34:46,346 --> 01:34:49,838
Well, what do we
mean when we say

1685
01:34:49,916 --> 01:34:52,043
"one of the seven
beginning to talk"?

1686
01:34:52,118 --> 01:34:55,417
Then moving on to
a conversation you had
with John Dean

1687
01:34:55,489 --> 01:34:56,979
on March 21,
the following year.

1688
01:34:57,057 --> 01:35:00,026
In one transcript alone,
there in black and white,

1689
01:35:00,093 --> 01:35:01,754
I picked out,
and these are your words,

1690
01:35:01,828 --> 01:35:05,559
one,
"You could get $1 million,
and you could get it in cash.

1691
01:35:05,632 --> 01:35:07,065
"I know where it
could be gotten."

1692
01:35:07,133 --> 01:35:10,466
Two, "Your major guy
to keep under control
is Hunt."

1693
01:35:11,071 --> 01:35:13,938
Three,
"Don't we have to handle
the Hunt situation?"

1694
01:35:14,007 --> 01:35:15,804
Four, "Get the million bucks.

1695
01:35:15,876 --> 01:35:18,344
"It would seem to me
that would be worthwhile."

1696
01:35:18,411 --> 01:35:21,209
Five, "Don't you agree
that you'd better get
the Hunt thing going?"

1697
01:35:21,281 --> 01:35:23,112
Six, "First you've got
the Hunt problem.

1698
01:35:23,183 --> 01:35:25,845
"That ought to be handled."
Seven, "The money
can be provided.

1699
01:35:25,919 --> 01:35:28,387
"Ehrlichman could provide
the way to deliver it."

1700
01:35:28,455 --> 01:35:30,150
Eight,
"We've no choice with Hunt

1701
01:35:30,223 --> 01:35:33,090
"but the $120,000 or
whatever it is, right?"

1702
01:35:33,159 --> 01:35:36,560
Nine, "Christ,
turn over any cash
we've got."

1703
01:35:36,630 --> 01:35:38,097
And I could go on.
Now, it seems to me

1704
01:35:38,164 --> 01:35:39,825
that someone
running a cover-up

1705
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:41,925
couldn't have expressed it
more clearly than that,
could they?

1706
01:35:42,002 --> 01:35:43,560
Look, let me
just stop you now
right there,

1707
01:35:43,637 --> 01:35:45,764
because you're doing
something here

1708
01:35:45,839 --> 01:35:48,171
which I am not doing,
and I will not do

1709
01:35:48,241 --> 01:35:50,471
throughout these
entire broadcasts.

1710
01:35:50,544 --> 01:35:52,671
You're quoting me
out of context,

1711
01:35:52,746 --> 01:35:54,941
out of order.
And I might add,

1712
01:35:55,015 --> 01:35:57,347
I have participated
in all these interviews

1713
01:35:57,417 --> 01:35:59,214
without a single note
in front of me.

1714
01:35:59,286 --> 01:36:00,776
Well, it is your life,
Mr. President.

1715
01:36:00,854 --> 01:36:01,980
Now, you've always maintained

1716
01:36:02,055 --> 01:36:04,956
that you knew nothing
about any of this
until March 21.

1717
01:36:05,025 --> 01:36:08,586
But in February,
your personal lawyer
came to Washington

1718
01:36:08,662 --> 01:36:11,722
to start the raising
of $219,000

1719
01:36:11,798 --> 01:36:13,789
of hush money to be
paid to the burglars.

1720
01:36:13,867 --> 01:36:16,802
Now, do you seriously
expect us to believe

1721
01:36:16,870 --> 01:36:18,462
that you had
no knowledge of that?

1722
01:36:18,538 --> 01:36:21,837
None. I believed
the money was for
humanitarian purposes.

1723
01:36:21,908 --> 01:36:24,502
To help
disadvantaged people
with their defenses.

1724
01:36:24,578 --> 01:36:28,378
Well, it was being delivered
on the tops of phone booths
with aliases,

1725
01:36:28,448 --> 01:36:30,678
and at airports
by people with gloves on.

1726
01:36:30,750 --> 01:36:32,877
That's not normally
the way lawyers' fees
are delivered, is it?

1727
01:36:32,953 --> 01:36:35,478
Look,
I have made statements
to this effect before.

1728
01:36:35,555 --> 01:36:37,750
All that was Haldeman
and Ehrlichman's business.

1729
01:36:37,824 --> 01:36:39,951
I knew nothing.
Okay, fine. Fine!

1730
01:36:40,026 --> 01:36:41,323
You made a conclusion there.

1731
01:36:41,394 --> 01:36:42,986
I stated my view,
now let's move on.

1732
01:36:43,063 --> 01:36:44,155
Let's get on to
the rest of it.

1733
01:36:44,230 --> 01:36:45,254
No, hold on.
No, hold on.

1734
01:36:45,332 --> 01:36:46,321
No, I don't
want to talk...

1735
01:36:46,399 --> 01:36:48,128
If Haldeman and Ehrlichman
were the ones
really responsible,

1736
01:36:48,201 --> 01:36:50,999
when you subsequently
found out about it,

1737
01:36:51,071 --> 01:36:53,130
why didn't you
call the police
and have them arrested?

1738
01:36:53,206 --> 01:36:55,231
Isn't that just
a cover-up of another kind?

1739
01:36:55,308 --> 01:36:56,969
Yeah, maybe I should
have done that.
Maybe I should have.

1740
01:36:57,043 --> 01:36:58,806
Just called the feds
into my office

1741
01:36:58,878 --> 01:37:01,005
and said, "Hey,
there's the two men.

1742
01:37:01,081 --> 01:37:02,548
"Haul them
down to the dock,

1743
01:37:02,616 --> 01:37:04,709
"fingerprint them
and then throw them
in the can."

1744
01:37:04,784 --> 01:37:05,910
I'm not made that way.

1745
01:37:05,986 --> 01:37:08,978
These men,
Haldeman, Ehrlichman,
I knew their families.

1746
01:37:09,055 --> 01:37:10,920
I knew them since
they were just kids.

1747
01:37:10,991 --> 01:37:12,288
Yeah, but you know,
politically,

1748
01:37:12,359 --> 01:37:15,260
the pressure on me
to let them go,
that became overwhelming!

1749
01:37:15,328 --> 01:37:18,161
So I did it.
I cut off one arm,

1750
01:37:18,231 --> 01:37:20,961
then I cut off the other,
and I'm not a good butcher!

1751
01:37:21,034 --> 01:37:23,901
And I have always maintained
what they were doing,

1752
01:37:23,970 --> 01:37:26,234
what we were all doing,
was not criminal.

1753
01:37:26,306 --> 01:37:27,864
Look,
when you're in office,

1754
01:37:27,941 --> 01:37:31,206
you gotta do
a lot of things sometimes
that are not always,

1755
01:37:31,277 --> 01:37:34,838
in the strictest sense
of the law, legal,
but you do them

1756
01:37:34,914 --> 01:37:37,144
because they're in
the greater interests
of the nation!

1757
01:37:37,217 --> 01:37:38,912
Right. Wait, just so
I understand correctly,

1758
01:37:38,985 --> 01:37:41,715
are you really saying
that in certain situations,

1759
01:37:41,788 --> 01:37:44,780
the President can decide
whether it's in the best
interests of the nation

1760
01:37:44,858 --> 01:37:46,917
and then do something illegal?

1761
01:37:46,993 --> 01:37:51,896
I'm saying that when
the President does it,
that means it's not illegal.

1762
01:37:54,267 --> 01:37:55,734
I'm sorry?

1763
01:37:55,802 --> 01:37:57,667
That's what I believe.

1764
01:37:58,638 --> 01:38:00,071
Oh, my God.

1765
01:38:05,011 --> 01:38:09,914
But I realize
no one else
shares that view.

1766
01:38:11,985 --> 01:38:16,979
So, in that case,
will you accept, then,

1767
01:38:17,190 --> 01:38:19,715
to clear the air
once and for all,

1768
01:38:20,193 --> 01:38:22,388
that you were part
of a cover-up

1769
01:38:22,462 --> 01:38:25,898
and that you did
break the law?

1770
01:38:35,275 --> 01:38:37,573
- Oh, my God, we got him.
<i>- I...</i>

1771
01:38:37,977 --> 01:38:38,841
Shit!

1772
01:38:40,914 --> 01:38:42,347
Okay, let's take
a break there.

1773
01:38:42,415 --> 01:38:43,814
What the fuck
is going on?

1774
01:38:44,284 --> 01:38:45,478
Cut it. Cut it.

1775
01:38:45,552 --> 01:38:46,541
Excuse me?
Shut it down.

1776
01:38:46,686 --> 01:38:47,710
Shut it down now.

1777
01:38:47,787 --> 01:38:50,688
<i>That's not my call. You're gonna
have to talk to the director.</i>

1778
01:38:50,757 --> 01:38:52,247
- He's in that truck out there.
- Get him in here.

1779
01:38:52,325 --> 01:38:54,088
<i>Listen, we have
an issue in here.</i>

1780
01:38:54,160 --> 01:38:55,923
Jack, what are you doing?
A break?

1781
01:38:55,995 --> 01:38:57,087
Change the tapes.

1782
01:38:57,163 --> 01:38:58,687
David, can I talk to you
for a minute, please?

1783
01:38:58,765 --> 01:39:00,255
What the hell is
going on, Jack?

1784
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:01,890
He was about to blow
and you know it.

1785
01:39:01,968 --> 01:39:04,061
Fellas, this is
a critical moment
in his life.

1786
01:39:04,137 --> 01:39:05,195
You realize we could
sue you for this?

1787
01:39:05,271 --> 01:39:07,671
You have
deliberately sabotaged
the interview, Jack.

1788
01:39:07,741 --> 01:39:08,765
Look, we're all
in this together.

1789
01:39:08,842 --> 01:39:09,831
I'm sure we can
find a solution.

1790
01:39:09,909 --> 01:39:12,878
<i>A solution? What the hell are you
talking about? It's an interview!</i>

1791
01:39:12,946 --> 01:39:14,243
<i>Bob, may I remind you...</i>

1792
01:39:14,314 --> 01:39:15,941
<i>This is a breach of contract.
We could sue.</i>

1793
01:39:19,319 --> 01:39:21,446
For heaven's sake, Jim.
Why don't you
give him a week off?

1794
01:39:21,521 --> 01:39:22,510
Give him a year off!

1795
01:39:22,589 --> 01:39:23,851
Give him a fucking massage!

1796
01:39:23,923 --> 01:39:26,084
<i>Watch your language,
for crying out loud.</i>

1797
01:39:41,307 --> 01:39:45,300
What'd you do?
Throw in the towel, Jack?

1798
01:39:46,679 --> 01:39:48,670
Did you take pity on me?

1799
01:39:51,117 --> 01:39:52,880
Sir, I just felt that

1800
01:39:54,387 --> 01:39:58,721
if you were going
to make some kind of
emotional disclosure,

1801
01:39:58,792 --> 01:40:02,023
that we should
just take a moment

1802
01:40:02,095 --> 01:40:04,859
to think it through,
sketch it out.

1803
01:40:05,832 --> 01:40:08,699
I just want to
impress upon you

1804
01:40:08,768 --> 01:40:11,396
how crucially important
this moment is

1805
01:40:12,238 --> 01:40:16,504
and how many potentially
devastating consequences

1806
01:40:16,576 --> 01:40:18,942
unplanned emotional
disclosures could have.

1807
01:40:19,012 --> 01:40:20,240
I know.

1808
01:40:21,381 --> 01:40:24,976
But to go on and carry on
denying it all...

1809
01:40:46,573 --> 01:40:48,564
I appreciate the gesture.

1810
01:40:54,447 --> 01:40:56,472
We ought to call it a snafu.

1811
01:41:06,392 --> 01:41:07,950
Jack, are we on?

1812
01:41:10,864 --> 01:41:12,456
We're on.
Okay, he's had plenty
of time to cook up

1813
01:41:12,532 --> 01:41:14,830
some sort of
slippery new bullshit,
so stay on your toes.

1814
01:41:14,901 --> 01:41:18,462
Listen, it's gonna be fine.
Pick up where you left off.

1815
01:41:57,543 --> 01:41:59,841
Thirty seconds, everyone.

1816
01:42:11,491 --> 01:42:13,721
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

1817
01:42:18,965 --> 01:42:24,665
David? Four, three,
two, and...

1818
01:42:25,905 --> 01:42:27,566
Mr. President,
we were talking about

1819
01:42:27,640 --> 01:42:30,302
the period
March 21 to April 30,

1820
01:42:30,376 --> 01:42:34,540
and the mistakes
you made, and so on,
and I was wondering

1821
01:42:36,849 --> 01:42:40,307
would you go
further than "mistakes"?

1822
01:42:40,386 --> 01:42:44,152
The word that
seems not enough
for people to understand.

1823
01:42:46,426 --> 01:42:49,361
Well, what word
would you express?

1824
01:42:57,370 --> 01:42:58,928
My goodness.

1825
01:43:03,776 --> 01:43:05,038
All right.

1826
01:43:06,245 --> 01:43:09,180
Since you've asked me,
I think there
are three things

1827
01:43:09,248 --> 01:43:12,342
that people would
like to hear you say.

1828
01:43:12,418 --> 01:43:16,855
One, that there was
probably more than mistakes.

1829
01:43:16,923 --> 01:43:19,858
There was wrongdoing.

1830
01:43:19,926 --> 01:43:22,759
And, yes, it might
have been a crime, too.

1831
01:43:24,063 --> 01:43:29,365
Secondly, that "I did
abuse the power
I had as President."

1832
01:43:31,104 --> 01:43:34,005
And thirdly,
"I put the American people

1833
01:43:34,073 --> 01:43:36,906
"through two years
of needless agony,

1834
01:43:37,844 --> 01:43:41,473
"and I apologize for that."
And I know
how difficult it is

1835
01:43:41,914 --> 01:43:45,179
for anyone, especially you,

1836
01:43:46,586 --> 01:43:50,454
but I think the people
need to hear it.

1837
01:43:50,523 --> 01:43:53,356
And I think that
unless you say it,

1838
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:57,996
you're going to be haunted
for the rest of your life.

1839
01:44:01,801 --> 01:44:07,797
Well, it's true.
I made mistakes,
horrendous ones,

1840
01:44:09,575 --> 01:44:12,840
ones that were not
worthy of a president,

1841
01:44:14,847 --> 01:44:17,748
ones that did not
meet the standards
of excellence

1842
01:44:17,817 --> 01:44:21,617
that I always dreamed of
as a young boy.

1843
01:44:21,687 --> 01:44:27,353
But, if you remember,
it was a difficult time.

1844
01:44:28,394 --> 01:44:32,387
I was caught up
in a five-front war

1845
01:44:32,899 --> 01:44:36,596
against a partisan media,
a partisan House of Congress,

1846
01:44:36,669 --> 01:44:39,365
a partisan Ervin Committee.

1847
01:44:40,873 --> 01:44:44,639
But, yes, I will admit
there were times

1848
01:44:44,710 --> 01:44:47,873
I did not fully meet
that responsibility

1849
01:44:47,947 --> 01:44:52,714
and I was involved
in a cover-up,
as you call it.

1850
01:44:53,386 --> 01:44:57,379
And for all those mistakes
I have a very deep regret.

1851
01:45:01,160 --> 01:45:04,891
No one can know
what it's like to resign
the presidency.

1852
01:45:06,899 --> 01:45:07,991
Now,

1853
01:45:09,769 --> 01:45:14,502
if you want me to get down
on the floor and grovel...

1854
01:45:15,608 --> 01:45:18,099
No! Never!

1855
01:45:19,812 --> 01:45:22,178
I still insist they were
mistakes of the heart.

1856
01:45:22,248 --> 01:45:23,806
They were not
mistakes of the head.

1857
01:45:23,883 --> 01:45:27,580
But they were my mistakes.
I don't blame anybody.

1858
01:45:28,721 --> 01:45:30,780
I brought myself down.

1859
01:45:32,892 --> 01:45:37,556
I gave them a sword,
and they stuck it in,

1860
01:45:37,630 --> 01:45:41,259
and they twisted it
with relish.

1861
01:45:42,268 --> 01:45:46,534
And I guess if I'd
been in their place,
I'd have done the same thing.

1862
01:45:46,839 --> 01:45:49,239
And the American people?

1863
01:46:08,227 --> 01:46:09,956
I let them down.

1864
01:46:12,598 --> 01:46:14,862
I let down my friends.

1865
01:46:17,703 --> 01:46:22,402
I let down the country.

1866
01:46:26,279 --> 01:46:27,940
And worst of all,

1867
01:46:31,450 --> 01:46:34,248
I let down
our system of government.

1868
01:46:35,855 --> 01:46:38,289
And the dreams of
all those young people

1869
01:46:38,357 --> 01:46:40,291
that ought to get
into government,

1870
01:46:40,359 --> 01:46:44,625
but now they think,
"It's all too corrupt,"
and the rest.

1871
01:46:46,032 --> 01:46:47,124
Yeah.

1872
01:46:53,139 --> 01:46:55,699
I let the American
people down,

1873
01:47:00,112 --> 01:47:03,275
and I'm gonna have to
carry that burden with me

1874
01:47:04,884 --> 01:47:06,909
for the rest of my life.

1875
01:47:18,631 --> 01:47:21,031
My political life is over.

1876
01:47:48,928 --> 01:47:53,160
You know, the first
and greatest sin
or deception of television

1877
01:47:53,232 --> 01:47:56,690
is that it simplifies,
it diminishes,

1878
01:47:57,003 --> 01:48:01,463
<i>great, complex ideas,</i>
<i>tranches of time.</i>

1879
01:48:02,275 --> 01:48:06,473
<i>Whole careers become reduced</i>
<i>to a single snapshot.</i>

1880
01:48:07,446 --> 01:48:09,641
At first, I couldn't
understand why

1881
01:48:09,715 --> 01:48:12,081
Bob Zelnick was
quite as euphoric

1882
01:48:12,151 --> 01:48:14,346
<i>as he was after</i>
<i>the interviews,</i>

1883
01:48:17,189 --> 01:48:20,955
<i>or why John Birt felt</i>
<i>moved to strip naked</i>

1884
01:48:21,027 --> 01:48:23,894
<i>and rush into</i>
<i>the ocean to celebrate.</i>

1885
01:48:23,963 --> 01:48:28,662
But that was before
I really understood

1886
01:48:28,734 --> 01:48:31,532
<i>the reductive power</i>
<i>of the close-up.</i>

1887
01:48:31,604 --> 01:48:35,472
Because David had
succeeded on that final day

1888
01:48:35,541 --> 01:48:37,338
in getting,
for a fleeting moment,

1889
01:48:37,410 --> 01:48:38,934
what no investigative
journalist,

1890
01:48:39,011 --> 01:48:42,708
no state prosecutor,
no judiciary committee

1891
01:48:42,782 --> 01:48:45,945
or political enemy
had managed to get.

1892
01:48:46,185 --> 01:48:48,551
<i>Richard Nixon's face,</i>

1893
01:48:48,621 --> 01:48:54,287
<i>swollen and ravaged</i>
<i>by Ioneliness,</i>
<i>self-Ioathing and defeat.</i>

1894
01:48:55,728 --> 01:48:59,425
<i>The rest of the project</i>
<i>and its failings would</i>
<i>not only be forgotten,</i>

1895
01:48:59,498 --> 01:49:01,762
<i>they would totally</i>
<i>cease to exist.</i>

1896
01:49:09,475 --> 01:49:12,035
<i>Who came out on top,
Mr. President?</i>

1897
01:49:31,797 --> 01:49:34,163
Is this what you
call a dachshund?

1898
01:49:34,233 --> 01:49:35,359
Mmm-hmm.

1899
01:49:43,843 --> 01:49:45,174
Very sweet.

1900
01:50:16,175 --> 01:50:19,201
The Nixon/Frost interviews
were wildly successful.

1901
01:50:19,278 --> 01:50:21,838
I think they attracted
the largest audience
for a news program

1902
01:50:21,914 --> 01:50:23,609
in the history of
American television.

1903
01:50:23,682 --> 01:50:26,810
<i>David was on</i>
<i>the cover of</i> Time <i>magazine</i>
<i>and</i> Newsweek <i>magazine.</i>

1904
01:50:26,886 --> 01:50:28,148
<i>And even the political</i>
<i>press corps,</i>

1905
01:50:28,220 --> 01:50:29,414
<i>the hard-bitten</i>
<i>political press corps,</i>

1906
01:50:29,488 --> 01:50:32,457
<i>called David up with</i>
<i>messages of contrition</i>
<i>and congratulation.</i>

1907
01:50:32,525 --> 01:50:34,720
David, I want to
say congratulations.

1908
01:50:34,827 --> 01:50:36,658
The interviews?

1909
01:50:36,729 --> 01:50:40,165
No, I didn't watch them.
I couldn't.

1910
01:50:42,535 --> 01:50:43,524
Hey.

1911
01:50:45,404 --> 01:50:46,564
Hello.

1912
01:50:54,313 --> 01:50:57,544
I believe David saw
the former President
just one more time.

1913
01:50:57,616 --> 01:50:59,447
Before he left California
for London again,

1914
01:50:59,518 --> 01:51:02,112
he drove down
to San Clemente
to say goodbye.

1915
01:51:14,300 --> 01:51:17,531
Hey, Mr. Frost.
It's nice to see you.

1916
01:51:18,471 --> 01:51:20,029
Miss Cushing.
Hello.

1917
01:51:21,207 --> 01:51:23,334
Please excuse
my golf outfit.

1918
01:51:23,409 --> 01:51:26,378
It's the official
uniform of the retired.

1919
01:51:27,813 --> 01:51:29,303
Are you on your way home?

1920
01:51:29,381 --> 01:51:30,575
Yes.

1921
01:51:30,649 --> 01:51:35,746
Into a bright new dawn
of fresh enterprises
and challenges, eh?

1922
01:51:35,821 --> 01:51:37,049
Well, let's hope so.

1923
01:51:37,122 --> 01:51:38,316
Good for you.

1924
01:51:38,390 --> 01:51:41,325
I didn't catch
the interviews
as they went out,

1925
01:51:41,393 --> 01:51:45,022
but they tell me
that they were
a great success.

1926
01:51:45,097 --> 01:51:48,828
I gather the journalists
that were so positive

1927
01:51:48,901 --> 01:51:51,893
about you weren't
so kind to me.

1928
01:51:51,971 --> 01:51:54,963
Yes, I was sorry to see that.

1929
01:51:55,641 --> 01:51:57,905
There's no
condolences necessary.

1930
01:51:57,977 --> 01:52:00,537
I've grown to
expect nothing else
from those sons of whores.

1931
01:52:00,613 --> 01:52:02,308
Yeah.

1932
01:52:02,414 --> 01:52:05,577
Jeez, please forgive me,
Miss Cushing.

1933
01:52:05,985 --> 01:52:09,148
You know,
I would've said
"sons of bitches,"

1934
01:52:09,221 --> 01:52:11,849
but Manolo here
is a lover of dogs,

1935
01:52:11,924 --> 01:52:14,222
and he hates me
to defame animals.

1936
01:52:14,693 --> 01:52:16,320
Can I get something
for somebody?

1937
01:52:16,395 --> 01:52:18,829
Yes. Would you like
some tea or champagne?

1938
01:52:18,898 --> 01:52:22,129
Hey, you know,
we got that caviar
the Shah of Iran sent me.

1939
01:52:22,201 --> 01:52:23,259
No, thank you.
You sure?

1940
01:52:23,335 --> 01:52:24,632
Come on. It'll be
no trouble at all.

1941
01:52:24,703 --> 01:52:25,931
No, really, we must be...

1942
01:52:26,005 --> 01:52:29,702
Okay, fine, fine.
Thanks for coming by.

1943
01:52:32,778 --> 01:52:35,008
You were a worthy opponent.

1944
01:52:37,016 --> 01:52:38,176
Goodbye, Mr. President.

1945
01:52:38,250 --> 01:52:39,547
Bye-bye.

1946
01:52:39,618 --> 01:52:41,017
Goodbye, Mr. President.

1947
01:52:41,086 --> 01:52:42,110
Goodbye.

1948
01:52:43,856 --> 01:52:46,484
Oh, God!
I almost forgot. I...

1949
01:52:47,493 --> 01:52:53,398
I brought you a present,
those shoes you admired.

1950
01:52:53,699 --> 01:52:55,462
I brought you a pair.

1951
01:52:56,635 --> 01:52:59,627
Well, jeez. Thank you.

1952
01:53:04,343 --> 01:53:09,508
I'm touched. Safe trip, now.

1953
01:53:13,886 --> 01:53:19,620
Oh! Say, David, you think
I could speak to you,
privately, just for a minute?

1954
01:53:30,970 --> 01:53:33,564
Do you know those
parties of yours?

1955
01:53:33,639 --> 01:53:36,107
The ones that I read about
in all the papers?

1956
01:53:36,175 --> 01:53:38,905
Do you actually enjoy those?

1957
01:53:39,812 --> 01:53:41,177
Of course.

1958
01:53:42,715 --> 01:53:46,617
You got no idea how
fortunate that makes you.

1959
01:53:47,786 --> 01:53:52,086
You know?
Liking people,
and being liked.

1960
01:53:52,157 --> 01:53:56,821
Having that facility,
that lightness, that charm.

1961
01:53:58,297 --> 01:54:00,731
I don't have it.
I never did.

1962
01:54:01,533 --> 01:54:04,366
It kind of makes you wonder
why I chose a life

1963
01:54:04,436 --> 01:54:07,530
that hinged on being liked.

1964
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:11,241
I'm better suited
to a life of thought,

1965
01:54:11,310 --> 01:54:13,540
debate,
intellectual discipline.

1966
01:54:14,580 --> 01:54:15,808
Maybe we got it wrong.

1967
01:54:15,881 --> 01:54:17,746
Maybe you should have
been a politician

1968
01:54:17,816 --> 01:54:20,148
and I the rigorous
interviewer.

1969
01:54:20,786 --> 01:54:22,048
Maybe.

1970
01:54:23,489 --> 01:54:24,615
David.

1971
01:54:26,959 --> 01:54:30,417
Did I really
call you that night?

1972
01:54:32,765 --> 01:54:33,959
Yes.

1973
01:54:34,867 --> 01:54:38,701
Did we discuss
anything important?

1974
01:54:42,975 --> 01:54:44,442
Cheeseburgers.

1975
01:54:46,845 --> 01:54:48,403
Cheeseburgers?

1976
01:54:54,119 --> 01:54:55,609
Goodbye, sir.

1977
01:55:05,798 --> 01:55:07,959
<i>Well, New York,</i>
<i>London and Sydney</i>

1978
01:55:08,033 --> 01:55:10,467
<i>welcomed David</i>
<i>back with open arms,</i>

1979
01:55:10,536 --> 01:55:12,265
<i>as did his friends</i>
<i>and investors,</i>

1980
01:55:12,337 --> 01:55:14,805
<i>who've made a fortune</i>
<i>from these interviews.</i>

1981
01:55:14,873 --> 01:55:16,465
<i>He got back all of his shows.</i>

1982
01:55:16,542 --> 01:55:18,806
<i>He even got back</i>
<i>his table at Sardi's.</i>

1983
01:55:19,578 --> 01:55:20,943
<i>As for Richard Nixon,</i>

1984
01:55:21,013 --> 01:55:22,241
<i>well, he certainly</i>
<i>never achieved</i>

1985
01:55:22,314 --> 01:55:25,010
<i>the rehabilitation</i>
<i>he so desperately craved.</i>

1986
01:55:25,084 --> 01:55:27,245
His most lasting legacy

1987
01:55:27,319 --> 01:55:30,117
is that today
any political wrongdoing

1988
01:55:30,222 --> 01:55:33,020
is immediately given
the suffix "gate."
