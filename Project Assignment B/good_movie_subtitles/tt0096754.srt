1
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,500
60 knots? No way, Barnes.

2
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,520
The Reds don't have anything that fast.

3
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,160
Checked it twice. I mean,
it's a real unique signature.

4
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,050
No cavitation. No reactor noise.

5
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,050
It doesn't even sound like screws.

6
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,000
What the hell is it?

7
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,850
I'll tell you what it's not.
It's not one of ours.

8
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:48,350
Sir, contact changing to heading 2-1-4.

9
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,560
Speed...

10
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,790
80 knots.

11
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,690
80 knots.

12
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:00,500
Still diving. Depth: 900. Still diving. Depth: 900 feet.

13
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,040
Port clearance: 150 feet from the cliff wall, sir.

14
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,600
It's getting tight in here.

15
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:09,130
We can still give him a haircut.

16
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,750
Helm, come right to... 0-6-9.

17
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,330
Down 5 degrees.

18
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,810
Coming right, 0-6-9. Down 5 degrees. Aye.

19
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,740
Port side clearance: 120 feet. Narrowing 75.

20
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,350
Sir, we have a proximity warning light.

21
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,910
It's too damn close! We gotta back off.

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,100
Sir, range to contact: 200.

23
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:30,910
Contact just jinked to bearing 2-6-0
and accelerated to...

24
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,900
...to 130 knots, sir.

25
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,450
Nothin' goes 130.

26
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,030
Sir, range to contact: 100 yards.

27
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,180
80 yards, sir!

28
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,160
60!

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,850
It's turbulence! We're in its wake!

30
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,100
Helm, all stop! Full right rudder.

31
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,970
Hydraulic failure. Planes not responding, sir.

32
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,030
Auxiliary power. Monitors back.

33
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,840
Hydraulics restored, sir.

34
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,700
Oh, my God!

35
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:18,840
Fire in sonar!

36
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,650
Collision alarm! Collision alarm!

37
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,100
Fire control to sonar!

38
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,730
Let's get outta here!

39
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:37,150
- Lighten her up, Charlie!
- Port torpedo room is flooded, sir!

40
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,400
Blow all tanks!
Blow all the tanks! Blow everything!

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,410
All back full!

42
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,950
Answering, all back full!

43
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,850
Give me a damage report! What's our depth?

44
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,880
Passing 1,400, sir.

45
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,050
Main forward tanks are ruptured!

46
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,560
Still descending, sir!

47
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,250
1,450.

48
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,860
Passing 1,500, sir.

49
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,420
Still descending.

50
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:15,900
- We're too deep to pump auxiliaries.
- Passing 1,550, still descending sir.

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,740
- We're losin' her!
- Passing 1,600, sir...

52
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:21,650
- ...and still descending!
- Launch the buoy.

53
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,000
- Passing 1,700, sir.
- Launching!

54
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,500
Come on! Give me your hand!

55
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,690
Get the door closed!

56
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,750
Benthic Explorer, Salvor 1 on final. Over.

57
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,450
Copy you, Salvor 1.
This is Benthic Explorer.

58
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,140
You're cleared to land.

59
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,650
Hey! They're coming.

60
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:43,210
This... could get pretty ugly.

61
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:44,830
Yeah.

62
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,870
Does not look good at all.

63
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,620
Oh, no. Look who's with them.

64
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,200
The queen bitch of the universe.

65
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,450
Sonny, how you doin'?

66
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,960
I've got 2 more welds on this bypass valve.

67
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,020
No light from the surface.

68
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,400
- How deep are they?
- McBride?

69
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,560
1,700 feet.

70
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:43,510
- I need them to go below 2,000.
- No problem. They can do that.

71
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:50,050
So that's it? You just cheerfully turn
the whole thing over to the goon squad?

72
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:53,380
Look, I was told to cooperate.
I'm cooperating.

73
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,710
Kirkhill, you're pathetic.

74
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,870
Get Brigman on the line.

75
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,040
Deepcore, this is Benthic.

76
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,950
Man, if Bud goes along with this...

77
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,650
...they're gonna have to shoot her
with a tranquilizer gun.

78
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,330
- Roger.
- Hippy, get me Bud.

79
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,750
Catfish, get them old bones up here
and give me a hand.

80
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,250
Hang on. I'll be up there in a second.

81
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,000
Hey, you guys are milkin' that job.

82
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:35,150
Yeah, it's just because we love freezing
our butts off out here for you so much.

83
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,450
- Bring me another hammer!

84
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,980
- Hey, Bud!
- Yeah!?

85
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,150
Hippy's on the bitch box!

86
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,750
It's a call from topside.
That new company man.

87
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,900
- Kirkhill?
- Yeah.

88
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,300
That guy don't know his butt from a rat hole.

89
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:59,600
Perry, do me a favor, square away this mud hose
and get rid of some of these empty sacks.

90
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,050
- This place is starting to look like my apartment.
- You got it, boss!

91
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:09,800
- Bud, pick up the topside line. Urgent.
- I'm coming, I'm coming!

92
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,300
Jeez, keep your pantyhose on!

93
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,150
Brigman here.

94
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,140
Yeah, Kirkhill. What's goin' on?

95
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,310
Yeah, I'm calm.

96
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,440
I'm a calm person. Is there some reason
why I shouldn't be calm?

97
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,650
WHAT!?

98
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,420
All right, I'm on last feed now.

99
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:50,820
Hey can you get that goddamn hippy shit music
off the comm line, please?

100
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,320
I'm almost done with the shut-off valve.

101
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,600
Sonny, I'm right behind you
with the next fitting.

102
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,250
Hang on a second.

103
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,250
- OK, give it to me.
- Here you go.

104
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,300
Thanks, sweetie.

105
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,500
All divers, drop what you're doin'.
Everybody out of the pool.

106
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,600
I mean everybody right now.
Sonny, One Night, let's go.

107
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,080
Damn it. We just got out here.

108
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,910
There was a time when I woulda asked why.

109
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,400
- Get a move on!
- Shit, woman!

110
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:46,100
Deepcore, Deepcore.
This is Flatbed preparing to surface.

111
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,750
Roger, Flatbed. Come on up.

112
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,900
All rig personnel assemble at the moon pool.

113
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,900
Everybody get to sub bay. ASAP.

114
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,780
Come on. Let's get his hat off.

115
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,550
- Take it off.
- What the hell's goin' on?

116
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,990
- How come we got recalled?
- The hell if I know.

117
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,150
I got it.

118
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,400
- What's the drift, partner? Why are we up?
- Just follow standard procedure.

119
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:17,320
Flog your dog till somebody
tells you what's happenin'.

120
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,500
- What's the story, boss?
- Folks, listen up!

121
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:25,010
We just been told to shut down the hole
and prepare to move the rig.

122
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,850
- Oh, shit!
- What?

123
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:32,350
We've received an invitation to, um,
cooperate in a matter of national security.

124
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,250
Now you know as much as I do.

125
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:38,410
Get your gear off and get to control.
We've got a briefing in 10 minutes.

126
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,370
Come on, come on! Let's move it!

127
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:45,400
At 09:22 local time today,
an American nuclear submarine...

128
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:49,000
...the USS Montana,
with 156 men aboard, went down...

129
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,650
- ...about 22 miles from here.
- Damn!

130
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:55,550
There's been no contact with the sub since
then. The cause of the incident is not known.

131
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,850
Your company has authorized
the navy's use of this facility...

132
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:03,510
...for a rescue operation
code-named Operation Salvor.

133
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,600
- You want us to search for the sub?
- No. We know where it is.

134
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,380
But she's in 2,000 feet of water
and we can't reach her.

135
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:14,700
We need divers to enter the sub
and search for survivors, if any.

136
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,100
Don't you have your own stuff for this kind of thing?

137
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:20,600
By the time we get our submersibles here,
the storm will be on us.

138
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:25,150
You can get your rig in and be on site
in 15 hours. That makes you our best option.

139
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,480
Why should we risk our butts
for something like this?

140
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:32,000
I have been authorized
to offer you all special bonuses...

141
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,500
...equivalent to 3 times normal dive pay.

142
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,670
Yes, sir, buddy!

143
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,250
For triple time, I'd eat Beany!

144
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,600
Set me on fire
and put me out with horse piss.

145
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,300
Look I don't know what kind of deal
you made with the company...

146
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:48,400
- ...but my people are not qualified for this. We're oil workers.
- This is a paycheck!

147
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,900
Shut up! Hold it down.

148
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,360
This is Lieutenant Coffey.

149
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,360
He will transfer down to you with
a SEAL team and supervise the operation.

150
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,650
You can send down whoever you like,
but I'm the tool pusher on this rig.

151
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:04,270
When it comes to the safety of these people,
there's me and then God.

152
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,760
Understand? If things get dicey,

153
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,930
I'm pulling the plug.

154
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,430
I think we're all
on the same wavelength, Brigman.

155
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,800
Now, let's get the wellhead uncoupled,
shall we?

156
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,150
All right let's get ready to meet.

157
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,180
Let's take it about 5 degrees left, all right?

158
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,960
Roger. 5 degrees left, Bud.

159
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:06,580
Plot these numbers to our position.
I need to know when the leading edge will hit.

160
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:10,450
Well, it's official sports fans.
They're calling it Hurricane Frederick.

161
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,300
And it's gonna be making our lives...

162
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,980
- ...real interesting in a few hours.
- Fred huh?

163
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:19,930
I don't know, man. I think hurricanes
should be named after women, don't you?

164
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,750
- I can't believe you're letting them do this.
- Hi, Lins!

165
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,090
I thought you were in Houston.

166
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:37,100
I was. Now I'm here.

167
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,250
- Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
- Wasn't up to me.

168
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:44,910
We were that close to proving
a submersible drilling platform could work.

169
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,100
- I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
- Your rig?

170
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,750
- My rig. I designed the damn thing.
- Benthic Petroleum paid for it.

171
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,000
So as long as they're holding the pink slip,
I go where they tell me.

172
00:13:55,650 --> 00:14:00,350
I had a lot riding on this. They bought you,
didn't they? More like rented you cheap!

173
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,300
I'm switchin' off now.

174
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,150
Bye-bye.

175
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,200
Oh, OK. Virgil, you wiener!
You never could stand up to a fight!

176
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,750
Bye-bye.

177
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,350
Virgil?

178
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,700
God, I hate that bitch!

179
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,650
Probably shouldn't have married her,
then, huh?

180
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,500
Get it stable!

181
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,600
Roger Cab 3. You're clear to launch.

182
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,970
Hang on, gentlemen.

183
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,600
Touchdown! Crowd goes wild!

184
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,210
Explorer, this is Cab 3. We are styling.

185
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,500
- How you boys doin' back there?
- Great.

186
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,150
Explorer, this is Cab 3.
Starting our descent along the umbilical.

187
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:05,250
- Roger that, Cab 3. Good luck.
- Luck is not a factor.

188
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,350
I got a white line fever, baby.

189
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,550
Yeah, I heard that.

190
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,350
Deepcore, Deepcore.

191
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:41,350
- This is Cab 3 on final approach.
- Roger, Cab 3. Is that you, Lindsey?

192
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,900
None other.

193
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,150
Oh, no!

194
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,700
Howdy, boys!

195
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,150
Hey, Lindsey!

196
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,550
I'll be damned!

197
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,950
Y'all shouldn't be down here, sweet thing.
You might ruin your stockings.

198
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:24,650
The bad news is we got 8 hours
in this can blowin' down.

199
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,000
And the worst news is
it's gonna take us 3 weeks...

200
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:33,250
- ...to decompress later.
- We've all been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.

201
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,300
Just don't call me that, OK? I hate that.

202
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:40,550
All right. What would you like us to call you?

203
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,370
Sir?

204
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:47,200
There we go!

205
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,350
Y'all start equalizin'... now!

206
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:58,550
Let's watch each other closely
for signs of HPNS.

207
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,750
High Pressure Nervous Syndrome.
Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.

208
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,130
- Nausea, increased excitability...
- Disorientation.

209
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,970
And a partridge in a pear tree.

210
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,550
About 1 person in 20 can't handle it.
They just go buggo.

211
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,150
Look, they've all made runs to this depth.

212
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,300
- They checked out.
- I understand that.

213
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,850
What I'm saying is it's impossible to predict...

214
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,420
- ...just who's susceptible.
- They checked out.

215
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,850
- These guys the SEALs?
- Yeah.

216
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,310
Those guys ain't so tough.
I've fought guys plenty tougher than them.

217
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,960
Now we get to hear
how you could have been a contender?

218
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,150
Hey! Hey!

219
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,350
- You see this?
- Yeah.

220
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,650
They used to call this the hammer.

221
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,100
Y'all done to a turn and ready to serve.

222
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:56,950
Everybody OK?

223
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:04,200
- They're really very sweet.
- Yeah.

224
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:07,990
Hey! I don't remember putting a wall here.
How you doin', Jammer?

225
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,400
- Pretty good. How are you, little lady?
- I'm OK.

226
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,250
- I want a full check on their gear.
- Yes sir.

227
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:23,500
- These guys are about as much fun as a tax audit.
- Got that right.

228
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,750
Hippy, you're gonna give that rat a disease.

229
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,150
Hi, Lins!

230
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:50,050
Well, well. Mrs. Brigman.

231
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,920
Not for long.

232
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:57,500
You never did like being called that, did you?

233
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,850
Not even when it meant something.

234
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:07,050
- Is that One Night in Flatbed?
- Yeah. Who else? Here. Say hi.

235
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,300
- Hey, One Night. It's Lindsey.
- Oh, hi, Lindsey.

236
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:24,250
OK Bud obstacle avoidance is showin' a rise
out about 100 meters. What do you wanna do?

237
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,350
- Copy Bud.
- You know I can't believe you
were dumb enough to come down here.

238
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,900
Now you're stuck here for the storm.

239
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:34,650
- That was dumb, hot rod. Real dumb.
- I didn't come down here to fight with you.

240
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,500
So what are you doin' down here hot rod?

241
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:46,850
You need me. Nobody knows
the systems on this rig better than I do.

242
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:51,500
Once you're disconnected from The Explorer, you guys are on
your own for however long this storm lasts.

243
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:55,300
I mean what if something was to happen
after the surface support clears off?
What would you have done?

244
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:59,500
Wow, you're right. Us poor dumb old boys
might've had to think for ourselves.

245
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,250
It could've been a disaster.

246
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,400
- You wanna know what I think?
- Jesus! Look where this thing is set.

247
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:10,350
- You wanna know what I think?
- Not particularly.

248
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:13,500
- I think you were worried about me.
- Then that must be it.

249
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:17,100
No, seriously. I think you were.
Come on. It's OK.

250
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,050
It's OK. You can admit it.

251
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:22,050
I was worried... about the rig.

252
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,560
I've got over 4 years
invested in this project.

253
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,800
Yeah, you only had 3 years
invested in me.

254
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,100
Well, you have to have priorities.

255
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,300
It's kinda messy, but, I guarantee you
it's the only bunk that won't be occupied.

256
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,000
You can get a couple of hours rest
before we get there.

257
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,550
What are you still wearing that for?

258
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,550
I don't know.

259
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,450
Divorce ain't final.

260
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,700
Forgot to take it off.

261
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,850
I haven't worn mine in months.

262
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,750
Yeah.

263
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:16,320
Well, 'what's his name' wouldn't like it.
The suit.

264
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,300
Do you always have to call him that?

265
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,860
The suit. Makes you sound like such a hick.

266
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,150
His name is Michael.

267
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:28,300
How is Michael anyway? Mr. Brooks Brothers.

268
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,250
Mr. BMW.

269
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,050
You still seeing him?

270
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,050
No.

271
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,150
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.

272
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,150
Terribly sorry. What happened?

273
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,800
Why are you doing this?
This is... this is none of your business!

274
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,650
It's not a part of your life any more.

275
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,500
I'll tell you what happened.

276
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:57,050
You woke up one morning
in those satin sheets...

277
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,450
...rolled over,
and there was this good-looking guy.

278
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,850
Well-groomed, expensive watch on.

279
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:06,600
And you realized,
"This guy never makes me laugh."

280
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:10,700
That's it, Bud. That's it!
Aren't you clever? Jesus! You're clever!

281
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,500
You know, you should start your own talk show or something!
Ask Dr. Bud.

282
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,250
'Advice to the Lovelorn from 300 Fathoms.'

283
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,550
Thank you. Thank you.

284
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,650
Oh, shit!

285
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:01,000
- Cuttin' you loose, Bud.
- OK, One Night. Stay clear.

286
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,400
We're settin' her down.

287
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,550
Touchdown!

288
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:14,850
This is us, sitting right on the edge
of the Cayman Trough.

289
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:20,400
This is the Montana.
300 meters away, 70 meters below us.

290
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,000
We think she slid down the wall
and now sits here on this outcropping.

291
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:30,000
So we're gonna have to drop
straight down... here and...

292
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,220
This tell us how much radiation we're gettin'?

293
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:35,800
Whoa whoa whoa! I'm not going near
no radiation! No way!

294
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:38,220
- Ah Hippy, you pussy.
- Yeah what good is the money...

295
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,400
...6 months later your dick drops off.

296
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:44,750
We'll take readings as we go.
If the reactor's breached...

297
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,460
...the warheads have released
any radioactive debris, we'll just back off.

298
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,620
- It's that simple.
- Oh, OK.

299
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:54,760
OK. Hippy's not going,
so, McWhirter, you can run Little Geek.

300
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:58,350
Oh goddamn it! You know
McWhirter can't run an ROV worth shit!

301
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,950
Then you'd better go.

302
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,750
I'll go.

303
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:06,050
What is your problem huh? On this dive...

304
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,050
...you'll do absolutely nothing
without direct orders from me.

305
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,150
And you'll follow those orders
without discussion. Is that clear?

306
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:18,200
All right, I want everyone to finish prep and
ready to get wet in 15 minutes.

307
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:24,000
- One of you guys gimme a hand loading Little Geek, OK?
- Let's get suited up.

308
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,440
Hey, guys, guys! Hold it a second.

309
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,600
Hold it!

310
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,500
Whoa!

311
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,750
Look uh...

312
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:41,600
...it's 3 am. These guys are running on
bad coffee and about 4 hours of sleep.

313
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,390
Maybe you could think about
cuttin' them some slack.

314
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:48,500
- I can't afford slack.
- Hey you come on my rig, you don't talk to me...

315
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:50,800
...you start ordering my people around.
It's not gonna work.

316
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:56,250
You gotta know how to handle these people.
We got a certain way of doing things around here.

317
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:00,550
Right now, I'm not interested in your way of doing
things. Just get your team ready to dive.

318
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:09,000
These guys have got no sense of humor.

319
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:15,670
Bud, do you know your hand is blue?

320
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,300
Finler, why don't you just shut up
and put your gear on?

321
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,350
Keep it coming.

322
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,900
- Hippy, throw me 1 of them cyalumes, please.
- Yeah sure.

323
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,050
- Good.
- Excuse me.

324
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:32,500
- What is all this stuff?
- Fluid Breathing System. We just got them.

325
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,900
- You use it when you go really deep.
- How deep?

326
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:38,850
- Deep.
- How deep?

327
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:40,950
It's classified.

328
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,550
Anyway you breathe liquid
so you can't get compressed.

329
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,990
- The pressure doesn't get you.
- You mean you got liquid in your lungs?

330
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,950
Oxygenated, fluorocarbon...

331
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,330
- ...emulsion.
- Bullshit!

332
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:54,950
Check this out.

333
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,750
- Can I borrow your rat?
- What are you doin'?

334
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,900
You're gonna... you're gonna kill her!

335
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:05,750
- It's OK. I've done this myself.
- Man! You're just drowning her?

336
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,400
She's gonna be fine.
I've breathed this myself.

337
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,500
- It's gonna be fine.
- No, man. She's gonna drown!

338
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:14,550
- Look, look! She's freaking out!
- Just goin' through a normal adjustment period.

339
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,250
Normal!? Does this look normal to you?
She's gonna drown!

340
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:19,300
He's taking the fluid into his lungs.

341
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:23,100
He's taking the fluid into his lungs.

342
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:29,600
There he goes. Still has a bit of anxiety here.

343
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:34,200
Now he's starting to relax.
He's breathing fine. See his chest moving?

344
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:38,390
- He's getting plenty of oxygen.
- Damn rat's breathing that shit.

345
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:43,800
That is, no bullshit, hands down,
the goddamndest thing I ever saw.

346
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:47,850
See the fluid's harder to push in and out than air.
It's a little more work to breathe.

347
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:51,010
But he's doing fine. He's diggin' it.

348
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:54,650
She's doin' it. She ain't diggin' it.
All right, let her out now!

349
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,950
- Now!
- OK. All right.

350
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,400
OK. Now we let the fluid drain from his lungs.

351
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,750
All right. Give her here. Give her here.

352
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,350
Here's your rat.

353
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,900
- See? He's fine!
- It's a she.

354
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,710
Going over the wall.

355
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,200
Coming to bearing 0-6-5.

356
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,450
Flatbed, you online?

357
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,900
10-4, Lindsey.
We read you loud and clear.

358
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,950
Starting our descent. Divers, how you doin'?

359
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,200
Everybody's OK so far.

360
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,600
Hang on, boys. It's all downhill from here.

361
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:37,050
- Hey, how deep's the drop-off here?
- This here's the bottomless pit, baby.

362
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,050
2 and a half miles straight down.

363
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:46,250
Cab 3, it's Bud. You on line?

364
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,150
Cab 3 check.

365
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,450
I'm right behind you.

366
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,000
Cab 1, do you see it yet?

367
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,900
Magnetometer's twitching,
but I don't see anything yet.

368
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,700
Hang on. I'm gonna test my strobes.

369
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,600
Cab 1, do you have a visual?

370
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,400
- Cab 1, do you copy?
- Uh yeah.

371
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,800
Roger that. Found it.

372
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:37,000
Cab 1, radiation readings?

373
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,950
Neutron counter's not showing much.

374
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:42,050
All right.
Just continue forward along the hull.

375
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:48,150
Copy that. Continuing forward.
You want me to get shots of everything, yes?

376
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,350
Roger that. Document as much as you can.

377
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,460
But, please, keep moving.
Remember, we're on a tight time line.

378
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,750
Copy that.

379
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:02,750
Coming up to the mid-ship's hatch.
Do you see it, Cab 3?

380
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,850
Yeah, roger. I got it.

381
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:11,600
- How do you want me?
- Just hold above it.

382
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,550
- Roger. Holding.
- OK. It's all yours, Lieutenant.

383
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,650
- All right, 'A Team.'
- Let's do it.

384
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,500
OK. Perry, Hippy.

385
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,800
- Let's get that R.O.V. launched.
- OK. We're on it, boss.

386
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,750
Go!

387
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,350
Little Geek is on the case.

388
00:30:56,550 --> 00:31:00,200
Monk here, sir.
We got the mid-ship’s outer hatch open.

389
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,800
Entering escape trunk.

390
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,800
Inner hatch looks intact.

391
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:17,600
It's flooded. All right. I'm gonna open her up.

392
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,700
OK. Get in there.

393
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,640
- Roger. Somebody get on that tether.
- Got it.

394
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,850
Sorry about this, little buddy, but better
you than me. You know what I mean?

395
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,900
Coffey, these are the missile hatches, right?

396
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:54,900
That's right. It looks like
a couple of the hatches have sprung.

397
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:58,950
Radiation's nominal.
Warheads must still be intact.

398
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,300
How many are there?

399
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,100
24 Trident missiles. 8 MIRVs per missile.

400
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,200
That's 192 warheads, Coffey.

401
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:09,600
How powerful are they?

402
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:14,600
Your MIRV is a tactical nuke.
50 kilotons nominal yield.

403
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:17,050
Say... 5 times Hiroshima.

404
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:21,550
Jesus Christ!

405
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,500
It's World War III in a can.

406
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,100
Let's knock off the chatter people.

407
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,100
OK. I'm headin' into the reactor compartment.

408
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:34,050
- Getting a reading?
- Uh it's twitching.

409
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:36,650
But it's below the line you said was safe.

410
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,580
All right. Let's get in there.

411
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,600
Flatbed, drop down starboard
of the sail and stay along the cliff edge.

412
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:54,400
OK. Copy that.

413
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,740
Keep heading for the bow.

414
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:14,200
OK, Flatbed. This looks good.

415
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:17,200
Just set it down here.

416
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,520
- We're solid.
- Let's go.

417
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,250
All right. Let's go.

418
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:39,800
OK. Let's just take it slow and easy goin' in.

419
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,200
Don't take any chances.

420
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:10,650
Where are we, Coffey?

421
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,550
This is the forward berthing compartment.
This way.

422
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:35,050
- You guys OK? Cat? Jammer?
- Right behind you, Bud.

423
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,900
Check your gauges.

424
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:39,340
How's your O2?

425
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:43,050
- I'm OK.
- Yeah, gauges are good.

426
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:44,550
OK.

427
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,300
16 minutes to go.

428
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,100
Jammer here. CO2 is up.

429
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,750
- Breathe slower, buddy.
- I'm OK.

430
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:11,900
Come on. Let's keep up.

431
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,500
All right, up this way to the control center.

432
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:45,600
It's jammed! Gimme a hand!

433
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:47,100
Get up here with that pry bar.

434
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,400
It's moving. Pull!

435
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,150
- Jesus!
- Oh God.

436
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:05,350
All right! We knew we were gonna see this.

437
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,550
Just move on.

438
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:12,660
- Jesus!
- Come on, Jammer. Let's go.

439
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:50,700
OK. Let's stay cool.

440
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,500
Everybody stay cool.

441
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:58,200
We can't help these guys,
but we might find somebody further in.

442
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,450
Stay here.

443
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,650
Hey, Jammer. You OK?

444
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,300
- How you guys doin'?
- I'm dealin'.

445
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:32,900
Triple time sounded like
a lot of money, Bud. It ain't.

446
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,850
We're here. Let's get it done, OK?

447
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:38,200
Brigman, take your men and continue aft.

448
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,900
Split up into 2 teams.

449
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,900
Come on. Let's get moving.
We head back in 14 minutes.

450
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,400
Let's go.

451
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:55,950
You OK, Jammer?

452
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,550
Yeah, I'm fine.

453
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,500
- What's this?
- Should be the missile launch control center.

454
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:10,550
- Don't touch anything.
- No, no, n-n-n-n-no.

455
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,500
This way.

456
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,550
I'm right behind you.

457
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,750
- Still with me, Jammer?
- Where are we?

458
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:42,950
Missile compartment.
Those are the launch tubes.

459
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,950
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

460
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:56,150
Hey, Jammer.

461
00:38:58,750 --> 00:38:59,400
Hey! Hey!

462
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:01,150
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! You OK?

463
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,150
Deep and slow, big guy.

464
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,500
- Deep and slow. Just breathe easy.
- Everybody's dead!

465
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,300
- They're all dead!
- OK. I'm taking you back out. Let's go.

466
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,600
No. I'm OK. I'm OK.

467
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,950
I just can't go any further in.

468
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:22,750
OK, Jammer. No problem.
You stay right here.

469
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:25,150
I've gotta check out this compartment,
all right?

470
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:30,050
We'll stay in voice contact.
You hold onto the end of this rope here.

471
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,350
You have any problem whatsoever,
you tug twice.

472
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:35,850
- I got it.
- Pull it hard. 5 more minutes.

473
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:38,450
Just relax, all right? You'll be OK.

474
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,050
- It's OK.
- Be right back.

475
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:27,750
You still readin' me OK, big guy?

476
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:29,800
Read you fine, Bud.

477
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:39,150
OK. Just a few more minutes.

478
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,900
There's a couple of compartments up ahead
that might have air.

479
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:45,650
- OK. No problem.
- We gotta be sure, right?

480
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,450
Hang on, Jammer. Just hold onto that...

481
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:56,950
Shit!

482
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:00,550
Bud? Bud can you hear me?

483
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:03,850
Bud? Bud?

484
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,150
Goddamn it!

485
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,200
Oh, Jesus!

486
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:53,950
Bud, is that you?

487
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,400
Hang on, Jammer.

488
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,050
Lew! Cat! Hurry up, on the double!

489
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:26,250
I'm on my way!

490
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:34,700
Jammer!

491
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,200
- What's the problem?
- He's convulsing!

492
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,800
It's his mixture! Too much oxygen!

493
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:49,000
Gotta get the O2 cut down! Turn him over!

494
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,950
Crank it down, man! You're losing him!

495
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,400
All right. We've gotta get him outta here!
Let's go. Let's move it.

496
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,150
Easy, big fella.

497
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,900
One Night, do you see the divers?
Are they out yet?

498
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:10,800
Negative, Lindsey.
Haven't seen hide nor hair.

499
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:13,050
Let's give 'em 2 minutes more max...

500
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,450
...and then I'll sound the diver recall.

501
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:35,070
Meet me at Flatbed!
This is a diver emergency!

502
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:38,750
- Lins, do you copy!
- Yeah, copy you, Bud. I'm on my way.

503
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:46,350
Look, I'm just a medic.

504
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:51,350
Which is mostly about patching holes.
This type of thing, it's...

505
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,600
...there's not much I can do.

506
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:57,450
The coma could last hours or days.

507
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,300
No, I didn't get a picture of it.

508
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:08,200
- What about the video?
- No.

509
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,450
We lost power right then.

510
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:13,850
Look, I just don't wanna talk about this, OK?

511
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:15,950
Fine. Be that way.

512
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:18,750
Look, I don't know what I saw, Bud, OK?

513
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:21,650
Coffey wants to call it
a Russian submersible - fine.

514
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,900
It's a Russian submersible. No problem.

515
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,400
Yeah, but you think it was something else.

516
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:28,500
What?

517
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:31,380
One of ours?

518
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:35,800
No.

519
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,650
Well, whose then?

520
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:41,400
Come on, Lindsey. Talk to me.

521
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,690
Look, Jammer saw something down there.

522
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:49,610
- Something that scared the hell out of him.
- His mixture got screwed up.

523
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:53,620
Jammer panicked. He pranged his regulator
and his mixture got screwed up.

524
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:56,160
But what did he see that made him panic?

525
00:44:58,090 --> 00:45:00,160
Well, what do you think he saw?

526
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:03,000
I don't know.

527
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:08,400
- Did any of you see it?
- No, sir. The Brigman woman saw it.

528
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:10,800
Could have been a Russian bogey.

529
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,000
CINCLANTFLT's gonna go apeshit.

530
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:19,900
2 Russian attack subs, a Tango and a
Victor, were tracked to within 50 miles of here.

531
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:22,850
And now they don't know
where the hell they are. OK.

532
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:28,750
I don't have any choice.
I'm confirming you to go to Phase 2.

533
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:33,350
You'll recover 1 warhead, arm it,
and wait for further instructions.

534
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:36,950
- Have we got a problem with that?
- Negative, sir.

535
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,100
Come on!

536
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,050
- What did he say?
- Turn it up, bozo!

537
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:48,750
...early reports that the Montana encountered
a Soviet fast attack sub prior to its sinking...

538
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:52,250
...and the Kremlin continues to deny any involvement.

539
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,200
That's us! That's us, man!

540
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:58,050
Benthic Petroleum are apparently participating
in the recovery operation...

541
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:00,810
...but we have little information about their involvement.

542
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:02,600
We want names!

543
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:05,650
Hey, that's the Explorer! We're famous!

544
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,600
There is a tremendous amount of activity.

545
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:14,700
With Cuba only 80 miles away,
the massive build-up of American forces...

546
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:18,300
...has drawn official protest from Havana and Moscow.

547
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:22,800
Russian and Cuban trawlers,
undoubtedly surveillance vessels...

548
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:24,900
...have been circling the area...

549
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,950
- ...and Soviet aircraft have repeatedly been warned away.
- This sucks!

550
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:33,350
- Hippy, what's the matter with you?
- What's the matter with me? Nothing!

551
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:36,230
We're just in the middle
of some big-time international incident...

552
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:39,850
- ...like the Cuban Missile Crisis or something!
- Figured that out for yourself, did you Hip?

553
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:42,150
You know, we got Russian subs creeping around.

554
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:46,210
Anything goes wrong,
they could say whatever they want happened.

555
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:48,790
Relax, will you?
You're making the women nervous.

556
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:51,660
- Cute, Virgil.
- You know, you know...

557
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:55,250
...those SEALs ain't tellin' us diddly.
Something is goin' on!

558
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:59,010
- Come on, come on.
- Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.

559
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:01,170
Everything is.

560
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,420
Hurry up, Coffey's splitting with Flatbed!

561
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:06,450
I showed him how to work the controls
and they're outta here!

562
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,950
- Didn't you tell him we need it right now?
- Yeah! He didn't pay any attention!

563
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,380
- Where the hell is he takin' it?
- I have no idea!

564
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:12,670
Shit!

565
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:16,870
Coffey! Come back! We need...

566
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:19,940
...the big arm to unhook the umbilical.

567
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:22,440
There's a goddamn hurricane coming!

568
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:25,190
- He switched off.
- It's unbelievable.

569
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:32,200
Go back down and tell those men
to get below and stay there!

570
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:45,170
We need to get unhooked
and get out of here now!

571
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:48,750
- All right. Do it, then.
- No problem, except your boys...

572
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,580
...went sightseeing with Flatbed. My people
need Flatbed to get unhooked at their end.

573
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:55,360
- Back in 2 hours.
- 2 hours?!

574
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,840
We're gonna get the shit kicked out of us
by our pal Fred in 2 hours!

575
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:08,250
OK. Set cold tab fitting to 200 psi.

576
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:10,870
- Set.
- There she goes.

577
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,420
- She's breakin' loose.
- Bringin' her up.

578
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:15,590
OK.

579
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:16,700
All right.

580
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:19,670
'K Clear the hatch.

581
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:21,150
Go on with it.

582
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:23,050
Go on. That's it. Up.

583
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:26,250
Sir, the missile looks intact.

584
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:29,930
Little is known about the events
leading up to the collision.

585
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:32,520
The US Navy guided missile cruiser Appleton...

586
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:37,540
...apparently struck the Soviet Udaloy class
destroyer in low visibility conditions.

587
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:42,490
In violent seas, little hope remains
for over 100 Russian crewmen...

588
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:46,500
...still missing after the sinking an hour ago.
Soviet military spokesmen...

589
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:50,580
...have claimed that the collision
constituted an unprovoked attack.

590
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:52,900
- This was denied by state department officials...
- Bud, this is big time.

591
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:55,920
...who said that Captain Michael Sweeney was acting correctly...

592
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:59,750
- OK. It's clear.
- It's all yours, sir.

593
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:02,600
I'm gonna swing it away and drop it.

594
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:05,550
Check. OK.

595
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:09,400
Bypass the ground connection
on the separation sequencer.

596
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:14,000
- Got it?
- Separation sequencer disconnected.

597
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:17,600
Remove explosive bolts 1 through 6...

598
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:20,850
- ...in counterclockwise sequence.
- Check. Removing bolt 1.

599
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:33,980
Negotiators have walked out
of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks...

600
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,270
...in protest over the incident this morning.

601
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:40,620
The sudden deterioration of relations
with the United States and the Soviet...

602
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:43,560
Soviet build-up of tanks
and aircraft has continued.

603
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:48,270
...Eastern-Time this morning, all US and NATO military
forces have been put on full alert.

604
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,450
It's on every channel.

605
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:52,400
Well, you just feel so helpless.

606
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:55,250
You can see it coming, but what can you do?

607
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,800
What can anyone do?

608
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:59,870
Hey, I mean, they love their kids too.

609
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,630
So why are we doing this?

610
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:04,210
If it happens, it happens.

611
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:06,900
There's nothing I can do about it, right?

612
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:09,950
I just don't think about it.

613
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:28,950
All right! Let's get their gear off! Then
clear the sub! We gotta get it outta here!

614
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:32,750
Come on, let's go! Let's move it!
One Night, you're up!

615
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:34,350
Get ready to roll, baby!

616
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:37,150
- Don't touch that! Just back away.
- Excusé moi!

617
00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:42,650
Hey, Coffey. We're a little pressed for time.

618
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,100
Prick.

619
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:51,450
This ain't no drill, Slick. Make me proud.

620
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,500
Piece of cake, baby.

621
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:29,700
What's the problem, One Night?

622
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:33,500
All hell must be breaking loose up there.
This cable's pissin' me off!

623
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:38,850
- I can't get a grip on it.
- Well, keep tryin', baby. Just keep tryin'.

624
00:51:40,450 --> 00:51:41,750
Son of a bitch!

625
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,700
Shit! We got a problem!

626
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:48,550
- What's going on?
- We're losing number 2 thruster!

627
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:49,950
Bearing's going!

628
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:55,050
It's not holding!
We're swinging out of position here!

629
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:06,900
Jesus!

630
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:15,550
Shit!

631
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:27,900
The rig is movin'!

632
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:32,550
Yeah, I can see that. Topside!
Topside, pay out some slack! We're gettin' dragged!

633
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:35,800
- Down on number 1 winch!
- We're gettin' dragged! Down on 1!

634
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:43,000
Bud, we're headed right for the drop-off!

635
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,750
What the hell?
We just lost all the topside feeds!

636
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:22,000
Shit! Get 'em on the UQC.

637
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,800
- Any damage on the hull?
- Bud!

638
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,750
- We lost the crane!
- Say again. What?

639
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:31,570
The crane! We've lost the crane!

640
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:33,750
It's on its way down to you!

641
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:37,550
All right, everybody!
Everybody rig for impact!

642
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:42,250
Close all the exterior hatches!
Let's move it! Let's go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

643
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,800
- Wait!
- Get in here!

644
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:53,200
- What the hell is goin' on around here!?
- I don't know!

645
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:03,250
You two help secure the rig! Let's go!

646
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:16,200
One Night! One Night! You gotta get the hell outta there!
The crane's comin' down!

647
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:26,900
I'm OK. I'm clear, Bud.

648
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:40,250
I've got it! It's headed straight for us!

649
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,200
Oh, shit!

650
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:02,800
- Oh no! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No!
- Oh my God.

651
00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:04,800
Bud?

652
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,150
Grab onto something!

653
00:56:12,050 --> 00:56:13,100
Jesus!

654
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:24,550
- Battery room's flooding! Let's go!
- Cat, put that out!

655
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:30,850
- Bud! The drill room's floodin'!
- Get back down there!

656
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:36,200
Go! I'll take the battery room!

657
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:37,800
Jesus!

658
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:56,150
Shit!

659
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:02,150
- Get out of there!
- Close the door!

660
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:03,350
Seal the room!

661
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:14,900
Lindsey! Let's get outta here!

662
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:06,850
- Hold this on me!
- OK!

663
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:13,400
Lindsey!

664
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:15,250
I got it!

665
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,200
Let's get the hell outta here!

666
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:47,000
Let's go!

667
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:50,450
Hit the door! Hit the door!

668
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:55,600
No!

669
00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:59,150
Bud! Bud!

670
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:11,150
Finler, cut the hose! Cut the line to the motor!

671
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,600
I can't open it from out here!

672
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:16,200
Finler, cut the hose!

673
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:20,550
Finler!

674
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:48,200
Hey! Hey!!!

675
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:50,200
Hey!

676
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,500
Hey!!!

677
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:57,900
- Come on, Sonny!
- Hey, Cat! Cat, help me out, man!

678
00:59:58,300 --> 00:59:59,200
Hang on!

679
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:05,950
The hose! Cut the hose!
The line to the motor! Hurry up, man!

680
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:11,550
Come on, Cat!

681
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:13,850
Hurry!

682
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:16,950
Come on, Sonny!
Help me out! Come on! Push!

683
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:25,900
- Come on, Sonny! Let's go!
- Come on! Let's go! We gotta go! Go! Go!

684
01:00:26,350 --> 01:00:28,450
Get outta here! Come on! Move it!

685
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,600
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

686
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:31,750
Get the hatch, Cat!

687
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,450
Get the hatch! Get the hatch!

688
01:00:48,450 --> 01:00:50,200
- You all right? Everybody OK?
- Yeah.

689
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:53,050
Son of a bitch!

690
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:54,650
Oh, man!

691
01:01:04,990 --> 01:01:10,070
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.
This is Deepcore. Do you read me? Over.

692
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:12,250
Forget it, Sonny. They're gone, man.

693
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:17,850
- Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.
- Hey.

694
01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:20,350
They're gone.

695
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:25,250
OK?

696
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:29,450
I just wanna get out of this.

697
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:35,700
I'd just like to see my wife one more time.

698
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:38,800
Well, all right, then.
You'd better keep trying, huh?

699
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:44,450
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.
This is Deepcore 2. Do you read?

700
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:50,150
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.
Do you read me? This is Deepcore 2. Over.

701
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:55,700
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.
Deepcore 2 do you read me? Over.

702
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:23,400
Hey, Jammer.

703
01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:31,800
- You got the shakes.
- I know what I got.

704
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:35,850
I'll deal with it, all right?
I'll deal with me. You deal with yourself.

705
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:38,150
Find your buddy?

706
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:41,700
- No.
- Tighter, tighter.

707
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:44,550
- Brigman.
- What?

708
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,200
I was under orders.

709
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:50,000
I had no choice.

710
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:08,150
How's it going, Cat?

711
01:03:19,150 --> 01:03:21,700
- What's the scoop, ace?
- Well...

712
01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:26,150
...I can get power to this module
and sub-bay if I reroute these buses.

713
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:29,850
But I gotta get past the mains,
which are a total meltdown.

714
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:33,850
Bud, there won't be enough to run the heaters.

715
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:37,350
In a few hours, this place
is gonna be as cold as a meat locker.

716
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:41,650
- What about O2?
- Yeah, well, brace yourself.

717
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:45,500
If we close off the sections we're not using,
we have about maybe 12 hours' worth.

718
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:51,550
The storm's gonna last
a lot longer than 12 hours.

719
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:53,000
Yeah, well...

720
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:56,500
...I can maybe extend that. Maybe.

721
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:00,650
There are some storage tanks outboard
next to the wrecked module.

722
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:03,100
I'll have to go outside, though,
and tie onto them.

723
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:08,490
Hey, Lins.

724
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:11,420
- Lins.
- Yeah?

725
01:04:12,650 --> 01:04:13,700
I'm glad you're here.

726
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:15,400
Yeah?

727
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:19,200
I'm not.

728
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:50,750
Hey. Found Cab 3.
Deader than dog shit, boss.

729
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,900
That girder went right through the brainpan.

730
01:04:53,950 --> 01:04:55,300
Yeah, I see that.

731
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:01,550
- Where are you?
- Living quarters. Level 2.

732
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:10,750
Ah jeez!

733
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:14,520
That's Perry.

734
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:22,300
That's it, then.
Finler, McWhirter, Dietz and Perry.

735
01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:25,600
Jesus.

736
01:05:27,950 --> 01:05:30,100
Uh... we just leave 'em there?

737
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:34,700
Yeah, for now. We got no choice. Our first
priority is to get somethin' to breathe.

738
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,500
Where are you now, Lins?

739
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:51,100
I'm under the starboard tri-module.

740
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:56,550
- Still with me, Hip?
- Right behind you, Lins.

741
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:11,050
- How's it look?
- Well, you guys really screwed up my rig.

742
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:14,550
- There's a lot of wreckage out here.
- Well, don't get fouled.

743
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:18,050
- Hey hit me with that 9/16ths, OK?
- Yeah.

744
01:06:18,650 --> 01:06:21,100
Thank you. So...

745
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:24,250
- ...there you were.
- Yeah, there we were.

746
01:06:25,850 --> 01:06:28,650
Side by side on the same ship
for 2 months.

747
01:06:29,850 --> 01:06:33,150
I'm a tool pusher and we're testing
this automated derrick of hers.

748
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:36,900
We get back on the beach
and we're livin' together.

749
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:38,950
Doesn't mean you had to marry her.

750
01:06:39,850 --> 01:06:43,000
Yeah, well we were due to go back out
on the same ship. 6 months of tests.

751
01:06:43,050 --> 01:06:45,950
If you were married, you got a stateroom.
Otherwise it was bunks.

752
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:50,950
OK. Good reason. Will you come over here
and tighten this for me? Then what?

753
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:53,800
Then it was all right
there for a while, you know.

754
01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:58,550
Then she got promoted
to chief engineer on this thing a couple years ago.

755
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:03,150
- She went front office on you, man.
- Yeah, well, you know Lindsey.

756
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:05,900
She's just too damn aggressive.

757
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:07,800
Son of a bitch!

758
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,850
She didn't leave me. She just left me behind.

759
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:14,900
Bud, let me tell you somethin'.

760
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:18,350
She ain't half as smart as she thinks she is.

761
01:07:22,650 --> 01:07:23,750
Get outta here.

762
01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:01,200
Come on. Let's see those muscles.

763
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:04,350
Bingo! That's 1.

764
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:06,900
2 for 2.

765
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:08,350
Hey, hey.

766
01:08:10,730 --> 01:08:12,650
Lindsey, do you read me? Over.

767
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:15,900
Copy you, Hippy. What's the matter?

768
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:21,150
Oh, shit.
The power's jackin' around with us again.

769
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:22,650
Lindsey, come back.

770
01:08:22,990 --> 01:08:25,950
I just lost video. Lins, are you there?

771
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:29,600
Hippy, do you copy?

772
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:34,450
Lins, you copy?

773
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:36,850
Oh, shit!

774
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:40,150
Oh, what the hell! Hippy, do you copy?

775
01:08:41,950 --> 01:08:43,150
Damn it!

776
01:08:44,150 --> 01:08:45,650
Bud, do you copy? Over.

777
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:50,850
Uh... I seem to be having a problem here.

778
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:10,450
Shit!

779
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:25,250
Damn it!

780
01:11:58,450 --> 01:12:01,450
- That's a great shot, Lins.
- You drop your dive light?

781
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:06,000
Oh come on you guys, come on. Now that's the smaller one.
That's the smaller one here.

782
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:08,800
- You can kinda see how it's zigging around.
- Yea, whatever it is.

783
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:11,850
I'm telling you what it is.
You're just not hearing me.

784
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:14,450
- Now, Lindsey you...
- There is something down there.

785
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:19,500
- Something not us.
- You could be more... specific.

786
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:21,400
- Something that zigs.
- Not us.

787
01:12:22,650 --> 01:12:23,950
Not human.

788
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:28,200
Get it? Something non-human... but intelligent.

789
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:37,400
A non-terrestrial intelligence.

790
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:40,450
A non-terrestrial intelligence.

791
01:12:40,930 --> 01:12:45,250
NTIs. Oh, man, that's better than UFOs.
Oh but that works too huh.

792
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,600
Underwater Flying Objects.

793
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:55,200
- Are we talking little space friends here?
- Hell, yeah!

794
01:12:55,220 --> 01:12:57,150
Hot rods of the gods! Right, Lins?

795
01:12:58,190 --> 01:13:00,400
No, no, really. It could be NTIs.

796
01:13:00,770 --> 01:13:02,500
- The CIA has known about 'em for ever.
- Step outside.

797
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:06,350
- They abduct people all the time, man. There was once...
- Hippy, would you do me a favor?

798
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,350
Stay off my side.

799
01:13:09,530 --> 01:13:11,400
- Will you step into my office, please?
- Certainly.

800
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:15,650
I... come here.

801
01:13:17,590 --> 01:13:20,740
- Jesus, Lins!
- Oh Bud, come on!
Something really important is happening here.

802
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:24,950
I'm trying to keep the situation under control.
I can't allow you to create this kind of hysteria.

803
01:13:24,950 --> 01:13:27,650
- Who's hysterical?! Nobody's hysterical!
- Shh!

804
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:33,350
All I'm saying is, when you're hanging on by your fingernails,
you don't go waving your arms around.

805
01:13:33,470 --> 01:13:38,200
Look, I saw something. I'm not gonna go in there
and say I didn't see it when I did. I'm sorry.

806
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:41,540
- Please.
- You are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.

807
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:43,350
Yes, I am!

808
01:13:43,950 --> 01:13:46,050
But I need you to believe me right now.

809
01:13:46,930 --> 01:13:50,200
Now, come on. Look at me. Come on.
Am I stressed out?

810
01:13:50,220 --> 01:13:53,300
Do I have any symptoms of pressure -
sickness, tremors, slurred speech?

811
01:13:55,060 --> 01:13:56,950
- No.
- No.

812
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:59,850
Bud, this is me - Lindsey. OK?

813
01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:03,200
You know me better
than anybody in the world.

814
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:06,750
Now watch my lips.

815
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:08,900
I saw these things.

816
01:14:10,390 --> 01:14:16,000
I touched one of them.
And... it wasn't some clunky steel can like we would build.

817
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:19,700
It glided.

818
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:23,200
It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

819
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:26,950
Oh, God, I wish you'd been there.

820
01:14:28,450 --> 01:14:29,710
It was a machine.

821
01:14:29,850 --> 01:14:33,600
It was a machine, but it was alive.
It was like a... like a dance of light.

822
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:38,870
Please. You have to trust me.

823
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:42,850
Now, I don't think they mean us any harm.
I don't know how I know that.

824
01:14:43,490 --> 01:14:45,550
It's just... a feeling.

825
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:50,900
Jesus! I'm supposed to go on a feeling?
How can I go on a feeling?

826
01:14:50,950 --> 01:14:54,600
- You think Coffey's gonna go on a feeling?
- Well, we all see what we wanna see.

827
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,760
Coffey looks and he sees Russians.

828
01:14:58,650 --> 01:15:00,230
He sees hate and fear.

829
01:15:02,150 --> 01:15:04,440
You have to look with better eyes than that.

830
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:11,260
Please.

831
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:13,680
I can't, Lins.

832
01:15:15,530 --> 01:15:16,760
I'm sorry.

833
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:21,900
All I want is 24 hour surveillance
on exterior cameras.

834
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:24,550
- You've got 6 people. I've got...
- Comin' through!

835
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:27,780
Everybody just stop!

836
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:39,990
All right. I want around-the-clock manning
of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.

837
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:42,570
That Russian bogey comes back...

838
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:45,870
- ...I don't think we should be taking a nap.
- Give me a break, Coffey.

839
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:49,460
Those things live 3 and a half miles down
in an abyssal trench.

840
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:51,670
Trust me, they're not speaking Russian.

841
01:15:56,350 --> 01:15:57,480
Have you finished the repairs...

842
01:15:57,500 --> 01:16:00,030
- ...on the acoustical transmitter yet?
- Nope.

843
01:16:01,410 --> 01:16:04,790
- Why not?
- I was having my nails done.

844
01:16:04,990 --> 01:16:06,600
Well, get it done.

845
01:16:07,050 --> 01:16:08,670
Kiss my ass.

846
01:16:21,130 --> 01:16:22,280
All right.

847
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:24,740
Get something straight.

848
01:16:26,410 --> 01:16:28,290
You people are under my authority.

849
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:30,230
Look, partner... look partner.

850
01:16:30,830 --> 01:16:32,150
We don't work for you.

851
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:34,760
We don't take orders from you.

852
01:16:35,950 --> 01:16:37,780
And we don't much like you.

853
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:43,810
Hey, Cat... Cat!

854
01:16:45,530 --> 01:16:46,290
Yeah?

855
01:16:46,910 --> 01:16:49,980
Why don't you take
the first watch on sonar? OK?

856
01:16:51,990 --> 01:16:53,020
Right on.

857
01:16:54,450 --> 01:16:57,730
Sonny, you get a couple of hours' sleep.
Then you spell Cat, all right?

858
01:16:58,450 --> 01:17:00,740
Hippy, you handle exterior surveillance.

859
01:17:02,870 --> 01:17:08,220
One Night... Will you do me a favor
and see if you can get that transmitter fixed?

860
01:17:09,190 --> 01:17:11,880
- All right?
- Give me a couple of hours.

861
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:22,790
Got it.

862
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:47,400
All right.

863
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:51,670
Come on, AJ Squared Away.
A little to the left.

864
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:54,430
What is?

865
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:04,990
Oh, this is not happening.

866
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:17,340
Look at me, I'm shaking man. All right.
Wait wait wait wait. And now...

867
01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:21,480
...here's MIRV!

868
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:28,530
- Oh, come on, man! What else could it be?
- Why bring it here?

869
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:33,130
It's gotta be some kind of emergency plan
to keep it away from the Russians, right?

870
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:36,170
Look look... they hot-wire 1 of the nukes.

871
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:38,640
They use some kind of detonator
that they brought.

872
01:18:38,810 --> 01:18:43,410
Then they stick it back in the sub.
Fry the whole thing up. Bam!

873
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:45,270
Slicker than snot.

874
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:50,470
I'm tellin' you. And I'm not being paranoi...

875
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:52,590
Hi, Lins.

876
01:19:01,150 --> 01:19:05,800
- Lins, will you just wait a second?
- Goddamn it, If you don't do something about it, I will!

877
01:19:05,850 --> 01:19:09,440
- Lindsey, we'll do something about it! Wait a sec!
- Fellas!? Hello!

878
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:13,640
- Lins! Just stop and think about this for a second.
- About what?

879
01:19:34,650 --> 01:19:37,610
You know, you've got some huevos
bringing that thing into my rig.

880
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:42,800
With all that's goin' on up in the world,
you bring a nuclear weapon...

881
01:19:42,850 --> 01:19:44,610
- ...in here!
- Mrs. Brigman...

882
01:19:44,870 --> 01:19:48,920
Does this strike anyone
as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?

883
01:19:49,250 --> 01:19:52,900
Mrs. Brigman, you don't need to know
the details of our operation.

884
01:19:52,950 --> 01:19:55,800
- It's better if you don't.
- You're right! I don't need to know!

885
01:19:55,850 --> 01:20:00,340
What I need to know is that thing is
off this rig! Do you hear me, Roger Ramjet!?

886
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:04,990
You're becoming
a serious impediment to our mission.

887
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:10,350
Now, you either do an about-face and walk
out of here, or I'll have you escorted out.

888
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:13,460
I will not do an about-face and get outta here!

889
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:19,350
- Who the hell do you think you're talking to?
- Emergency! Maintenance Room B! Emergency!
Everybody move it!

890
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:20,550
On the double!

891
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:21,950
Now! Now!

892
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:27,250
- In here! Come on! We got trouble! Now! Come on!
- What's goin' on?

893
01:20:27,350 --> 01:20:28,850
All right! All right! All right! All right!

894
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:33,950
- What's up? What's happening?
- All right, you let her go, man. Do it.

895
01:20:34,710 --> 01:20:36,140
Do it now!

896
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:37,660
Let her go.

897
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,660
The smartest thing you ever did.

898
01:20:46,110 --> 01:20:48,460
- Coffey, you son of a bitch!
- Lindsey! Cool it.

899
01:20:48,630 --> 01:20:54,070
- What's the problem?
- Nothing. We were just leaving. Weren't we?

900
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:15,790
We don't need them.

901
01:21:17,570 --> 01:21:19,000
We can't trust them.

902
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:25,550
We may have to take steps.

903
01:21:28,340 --> 01:21:30,260
We're gonna have to take steps.

904
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:38,600
Lins, I want you
to stay away from that guy. I mean it.

905
01:21:38,750 --> 01:21:41,550
The guy is gone. Did you see his hands?

906
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,100
What? He's got the shakes?

907
01:21:44,210 --> 01:21:48,700
Look, he's operating on his own.
He's cut off from his chain of command.

908
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:51,560
He's showing signs
of pressure-induced psychosis.

909
01:21:52,110 --> 01:21:53,910
And he's got a nuclear weapon.

910
01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:58,900
So, as a personal favor to me, will you try
to put your tongue in neutral for a while?

911
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:03,250
- OK?
- I gotta tell you. I give this whole thing
a sphincter factor of about 9.5.

912
01:22:43,390 --> 01:22:46,600
You can just punch into his primary
guidance chip where you want him to go...

913
01:22:46,650 --> 01:22:50,050
- ...and he'll go there, right?
- No. Bad idea, Lindsey.

914
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:51,500
Why, Hip? Come on.

915
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:55,720
Because even if it could take the pressure
at that depth, which I don't think it can...

916
01:22:56,840 --> 01:23:02,240
...without the tether, you know what would happen
if it got down there? It would just sit like
a... please... it would just sit like a dumb shit.

917
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:06,300
- Yeah... something would have to pass
in front of the camera for you to see anything.
- I know. I know.

918
01:23:06,350 --> 01:23:09,620
But we could get lucky right?
So we should go for it.

919
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:11,890
I really ought to talk to Bud about this.

920
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:16,940
No way. This is between you and me. We get
proof and then we tell the others. Hippy, look.

921
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:20,670
If we can prove to Coffey
that there aren't Russians down there...

922
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:23,600
...maybe he'll ease off the button a little bit.

923
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:28,820
I gotta tell you, that guy scares me more
than anything we're gonna find down there.

924
01:23:29,050 --> 01:23:34,280
He's a goddamn AJ squared away jarhead robot!

925
01:23:37,210 --> 01:23:39,420
All right. All right. Give me a couple of hours.
I'll see what I can do.

926
01:23:39,620 --> 01:23:40,880
Great. Thanks.

927
01:23:48,660 --> 01:23:49,670
How's that?

928
01:23:54,290 --> 01:23:55,550
Thanks.

929
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:20,610
Virgil, turn on your side.

930
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:52,480
All right. You're all set, big guy.

931
01:24:53,150 --> 01:24:55,930
Hey, I told you to wipe that grin off your face.

932
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:06,780
Good night, little buddy.

933
01:26:56,840 --> 01:26:57,530
Bud!

934
01:26:57,950 --> 01:26:59,080
Bud! Get up!

935
01:27:14,130 --> 01:27:14,990
Cat?

936
01:27:17,740 --> 01:27:18,430
Cat!

937
01:27:18,890 --> 01:27:21,300
Hey! Goddamn... leave me alone.

938
01:27:30,030 --> 01:27:31,120
Bud!

939
01:27:34,510 --> 01:27:36,060
No, wait. It's OK.

940
01:27:36,950 --> 01:27:38,640
Sweet Christ almighty!

941
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:40,050
I think it likes you.

942
01:28:00,650 --> 01:28:02,440
It's trying to communicate.

943
01:28:04,650 --> 01:28:05,770
It's Bud.

944
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:12,400
- It's wonderful!
- It's me!

945
01:28:15,950 --> 01:28:18,170
- No no no no no!
- Shh it's OK. It's OK.

946
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:19,580
What is it!?

947
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:24,060
Is it alive?

948
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:29,920
Lindsey, no...

949
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:32,730
Seawater.

950
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:34,680
Oh, man.

951
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:50,180
Come on! Come on!

952
01:28:52,570 --> 01:28:54,350
- Hurry!
- Where the hell's it going?

953
01:29:05,650 --> 01:29:07,840
Hurry! I think it's headed for B module!

954
01:29:09,350 --> 01:29:10,550
Lins, you see it?

955
01:30:10,710 --> 01:30:13,960
So, raise your hand if you think
it was a Russian water tentacle.

956
01:30:15,510 --> 01:30:16,570
Lieutenant?

957
01:30:17,370 --> 01:30:19,050
No? Well...

958
01:30:20,650 --> 01:30:21,790
...a breakthrough.

959
01:30:22,940 --> 01:30:23,890
Hey, ace...

960
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:28,220
- ...you done impressing yourself?
- No way that thing could just be seawater.

961
01:30:29,110 --> 01:30:32,850
They must have learned to control water.
I mean, at a molecular level.

962
01:30:33,130 --> 01:30:36,920
You know, they can plasticize it, they can pulverize it,
do whatever they wanna do with it.

963
01:30:37,070 --> 01:30:46,280
- They can put it under intelligent control.
- Maybe... their whole technology's based on that... controlling water.

964
01:30:47,570 --> 01:30:50,420
Was it the same thing
that you saw the last time?

965
01:30:50,670 --> 01:30:51,280
No.

966
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:55,700
You know, I don't think that
that thing you saw was one of them.

967
01:30:55,870 --> 01:30:59,080
- What are you talkin' about?
- I mean, I don't think it was an NTI.

968
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:03,050
I think it was like their version of an ROV.
Like Big Geek.

969
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:06,550
Hippy, you mean
they was just checkin' us out?

970
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:08,650
- Yeah.
- How come?

971
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:10,280
Curious, I suppose.

972
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:13,610
We're probably the first people
they've ever seen right?
Who's been down this far?

973
01:31:30,450 --> 01:31:34,140
It went straight for the warhead.
And they think it's cute!

974
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:55,250
You need to get some sleep.

975
01:32:05,850 --> 01:32:07,440
We have no...

976
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:11,030
...way of warning the surface.

977
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:13,550
And you know what that means?

978
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:18,780
It means whatever happens...

979
01:32:19,270 --> 01:32:21,410
...is up to us.

980
01:32:22,310 --> 01:32:23,630
Us.

981
01:33:32,270 --> 01:33:35,720
So you think they're from down there
originally? Or from...

982
01:33:37,530 --> 01:33:38,500
...you know.

983
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:41,520
I don't know.

984
01:33:41,830 --> 01:33:44,370
I think... I think they're from, 'you know.'

985
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:46,860
Someplace with similar conditions.

986
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:49,740
- Cold, intense pressure.
- Oh, man!

987
01:33:49,930 --> 01:33:52,480
Happy as hogs in a waller down there,
probably.

988
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:53,120
Sniff something?

989
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:58,690
Did you, rat boy?

990
01:35:04,100 --> 01:35:05,400
Hey! Hey! Hey! Come on!

991
01:35:05,650 --> 01:35:06,800
Freeze!

992
01:35:07,180 --> 01:35:08,450
Don't move!

993
01:35:10,580 --> 01:35:11,530
That's right.

994
01:35:13,130 --> 01:35:15,050
- You OK, Hip?
- They're using Big Geek...

995
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:17,830
- ...to take the bomb to the NTIs.
- What?

996
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:20,020
We set it up to go right to 'em.

997
01:35:20,450 --> 01:35:23,260
Oh my God! Oh my God!

998
01:35:23,890 --> 01:35:26,250
Take this. We're going to Phase 3.

999
01:35:27,070 --> 01:35:29,290
What!? We don't have orders for that!

1000
01:35:29,780 --> 01:35:33,800
I programmed Big Geek to go down to the
bottom of the trench and shoot some video.

1001
01:35:34,050 --> 01:35:36,450
- Now they got the warhead tied to it.
- Coffey.

1002
01:35:40,150 --> 01:35:44,400
- Lins...
- Coffey... no, come on, Coffey.
Just think about what you're doing, OK?

1003
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:47,170
Just 1 minute. Just think about what you're doing!

1004
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:48,700
Get back!

1005
01:35:51,050 --> 01:35:54,490
This is something I've wanted to do
since we first met.

1006
01:36:01,780 --> 01:36:03,860
Come on. Take it easy. Take it easy.

1007
01:36:06,950 --> 01:36:11,020
- All right! Into the kitchen! Let's go! Move!
- Get your damn hands off of me!

1008
01:36:11,110 --> 01:36:12,750
- Get in there!
- I know the way.

1009
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:16,230
Your boss is fixin' to pull the pin
on 50 kilotons!

1010
01:36:16,890 --> 01:36:18,840
And we're all gonna be ringside!

1011
01:36:19,410 --> 01:36:21,590
He's havin' a full-on meltdown!

1012
01:36:21,970 --> 01:36:23,870
- What's the timer set for?
- 3 hours.

1013
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:26,150
- Shut up! Don't talk.
- 3 hours.

1014
01:36:26,620 --> 01:36:29,290
We can't get to minimum safe distance
in 3 hours.

1015
01:36:30,930 --> 01:36:32,970
We can't go to Phase 3.
What about these people?

1016
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,350
Shut up! What's the matter with you?

1017
01:36:42,090 --> 01:36:45,910
Everybody just stay calm.
The situation is under control.

1018
01:36:51,250 --> 01:36:53,560
Anybody touches that door, kill 'em.

1019
01:36:58,550 --> 01:37:01,680
Shoenick! Your lieutenant's
about to make a real bad career move!

1020
01:37:01,700 --> 01:37:04,200
- The guy is crazier than a shithouse rat!
- Shut it!

1021
01:37:04,250 --> 01:37:05,630
- They're trying to make contact!

1022
01:37:05,630 --> 01:37:08,070
- Can't you see he's lost it?
- Shut up!

1023
01:37:08,190 --> 01:37:10,600
- The shock wave will kill us.
- Quiet!

1024
01:37:10,770 --> 01:37:12,840
It'll crush this rig like a beer can.

1025
01:37:12,850 --> 01:37:14,850
- Shut up, man! What are you talkin' about!?
- We gotta stop him.

1026
01:37:14,900 --> 01:37:16,280
Shut up!

1027
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:20,140
This is not our mission.
We can't detonate without orders.

1028
01:37:33,350 --> 01:37:35,200
He's about to declare war on an alien species...

1029
01:37:35,250 --> 01:37:38,220
...just when they're trying to make contact with us. Please!

1030
01:37:38,650 --> 01:37:40,770
- I don't know. I think I'm reaching him.
- Yeah!

1031
01:37:44,790 --> 01:37:45,830
I'll be damned.

1032
01:37:49,350 --> 01:37:51,680
- Jammer.
- Is everybody OK?

1033
01:37:52,260 --> 01:37:53,660
Oh, man!

1034
01:37:54,900 --> 01:37:58,030
- Don't move, jarface!
- Look, I'm the least of your problems.

1035
01:37:58,230 --> 01:38:01,760
- Take it easy, Hippy.
- I'm all right.
- How you feeling, big guy?

1036
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:03,600
I'm OK, Bud. I...

1037
01:38:04,030 --> 01:38:09,910
...I just... I just figured I was dead back there
when I saw that angel coming for me.

1038
01:38:12,580 --> 01:38:16,310
Yeah, OK.
Yeah. Why don't you tell us about it later?

1039
01:38:23,110 --> 01:38:26,050
- Come on.
- He's got it tied off with something.

1040
01:38:26,420 --> 01:38:27,510
Yeah come on. Ready?

1041
01:38:31,450 --> 01:38:36,000
- We're not gonna be able to budge it.
- Now what? This is the only door to sub-bay.

1042
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:50,300
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna swim to hatch 6.

1043
01:38:50,820 --> 01:38:51,510
What!?

1044
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:55,020
I'm gonna get inside...

1045
01:38:55,650 --> 01:38:59,250
- ...and I'm gonna open the door from the other side.
- Bud, this water is freezing.

1046
01:39:00,750 --> 01:39:02,450
Then I guess you'd better wish me luck, huh?

1047
01:39:03,050 --> 01:39:04,970
- Wish us luck.
- You comin' along?

1048
01:39:04,980 --> 01:39:06,050
Looks that way.

1049
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:10,650
- All right, Cat.
- Come on, Bud.

1050
01:39:11,950 --> 01:39:14,700
- In case I don't die...
- This is insane.

1051
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:17,600
Come on, Bud.
Let's go, partner. I ain't got all day.

1052
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:19,550
Come on. Yank on it.

1053
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:26,950
We have to...

1054
01:40:28,050 --> 01:40:29,450
...we have to go to the moon pool.

1055
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:32,790
- It's the only way.
- I can't.

1056
01:40:33,190 --> 01:40:34,600
I can't make it, partner.

1057
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:36,450
I'm sorry.

1058
01:40:38,950 --> 01:40:41,300
OK... OK Cat.

1059
01:40:41,550 --> 01:40:42,800
You head on back, all right?

1060
01:42:17,750 --> 01:42:20,400
- What is he doing?
- He can't make it to the door.

1061
01:42:20,700 --> 01:42:25,270
- He's gonna try and take him out himself.
- No. God, he couldn't be that dumb.

1062
01:42:25,300 --> 01:42:26,750
That guy's a trained killer.

1063
01:43:16,450 --> 01:43:17,150
No!

1064
01:43:18,150 --> 01:43:20,550
Coffey... Coffey, listen.

1065
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:35,500
Hey!

1066
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:56,700
Hey!

1067
01:45:13,100 --> 01:45:15,300
- Bud, you all right?
- Get him, Cat!

1068
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:25,150
- He's dogged it, Bud!
- We gotta get this off of here.

1069
01:45:29,150 --> 01:45:31,500
Come on. Help me. Pull the gripper!

1070
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:44,150
Cat, get the door!

1071
01:45:54,650 --> 01:45:55,360
Shit!

1072
01:45:56,650 --> 01:45:57,450
Come on!

1073
01:45:59,950 --> 01:46:00,500
Shoot!

1074
01:46:00,550 --> 01:46:01,550
You all right?

1075
01:46:01,900 --> 01:46:03,850
The safety's on! Safety's on!

1076
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:05,650
Give me that!

1077
01:46:11,700 --> 01:46:14,750
Come on! Let's go! Help me out!
Gimme a hand. Let's move it.

1078
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:17,450
- One Night, what about Cab 1?
- Ready to launch.

1079
01:46:19,700 --> 01:46:21,900
Go! You're better in these than I am.

1080
01:46:22,850 --> 01:46:24,550
- You got air?
- Come on. Come on!

1081
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:29,100
You got air. You got air. You got air. You got air.

1082
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:22,000
Shit!

1083
01:48:53,900 --> 01:48:55,250
Bud, get out of the way!

1084
01:49:02,650 --> 01:49:03,500
Shit!

1085
01:49:26,450 --> 01:49:28,800
Get in! Hurry up!

1086
01:49:29,300 --> 01:49:32,150
I'm comin', baby! Keep your pantyhose on.

1087
01:49:41,950 --> 01:49:44,050
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

1088
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:50,900
- Do you see Big Geek?
- Yeah. Right out in front.

1089
01:49:58,250 --> 01:50:01,350
- Oh, my God!
- Get after him.
- OK. OK. OK. OK. Get on the arm.

1090
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,450
- To the left. A little more.
- You missed. Try it again.

1091
01:50:04,470 --> 01:50:06,460
- Stay steady. Steady. Steady. Steady.
- OK.

1092
01:50:06,470 --> 01:50:07,950
- Grab it!
- Yeah, got it!

1093
01:50:08,500 --> 01:50:10,600
- Pretty slick, Slick.
- Hold it really steady.

1094
01:50:11,180 --> 01:50:13,050
- Hold it still. Hold it still.
- I am. I am.

1095
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:26,200
Shit! We lost Geek!

1096
01:50:33,300 --> 01:50:34,550
Where is he, Bud? Do you see him?

1097
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:35,500
I'll take a look.

1098
01:50:38,200 --> 01:50:40,900
- He's comin' up fast. Step on it!
- Shit!

1099
01:50:51,850 --> 01:50:54,600
- Go to the right! Swing to the right!
- Shit!

1100
01:51:11,300 --> 01:51:12,350
Keep movin', baby!

1101
01:51:15,100 --> 01:51:16,020
Come here.

1102
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:23,950
Son of a bitch!

1103
01:51:32,150 --> 01:51:34,190
Hard left, baby! Left! Left! Left!

1104
01:51:48,300 --> 01:51:49,900
Jesus Christ, lady!

1105
01:51:49,950 --> 01:51:52,500
Bud, if you think you can do any better
then you're welcome up here!

1106
01:51:59,850 --> 01:52:01,250
Son of a bitch!

1107
01:52:03,750 --> 01:52:06,050
- Is he right on us?
- Yeah, he's right on your ass.

1108
01:52:06,160 --> 01:52:07,550
OK. OK.

1109
01:52:07,700 --> 01:52:09,400
- Where you goin'?
- Hang on!

1110
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,100
Deepcore, this is Cab 1. Do you read?

1111
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,200
Deepcore, Deepcore, this is Cab 1. Over.

1112
01:54:02,150 --> 01:54:03,500
I'm not getting any answer!

1113
01:54:05,530 --> 01:54:07,250
And we're flooding like a son of a bitch.

1114
01:54:07,590 --> 01:54:08,800
Yeah. You noticed?

1115
01:54:09,450 --> 01:54:11,500
You know, you did OK back there, Virgil.

1116
01:54:11,950 --> 01:54:14,450
- I was fairly impressed.
- Yeah, well, not good enough.

1117
01:54:14,990 --> 01:54:18,250
- We still gotta catch Big Geek.
- Yeah, well, not in this thing.

1118
01:54:18,950 --> 01:54:21,400
Deepcore, Deepcore, this is Cab 1. Over.

1119
01:54:25,150 --> 01:54:26,050
Try it again.

1120
01:54:26,950 --> 01:54:28,980
Deepcore, this is Cab 1. We need a...

1121
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:34,450
You all right?

1122
01:54:35,380 --> 01:54:36,300
Yeah.

1123
01:54:42,900 --> 01:54:44,000
Well, that's that.

1124
01:54:44,020 --> 01:54:45,350
Yeah, wonderful.

1125
01:54:47,640 --> 01:54:50,800
There's some light comin' from somewhere.
Off to the right.

1126
01:54:51,450 --> 01:54:52,850
Yeah, that's the rig.

1127
01:54:53,050 --> 01:54:55,300
It's a good 60, 70 yards, I'd say.

1128
01:54:55,800 --> 01:54:57,050
Well, they'll come after us.

1129
01:54:58,120 --> 01:55:02,250
Yeah, but it's gonna take 'em a while to get
here. We gotta get this flooding stopped.

1130
01:55:04,950 --> 01:55:07,500
- Can you see where it's coming in?
- Yeah. Can you hold the lamp for me?

1131
01:55:08,300 --> 01:55:11,850
There's a busted fitting behind this panel.
Problem is I don't think I can get to it.

1132
01:55:15,600 --> 01:55:18,350
- You got any tools?
- Uh, I don't know. I'll have to look around.

1133
01:55:18,900 --> 01:55:20,450
Yeah, well, I looked already.

1134
01:55:23,350 --> 01:55:26,000
Goddamn it!
All I need's a goddamn crescent wrench!

1135
01:55:29,550 --> 01:55:30,400
Come on.

1136
01:55:36,650 --> 01:55:38,150
Son of a bitch!

1137
01:55:39,060 --> 01:55:41,150
OK. Calm down, Bud.

1138
01:55:41,900 --> 01:55:44,200
- Calm down.
- OK.
- OK.

1139
01:55:47,180 --> 01:55:48,350
OK.

1140
01:55:50,990 --> 01:55:52,600
We gotta get you outta here.

1141
01:55:53,300 --> 01:55:55,450
- How?
- I don't know how.

1142
01:55:55,850 --> 01:55:58,970
- All right. We've only got 1 suit.
- I know. I know. But we gotta come up with something.

1143
01:55:58,970 --> 01:55:59,900
- Oh, my God! I'm freezing!
- Come here. Come here. Give me your hands.
- All right. We've only got 1 suit.
- I know. I know. But we gotta come up with something.

1144
01:55:59,900 --> 01:56:02,750
- Oh, my God! I'm freezing!
- Come here. Come here. Give me your hands.

1145
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:06,250
- Listen, you're smart. Think of something.
Can't you think of something?
- OK. OK.

1146
01:56:07,080 --> 01:56:10,550
OK. Why don't you swim back to the rig
and bring back another suit?

1147
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:18,100
That'll take me about 7, or 8 minutes
to swim, get the gear, and come back.

1148
01:56:18,900 --> 01:56:21,150
I wouldn't make it. Look at this.
By the time I got back, you'd be...

1149
01:56:23,250 --> 01:56:27,200
- OK. OK.
- Lins.
- Let's look around. Let's look. Oh my God!

1150
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:29,990
Is that working?

1151
01:56:32,150 --> 01:56:32,950
Shit!

1152
01:56:44,600 --> 01:56:46,450
All right. All right. All right. All right. All right.

1153
01:56:47,240 --> 01:56:49,150
Here. You put this on.

1154
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:52,800
- No! No! What, are you growing gills all of a sudden?
- Don't argue with me, goddamn it! Just put it on.

1155
01:56:52,820 --> 01:56:57,350
- Look, this is not an option, so just forget about it! All right?
- Lindsey, shut up! Shut up and put this thing on!

1156
01:56:57,400 --> 01:56:59,990
- If you'd be logical just for 1 second...
- Fuck logic!
- Please! Listen...

1157
01:57:00,250 --> 01:57:04,800
Just listen to me for 1 second. Now, you've got the suit on
and you're a better swimmer than I am, right?

1158
01:57:05,240 --> 01:57:07,800
- Yeah, maybe.
- Right? Yes! So I've got a plan.

1159
01:57:07,910 --> 01:57:11,200
- What's the plan?
- I drown, and you tow me back to the rig.

1160
01:57:11,250 --> 01:57:12,300
No. No!

1161
01:57:12,650 --> 01:57:15,400
- Yes! This water's...
- No!
- ...only a couple of degrees above freezing.

1162
01:57:15,570 --> 01:57:19,600
I'll... go into deep hypothermia.
My blood will go like ice water.

1163
01:57:20,250 --> 01:57:22,850
Right? My body systems will slow down.
They won't stop.

1164
01:57:22,900 --> 01:57:27,550
- Lins...
- You tow me back and I can... I can be revived after maybe...

1165
01:57:27,600 --> 01:57:30,350
- ...10 or 15 minutes.
- Lins, put this on! You put it on!

1166
01:57:30,350 --> 01:57:30,750
- No, it's the only way! You just put this on!
Put this on. You know I'm right.
- 10 or 15 minutes.
- Lins, put this on! You put it on!

1167
01:57:30,750 --> 01:57:35,130
No, it's the only way! You just put this on!
Put this on. You know I'm right.

1168
01:57:35,380 --> 01:57:39,980
Please! It's the only way. You've got
all the... stuff on the rig to do this.

1169
01:57:40,410 --> 01:57:42,300
Put this on. Bud, please!

1170
01:57:43,800 --> 01:57:45,050
- This is insane.
- I know.

1171
01:57:45,950 --> 01:57:46,900
Oh, my God.

1172
01:57:47,750 --> 01:57:49,150
- Are you OK?
- It's the only way.

1173
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,250
All right. Here. Hold this.

1174
01:57:54,950 --> 01:57:56,550
Son of a bitch. Hold on, Lindsey.

1175
01:57:59,600 --> 01:58:00,700
You can do this, you know.

1176
01:58:06,700 --> 01:58:09,150
- You can do this.
- God, Lins... I...

1177
01:58:09,250 --> 01:58:11,200
I know. You can tell me later.

1178
01:58:29,700 --> 01:58:31,700
This is maybe not such a good idea!

1179
01:58:33,750 --> 01:58:35,450
Oh, my God!

1180
01:58:36,100 --> 01:58:38,050
Bud! No!

1181
01:58:47,300 --> 01:58:50,350
I can't! Oh, Bud, I'm scared!

1182
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:25,820
NO!!!

1183
01:59:48,360 --> 01:59:49,450
I got him! I got him!

1184
01:59:49,710 --> 01:59:51,930
- Where?
- Oh, my God! It's Lindsey.

1185
01:59:51,950 --> 01:59:54,900
- Deepcore! Deepcore, do you read? Over.
- Yeah, we got you, Bud.

1186
01:59:54,950 --> 01:59:56,700
- We're here.
- Go to the infirmary.

1187
01:59:57,750 --> 02:00:00,550
Get the cart, oxygen, defib' kit...

1188
02:00:01,420 --> 02:00:05,600
...adrenaline in a 10cc syringe,
and some heating blankets. You got all that?

1189
02:00:05,800 --> 02:00:08,300
- Got it.
- Meet me at the moon pool and make it fast!

1190
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:09,750
Now! Come on! Let's go!

1191
02:00:10,250 --> 02:00:11,350
Hippy, get the hot packs!

1192
02:00:11,850 --> 02:00:12,650
Got 'em!

1193
02:00:29,800 --> 02:00:30,800
Here he comes!

1194
02:00:38,990 --> 02:00:40,750
- Watch her head. Watch her head.
- I got it. I got it.

1195
02:00:41,150 --> 02:00:41,950
Watch her feet.

1196
02:00:45,400 --> 02:00:46,750
Watch her head comin' down. Watch her head.

1197
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,700
- Clear it out. Clear it out. Is she clear?
- Come on!
- Is she clear?

1198
02:00:57,050 --> 02:00:59,150
Get the defib’ ready. Hurry up, Cat.

1199
02:00:59,400 --> 02:01:00,900
OK. OK. Got it.

1200
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:03,750
- OK?
- Yeah.

1201
02:01:05,730 --> 02:01:08,600
- Three-one thousand, four-one thousand, five-one thousand...
- Breathe!

1202
02:01:10,610 --> 02:01:13,050
One-one thousand, two-one thousand, three-one thousand...

1203
02:01:13,740 --> 02:01:16,150
N-N-N-No! You gotta have bare skin or it won't work!

1204
02:01:17,130 --> 02:01:18,800
Three-one thousand, four-one thousand...

1205
02:01:20,250 --> 02:01:21,050
Here.

1206
02:01:22,670 --> 02:01:23,540
Is that right? Is this it?

1207
02:01:23,550 --> 02:01:25,150
- Bud, I got it.
- Well, do it!

1208
02:01:25,900 --> 02:01:26,600
Breathe!

1209
02:01:27,920 --> 02:01:30,050
- Come on! Zap her!
- Clear!

1210
02:01:32,050 --> 02:01:34,250
- Come on, baby! Oh, Christ!
- Nothing.

1211
02:01:34,450 --> 02:01:35,250
Breathe.

1212
02:01:36,530 --> 02:01:40,250
- I'll jack it up to 300.
- Do it again, One Night. Zap her again.

1213
02:01:40,450 --> 02:01:42,500
It's going, it's going, it's going. It's charging.

1214
02:01:43,350 --> 02:01:46,800
Charging... charging... charging...

1215
02:01:46,850 --> 02:01:48,050
- Now!
- ...clear!

1216
02:01:50,100 --> 02:01:51,750
- Anything?
- No pulse.

1217
02:01:51,980 --> 02:01:54,250
- Come on, baby!
- Just charging 1 more time.

1218
02:01:54,600 --> 02:01:56,800
Zap her again. Come on!

1219
02:01:58,300 --> 02:01:59,450
- Come on!
- Clear!

1220
02:02:03,090 --> 02:02:04,250
God! No pulse.

1221
02:02:04,270 --> 02:02:06,750
Flat, it's flat. Goddamn! It's flat.

1222
02:02:06,800 --> 02:02:07,850
Get outta here.

1223
02:02:09,490 --> 02:02:12,450
One, two, three, four, five-one thousand.

1224
02:02:12,850 --> 02:02:15,350
One, two, three, four... breathe!

1225
02:02:15,890 --> 02:02:18,650
One, two, three, four... breathe!

1226
02:02:27,090 --> 02:02:29,500
Come on, baby.
One-one thousand, two-one thousand...

1227
02:02:29,550 --> 02:02:31,310
...three-one thousand, four-one thousand...

1228
02:02:32,540 --> 02:02:37,100
...come on, baby. One-one thousand, two-one thousand,
three-one thousand, four-one thousand, five-one thousand...

1229
02:02:37,200 --> 02:02:40,700
- ...come on, baby! Breathe! Come on!
Two-one thousand, three-one thousand...
- Bud...

1230
02:02:41,500 --> 02:02:43,350
Bud... Bud...

1231
02:02:46,700 --> 02:02:48,100
It's all over, man.

1232
02:02:50,970 --> 02:02:52,150
It's all over.

1233
02:02:53,250 --> 02:02:54,350
I'm sorry.

1234
02:02:55,550 --> 02:02:56,750
No pulse.

1235
02:03:19,700 --> 02:03:20,800
NO!!!

1236
02:03:21,420 --> 02:03:23,750
No, she has a strong heart!
She wants to live!

1237
02:03:24,300 --> 02:03:26,050
Come on, Lins! Come on, baby!

1238
02:04:00,100 --> 02:04:02,700
- Zap her again! Do it!
- Charging.

1239
02:04:02,720 --> 02:04:03,750
Do it!
- Charging.

1240
02:04:10,900 --> 02:04:11,560
Clear.

1241
02:04:12,020 --> 02:04:12,900
Clear!

1242
02:04:16,090 --> 02:04:17,150
Get outta here!

1243
02:04:24,760 --> 02:04:27,600
Come on. Breathe, baby.
Goddamn it! Breathe!

1244
02:04:28,410 --> 02:04:32,000
Goddamn it, you bitch! You never backed
away from anything in your life! Now fight!

1245
02:04:32,520 --> 02:04:34,270
Fight! Fight!

1246
02:04:34,440 --> 02:04:36,150
Right now! Do it!

1247
02:04:36,880 --> 02:04:38,400
Fight, goddamn it!

1248
02:04:40,270 --> 02:04:41,240
FIGHT!!!

1249
02:04:41,360 --> 02:04:42,100
FIGHT!!!

1250
02:04:42,200 --> 02:04:43,450
FIGHT!!!

1251
02:04:52,760 --> 02:04:54,400
Lins? That's it, Lindsey.

1252
02:04:55,080 --> 02:04:56,350
That's it, Lins. You can do it.

1253
02:04:56,980 --> 02:04:59,500
That's it, Lins. Come on back, baby. Come on.

1254
02:04:59,990 --> 02:05:01,100
You can do it, baby.

1255
02:05:12,350 --> 02:05:13,250
Get her some air.

1256
02:05:15,380 --> 02:05:16,300
Breathe Lindsey.

1257
02:05:20,430 --> 02:05:21,720
You did it, ace!

1258
02:05:38,050 --> 02:05:40,150
- Make sure... Make sure her heart's good.
- OK.

1259
02:05:57,120 --> 02:05:59,100
Big boys don't cry, remember?

1260
02:06:05,700 --> 02:06:06,700
Hi, lady.

1261
02:06:08,890 --> 02:06:10,050
Hi, tough guy.

1262
02:06:14,350 --> 02:06:15,850
I guess it worked, didn't it?

1263
02:06:16,150 --> 02:06:17,500
Yeah. Of course it did.

1264
02:06:19,800 --> 02:06:21,250
You're never wrong, are you?

1265
02:06:24,250 --> 02:06:25,450
How you feelin'?

1266
02:06:27,380 --> 02:06:28,700
I feel better.

1267
02:06:30,150 --> 02:06:31,650
What did you do to me?

1268
02:06:38,370 --> 02:06:40,270
Next time it's your turn, OK?

1269
02:06:43,600 --> 02:06:45,060
Yeah, you got that right.

1270
02:06:46,150 --> 02:06:50,500
OK, these are so your eyes can focus
in the breathing fluid. How's that feel?

1271
02:06:51,890 --> 02:06:53,950
If you can't see, you can't disarm the bomb right?

1272
02:06:54,500 --> 02:06:57,550
OK. With this much weight,
you're gonna fall like a brick.

1273
02:06:58,950 --> 02:07:02,250
We've still got about an hour,
so you should get there in plenty of time.

1274
02:07:03,150 --> 02:07:07,200
When you get down there, all you gotta do is
cut 1 wire, drop the weights and come on home.

1275
02:07:11,650 --> 02:07:14,250
- Hand me that wrench over there will ya?
- Maybe I oughta check out everything.

1276
02:07:18,050 --> 02:07:20,100
That's loose. I'll fix that up.

1277
02:07:21,320 --> 02:07:24,070
Bud, you don't have to do this.

1278
02:07:25,450 --> 02:07:26,650
Somebody's gotta do it.

1279
02:07:27,380 --> 02:07:28,850
Well it doesn't have to be you.

1280
02:07:29,820 --> 02:07:30,800
Who then?

1281
02:07:35,760 --> 02:07:39,550
So, what, I can hear you
but I can't talk, right?

1282
02:07:39,640 --> 02:07:42,160
The fluid prevents the larynx
from making sound. Excuse me.

1283
02:07:42,550 --> 02:07:44,600
- It'll feel a little strange.
- Yeah, no shit.

1284
02:07:45,610 --> 02:07:49,080
I gotta warn you all... I'm a pretty lousy typist.

1285
02:07:53,450 --> 02:07:54,600
The moment of truth.

1286
02:07:56,400 --> 02:07:57,950
- Come on. Let's go.
- Let's go.

1287
02:07:59,560 --> 02:08:00,310
Easy.

1288
02:08:03,100 --> 02:08:05,100
- I need it in the front a little bit.
- OK.

1289
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:06,650
- Thank you.
- You got it.

1290
02:08:08,660 --> 02:08:10,450
- Set.
- Set.
- Clamp?

1291
02:08:10,470 --> 02:08:11,150
Set.

1292
02:08:21,830 --> 02:08:23,400
OK, let's rock and roll!

1293
02:08:25,630 --> 02:08:26,350
Crack it.

1294
02:08:27,610 --> 02:08:29,050
- Headset...
- Headset, please.

1295
02:08:31,430 --> 02:08:33,850
- OK.
- Relax now, Bud. Just relax.

1296
02:08:35,200 --> 02:08:36,850
- Bud.
- Relax now, Bud.

1297
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:37,750
Watch me.

1298
02:08:38,600 --> 02:08:40,600
- Relax.
- OK? Watch me. Watch me.
- OK.

1299
02:08:40,970 --> 02:08:42,900
Doin' fine. No, don't hold your breath. Take it in.

1300
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,750
Just let yourself take it in. Take it in.

1301
02:08:47,470 --> 02:08:50,750
- That's it.
- Oh man.
- Don't hold your breath now. Take it in. There you go.

1302
02:08:51,600 --> 02:08:53,550
Don't hold your breath. Take it in. That's it.

1303
02:08:53,600 --> 02:08:55,900
- There you go.
- Bud!

1304
02:08:56,550 --> 02:08:58,150
This is not normal!

1305
02:08:58,550 --> 02:09:01,300
It's normal! It'll pass in a second! It's perfectly normal!

1306
02:09:01,940 --> 02:09:03,600
- This is normal?
- It's perfectly normal.

1307
02:09:04,650 --> 02:09:08,400
We all breathe liquid for 9 months, Bud.
Your body will remember. That's it.

1308
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:10,150
That's it.

1309
02:09:11,300 --> 02:09:14,050
- Perfectly normal.
- Oh my, Christ! He's breathing!

1310
02:09:14,400 --> 02:09:15,400
Give me that.

1311
02:09:17,100 --> 02:09:19,400
- Can you hear me?
- There he goes.

1312
02:09:19,500 --> 02:09:22,150
- Yes? Yes?
- He's got it. That's it.
- OK. Bud...

1313
02:09:22,950 --> 02:09:23,950
Try your keypad.

1314
02:09:39,850 --> 02:09:40,850
I already have.

1315
02:09:44,950 --> 02:09:45,750
- OK.
- Great.

1316
02:09:45,770 --> 02:09:46,450
Let's go!

1317
02:09:47,680 --> 02:09:48,450
- OK.

1318
02:09:53,800 --> 02:09:56,150
- OK, Hippy, you got that?
- Hold on, Jammer.

1319
02:09:57,200 --> 02:09:58,450
Easy. Easy.

1320
02:09:58,670 --> 02:10:01,050
Watch out. Watch his side. Watch the back.

1321
02:10:02,750 --> 02:10:03,550
Careful.

1322
02:10:06,220 --> 02:10:10,150
I redid Little Geek's chip the same as Big Geek!

1323
02:10:10,450 --> 02:10:12,350
It should take you straight there!

1324
02:10:12,580 --> 02:10:14,790
All you have to do is hang on!

1325
02:12:01,970 --> 02:12:03,060
What's his depth?

1326
02:12:03,320 --> 02:12:06,500
- 3,200 feet.
- Your depth is 3,200 feet.

1327
02:12:06,520 --> 02:12:09,950
You're doing fine. Now,
you better watch out for crane wreckage.

1328
02:12:09,990 --> 02:12:11,750
You should, you should be almost to it.

1329
02:12:23,500 --> 02:12:25,250
4,800 feet. It's official.

1330
02:12:25,450 --> 02:12:26,450
Yeah.

1331
02:12:27,200 --> 02:12:30,800
Bud, according to Monk here, you just
set a record for the deepest suit dive.

1332
02:12:31,890 --> 02:12:34,560
Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this
when you got up this morning, huh?

1333
02:12:44,090 --> 02:12:46,210
1 mile down. Still grinnin'.

1334
02:13:02,720 --> 02:13:04,140
8,500 feet.

1335
02:13:06,770 --> 02:13:08,150
8,500 feet, Bud.

1336
02:13:08,200 --> 02:13:09,600
Everything OK?

1337
02:13:12,250 --> 02:13:15,550
Ask him about pressure effects.
Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.

1338
02:13:18,220 --> 02:13:19,950
Ensign Monk wants to know how you feel.

1339
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:34,750
It's starting. It hits the nervous system first.

1340
02:13:35,280 --> 02:13:37,550
Keep talking Lindsey. Let him hear your voice.

1341
02:13:38,060 --> 02:13:40,050
OK, Bud. Your depth is 8,900 feet.

1342
02:13:40,100 --> 02:13:42,930
- You're doing fine.
- No, Lindsey.

1343
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:45,090
Talk to him.

1344
02:13:52,750 --> 02:13:53,750
Bud...

1345
02:13:55,100 --> 02:13:58,350
...there's some... some things I need to say.

1346
02:14:00,380 --> 02:14:01,670
It's hard for me, you know.

1347
02:14:03,980 --> 02:14:06,250
It's not easy being a cast-iron bitch.

1348
02:14:07,080 --> 02:14:09,450
It takes discipline and years of training.

1349
02:14:11,390 --> 02:14:13,050
A lot of people don't appreciate that.

1350
02:14:16,770 --> 02:14:19,350
Jesus, I'm sorry
I can't tell you these things to your face.

1351
02:14:20,750 --> 02:14:23,300
I have to wait till you're alone in the dark...

1352
02:14:24,140 --> 02:14:26,660
...freezing, and there's 10,000 feet of water between us.

1353
02:14:29,160 --> 02:14:30,750
I'm sorry. I'm, I'm rambling.

1354
02:14:44,770 --> 02:14:46,440
Comin' up on the big ten thou'.

1355
02:14:54,350 --> 02:14:55,600
12,000 feet. Jesus!

1356
02:14:55,640 --> 02:14:57,350
- I don't believe he's doin' this!
- Hippy!

1357
02:14:58,330 --> 02:14:59,850
Shut up! What's wrong with you?

1358
02:15:04,590 --> 02:15:05,800
Bud, how are you doing?

1359
02:15:08,600 --> 02:15:09,700
Signal's fading.

1360
02:15:09,800 --> 02:15:12,600
No! No, Bud, I'm not going away.
I'm right here.

1361
02:15:12,750 --> 02:15:16,750
Kill everything we don't need.
Uh, Catfish, knock out those exterior lights. Come on now. Go! Go!

1362
02:15:16,900 --> 02:15:19,750
Run it through the digital processor!
Cook it as much as you can!

1363
02:15:20,750 --> 02:15:22,300
I am right here with you, Bud.

1364
02:15:23,310 --> 02:15:24,480
Bud, this is Lindsey.

1365
02:15:25,050 --> 02:15:27,350
Please. I'm right here with you.

1366
02:15:28,200 --> 02:15:31,750
OK? So try and stay calm.
I'm right here, all right?

1367
02:15:38,330 --> 02:15:39,250
Bud.

1368
02:15:42,280 --> 02:15:43,200
He's losing it.

1369
02:15:43,620 --> 02:15:47,250
- Talk to him. Keep him with us.
- Comin' up on 16,000...

1370
02:15:47,300 --> 02:15:49,600
No, B-Bud, it's the pressure. All right?

1371
02:15:49,620 --> 02:15:51,700
You have to listen to my voice.
You have to try.

1372
02:15:52,270 --> 02:15:55,800
Concentrate, all right?
Just listen to my voice. Please.

1373
02:15:56,850 --> 02:15:58,750
17,000 feet.

1374
02:15:59,200 --> 02:16:01,050
Christ almighty, this is insane.

1375
02:16:01,870 --> 02:16:03,700
Bud? I'm not getting anything!

1376
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:11,900
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Oh come on! No! No!
- What? What!?

1377
02:16:12,110 --> 02:16:14,900
- Little Geek just folded.
- Oh, Jesus.

1378
02:17:05,590 --> 02:17:07,400
He can still make it.

1379
02:17:08,350 --> 02:17:09,350
OK.

1380
02:17:12,790 --> 02:17:13,460
Bud?

1381
02:17:15,410 --> 02:17:17,250
I know how alone you feel.

1382
02:17:19,440 --> 02:17:23,050
Alone in all that... cold... blackness.

1383
02:17:26,770 --> 02:17:31,100
But I'm there in the dark with you.
Oh, Bud. You're not alone.

1384
02:17:35,550 --> 02:17:37,100
Oh, God!

1385
02:17:37,720 --> 02:17:39,250
You remember that time...

1386
02:17:40,330 --> 02:17:42,700
...you were pretty drunk.
You probably don't remember.

1387
02:17:43,390 --> 02:17:47,500
But the power went out in that little apartment
we had on Orange Street.

1388
02:17:48,530 --> 02:17:53,200
We were staring at that 1 little candle
and I, I said something really dumb like...

1389
02:17:53,980 --> 02:17:55,500
..."That candle is me," like...

1390
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:01,550
...like everyone of us is out there
alone in the dark in this life.

1391
02:18:03,400 --> 02:18:08,050
And you just... you just lit up another candle
and you put it beside mine...

1392
02:18:08,080 --> 02:18:11,250
...and you said, "no. See, that's me. That's me."

1393
02:18:12,910 --> 02:18:15,250
And we stared at the 2 candles and then...

1394
02:18:18,420 --> 02:18:21,750
...well, if you remember any of this,
I'm sure you remember the next part.

1395
02:18:26,020 --> 02:18:28,290
But there are 2 candles in the dark.

1396
02:18:30,450 --> 02:18:31,600
I'm with you.

1397
02:18:32,800 --> 02:18:35,850
I'll always be with you, Bud. I promise that.

1398
02:18:49,430 --> 02:18:50,550
How you doin' partner?

1399
02:18:52,500 --> 02:18:54,400
You still with us? Come back.

1400
02:18:55,720 --> 02:18:57,650
You talk to us, Buddy boy.

1401
02:18:58,040 --> 02:18:59,700
- Come on.
- Bud?

1402
02:19:00,400 --> 02:19:01,500
Talk to me, Bud.

1403
02:19:02,070 --> 02:19:03,850
Now, come on. You hangin' in there?

1404
02:19:04,750 --> 02:19:07,460
You just... you have to talk to me, Bud! Please!

1405
02:19:07,900 --> 02:19:09,730
I need to know if you're OK.

1406
02:19:24,740 --> 02:19:26,440
You s... you see light?

1407
02:19:27,150 --> 02:19:28,500
What kind of light, Bud?

1408
02:19:30,910 --> 02:19:32,350
He's hallucinating badly.

1409
02:19:55,960 --> 02:19:59,100
- He made it.
- Oh, my God.
- ... man.

1410
02:20:01,690 --> 02:20:02,580
OK, Bud.

1411
02:20:03,210 --> 02:20:05,050
We'll go step by step.

1412
02:20:05,650 --> 02:20:09,450
Remove the detonator housing
by unscrewing it...

1413
02:20:09,700 --> 02:20:11,300
...counterclockwise.

1414
02:20:42,400 --> 02:20:45,050
All right, Bud. You have to cut...

1415
02:20:45,100 --> 02:20:47,650
...the ground wire. Not the lead wire.

1416
02:20:49,090 --> 02:20:51,350
It's the blue wire with the white stripe.

1417
02:20:51,550 --> 02:20:53,350
Not, I repeat...

1418
02:20:53,950 --> 02:20:57,050
...not the black wire with the yellow stripe.

1419
02:21:54,860 --> 02:21:56,200
Quiet! Quiet! Save your air.

1420
02:21:56,550 --> 02:21:59,150
Bud, give me a reading
off your liquid oxygen gauge.

1421
02:22:06,920 --> 02:22:07,730
What?

1422
02:22:09,250 --> 02:22:12,450
- It took him 30 minutes just to get down there!
- Bud! Do you hear me?

1423
02:22:12,860 --> 02:22:14,550
You drop your weights and start back now Bud!

1424
02:22:15,200 --> 02:22:17,880
That gauge could be wrong. Do you hear me?

1425
02:22:18,170 --> 02:22:22,400
Just drop your weights and start back now!
Your gauge could be wrong!

1426
02:22:22,790 --> 02:22:26,650
Your gauge could be wrong!
You drop your weights and start back now!

1427
02:22:30,660 --> 02:22:35,940
No, you won't stay there. You drop your weights.
You can breathe shallow! Do you hear me?

1428
02:22:36,280 --> 02:22:39,040
Bud, please listen to me! Please! Goddamn it!

1429
02:22:39,180 --> 02:22:41,500
You dragged me back from that bottomless pit!

1430
02:22:41,550 --> 02:22:44,590
You can't leave me here alone now. Please!

1431
02:22:45,360 --> 02:22:47,750
Oh, God, Virgil! Please!

1432
02:22:48,020 --> 02:22:49,400
Please!

1433
02:23:30,800 --> 02:23:32,290
I love you.

1434
02:28:35,050 --> 02:28:36,000
Howdy.

1435
02:28:36,920 --> 02:28:37,840
Uh...

1436
02:28:38,850 --> 02:28:40,050
...how are you guys doin'?

1437
02:28:45,990 --> 02:28:49,500
Attempts to convene a summit
between heads of state have collapsed...

1438
02:28:49,920 --> 02:28:52,800
The Soviet build-up of tanks and aircraft has...

1439
02:28:53,250 --> 02:28:57,750
All citizens to stay on their jobs, restrict unnecessary travel...

1440
02:28:58,080 --> 02:29:00,320
...just moments ago is what officials are calling
an unprovoked attack.

1441
02:29:00,400 --> 02:29:01,530
Oh, shit!

1442
02:29:01,550 --> 02:29:04,650
Across the country, National Guard units have been mobilized...

1443
02:29:04,770 --> 02:29:08,550
...and all civil defense volunteers
have been called to full-time duty.

1444
02:29:11,600 --> 02:29:14,350
You watch our TV.
That's what you're telling me.

1445
02:29:14,950 --> 02:29:18,400
- That you know what's going on up there?
- Seismologists are reporting...

1446
02:29:18,450 --> 02:29:21,250
...an enormous disturbance throughout the world's oceans...

1447
02:29:21,270 --> 02:29:24,120
...which apparently began about 15 minutes ago.

1448
02:29:24,150 --> 02:29:29,150
They are acoustic shock waves like tsunamis,
but with no apparent seismological source.

1449
02:29:29,200 --> 02:29:32,500
Uh, the waves are propagating towards
the shorelines of every continent.

1450
02:29:33,150 --> 02:29:35,530
- I'm so sorry. That's...
- Dr. Berg, would you please...

1451
02:29:35,550 --> 02:29:37,640
Young lady. Young lady, listen to me.

1452
02:29:38,040 --> 02:29:40,650
I don't know. We don't know
what's going on yet. We don't have a clue.

1453
02:29:43,350 --> 02:29:45,160
The horizon has already grown dark.

1454
02:29:45,400 --> 02:29:48,100
People are running everywhere.
It's, it's sheer panic.

1455
02:29:48,700 --> 02:29:49,750
Stay on me!

1456
02:29:49,920 --> 02:29:54,200
Uh, the wave... the wave is, uh,
I don't know, maybe 1,000 feet high already.

1457
02:29:54,580 --> 02:29:55,900
Getting bigger as I'm watching...

1458
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:57,400
...still miles out.

1459
02:29:58,910 --> 02:30:00,570
- Oh my God.
- Get outta here!

1460
02:30:00,600 --> 02:30:01,900
We're staying! We're staying!

1461
02:30:02,750 --> 02:30:03,850
Give it to me, then!

1462
02:30:04,350 --> 02:30:07,650
Uh, I don't even know if I'm still broadcasting.
I can't be sure.

1463
02:30:07,850 --> 02:30:11,400
- I'll just keep going as long as I can. Um...
- Get out of the way!

1464
02:30:14,990 --> 02:30:16,620
You guys are doing this.

1465
02:30:19,150 --> 02:30:21,800
You guys are doing this, right?
You can control water.

1466
02:30:22,950 --> 02:30:25,580
That's your technology,
but why are you doing this?

1467
02:30:46,150 --> 02:30:48,000
OK. That's enough. I get the point!

1468
02:30:50,530 --> 02:30:52,550
How do you know...

1469
02:30:52,570 --> 02:30:54,000
...they're really gonna do it?

1470
02:30:56,150 --> 02:31:00,000
Where do you get off passing judgment
on us? You can't be sure.

1471
02:31:00,750 --> 02:31:02,100
How do you know?

1472
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:58,370
You could've done it.

1473
02:34:02,790 --> 02:34:04,020
Why didn't you?

1474
02:35:22,750 --> 02:35:25,810
Deepcore, do you read?
This is Benthic Explorer. Over.

1475
02:35:26,160 --> 02:35:27,300
Do you hear, Deepcore?

1476
02:35:28,680 --> 02:35:31,500
Deepcore, do you read?
Do you read me, Deepcore?

1477
02:35:34,240 --> 02:35:37,180
Deepcore, do you read?
This is Benthic Explorer. Over.

1478
02:35:40,170 --> 02:35:42,200
Hell, yes, we read! Good of you to join us!

1479
02:35:42,400 --> 02:35:44,100
Copy, Deepcore. Hey, I've got 'em!

1480
02:35:45,160 --> 02:35:46,740
How's that storm goin' up there?

1481
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,730
Well, it's strange, It just sort of blew itself out all of a sudden.

1482
02:35:50,160 --> 02:35:52,350
Well, hell, son.
You'd better get a line down to us.

1483
02:35:52,400 --> 02:35:57,270
We're in moderately poor shape down here.
We've lost 7 people, including Bud.

1484
02:35:57,530 --> 02:36:01,550
And we're about out of O2,
so whatever you're gonna do, you better do it fast.

1485
02:36:03,300 --> 02:36:05,500
You boys make up your mind
how to get us outta here yet?

1486
02:36:05,950 --> 02:36:08,590
They're talking about
flying in a DSRV from Norfolk.

1487
02:36:08,700 --> 02:36:10,800
- I just wish I could've seen it.
- OK.

1488
02:36:11,370 --> 02:36:12,900
How long's that gonna take?

1489
02:36:12,950 --> 02:36:18,100
- ...and how do you stop a half-mile high tidal wave in...
- ...come into Guantanamo on a C133.

1490
02:36:20,810 --> 02:36:21,560
Hey...

1491
02:36:22,310 --> 02:36:26,500
- Hey... hey it's Bud!
- That's impossible.

1492
02:36:27,900 --> 02:36:29,900
- Do you read me Deepcore?
- No it's not.

1493
02:36:30,930 --> 02:36:31,900
Yes!

1494
02:36:33,190 --> 02:36:35,750
W-W-Wait. Wait. Wait.
We've got a message from Bud.

1495
02:36:35,850 --> 02:36:38,250
- Bud?
- What's it say?

1496
02:36:39,730 --> 02:36:40,650
Here. Here.

1497
02:36:42,950 --> 02:36:44,070
It says...

1498
02:36:45,050 --> 02:36:48,300
It says, uh, "Virgil Brigman back on the air."

1499
02:37:01,580 --> 02:37:04,300
"Have some new friends down here."

1500
02:37:04,970 --> 02:37:06,810
"Guess they've been here a while."

1501
02:37:16,630 --> 02:37:20,420
"They've left us alone, but it bothers them
to see us hurting each other."

1502
02:37:24,810 --> 02:37:26,040
"Getting out of hand."

1503
02:37:34,910 --> 02:37:37,380
"They sent a message. Hope you got it."

1504
02:37:38,130 --> 02:37:40,500
I'd say that's a big 10-4, Jack.

1505
02:37:42,350 --> 02:37:43,870
"They want us to grow up a bit...

1506
02:37:44,100 --> 02:37:46,340
...and, put away childish things."

1507
02:37:48,520 --> 02:37:51,700
"Of course, it's just a suggestion."

1508
02:38:00,060 --> 02:38:02,300
Looks like you boys
might be out of business.

1509
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:14,900
What the hell's goin' on?

1510
02:38:15,200 --> 02:38:17,000
One Night, get to sonar.

1511
02:38:17,450 --> 02:38:18,800
Good God almighty!

1512
02:38:20,820 --> 02:38:24,350
Fellas... I'm gettin' some awful big readings here.

1513
02:38:24,450 --> 02:38:26,650
- Somebody's comin' up the wall!
- What is it?

1514
02:38:26,670 --> 02:38:28,450
Whatever it is, it's major!

1515
02:38:57,750 --> 02:39:00,250
Something is definitely going on down there.

1516
02:39:01,700 --> 02:39:07,670
- Active is pinging back something really big.
It's huge and it's comin' up right underneath us.
- Where?
