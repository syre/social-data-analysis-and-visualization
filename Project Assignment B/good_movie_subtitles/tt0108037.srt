2
00:01:01,271 --> 00:01:05,108
and it happened
in the 1932 World Series.

3
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:08,653
The story goes that in the bottom
of the ninth inning with two outs,

4
00:01:08,778 --> 00:01:11,448
a full count
and the tying run on base,

5
00:01:11,531 --> 00:01:14,784
Babe Ruth raised his arm and pointed
to the center field bleachers.

6
00:01:14,868 --> 00:01:19,372
No one believed it,
because nobody had ever done it before.

7
00:01:19,497 --> 00:01:22,208
But The Babe
was calling his shot.

8
00:01:22,334 --> 00:01:28,173
On the next pitch, the Great Bambino
hit a towering 400-foot home run.

9
00:01:28,298 --> 00:01:31,217
And even although he'd been
a hero before that,

10
00:01:31,343 --> 00:01:34,429
that's pretty much
how he became a legend.

11
00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:38,683
Thirty years later, a kid named
Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez...

12
00:01:38,808 --> 00:01:40,810
became a neighborhood legend.

13
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:43,104
It was in the greatest summer
of my life...

14
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:45,106
when he taught me
to play baseball,

15
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,400
and he became my best friend.

16
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:51,196
And he got me out of the biggest
pickle I'd ever be in.

17
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:23,687
Go! Go! Go!

18
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:05,562
Come over at 9:00.

19
00:03:05,645 --> 00:03:07,564
All right.
See you later.

20
00:03:13,737 --> 00:03:17,115
I moved to the neighborhood
two weeks before school let out.

21
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:18,491
It was the same summer
that Dodger Maury Wills would
break the stolen bases record.

22
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:21,995
It was the same summer
that Dodger Maury Wills would
break the stolen bases record.

23
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,205
So with something
that incredible going on,

24
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:28,418
it should've started off with loads
of great things happening for me,

25
00:03:28,501 --> 00:03:30,545
but it didn't.

26
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:35,008
I was from another state,
and I didn't have a single
friend in a thousand miles.

27
00:03:36,301 --> 00:03:38,720
It was a lousy way
to end up the fifth grade,

28
00:03:38,803 --> 00:03:41,931
'cause I had zip time
to make friends before summer.

29
00:03:42,015 --> 00:03:45,935
And that's about
where it all started.

30
00:03:50,148 --> 00:03:53,401
My real dad died
when I was just a little kid.

31
00:03:53,485 --> 00:03:57,947
My mom had married Bill about a year
before we moved to the Valley.

32
00:03:58,031 --> 00:04:02,994
At the time, he and I were still
getting used to each other.

33
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:05,789
Yeah.

34
00:04:07,624 --> 00:04:10,752
- Um, Dad?
- Mm-hm m?

35
00:04:10,835 --> 00:04:12,754
I -I mean Bill.

36
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:17,759
- Remember you-- you promised
you'd teach me to play catch?
- Mm-hmm.

37
00:04:17,842 --> 00:04:20,053
Um,

38
00:04:20,178 --> 00:04:22,097
w-well,
could you teach me?

39
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:25,809
Yeah. Sure.

40
00:04:32,023 --> 00:04:33,900
Okay.

41
00:04:34,025 --> 00:04:36,236
- Okay?
- Thanks.

42
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:43,910
Sorry.

43
00:05:25,785 --> 00:05:29,080
I'd followed them
to the sandlot once after school.

44
00:05:29,164 --> 00:05:31,708
I'd never seen any place like it.

45
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,836
It was like their own little
baseball kingdom or something.

46
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:37,797
It was the greatest place
I'd ever seen anyway.

47
00:05:37,922 --> 00:05:39,883
- Bertram.
- But they were good,

48
00:05:39,966 --> 00:05:41,885
- real good.
- Come on, Bertram!

49
00:05:41,968 --> 00:05:44,804
And all I had was a plastic toy mitt
that my grandmother gave me...

50
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:47,307
for my birthday when I was six.

51
00:05:47,432 --> 00:05:51,645
But when I finally got up enough guts to
go out there and try and make friends,

52
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:55,357
I found out that they never kept score,
they never chose sides,

53
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,734
they never even really
stopped playing the game.

54
00:05:57,817 --> 00:06:02,322
It just went on forever.
Every day they picked up where
they left off the day before.

55
00:06:02,447 --> 00:06:05,450
- It was like an endless dream game.
- Come on! Come on!

56
00:06:05,575 --> 00:06:08,578
There was only eight of them,
so they didn't have a whole team.

57
00:06:08,662 --> 00:06:12,582
So even though I didn't know
how to play, I figured
I could be the ninth man...

58
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:15,835
and maybe just stand in the outfield
somewhere and take up space.

59
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,714
- Squints!
- Of course, if I'd have known what was
gonna happen when I got there,

60
00:06:19,798 --> 00:06:24,302
- I got it!
- I probably never would've gone.

61
00:06:24,427 --> 00:06:26,096
- Nice catch.
- Yeah.

62
00:06:32,268 --> 00:06:36,398
Come on!

63
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:57,836
Come on, Benny,
hit a homer!

64
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,838
- Come on!
- Hey, batter, batter, batter!

65
00:06:59,963 --> 00:07:02,173
- Whoa!
- Watch out!

66
00:07:22,861 --> 00:07:25,447
Okay, I'll get it!
Get it.

67
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:29,826
Don't be a goofus. Don't be a goofus!
Don't be a goofus!

68
00:07:38,376 --> 00:07:42,672
- Throw the ball back! Come on!
- Yeah, hurry up!

69
00:07:53,516 --> 00:07:55,685
We are waiting!

70
00:07:55,769 --> 00:07:57,729
Come on! Throw it!

71
00:08:02,942 --> 00:08:06,655
- Come on, toss me the ball!
- Come on!

72
00:08:06,738 --> 00:08:08,698
Come on!

73
00:08:14,287 --> 00:08:18,792
Oh, my God!

74
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:22,545
My life's over.

75
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:25,131
Did you see that hand?

76
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,679
If it wasn't for Benny,

77
00:08:30,762 --> 00:08:33,431
I never would've made
a single friend that summer,

78
00:08:33,556 --> 00:08:36,101
'cause all the rest of those
guys thought I was a lost cause.

79
00:08:37,477 --> 00:08:40,021
Even before we became friends,

80
00:08:40,105 --> 00:08:44,567
Benny and me were connected, connected
for the one moment later that summer...

81
00:08:44,651 --> 00:08:46,695
when I'd get us all
into the biggest pickle...

82
00:08:46,778 --> 00:08:49,572
any of us had ever seen.

83
00:08:57,247 --> 00:08:59,791
Night, hon.

84
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:03,420
Oh, I'm sorry, Mom.
It was an accident.

85
00:09:12,762 --> 00:09:16,016
Scotty, have you made
any friends yet?

86
00:09:17,642 --> 00:09:20,061
- No.
- Why not, honey?

87
00:09:22,147 --> 00:09:24,149
'Cause I'm still new.

88
00:09:24,274 --> 00:09:28,528
I don't want you sitting around in here
all summer fiddling with this stuff...

89
00:09:28,653 --> 00:09:30,655
like you did last summer
and the one before.

90
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,283
I know you're smart,
and I'm proud of you.

91
00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:37,912
I want you to get out into the fresh air
and make some friends.

92
00:09:37,996 --> 00:09:41,458
Run around,
scrape your knees, get dirty.

93
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,460
Climb trees, hop fences.

94
00:09:43,543 --> 00:09:46,796
Get into trouble,
for crying out loud.

95
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,883
Not too much, but some.
You have my permission.

96
00:09:50,008 --> 00:09:53,470
How many mothers do you know who
say something like that to their sons?

97
00:09:53,553 --> 00:09:56,264
Well, none mothers, I guess.

98
00:09:56,348 --> 00:10:01,019
Honey, I want you to make
some friends this summer. Lots of them.

99
00:10:02,145 --> 00:10:04,105
Yeah, I know.

100
00:10:04,189 --> 00:10:06,107
But I'm not good
at anything, Mom.

101
00:10:06,191 --> 00:10:08,109
Face it,
I'm just an egghead.

102
00:10:08,193 --> 00:10:12,656
Honey, you'll always be just an egghead
with an attitude like that.

103
00:10:29,172 --> 00:10:31,383
Well?

104
00:10:33,093 --> 00:10:35,428
Well?

105
00:10:35,553 --> 00:10:39,224
- He's too busy, Mom.
- Oh, no, honey, he's not.
He has some time.

106
00:10:39,349 --> 00:10:42,435
You go on back out there
and ask him.

107
00:10:44,562 --> 00:10:46,648
- Uh, Bill, uh--
- Yeah?

108
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:49,943
I mean, Dad, uh, can we--

109
00:10:50,068 --> 00:10:54,406
I mean, could you, like you said,
teach me to play catch?

110
00:10:54,531 --> 00:10:56,866
Yeah. Sure.

111
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,868
But I gotta get
this done, okay?

112
00:10:58,952 --> 00:11:01,454
- Okay, thanks.
- All right.

113
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:03,415
- Bill?
- Yeah?

114
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:07,127
Uh, couldn't you take a break
and teach him now?

115
00:11:07,252 --> 00:11:09,587
- Mom, it's okay, really.
- Honey,

116
00:11:09,713 --> 00:11:12,132
I said I would, and I will,
but I'm under the gun here.

117
00:11:12,257 --> 00:11:14,467
How long could it take?

118
00:11:14,592 --> 00:11:16,970
Can't you spare half an hour
and show him now?

119
00:11:17,095 --> 00:11:19,597
- Mom, really, it's okay.
- All right.

120
00:11:21,349 --> 00:11:24,019
Okay. I'll get my glove.

121
00:11:27,272 --> 00:11:30,859
See? I told you.

122
00:11:30,942 --> 00:11:33,153
Oh, great.

123
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:35,697
All right, Scotty, get down
to that end of the yard.

124
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,365
Okay.

125
00:11:37,449 --> 00:11:40,118
Now, the key to this game
is keeping your eye on the ball.

126
00:11:40,243 --> 00:11:43,788
No matter whether you're in the field
or at bat, eye on the ball, okay?

127
00:11:43,913 --> 00:11:45,957
All right. Uh, yeah.
I think so.

128
00:11:46,082 --> 00:11:48,543
Where the ball goes,
your glove should go. Got it?

129
00:11:48,626 --> 00:11:50,462
Okay.

130
00:11:50,587 --> 00:11:52,422
Okay. All right.

131
00:11:56,384 --> 00:11:58,845
Darn. Sorry.

132
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,764
It's all right.
All right.

133
00:12:09,064 --> 00:12:11,608
Um-- Uh, here.

134
00:12:14,194 --> 00:12:16,112
Okay.

135
00:12:16,196 --> 00:12:18,281
Okay, I'm ready.

136
00:12:18,365 --> 00:12:22,118
Eye on the ball, okay?
Got it?

137
00:12:22,202 --> 00:12:23,453
Okay.

138
00:12:23,536 --> 00:12:26,289
If the ball moves,
move your glove. Got it?

139
00:12:26,373 --> 00:12:27,791
Yeah.

140
00:12:27,874 --> 00:12:30,293
All right. Here we go.

141
00:12:35,632 --> 00:12:38,385
Okay. You just need a bigger glove.
Throw it back to me this time.

142
00:12:41,137 --> 00:12:43,014
Throw it back.

143
00:12:58,446 --> 00:13:01,533
Okay. Scotty,
keep your eye on the ball.

144
00:13:01,658 --> 00:13:03,994
Okay. Got it.

145
00:13:04,077 --> 00:13:05,328
Okay.

146
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:09,207
Ow! Oh, my eye!

147
00:13:09,332 --> 00:13:12,460
Ow! Ow! Oh!

148
00:13:12,544 --> 00:13:14,462
Ow! Ow!

149
00:13:14,546 --> 00:13:17,757
- What happened?
- My eye.

150
00:13:17,882 --> 00:13:20,844
- Honey, get some ice. Ice.
- No, I got it.

151
00:13:20,969 --> 00:13:22,887
- Here you go.
- Those were for dinner.

152
00:13:22,971 --> 00:13:24,889
- Oh!
- Just hold it up there.

153
00:13:24,973 --> 00:13:26,891
Nice and hard.
Press it against-- Yeah.

154
00:13:26,975 --> 00:13:29,811
- I just took my eye off the ball, Mom.
- Yeah, but you caught it.

155
00:13:29,894 --> 00:13:32,605
Just keep that on for, like, an hour.

156
00:13:32,731 --> 00:13:35,608
It'll still be black,
but it won't swell.

157
00:13:35,734 --> 00:13:38,194
Sorry.

158
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,572
Gotta watch out
for that curve.

159
00:13:47,537 --> 00:13:49,414
Hey.

160
00:13:52,292 --> 00:13:55,420
I'm gonna play some ball.
We need an extra guy. You wanna go?

161
00:13:55,545 --> 00:13:59,007
- No. Thanks.
- Why not? Don't you like baseball?

162
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:01,509
- Oh, yeah, but--
- But what?

163
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,723
But my glove--
it's busted.

164
00:14:06,806 --> 00:14:11,186
Uh, see? Now I can't go.
Thanks, though.

165
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:13,104
It's okay.

166
00:14:14,272 --> 00:14:16,149
I got an extra one.

167
00:14:18,318 --> 00:14:20,278
Come on. Let's go.

168
00:14:23,114 --> 00:14:25,492
Mom, I'm gonna go
play some ball!

169
00:14:25,617 --> 00:14:27,494
I'll be back
in a little while.

170
00:14:27,619 --> 00:14:29,496
Come on. Let's go.

171
00:14:32,457 --> 00:14:35,377
And I'm Babe Ruth.

172
00:14:42,884 --> 00:14:45,470
Listen. Ready?

173
00:14:45,595 --> 00:14:48,139
Check this out.

174
00:14:48,264 --> 00:14:50,558
I'm the Great Bambino.

175
00:14:50,642 --> 00:14:52,769
What?

176
00:14:52,894 --> 00:14:55,897
- I'm the Great Bambino.
- What?

177
00:14:55,981 --> 00:14:58,191
I'm the Great Bambino.

178
00:14:58,316 --> 00:15:00,276
Oh!

179
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,195
Who's that?

180
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:08,118
What?

181
00:15:08,201 --> 00:15:11,121
I had no idea
who they were talking about.

182
00:15:11,204 --> 00:15:14,833
- What did he say?
- What, were you born in a barn, man?

183
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:16,835
Yeah, what planet
are you from?

184
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,254
But there was
no way I could let them know.

185
00:15:19,337 --> 00:15:21,548
You never heard
of the Sultan of Swat?

186
00:15:21,673 --> 00:15:23,591
The Titan of Terror?

187
00:15:23,675 --> 00:15:26,803
- The Colossus of Clout?
- The Colossus of Clout!

188
00:15:26,886 --> 00:15:30,515
- The King of Crash, man.
- So I lied.

189
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:34,019
Oh, yeah, the Great Bambino.
Of course.

190
00:15:34,144 --> 00:15:36,021
I thought you said,
"the Great Bambi."

191
00:15:36,146 --> 00:15:38,273
That wimpy deer?

192
00:15:38,356 --> 00:15:41,735
Yeah. I guess. Sorry.

193
00:15:44,487 --> 00:15:49,868
Anyway, Scott, that's
Timmy and Tommy Timmons,

194
00:15:49,993 --> 00:15:52,454
Mike "Squints" Palledorous,

195
00:15:52,537 --> 00:15:55,040
Alan McClellan--
we call him Yeah-Yeah--

196
00:15:55,123 --> 00:15:57,709
Bertram Grover Weeks,

197
00:15:57,834 --> 00:16:00,295
Kenny DeNunez
and Hamilton Porter.

198
00:16:00,378 --> 00:16:02,839
We call him Ham.
Guys, this is Scott Smalls.

199
00:16:02,922 --> 00:16:04,841
Hi.

200
00:16:06,718 --> 00:16:10,555
Yeah, um, wel I, he's gonna play with us
'cause he makes nine.

201
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,933
Now we've got a whole team. We're
wasting time. Let's go to the sandlot.

202
00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:16,853
- Benny, it's 9:00 in the morning.
- It's 9:00.

203
00:16:16,936 --> 00:16:18,229
- Why'd you bring him, Benny?
- 'Cause there's eight of us,
and he makes nine.

204
00:16:18,229 --> 00:16:20,231
- Why'd you bring him, Benny?
- 'Cause there's eight of us,
and he makes nine.

205
00:16:20,357 --> 00:16:22,901
Yeah, yeah, so would my sister,
but I didn't bring her.

206
00:16:23,026 --> 00:16:25,654
With nine guys we've got
a whole team, Yeah-Yeah.

207
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:30,575
No. With Elswenger
we had a whole team.

208
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:34,120
- Elswenger could catch.
- And throw.

209
00:16:34,245 --> 00:16:36,873
Come on, Benny, man.
He ain't game.

210
00:16:36,998 --> 00:16:40,043
- You saw the way he threw.
- Yeah.

211
00:16:40,126 --> 00:16:44,339
You already fill up all
the empty positions since
Elswenger moved to Arizona.

212
00:16:44,422 --> 00:16:47,425
Right. And now I get to rotate
eight positions instead of seven.

213
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:51,638
- I need the practice, guys.
- You're the best on the team.
You don't need any practice.

214
00:16:51,763 --> 00:16:54,140
- No, you don't.
- You're the best, man.

215
00:16:54,265 --> 00:16:56,643
Come on, Benny, man.
The kid is...

216
00:16:56,768 --> 00:17:00,438
a L-7 weenie.

217
00:17:00,563 --> 00:17:04,109
Yeah, yeah.
Oscar Mayer even. Foot-long!

218
00:17:04,234 --> 00:17:07,904
Dodger dog! A weenie!

219
00:17:09,823 --> 00:17:12,409
What are you laughing at, Yeah-Yeah?
You run like a duck.

220
00:17:13,618 --> 00:17:15,829
Okay, okay, but I'm-- I'm--

221
00:17:15,954 --> 00:17:19,290
- Part of the game, right?
- Mmm, yeah.

222
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,710
Now, how come
he don't get to be?

223
00:17:21,793 --> 00:17:23,878
- 'Cause he's a geek, man.
- He can't catch.

224
00:17:23,962 --> 00:17:27,007
Man, base up,
you blockheads.

225
00:17:32,512 --> 00:17:35,682
Smalls, you take
left center, okay?

226
00:17:35,807 --> 00:17:38,768
Okay. Um, where
exactly is that?

227
00:17:40,854 --> 00:17:42,772
It's over there, man.

228
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:51,156
Here?

229
00:17:53,366 --> 00:17:55,285
That's left.
I said left center.

230
00:17:56,494 --> 00:17:58,788
Okay. Right.

231
00:17:58,872 --> 00:18:00,790
Here?

232
00:18:03,668 --> 00:18:06,171
Come on, Benny, man.

233
00:18:06,296 --> 00:18:09,883
He's never gonna catch the ball anyway.
Let's just play.

234
00:18:11,801 --> 00:18:15,597
- What a jerk.
- Yeah-Yeah, get two.

235
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:20,894
Come on!
Throw it in here, Bertram!

236
00:18:23,355 --> 00:18:25,899
- Nice.
- Wow!

237
00:18:26,024 --> 00:18:27,901
Good job!

238
00:18:30,362 --> 00:18:33,156
- Hey, Smalls, throw it to second.
- Okay.

239
00:18:36,826 --> 00:18:40,914
- Come on, Benny.
He's never gonna catch it.
- He's not gonna catch it.

240
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:46,294
Oh! I told you, Benny.
We told you.

241
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,676
Come on, Benny.
Why'd you do that?

242
00:18:56,388 --> 00:19:00,016
A square, Benny.
The kid's a square.

243
00:19:06,272 --> 00:19:09,025
Come on. Throw it in.

244
00:19:09,109 --> 00:19:11,945
What the hell's he doing?

245
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,701
I don't believe this.

246
00:19:21,121 --> 00:19:24,040
Here. Sorry. Sorry.

247
00:19:50,734 --> 00:19:52,610
You can throw it, you know.

248
00:19:55,113 --> 00:19:57,032
No.

249
00:19:57,115 --> 00:19:59,159
I can't.

250
00:19:59,284 --> 00:20:01,161
I don't know how.

251
00:20:03,121 --> 00:20:07,250
Thanks for taking me here,
but I think I'd better go.

252
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:10,378
Hey, hey.
You think too much.

253
00:20:10,462 --> 00:20:12,380
I bet you get straight A's
and shit, huh?

254
00:20:12,464 --> 00:20:14,799
No, I got a "B" once.

255
00:20:14,924 --> 00:20:18,261
Actually an A-minus.
But it should've been a "B."

256
00:20:18,345 --> 00:20:21,014
Man, this is baseball.
You gotta stop thinking.

257
00:20:21,139 --> 00:20:23,016
You just have fun.

258
00:20:23,141 --> 00:20:26,019
I mean, if you were having fun,
you would've caught that ball.

259
00:20:29,272 --> 00:20:31,149
You ever have
a paper route?

260
00:20:31,274 --> 00:20:33,360
I helped a guy once.

261
00:20:34,986 --> 00:20:37,822
Okay. Well, chuck it like
you would throw a paper.

262
00:20:37,947 --> 00:20:41,242
When your arm gets here,
just let go.

263
00:20:41,326 --> 00:20:43,244
Just let go.
It's that easy.

264
00:20:44,496 --> 00:20:47,165
How do I catch it?

265
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:52,796
Just stand there and stick your glove
out in the air.

266
00:20:52,879 --> 00:20:54,798
I'll take care of it.

267
00:20:54,881 --> 00:20:58,051
About time, Benny.
My clothes are going out of style.

268
00:20:58,176 --> 00:21:00,845
- They already are, Squints.
- Shut up!

269
00:21:01,888 --> 00:21:03,807
I told you, Benny.

270
00:21:06,476 --> 00:21:08,395
Smalls, throw it to second.

271
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,897
Okay.

272
00:21:12,983 --> 00:21:15,318
Not again.

273
00:21:15,402 --> 00:21:17,529
We're wasting time, Benny.

274
00:21:19,197 --> 00:21:21,116
Please catch it.

275
00:21:29,499 --> 00:21:31,543
Please catch it.

276
00:21:31,668 --> 00:21:34,296
Please catch it.
Please catch it.

277
00:21:41,386 --> 00:21:43,305
Yeah!

278
00:21:45,265 --> 00:21:49,352
- All right!
- He's all right.

279
00:21:49,436 --> 00:21:52,063
I told you so, man.

280
00:21:56,401 --> 00:21:58,320
Okay.

281
00:21:58,403 --> 00:22:01,448
- Let's play some ball.
- Yeah, let's play some ball.

282
00:22:01,573 --> 00:22:05,035
All right.
I knew it... all the time.

283
00:22:08,747 --> 00:22:10,498
Yeah!

284
00:22:25,972 --> 00:22:28,058
I'll show you some more
tomorrow, okay?

285
00:22:28,141 --> 00:22:30,060
- Okay. Bye.
- You did good.

286
00:22:30,143 --> 00:22:32,062
See you later, Ham.
8:00 tomorrow.

287
00:22:32,145 --> 00:22:34,064
- 8:00, Benny?
- Yeah. See you later, Smalls.

288
00:22:34,147 --> 00:22:36,524
Bye. See you tomorrow.

289
00:22:36,608 --> 00:22:38,526
Benny, wait!

290
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:42,322
- Your glove.
- Keep it, man.

291
00:22:42,447 --> 00:22:44,324
Thanks!

292
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,244
Oh, yeah.
Hey, Smalls.

293
00:22:52,957 --> 00:22:57,253
Um, bring a T-shirt
and jeans tomorrow, okay?

294
00:22:57,337 --> 00:23:01,132
- Oh, um, you got a fireplace?
- Oh, yeah.

295
00:23:01,257 --> 00:23:03,176
Yeah, why?

296
00:23:03,301 --> 00:23:05,178
Throw that hat
in there, man.

297
00:23:05,303 --> 00:23:08,139
Oh, yeah. You know,
it was the only one I had.

298
00:23:08,223 --> 00:23:10,725
Not anymore.
Wear my old hat.

299
00:23:10,809 --> 00:23:12,727
8:00 tomorrow morning.

300
00:23:12,811 --> 00:23:16,189
Thanks, Benny.
Great. 8:00.

301
00:23:18,274 --> 00:23:20,151
Mom, guess what?

302
00:23:36,001 --> 00:23:39,546
Hamilton "The Babe" Porter.

303
00:23:39,671 --> 00:23:42,007
"Long-ball" Porter.

304
00:23:42,132 --> 00:23:44,009
Come on, DeNunez.

305
00:23:49,681 --> 00:23:53,143
Yeah, okay.
Yes, I see it. Yes.

306
00:23:58,523 --> 00:24:00,442
Whoa!

307
00:24:00,525 --> 00:24:03,570
You call that pitching?

308
00:24:03,695 --> 00:24:06,448
This is baseball,
not tennis.

309
00:24:06,531 --> 00:24:08,950
- Give him a tennis racket.
- Give me something to hit.

310
00:24:09,034 --> 00:24:11,286
All right, Ham.
This is my heater.

311
00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:14,664
- I dare you to hit it.
- You'll be sorry.

312
00:24:14,748 --> 00:24:17,334
- Give that boy a bigger bat.
- You want the heater,
I'll give it to you.

313
00:24:17,417 --> 00:24:19,961
Give him a basketball.
Maybe then he'll hit it.

314
00:24:24,966 --> 00:24:27,135
Oh, man!

315
00:24:27,218 --> 00:24:30,388
Yeah!
That's how you do it.

316
00:24:32,515 --> 00:24:35,018
Ham, you idiot.
Now we can't play no more.

317
00:24:35,101 --> 00:24:37,270
Great, you idiot!

318
00:24:37,395 --> 00:24:40,231
Hit me with the heater.

319
00:24:40,315 --> 00:24:42,484
Stupid idiot!

320
00:24:42,567 --> 00:24:45,695
Low and outside.
Just like I like it.

321
00:24:56,748 --> 00:24:58,667
I'm gonna hit you!

322
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:03,838
Wait a sec. I'll get it.
- 1932 called shot
World Series by The Babe.

323
00:25:03,922 --> 00:25:06,591
Called shot by the Babe.

324
00:25:06,716 --> 00:25:08,885
No!

325
00:25:08,969 --> 00:25:12,597
No!

326
00:25:18,061 --> 00:25:21,690
- Smalls, come back!
- Hey guys, I'll get it!

327
00:25:21,773 --> 00:25:24,150
- Smalls!
- Smalls!

328
00:25:24,275 --> 00:25:27,278
- What are you doing?
- Smalls, wait!

329
00:25:27,404 --> 00:25:30,073
- Guys, what are you--
- Smalls!

330
00:25:30,156 --> 00:25:32,701
Get off!
Guys, I gotta get the ball!

331
00:25:32,784 --> 00:25:36,871
- No, wait!
- Get off of me! Now!

332
00:25:36,955 --> 00:25:38,873
- You're gonna get yourself killed!
- Killed, man, jeez!

333
00:25:38,957 --> 00:25:40,875
Stop!

334
00:25:42,961 --> 00:25:45,046
Holy crap,
you could've been killed.

335
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:47,299
Yeah, yeah, truly.
What are you doing?

336
00:25:47,424 --> 00:25:50,260
You guys were leaving,
so I just thought I'd hop the fence--

337
00:25:50,343 --> 00:25:53,930
- If you were thinking, you
wouldn't have thought that.
- You can't go back there.

338
00:25:54,014 --> 00:25:56,391
- Then how do we get the ball back?
- We don't.

339
00:25:56,474 --> 00:25:58,393
- We don't.
- It's history.

340
00:25:58,476 --> 00:26:02,063
- It's history. Kiss it--
- Kiss it good-bye. Shut up, Tommy.

341
00:26:02,147 --> 00:26:04,649
It's gone, man. Gone.

342
00:26:04,774 --> 00:26:08,236
Game's over, man.
We'll just get another ball tomorrow.

343
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,822
- Yeah.
- We'll never see it again.

344
00:26:10,947 --> 00:26:13,616
Why not?

345
00:26:17,037 --> 00:26:18,955
The Beast.

346
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,082
What is that?

347
00:26:26,296 --> 00:26:28,173
Smalls, listen to me.

348
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:34,054
Go to that fence... real slow,
and be quiet.

349
00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:36,806
- But... I-I think--
- No, no, no. No, no.

350
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:39,517
- Just go and peek through that hole.
- But I--

351
00:26:39,643 --> 00:26:43,521
- But I saw something. What's back there?
- It's okay. Just go.

352
00:26:43,647 --> 00:26:46,024
- Just go.
- Go, Smalls.

353
00:26:46,149 --> 00:26:48,026
Come on, Smalls.

354
00:26:49,861 --> 00:26:52,781
Shh!

355
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:05,210
Shh!

356
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:13,927
- Shh!
- Be quiet.

357
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:20,809
Something got the ball.

358
00:27:22,852 --> 00:27:24,938
W-What was that thing?

359
00:27:26,189 --> 00:27:28,066
Camp out.

360
00:27:36,074 --> 00:27:37,951
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.

361
00:27:38,076 --> 00:27:39,953
- My mom made me put on my jacket,
- Shut up!

362
00:27:40,078 --> 00:27:42,247
And then she made me do the dishes.

363
00:27:42,372 --> 00:27:45,542
Your poor little mommy
made you do the big bad dishes.

364
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:49,421
- Hey, you want a s'more?
- Some more what?

365
00:27:49,504 --> 00:27:51,881
No, no, you want a s'more?

366
00:27:51,965 --> 00:27:56,469
I haven't had anything yet,
so how can I have some more of nothing?

367
00:27:56,594 --> 00:27:59,431
- Shut up!
- You're killing me, Smalls.

368
00:27:59,514 --> 00:28:02,767
- All right. Who cut one?
- These are s'mores stuff.

369
00:28:02,892 --> 00:28:05,854
- Okay, pay attention.
- Bertram!

370
00:28:05,937 --> 00:28:08,189
First you take the graham.

371
00:28:08,273 --> 00:28:11,985
You stick the chocolate
on the graham.

372
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:15,155
- Then you roast the 'mallow.
- No, it's my sleeping bag.

373
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,699
When the 'mallow's flaming,

374
00:28:17,782 --> 00:28:20,327
Yes, it is yours.
It has a yellow stain on it.

375
00:28:20,452 --> 00:28:22,662
You stick it
on the chocolate.

376
00:28:22,787 --> 00:28:25,123
- You're gonna set the place on fire.
- Then...

377
00:28:25,206 --> 00:28:28,126
- you cover it with the other end.
- Make me one of those.

378
00:28:28,209 --> 00:28:30,128
Yeah, me too.

379
00:28:30,211 --> 00:28:33,840
- Then you stuff.
- I don't like that chocolate stuff.

380
00:28:33,965 --> 00:28:36,009
Kind of messy, but good.
Try some.

381
00:28:36,134 --> 00:28:38,720
Okay. Quiet, you guys.

382
00:28:38,803 --> 00:28:42,057
Shh! Shh!

383
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:45,101
Quiet! Are you trying
to wake it up?

384
00:28:45,185 --> 00:28:47,771
It just went to bed.

385
00:28:47,896 --> 00:28:50,690
- What just went to bed?
- Shh!

386
00:28:50,815 --> 00:28:53,151
The Beast.

387
00:28:53,234 --> 00:28:55,820
- Oh, yeah!
- Shh!

388
00:28:55,945 --> 00:28:57,822
- Jeez.
- Dang.

389
00:28:57,947 --> 00:29:00,033
Shh.

390
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:03,161
Now quiet.

391
00:29:05,121 --> 00:29:10,377
The legend of The Beast
goes back a long time...

392
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:15,340
before any of us
could even pick up a baseball.

393
00:29:17,008 --> 00:29:21,846
Back to a place
called Mertle's Acres.

394
00:29:21,972 --> 00:29:26,851
It all started about, mmm,
20 years ago,

395
00:29:26,977 --> 00:29:30,814
when thieves kept stealing junk
from Mertle's Acres junkyard.

396
00:29:30,897 --> 00:29:34,275
So Mr. Mertle, the guy
that used to own the place,

397
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:38,238
got him this new pup
from the dog pound.

398
00:29:38,363 --> 00:29:40,490
He fed him whole sides of beef...

399
00:29:40,615 --> 00:29:43,201
and turned the pup loose
in the junkyard.

400
00:29:43,326 --> 00:29:45,578
And the pup was grateful.

401
00:29:57,173 --> 00:30:00,552
And so, in a few weeks,
the pup grew into The Beast.

402
00:30:00,677 --> 00:30:04,180
And he grew big,
and he grew mean...

403
00:30:04,306 --> 00:30:08,476
so that he could protect the junkyard
with only one thing on his mind:

404
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,229
to kill everyone
that broke in.

405
00:30:11,354 --> 00:30:15,775
And he did, and he liked it a lot!

406
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:19,654
The Beast was the most perfect
junkyard dog that ever lived.

407
00:30:19,738 --> 00:30:22,866
A true killing machine.

408
00:30:22,991 --> 00:30:25,827
But after a while, the cops started
getting phone calls from people...

409
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:28,705
reporting all the missing thieves,

410
00:30:28,788 --> 00:30:31,041
the ones The Beast had killed.

411
00:30:31,124 --> 00:30:33,918
It added up to about 120--

412
00:30:34,044 --> 00:30:36,296
173 guys.

413
00:30:36,421 --> 00:30:38,465
It's true.

414
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,925
They never found a single body.

415
00:30:41,051 --> 00:30:44,137
Not one. Some people say
they all got away.

416
00:30:44,262 --> 00:30:47,015
But we all know
what really happened.

417
00:30:47,098 --> 00:30:49,059
The Beast ate them.

418
00:30:49,142 --> 00:30:52,979
He ate them bone and all.

419
00:30:53,104 --> 00:30:55,398
The Beast was too good
at his guard dog job,

420
00:30:55,482 --> 00:30:58,193
so the police said
he had to be retired.

421
00:30:58,276 --> 00:31:01,112
My grandpa, Squidman Palledorous,

422
00:31:01,196 --> 00:31:03,448
was police chiefback then.

423
00:31:03,573 --> 00:31:08,119
He ordered Mr. Mertle to turn
his backyard into a fortress...

424
00:31:08,244 --> 00:31:11,706
and chain up The Beast
and put him under the house...

425
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:14,834
where he could never get out
to eat children and stuff.

426
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:17,671
That's where he's been for 20 years.

427
00:31:17,796 --> 00:31:20,548
And that's where he'll be
for the rest of his life.

428
00:31:20,632 --> 00:31:23,677
Because Mr. Mertle
asked the cops how long...

429
00:31:23,802 --> 00:31:26,346
he had to keep The Beast
chained up like a slave,

430
00:31:26,471 --> 00:31:30,809
they said until forever.

431
00:31:30,934 --> 00:31:32,978
Forever. Forever.

432
00:31:32,978 --> 00:31:35,438
Forever. Forever.

433
00:31:35,522 --> 00:31:39,192
Forever.

434
00:31:39,317 --> 00:31:43,738
And so, The Beast sits there
under that lean-to,

435
00:31:43,822 --> 00:31:48,201
dreaming of the time when he can
break the chain and get out,

436
00:31:48,326 --> 00:31:51,913
dreaming of the time
he can chase and kill again.

437
00:31:53,164 --> 00:31:55,208
See, man? That's why
you can't go over there.

438
00:31:55,333 --> 00:31:58,003
Nobody ever has.
Nobody ever will.

439
00:31:58,128 --> 00:32:01,339
One kid did, but nobody
ever seen him again.

440
00:32:01,464 --> 00:32:04,676
- That ain't true.
- Yeah, it is.

441
00:32:08,388 --> 00:32:10,307
He got eaten.

442
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:12,684
Nuh-uh.

443
00:32:12,767 --> 00:32:14,936
No. None of that's true.

444
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,272
You guys are just making this up
to scare me.

445
00:32:17,355 --> 00:32:19,274
Oh, yeah?

446
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:23,278
Stick your head
out that window...

447
00:32:23,361 --> 00:32:25,530
and look down.

448
00:32:28,658 --> 00:32:33,079
That night I
learned that more than 150 baseballs...

449
00:32:33,204 --> 00:32:36,291
had gone over that fence and not one
of them was ever seen again,

450
00:32:36,374 --> 00:32:38,293
even when some brave kid...

451
00:32:38,376 --> 00:32:40,670
worked up enough courage
to peek over.

452
00:32:40,754 --> 00:32:43,131
Because when they went over,
they vanished.

453
00:32:43,214 --> 00:32:45,133
I knew it was true.

454
00:32:45,216 --> 00:32:47,177
Because when I looked down in there,

455
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:51,556
I didn't see a single solitary one.

456
00:32:54,225 --> 00:32:57,020
- He's down there.
- You bet he is.

457
00:32:57,103 --> 00:33:00,148
Whatever goes over that fence...

458
00:33:02,442 --> 00:33:04,361
stays there.

459
00:33:04,444 --> 00:33:07,989
It becomes the property
of The Beast...

460
00:33:08,073 --> 00:33:10,200
forever.

461
00:33:14,245 --> 00:33:16,915
- Come on, give it to me.
- No, I wanna carry it.

462
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,417
- Come on. I paid for it.
- I wanna carry it.

463
00:33:19,501 --> 00:33:22,587
- Oh. Whoa!
- Give it to me.

464
00:33:22,712 --> 00:33:25,256
Jeez Louise.

465
00:33:25,382 --> 00:33:27,258
- What's the matter?
- Jeez.

466
00:33:37,894 --> 00:33:41,022
Wendy Peffercorn. Mmm.

467
00:33:42,357 --> 00:33:44,442
- Whoa!
- Wow!

468
00:34:04,296 --> 00:34:06,715
- Come on, let's go. We gotta get--
- No!

469
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:09,384
We gotta get to the sandlot. Let's go.

470
00:34:12,304 --> 00:34:14,222
- Come on. Let's go.
- Okay.

471
00:34:16,182 --> 00:34:19,144
I'm sweating like a pig.

472
00:34:19,227 --> 00:34:21,146
Let's go! Come on!

473
00:34:24,858 --> 00:34:27,569
Where you guys been?
We've been waiting here forever already.

474
00:34:27,652 --> 00:34:29,612
Aw, Squints was pervin' a dish.

475
00:34:29,696 --> 00:34:32,991
- Shut up. I wasn't.
- Yeah, yeah, you were.

476
00:34:33,116 --> 00:34:37,203
Your tongue was hangin' out of
your head, and you was swoonin'.

477
00:34:37,329 --> 00:34:41,958
Oh, Wendy Peffercorn,
my darling lover girl.

478
00:34:42,042 --> 00:34:44,210
I said shut up!

479
00:34:44,336 --> 00:34:46,713
I've got a lot of things
on my mind.

480
00:34:49,883 --> 00:34:51,801
This pop isn't working, Benny.

481
00:34:51,885 --> 00:34:55,430
I'm baking like a toasted cheeser!
It's so hot here!

482
00:34:55,513 --> 00:34:59,351
It's 150 degrees out there.
You can't play baseball.

483
00:34:59,434 --> 00:35:02,479
- You have to call it for the day.
- You gotta listen to him, Benny.

484
00:35:02,562 --> 00:35:06,316
Vote then.
Anybody who wants to be...

485
00:35:06,399 --> 00:35:10,445
a "can't hack it" panty waist...

486
00:35:10,528 --> 00:35:13,948
who wears their mama's bra,
raise your hand.

487
00:35:14,032 --> 00:35:15,992
Yeah, I can handle that.

488
00:35:17,577 --> 00:35:19,788
Fine, fine, fine!

489
00:35:19,871 --> 00:35:21,790
Be like that.

490
00:35:21,873 --> 00:35:23,792
So what are we gonna do?

491
00:35:29,255 --> 00:35:32,550
Scam pool honeys!

492
00:35:32,717 --> 00:35:36,471
Benny would've
played ball all day, all night, rain,

493
00:35:36,554 --> 00:35:38,473
shine, tidal wave, whatever.

494
00:35:38,556 --> 00:35:41,059
Baseball was the only thing
he cared about.

495
00:35:41,142 --> 00:35:43,728
But of all the things
we ever did besides baseball,

496
00:35:43,853 --> 00:35:46,648
going to the pool
was what he tolerated best.

497
00:35:46,731 --> 00:35:49,275
Even though none of us had
ever seen a Playboy magazine,

498
00:35:49,401 --> 00:35:52,487
- which we constantly lied about,
- Hi.

499
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:55,615
We figured going to the pool was
the next best thing to being there.

500
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:58,952
I remember you.
Oh, sexy.

501
00:36:01,913 --> 00:36:04,040
Hey, girls.

502
00:36:09,546 --> 00:36:12,173
Cannonball!

503
00:36:19,306 --> 00:36:22,726
It wasn't really
the pool honeys like we said,

504
00:36:22,809 --> 00:36:27,230
because if any one of them
had come up to any one of us,
we'd have just peed our pants.

505
00:36:27,314 --> 00:36:29,607
We all went because--

506
00:36:29,733 --> 00:36:34,612
well, because Wendy Peffercorn
was the lifeguard.

507
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,758
- Aw, man.
- Yeah, yeah. Too cool.

508
00:36:54,841 --> 00:36:56,801
She don't know what she's doing.

509
00:36:56,926 --> 00:36:58,803
She don't know what she's doing.

510
00:36:58,928 --> 00:37:01,139
Yeah, she does.

511
00:37:01,264 --> 00:37:03,933
She knows exactly
what she's doing.

512
00:37:04,017 --> 00:37:07,771
I've swum here every summer
of my adult life.

513
00:37:10,523 --> 00:37:13,234
And every summer,
there she is,

514
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:18,782
lotioning, oiling,
oiling, lotioning.

515
00:37:18,865 --> 00:37:22,744
- One day it became too much...
- Smiling.

516
00:37:22,827 --> 00:37:25,747
- For Michael "Squints" Palledorous.
- Smiling!

517
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:28,249
I can't take this no more!

518
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:30,919
- Move!
- And he did the most desperate thing...

519
00:37:31,002 --> 00:37:33,254
- Lotioning, oiling.
- Any of us...

520
00:37:33,338 --> 00:37:35,298
- had ever seen.
- Lotioning,

521
00:37:35,382 --> 00:37:37,550
oiling.

522
00:37:45,642 --> 00:37:49,104
- What's wrong with him?
- What's he doing?

523
00:37:59,406 --> 00:38:02,033
Three summers of this.
I think he finally snapped.

524
00:38:02,158 --> 00:38:05,412
I don't know. But that's the deep end,
and Squints can't swim.

525
00:38:42,407 --> 00:38:44,701
- Somebody help him!
- Squints!

526
00:38:44,784 --> 00:38:46,995
Somebody help him!
Come on!

527
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:00,550
Move back. Move back.

528
00:39:00,634 --> 00:39:03,762
- Okay, I got him. I got him.
- Come on up, Wendy.

529
00:39:03,887 --> 00:39:07,265
Everybody move back.
Move back. Roll him over.

530
00:39:07,349 --> 00:39:09,643
Never mind! Never mind!

531
00:39:09,768 --> 00:39:13,229
Come on, Squints.

532
00:39:13,313 --> 00:39:15,065
- Come on, Squints.
- Come on!

533
00:39:15,148 --> 00:39:17,567
Squints!

534
00:39:17,651 --> 00:39:20,987
- Come on, Squints. Squints.
- Come on, Squints. Come on.

535
00:39:23,073 --> 00:39:26,159
- Wake up.
- Come on, breathe, would you?

536
00:39:28,662 --> 00:39:30,830
Come on, Squints!
You can do it! Pull through, bud!

537
00:39:35,085 --> 00:39:38,129
- Come on, man! Come on!
- Yeah, yeah. He looks pretty crappy.

538
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,968
Squints! Come on, man.

539
00:39:46,429 --> 00:39:48,723
Oh, God, he looks
like a dead fish.

540
00:39:54,312 --> 00:39:56,523
What?

541
00:40:01,319 --> 00:40:04,406
Little pervert!

542
00:40:04,489 --> 00:40:06,491
Oh, man, he's in deep shit.

543
00:40:22,674 --> 00:40:26,011
And stay out!

544
00:40:49,492 --> 00:40:51,661
Oh, hey, here's your glasses.
Did you plan that?

545
00:40:51,786 --> 00:40:54,497
Of course I did.
I been planning it for years.

546
00:40:54,581 --> 00:40:56,750
You guys, he planned that!
He knew what he was doing!

547
00:40:59,961 --> 00:41:03,256
Michael "Squints" Palledorous
walked a little taller that day.

548
00:41:03,381 --> 00:41:05,425
We had to tip our hats to him.

549
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:07,927
He was lucky she hadn't
beat the crap out of him.

550
00:41:08,053 --> 00:41:10,889
We wouldn't have blamed her.
What he'd done was sneaky,

551
00:41:11,014 --> 00:41:15,268
rotten and low... and cool.

552
00:41:15,393 --> 00:41:18,313
Not another one among us
would've ever in a million years...

553
00:41:18,396 --> 00:41:22,400
even for a million dollars had the guts
to put the move on the lifeguard.

554
00:41:22,525 --> 00:41:25,195
He did.
He had kissed a woman,

555
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,656
and he had kissed her long
and good.

556
00:41:27,739 --> 00:41:30,408
We got banned from the pool
forever that day.

557
00:41:30,533 --> 00:41:32,410
But every time we walked by
after that,

558
00:41:32,535 --> 00:41:34,412
the lifeguard looked down
from her tower,

559
00:41:34,537 --> 00:41:36,831
right over at Squints...

560
00:41:36,915 --> 00:41:40,085
and smiled.

561
00:41:52,055 --> 00:41:53,932
- Get your glove and come on.
- What's the big deal?

562
00:41:54,057 --> 00:41:57,769
- Night game. Come on. Come on.
- Mom, I'm going out!

563
00:42:14,327 --> 00:42:16,413
There was only one night game a year.

564
00:42:16,496 --> 00:42:18,665
- Guys, wait up!
- On the 4th of July...

565
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:21,626
the whole sky would brighten up
with fireworks,

566
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:24,504
giving us just enough light
for a game.

567
00:42:24,629 --> 00:42:28,550
We played our best then
because, I guess, we all felt
like the big leaguers...

568
00:42:28,633 --> 00:42:31,469
under the lights
of some great stadium.

569
00:42:31,594 --> 00:42:33,763
Benny felt like that
all the time.

570
00:42:33,847 --> 00:42:37,809
We all knew he was gonna go on
to bigger and better games,

571
00:42:37,892 --> 00:42:42,439
because every time we stopped
to watch the sky on those nights
like regular kids,

572
00:42:42,564 --> 00:42:44,774
he was there to call us back.

573
00:42:44,899 --> 00:42:48,737
You see, for us,
baseball was a game.

574
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:51,656
But for
Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez,

575
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,992
baseball was life.

576
00:42:57,329 --> 00:43:00,332
- Okay, hit it!
- Yeah, yeah, come on, Benny.

577
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:37,619
Now wait a minute.

578
00:43:37,702 --> 00:43:39,788
I'm talking about--

579
00:43:46,586 --> 00:43:49,255
You know--

580
00:43:59,474 --> 00:44:01,518
Yes, He did.

581
00:44:04,104 --> 00:44:06,690
Man!

582
00:44:13,905 --> 00:44:18,201
- Come on! Hurry up!
- First!

583
00:44:18,284 --> 00:44:20,537
Run!

584
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:22,956
Back off!

585
00:44:24,457 --> 00:44:26,543
Yeah, yeah!

586
00:44:26,626 --> 00:44:30,005
- Throw it in! Throw it in!
- Get him! Get him!

587
00:44:30,088 --> 00:44:32,507
Come on! Come on!
Come on!

588
00:44:34,134 --> 00:44:36,761
- Come on! Hurry up!
- Go, Benny!

589
00:44:36,886 --> 00:44:40,223
Oh, damn!

590
00:44:45,312 --> 00:44:47,772
Oh, no!

591
00:45:16,468 --> 00:45:20,347
It's easy when you play with a bunch
of rejects and a fat kid, Rodriguez.

592
00:45:20,472 --> 00:45:23,224
- Shut your mouth, Phillips.
- What'd you say, crap face?

593
00:45:23,308 --> 00:45:25,685
I said you shouldn't even
be allowed to touch a baseball.

594
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:28,688
Except for Rodriguez,
you're all an insult to the game.

595
00:45:28,813 --> 00:45:32,192
Come on! We'll take you on
right here, right now!

596
00:45:32,317 --> 00:45:35,695
Come on!

597
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:38,073
We play on a real diamond, Porter.

598
00:45:38,156 --> 00:45:40,408
You ain't good enough to lick
the dirt off our cleats.

599
00:45:40,492 --> 00:45:42,911
- Watch it, jerk.
- Shut up, idiot!

600
00:45:42,994 --> 00:45:44,829
- Moron!
- Scab eater!

601
00:45:44,954 --> 00:45:46,956
- Butt sniffer!
- Pus licker!

602
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,959
- Fart smeller!
- Ah!

603
00:45:50,043 --> 00:45:52,712
You eat dog crap
for breakfast, geek.

604
00:45:52,837 --> 00:45:55,340
You mix your Wheaties
with your mama's toe jam!

605
00:45:55,465 --> 00:45:57,717
Yeah!

606
00:45:57,842 --> 00:46:01,012
You bob for apples in the toilet
and you like it.

607
00:46:01,137 --> 00:46:04,808
- Ooh.
- You play ball like a girl!

608
00:46:14,067 --> 00:46:17,445
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

609
00:46:19,239 --> 00:46:21,157
Tomorrow.

610
00:46:21,241 --> 00:46:24,160
Noon. At our field.

611
00:46:24,244 --> 00:46:26,162
Be there, buffalo-butt breath.

612
00:46:26,246 --> 00:46:28,540
Count on it,
pee-drinking crap face!

613
00:46:28,665 --> 00:46:30,000
Yeah!

614
00:46:30,083 --> 00:46:32,335
Let's go!

615
00:46:41,219 --> 00:46:43,138
We're gonna kick
their butts tomorrow.

616
00:46:43,221 --> 00:46:45,140
Yeah!

617
00:46:46,683 --> 00:46:48,560
- Good job.
- Jerks.

618
00:46:50,854 --> 00:46:53,690
Play ball!

619
00:46:55,942 --> 00:46:57,861
Hurry up, batter.

620
00:46:57,944 --> 00:47:00,947
It's gonna be a short game,
and I gotta get home for lunch.

621
00:47:02,574 --> 00:47:04,617
That's one.

622
00:47:04,743 --> 00:47:09,247
You know, if I had a dog
as ugly as you,

623
00:47:09,372 --> 00:47:13,460
I'd shave his butt
and tell him to walk backwards.

624
00:47:13,585 --> 00:47:15,712
The heater.

625
00:47:15,795 --> 00:47:18,757
Here it comes.
I dare you.

626
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,884
Strike three.
You're out.

627
00:47:20,967 --> 00:47:25,555
Hey, is that your sister
out there in left field, naked?

628
00:47:25,639 --> 00:47:27,974
- She's naked.
- Shut up, Porter!

629
00:47:28,099 --> 00:47:29,976
Hey, hey, hey.

630
00:47:30,101 --> 00:47:33,021
I'm just trying to have
a little friendly conversation.

631
00:47:33,104 --> 00:47:36,524
Come on. You think
she'd go out with me?

632
00:47:39,152 --> 00:47:40,904
Come on.
Show me your stuff.

633
00:47:41,029 --> 00:47:43,490
- Let's see what you got.
- Hey, batter, batter, batter!

634
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:46,284
Take him out!

635
00:48:02,425 --> 00:48:05,679
- Come on!
- Bring it in!

636
00:48:16,314 --> 00:48:19,484
Oh! Beat ya.

637
00:48:22,028 --> 00:48:24,864
Throw it to third!

638
00:48:55,353 --> 00:48:58,523
We were all walking on air that night.

639
00:48:58,648 --> 00:49:00,525
It had been a solid victory.

640
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:02,944
In fact, we beat the crap
out of those guys.

641
00:49:03,028 --> 00:49:05,363
So we all went to celebrate.

642
00:49:05,488 --> 00:49:08,199
And we did
the stupidest thing...

643
00:49:08,325 --> 00:49:10,243
any of us had ever done.

644
00:49:10,368 --> 00:49:13,330
Hey, guys, it's all on me tonight.

645
00:49:13,413 --> 00:49:15,332
Thanks, Benny!

646
00:49:15,415 --> 00:49:17,334
Nine tickets, please.

647
00:49:17,417 --> 00:49:19,336
- Hey, Benny.
- Thanks.

648
00:49:19,419 --> 00:49:22,339
- Hey, Benny.
- Benny.

649
00:49:22,422 --> 00:49:24,716
- Come on, you guys!
- What about me? Thanks.

650
00:49:24,841 --> 00:49:28,011
Aw, crap!
I almost forgot!

651
00:49:28,094 --> 00:49:30,221
- What?
- What?

652
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:36,519
Chaw! I was saving it
for a good time.

653
00:49:36,603 --> 00:49:38,647
- What is it?
- Big Chief.

654
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:40,649
The best!

655
00:49:40,732 --> 00:49:45,737
Jeez, Smalls. I suppose you don't
even know who The Babe is either.

656
00:49:47,697 --> 00:49:49,991
It's plug. Wad.
Chewing tobacco.

657
00:49:50,075 --> 00:49:52,661
- 'Baccy, man.
- What do you do with it?

658
00:49:54,913 --> 00:49:57,791
You're killing me, Smalls.

659
00:49:59,417 --> 00:50:01,836
- Chew it, of course. Yes.
- You do?

660
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,631
Yeah, sure, man.
All the pros do it.

661
00:50:04,756 --> 00:50:07,217
Yeah, yeah.
Gives you tons of energy.

662
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:10,720
- Let's dip. Let's dip.
- You got it, guys.

663
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:14,641
Come on. I want some.

664
00:50:14,766 --> 00:50:17,102
- Mm. Mm.
- Mm.

665
00:50:17,227 --> 00:50:21,064
- The best.
- Let's ride!

666
00:50:21,147 --> 00:50:23,066
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

667
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:40,709
Mm!

668
00:50:56,599 --> 00:50:59,769
- Yeah-hah!
- Yeah!

669
00:50:59,853 --> 00:51:03,231
- Whoo-hoo!
- Squints, this is the best!

670
00:51:03,315 --> 00:51:06,192
Wow! Yeah! Whoo!

671
00:51:06,318 --> 00:51:07,777
All right!

672
00:51:14,993 --> 00:51:16,911
Yeah!

673
00:51:43,396 --> 00:51:45,065
Blech!

674
00:52:29,401 --> 00:52:32,779
Oh, that feels better.

675
00:52:37,867 --> 00:52:40,912
I'll be back in an hour.
I'm gonna take your dad to the airport.

676
00:52:41,037 --> 00:52:42,956
Oh, okay.

677
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:45,375
Honey, are you feeling all right?
You look kind of pale.

678
00:52:45,458 --> 00:52:47,377
- I'm fine, Mom.
- You sure?

679
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:50,505
- I'm fine, really.
- All right.

680
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:52,549
Listen, Scott.

681
00:52:54,968 --> 00:52:58,430
While I'm gone, you're the man
of the house. Understand?

682
00:52:58,555 --> 00:53:00,432
- Okay.
- Okay.

683
00:53:00,557 --> 00:53:03,351
- Where are you going?
- Chicago.

684
00:53:03,435 --> 00:53:05,437
On business for a week.

685
00:53:05,562 --> 00:53:09,024
- We'll take another stab at catch
when I get back, all right?
- Yeah, I guess so.

686
00:53:09,149 --> 00:53:11,568
- Take care of things for me.
- Okay.

687
00:53:11,651 --> 00:53:13,570
- All right?
- I will.

688
00:53:13,653 --> 00:53:16,489
Okay. Be a good boy.

689
00:53:16,573 --> 00:53:18,575
- I will.
- Okay.

690
00:53:25,832 --> 00:53:29,336
A couple days after
we all got over acting like big shots,

691
00:53:29,419 --> 00:53:33,840
we swore off the hard stuff forever
and just stuck to Bazooka.

692
00:53:33,923 --> 00:53:36,676
But the day we all got back
together for some baseball...

693
00:53:36,801 --> 00:53:40,889
was the day I got us into
the biggest pickle of all time,

694
00:53:40,972 --> 00:53:43,767
and it all started with an omen.

695
00:54:54,838 --> 00:54:56,756
Oh, man.

696
00:54:59,217 --> 00:55:02,178
I don't believe it.

697
00:55:02,262 --> 00:55:04,180
- Bitchin'.
- Nah, it ain't.

698
00:55:04,264 --> 00:55:06,182
Come on. Maybe two or three
guys in history...

699
00:55:06,308 --> 00:55:08,184
ever busted the guts out of a ball.

700
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:12,105
- Must be an omen.
- All's it means is that
we can't play no more.

701
00:55:12,188 --> 00:55:15,358
It's only 12:00, and I just ruined
the whole day for us.

702
00:55:15,483 --> 00:55:18,445
No, you didn't. That's the most
amazing thing I ever saw.

703
00:55:18,528 --> 00:55:20,780
- Yeah.
- Anybody got any money?

704
00:55:20,864 --> 00:55:24,117
No.
- Then it ain't okay, 'cause
now we can't play no more.

705
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,119
Yeah, we can.

706
00:55:26,202 --> 00:55:29,205
What, you got 98 extra cents
lying around, Smalls?

707
00:55:29,289 --> 00:55:33,293
- No, but I got a ball.
- Go get it!

708
00:55:49,517 --> 00:55:52,729
I got it, guys! I got it!
I got the ball, guys!

709
00:55:52,812 --> 00:55:54,731
I got it. Right here, guys.

710
00:55:54,814 --> 00:55:57,359
I got the ball. I got it.

711
00:55:57,484 --> 00:56:00,028
- Here, Benny. I got it.
- Bitchin'. Your ball, your ups.

712
00:56:00,153 --> 00:56:02,072
- Here you go.
- Okay.

713
00:56:02,155 --> 00:56:05,367
All right. Come on.
Kenny, here.

714
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:07,369
Come on. Yeah, come on!

715
00:56:07,452 --> 00:56:09,996
Batter up!

716
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,207
Your fly's open.

717
00:56:14,167 --> 00:56:16,336
There's one.

718
00:56:19,047 --> 00:56:21,049
One, two, three.

719
00:56:21,132 --> 00:56:23,385
Three strikes, three pitches.

720
00:56:23,468 --> 00:56:25,387
Hey, batter, batter, batter!

721
00:56:25,470 --> 00:56:29,057
- Come on, Smalls!
- Hey, batter, batter, batter!

722
00:56:31,685 --> 00:56:33,687
Oh, my. Oh, man.

723
00:56:35,105 --> 00:56:37,023
- Run!
- Yes!

724
00:56:37,107 --> 00:56:40,402
Way to go, school meat!
I taught him everything.

725
00:56:43,989 --> 00:56:47,075
Oh, man, that was great.
That went clear over.

726
00:56:49,411 --> 00:56:52,622
Hey, uh, Smalls,
third base is that way.

727
00:56:52,706 --> 00:56:54,624
Hey, Smalls. Smalls.

728
00:56:55,875 --> 00:56:59,212
- Go to third.
- Oh, no. Oh, no.

729
00:56:59,296 --> 00:57:02,465
Yeah! Nice hit, Smalls.
Nice hit. Yeah!

730
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:06,011
- Oh, no.
- It's outta here!
Who's got the big bat now?

731
00:57:06,136 --> 00:57:09,097
- Smalls! Smalls! Smalls!
- Smalls?

732
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:11,266
You forgot to turn.

733
00:57:11,349 --> 00:57:13,601
You go to third base!

734
00:57:15,812 --> 00:57:17,772
Smalls--

735
00:57:19,024 --> 00:57:20,942
What the hell's he doing?

736
00:57:21,026 --> 00:57:23,987
Maybe the shock of his first homer
was just too much for him.

737
00:57:24,112 --> 00:57:26,906
Yeah.

738
00:57:28,325 --> 00:57:32,162
Smalls.

739
00:57:33,747 --> 00:57:35,999
Smalls? Smalls.

740
00:57:51,181 --> 00:57:55,018
- We got to get that ball back.
- Oh, yeah, right.

741
00:57:55,101 --> 00:57:57,937
- Good one, Smalls.
- Yeah, good one, Smalls.

742
00:57:58,021 --> 00:58:01,107
Hey, forget about it, man.
Let's get another ball.

743
00:58:01,191 --> 00:58:03,026
No, you don't understand!

744
00:58:03,109 --> 00:58:07,155
Sure, we do. You feel bad
'cause you belted a homer.
Now we can't play no more.

745
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,949
No, you don't understand!
That wasn't my ball!

746
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:16,998
What do you mean,
that wasn't your ball?

747
00:58:17,082 --> 00:58:19,292
It was my stepdad's.

748
00:58:19,376 --> 00:58:21,503
I stole it from his trophy room.

749
00:58:21,628 --> 00:58:24,089
It was a present or something.
Somebody gave it to him.

750
00:58:24,214 --> 00:58:26,383
We gotta get it back.
He's gonna kill me!

751
00:58:26,508 --> 00:58:29,427
Ohh.

752
00:58:29,552 --> 00:58:32,180
Listen to me, Smalls.

753
00:58:32,263 --> 00:58:34,724
It's a matter of life and death.

754
00:58:34,849 --> 00:58:38,061
Where did your old man
get that ball?

755
00:58:38,144 --> 00:58:41,398
What? I don't know.
Some lady gave it to him.

756
00:58:41,481 --> 00:58:44,025
- Why?
- What? Some lady?

757
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:47,612
Yeah. She even signed her name on it.
Some lady named...

758
00:58:47,737 --> 00:58:49,864
Ruth, Baby Ruth.

759
00:58:49,948 --> 00:58:52,158
Babe Ruth?

760
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:16,850
No!

761
00:59:22,314 --> 00:59:24,107
The Beast got it.

762
00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:27,736
- You're dead as a doornail, Smalls.
- You're dead as a doornail.

763
00:59:27,819 --> 00:59:31,281
Smalls, you mean to tell me that you
went home and swiped a ball...

764
00:59:31,406 --> 00:59:33,867
that was signed by Babe Ruth,

765
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:37,454
- and you brought it here
and actually played with it?
- Actually played with it?

766
00:59:37,579 --> 00:59:42,125
- Yeah, but I was gonna bring it back.
- But it was signed by Babe Ruth.

767
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:46,421
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
You keep telling me that. Who is she?

768
00:59:46,504 --> 00:59:48,298
What?

769
00:59:49,549 --> 00:59:51,593
What?

770
00:59:51,676 --> 00:59:55,263
- The Sultan of Swat.
- The King of Crash.

771
00:59:55,347 --> 00:59:57,932
- The Colossus of Clout.
- The Colossus of Clout.

772
00:59:58,016 --> 00:59:59,976
Babe Ruth!

773
01:00:00,101 --> 01:00:03,355
The Great Bambino!

774
01:00:04,564 --> 01:00:06,983
Oh, my God!
You mean that's the same guy?

775
01:00:07,108 --> 01:00:08,985
Yes!

776
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:12,989
Smalls, Babe Ruth is the greatest
baseball player that ever lived.

777
01:00:13,114 --> 01:00:16,117
People say he was less than a god
but more than a man.

778
01:00:16,201 --> 01:00:18,703
You know, like Hercules
or something.

779
01:00:18,828 --> 01:00:22,499
That ball you just aced
to The Beast is worth,

780
01:00:22,624 --> 01:00:24,918
well, more than your whole life.

781
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:30,131
I don't feel so good.

782
01:00:30,256 --> 01:00:34,010
- Uh-oh, fan him.
- Give him air, give him air.

783
01:00:34,094 --> 01:00:36,304
We have to get that ball back.

784
01:00:38,556 --> 01:00:41,810
- When does your old man
get home from work?
- He's gone on business.

785
01:00:41,893 --> 01:00:45,814
Out of town.
But he could be back anytime.

786
01:00:45,897 --> 01:00:47,816
All right.
Find out when.

787
01:00:47,899 --> 01:00:50,819
And, guys, spread out and look
for bottles and cash 'em in.

788
01:00:50,902 --> 01:00:53,738
We need 98 cents.
We gotta buy us a ball.

789
01:00:53,863 --> 01:00:55,907
Yeah!

790
01:01:01,705 --> 01:01:04,916
- Come on. Let's go!
- Go, go, go, go! Move, move!

791
01:01:05,041 --> 01:01:08,503
Come on. Open it up!
Hurry up, hurry up!

792
01:01:08,586 --> 01:01:11,298
- Give me the ball.
- Give me something to write with.

793
01:01:11,381 --> 01:01:14,384
- I got a pencil.
- Give me a pen, not a pencil!

794
01:01:14,509 --> 01:01:16,511
- Sorry.
- I got a pen.

795
01:01:18,263 --> 01:01:20,181
Babe--

796
01:01:20,265 --> 01:01:22,934
- Baby Ruthie?
- It says, "Babe Ruth."

797
01:01:23,059 --> 01:01:26,187
- I don't know, Benny, man.
- Yeah, boy, that looks pretty crappy.

798
01:01:26,271 --> 01:01:28,356
It doesn't matter
what it looks like.

799
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:30,358
His mom's never gonna know
the difference.

800
01:01:30,442 --> 01:01:33,695
- This'll just buy us
some time, you dorks.
- Okay, come on.

801
01:01:50,795 --> 01:01:53,381
- Scotty?
- Uh, in here, Mom.

802
01:01:55,091 --> 01:01:57,844
Oh, hi, honey.
What are you doing in here?

803
01:01:57,927 --> 01:02:00,347
Uh, just looking at Bill's--

804
01:02:00,430 --> 01:02:02,432
I mean, uh, Dad's baseball.

805
01:02:02,557 --> 01:02:05,852
You know he doesn't like
you to touch his things.

806
01:02:07,312 --> 01:02:09,439
Yeah. I-- I know. Sorry, Mom.

807
01:02:09,564 --> 01:02:13,443
Has he ever told you about that ball?

808
01:02:13,568 --> 01:02:16,696
Uh, no. Uh, not really.

809
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:20,950
I-- I don't think so.
No, no, no, he hasn't at all.

810
01:02:21,076 --> 01:02:23,745
I don't-- I don't know
anything about it.

811
01:02:23,828 --> 01:02:26,623
Babe Ruth signed that ball.
He was...

812
01:02:26,706 --> 01:02:28,958
the greatest baseball player
who ever lived.

813
01:02:29,042 --> 01:02:32,671
- Oh. Really?
- He sure is.

814
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:36,800
Your dad's father gave it to him.

815
01:02:36,925 --> 01:02:39,302
Maybe someday he'll give it to you.

816
01:02:40,512 --> 01:02:42,847
Oh.

817
01:02:42,973 --> 01:02:44,849
Neat.

818
01:02:44,975 --> 01:02:47,519
It was salt in an open wound.

819
01:02:47,644 --> 01:02:49,896
Even my own mom, a grown-up girl,

820
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:52,565
knew who Babe Ruth was.

821
01:02:52,732 --> 01:02:55,276
I was dead meat.

822
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:58,822
We had thought that that ball Benny
had busted the guts out of...

823
01:02:58,947 --> 01:03:01,324
meant something amazing
was gonna happen.

824
01:03:01,449 --> 01:03:03,785
Now I just figured
it meant my life was over.

825
01:03:03,868 --> 01:03:05,954
Hey, I got it!

826
01:03:06,037 --> 01:03:08,164
Why don't we just go over...

827
01:03:08,289 --> 01:03:11,418
and knock on the door and ask
Mr. Mertle if he can get it for us?

828
01:03:11,501 --> 01:03:15,672
Are you out of your mind? Mr. Mertle's
the meanest old man that ever lived.

829
01:03:15,797 --> 01:03:19,467
He's the one who made
The Beast eat that kid.

830
01:03:20,719 --> 01:03:24,347
It's not an option, Smalls.
Forget about it!

831
01:03:24,472 --> 01:03:27,934
Oh, okay. Sorry.
I -- I will.

832
01:03:28,018 --> 01:03:30,270
Let's just look out the window.

833
01:03:30,353 --> 01:03:32,480
Good idea.

834
01:04:00,050 --> 01:04:03,678
- He's daring us.
- We're on his territory now.

835
01:04:03,803 --> 01:04:05,722
Anybody got any bright ideas?

836
01:04:05,847 --> 01:04:09,434
After we'd
all thought about it real hard,

837
01:04:09,559 --> 01:04:12,729
we had absolutely no idea
what the hell we were gonna do.

838
01:04:12,812 --> 01:04:14,856
So things started primitively.

839
01:04:18,151 --> 01:04:21,237
Go.

840
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:28,703
- Farther.
- Farther, okay.

841
01:04:35,502 --> 01:04:39,255
- Just a little bit farther.
- Farther. Farther.

842
01:04:40,548 --> 01:04:43,843
Aah!

843
01:04:43,927 --> 01:04:47,013
Oh, no! Aah!

844
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:01,027
Farther.

845
01:05:04,114 --> 01:05:08,284
Go to the right a little bit.
Put the back to the right.

846
01:05:12,163 --> 01:05:14,374
A little bit farther.

847
01:05:14,457 --> 01:05:17,085
- Farther?
- Guys, I see it. Turn, turn.

848
01:05:20,964 --> 01:05:23,383
Almost.

849
01:05:25,218 --> 01:05:28,054
You got it. Pull it back.

850
01:05:28,138 --> 01:05:30,765
- I got it!
- Got it, guys.

851
01:05:30,890 --> 01:05:33,935
Oh, my God!

852
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:36,604
Pull it back! Aah!

853
01:05:58,043 --> 01:06:02,505
I think we've seriously
underestimated The Beast.

854
01:06:02,631 --> 01:06:06,176
Obviously, we're dealing
with a superior intelligence.

855
01:06:09,346 --> 01:06:12,515
- Power.
- Okay, guys, almost ready.

856
01:06:12,599 --> 01:06:14,517
We're connecting power now.

857
01:06:14,601 --> 01:06:17,145
Power connected.

858
01:06:33,286 --> 01:06:35,205
Okay, we're ready.

859
01:06:35,330 --> 01:06:37,832
Initiate retrieval suction.

860
01:06:37,916 --> 01:06:38,958
Initiate retrieval suction.

861
01:06:38,958 --> 01:06:40,627
Initiate retrieval suction.

862
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:44,673
- Prepare to initiate
retrieval suction number one.
- Okay. Get ready, guys.

863
01:06:44,756 --> 01:06:46,967
Initiate retrieval suction
number one.

864
01:06:47,050 --> 01:06:49,552
Initiating retrieval suction
number one now!

865
01:06:53,723 --> 01:06:56,184
- Fire number two.
- Initiate number two.

866
01:06:56,267 --> 01:06:58,186
Firing two now!

867
01:07:01,606 --> 01:07:05,193
- Fire number three.
- Number three now!

868
01:07:05,276 --> 01:07:07,696
Whoa!

869
01:07:10,198 --> 01:07:13,201
Ha! You got it.
Haul it up.

870
01:07:13,284 --> 01:07:15,245
All right!

871
01:07:20,208 --> 01:07:23,044
Pull it up.

872
01:07:33,596 --> 01:07:38,727
- What's going on, Squints?
- The pipe-- it's pinched shut.

873
01:07:40,729 --> 01:07:44,524
- Turn it off, man!
- I can't! They're shorting out!

874
01:07:44,607 --> 01:07:47,235
What the hell is that noise?

875
01:07:47,319 --> 01:07:50,572
The vacs are clogged. I don't know
about you, but I'm getting outta here.

876
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:52,615
Let's go!

877
01:07:52,699 --> 01:07:55,952
Oh, no! Aah!

878
01:07:57,078 --> 01:07:58,955
Aah!

879
01:08:04,294 --> 01:08:06,630
Aah!

880
01:08:06,713 --> 01:08:10,634
Aah! Aah!

881
01:08:10,717 --> 01:08:13,136
They're gonna blow! Aah!

882
01:08:24,773 --> 01:08:26,650
Aah!

883
01:08:26,775 --> 01:08:29,319
Incoming!

884
01:08:58,014 --> 01:09:03,186
We've been going about this all wrong.

885
01:09:03,269 --> 01:09:06,439
I blame myself.

886
01:09:06,523 --> 01:09:08,441
We need total surprise.

887
01:09:08,525 --> 01:09:13,279
An airborne attack.
The Beast will never expect it.

888
01:09:13,363 --> 01:09:14,990
Yeah.

889
01:09:25,208 --> 01:09:29,004
- It's clear.
- Take me up.

890
01:09:53,903 --> 01:09:55,822
Let me down slow.

891
01:10:02,871 --> 01:10:05,373
- A little slower.
- Go slow.

892
01:10:05,457 --> 01:10:07,459
Go.

893
01:10:07,584 --> 01:10:09,544
Yeah, let me down.
Almost there.

894
01:10:09,669 --> 01:10:13,214
He's almost there.

895
01:10:18,011 --> 01:10:20,138
Let me down right over it.

896
01:10:20,263 --> 01:10:22,724
Let him down right overit.

897
01:10:38,782 --> 01:10:40,700
Ewww.

898
01:10:42,452 --> 01:10:45,080
Okay, I got it.
Get me outta here.

899
01:10:45,163 --> 01:10:47,415
Pull him up.

900
01:10:53,630 --> 01:10:55,924
I-- I-- I--

901
01:10:56,007 --> 01:10:59,511
- Hey, pull him up!
- Aah! Aah!

902
01:10:59,636 --> 01:11:02,222
Aah!

903
01:11:04,766 --> 01:11:07,227
Aah!

904
01:11:07,310 --> 01:11:10,647
Aah!

905
01:11:17,112 --> 01:11:19,072
It was my last chance.

906
01:11:19,155 --> 01:11:22,492
So we quit messing around
and pulled out all the stops.

907
01:11:22,617 --> 01:11:25,161
I collected every piece
of erector set I had,

908
01:11:25,286 --> 01:11:27,998
and it finally became...

909
01:11:28,123 --> 01:11:31,167
science against nature.

910
01:11:43,513 --> 01:11:47,684
Okay, go with me on the launch.
Come on, Squints.

911
01:11:51,396 --> 01:11:53,815
- Prepare to launch.
- Prepare to launch.

912
01:11:53,898 --> 01:11:56,192
Prepare to launch. Launching.

913
01:11:56,276 --> 01:11:58,028
Launch.

914
01:12:23,053 --> 01:12:25,388
Okay, you're on the ground.

915
01:12:27,724 --> 01:12:29,851
Moving forward.

916
01:12:47,619 --> 01:12:50,163
- You went too far. Go back.
- Reverse. It's too far.

917
01:12:50,246 --> 01:12:51,831
Reverse.

918
01:12:53,667 --> 01:12:56,086
Stop.

919
01:12:56,211 --> 01:12:58,254
Drop catapult.

920
01:13:03,259 --> 01:13:06,262
- The catapult is dropped.
- Open catapult.

921
01:13:06,388 --> 01:13:09,015
We're gonna get it. I know it.

922
01:13:09,099 --> 01:13:10,892
Opening.

923
01:13:15,563 --> 01:13:17,941
Forward.

924
01:13:25,115 --> 01:13:27,534
Close catapult.

925
01:13:29,035 --> 01:13:32,539
- Catapult's closed.
- We're gonna get it. Come on.

926
01:13:33,915 --> 01:13:37,794
Aah! Fire, fire, fire!

927
01:13:44,467 --> 01:13:46,928
I got it! I got it! I got it!

928
01:13:51,057 --> 01:13:53,768
Aah!

929
01:14:23,006 --> 01:14:25,967
My life... was over.

930
01:14:26,092 --> 01:14:28,762
Just as Bill had finally
warmed up to me...

931
01:14:28,845 --> 01:14:30,972
and asked me to be
the man of the house,

932
01:14:31,097 --> 01:14:35,852
I had to knock a priceless chunk of
history into the clutches of a monster.

933
01:14:35,935 --> 01:14:38,563
Great.

934
01:14:38,688 --> 01:14:42,067
I had a dream that night
about a giant baseball...

935
01:14:42,192 --> 01:14:44,235
that was signed by Babe Ruth...

936
01:14:44,361 --> 01:14:46,821
falling out of the sky
and hammering me into the ground...

937
01:14:46,946 --> 01:14:49,449
like a railroad spike.

938
01:14:49,532 --> 01:14:51,534
I didn't know what that meant,

939
01:14:51,618 --> 01:14:55,872
but Benny had a dream that night too,
and his was a lot more helpful.

940
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:04,881
Who's there?

941
01:15:09,094 --> 01:15:12,889
Don't go pee in your pants.
I'm just here to give you a hand.

942
01:15:12,973 --> 01:15:16,184
- B-But you're--
- Dead?

943
01:15:16,267 --> 01:15:18,228
Legends never die, kid.

944
01:15:18,311 --> 01:15:20,230
But you're really him.

945
01:15:21,815 --> 01:15:23,733
You're The Babe.

946
01:15:25,068 --> 01:15:28,405
The Sultan of Swat.
The King of Crash.

947
01:15:28,488 --> 01:15:31,074
Of Crash, and a hundred
other dopey names.

948
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:33,576
Forget about that stuff, kid.
We ain't got much time.

949
01:15:33,702 --> 01:15:36,705
- I'm here 'cause you're in
some kind of a pickle, right?
- Yeah.

950
01:15:36,788 --> 01:15:39,791
A baseball with
my John Hancock on it...

951
01:15:39,916 --> 01:15:41,876
went over a fence and you
can't get it back, right?

952
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:44,921
Yeah, right.

953
01:15:45,046 --> 01:15:48,550
- Then just hop over there and get it.
- Wait, wait!

954
01:15:54,472 --> 01:15:56,599
- I can't.
- Can't what?

955
01:15:58,268 --> 01:16:01,229
- I can't go into that backyard.
- Why not?

956
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:04,858
There's a beast back there.

957
01:16:06,192 --> 01:16:08,320
What kind?

958
01:16:08,445 --> 01:16:11,906
A giant gorilla-dog thing
that ate one kid already.

959
01:16:12,032 --> 01:16:15,118
Is that a fact?
Sit down, kid.

960
01:16:17,287 --> 01:16:19,372
Sit down.

961
01:16:25,587 --> 01:16:28,465
Let me tell you something, kid.

962
01:16:28,590 --> 01:16:32,052
Everybody gets one chance
to do something great.

963
01:16:32,135 --> 01:16:35,430
Most people never take the chance,
either 'cause they're too scared...

964
01:16:35,513 --> 01:16:38,099
or they don't recognize it
when it spits on their shoes.

965
01:16:38,224 --> 01:16:40,894
This is your big chance,

966
01:16:40,977 --> 01:16:43,229
and you shouldn't let it go by.

967
01:16:43,313 --> 01:16:47,150
Remember when you busted the guts
out of the ball the other day?

968
01:16:47,275 --> 01:16:51,154
Someone's telling you something, kid.
If I was you, I'd listen.

969
01:16:52,739 --> 01:16:55,158
Yeah. But what?

970
01:16:55,241 --> 01:16:58,078
You're the one with the rubber legs.

971
01:16:58,161 --> 01:17:00,163
Figure it out.

972
01:17:01,748 --> 01:17:04,125
"Henry Aaron."

973
01:17:04,209 --> 01:17:07,462
- I don't know why, but can I have this?
- Sure, yeah.

974
01:17:07,545 --> 01:17:09,464
Thanks.

975
01:17:11,549 --> 01:17:13,843
Wait.

976
01:17:15,845 --> 01:17:20,600
You're saying I should hop over
that fence and pickle The Beast?

977
01:17:22,185 --> 01:17:26,356
Think about that, kid.
I'll see you later.

978
01:17:30,652 --> 01:17:34,280
Remember, kid, there's heroes
and there's legends.

979
01:17:34,364 --> 01:17:36,992
Heroes get remembered,

980
01:17:37,117 --> 01:17:39,160
but legends never die.

981
01:17:39,244 --> 01:17:43,164
Follow your heart, kid,
and you'll never go wrong.

982
01:17:47,002 --> 01:17:49,254
I had a dream. Get dressed.
We're going to the sandlot.

983
01:17:49,379 --> 01:17:51,548
Okay. Wait.
I'll get my stuff.

984
01:18:00,390 --> 01:18:03,143
Only one kid
in history had ever attempted...

985
01:18:03,226 --> 01:18:05,854
what Benny was about to,

986
01:18:05,937 --> 01:18:07,897
and he got eaten.

987
01:18:07,981 --> 01:18:11,359
So we were worried--
real worried--

988
01:18:11,443 --> 01:18:14,279
even when Benny brought out
the secret weapon:

989
01:18:14,404 --> 01:18:18,575
shoes guaranteed to make a kid
run faster and jump higher,

990
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:20,577
P.F. Flyers.

991
01:18:20,702 --> 01:18:23,872
We can't let him do this, man.

992
01:18:41,181 --> 01:18:42,891
Benny, wait.

993
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:46,019
It's okay.

994
01:18:46,102 --> 01:18:48,063
It was my fault.

995
01:18:50,148 --> 01:18:52,317
You don't have to do this.

996
01:18:52,442 --> 01:18:56,071
Yeah. Come on, Benny, man. You don't
have to do it. Forget about it.

997
01:18:56,196 --> 01:18:59,032
It's like committing suicide,
Benny. Don't do it.

998
01:18:59,115 --> 01:19:01,451
- Yeah, don't do it, Benny.
- Yeah.

999
01:19:01,576 --> 01:19:03,286
Don't do it.
It's suicide.

1000
01:19:03,411 --> 01:19:05,622
Yeah, I do, Smalls.

1001
01:19:07,082 --> 01:19:09,542
I have to do this.

1002
01:19:17,926 --> 01:19:19,803
Heroes get remembered,

1003
01:19:19,928 --> 01:19:21,930
but legends never die.

1004
01:19:22,013 --> 01:19:25,809
Follow your heart, kid,
and you'll never go wrong.

1005
01:21:33,103 --> 01:21:35,730
Whoa!

1006
01:21:38,525 --> 01:21:41,444
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Yeah!

1007
01:21:41,569 --> 01:21:44,948
- Yeah! All right, Benny!
- Oh, shit!

1008
01:21:58,086 --> 01:22:02,132
Come on! What are we waiting for?
Let's get him!

1009
01:22:10,056 --> 01:22:13,601
A werewolf can be killed
only with a silver bullet...

1010
01:22:13,727 --> 01:22:16,313
or a silver knife
or a stick...

1011
01:22:16,438 --> 01:22:18,940
- with a silver handle.
- You're insane.

1012
01:22:24,446 --> 01:22:26,406
Aah!

1013
01:22:27,657 --> 01:22:29,117
Ohh!

1014
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:32,746
- The wolf bit you, didn't he?
- Yeah, he did.

1015
01:22:37,334 --> 01:22:41,171
Go now.
And heaven help you.

1016
01:23:51,616 --> 01:23:55,537
Look out! Aah!

1017
01:23:58,456 --> 01:24:01,418
Hey! Hey!

1018
01:24:07,132 --> 01:24:10,051
Hey, hey, hey! Kids!

1019
01:24:12,762 --> 01:24:15,015
Put it down.
Careful, careful.

1020
01:24:16,391 --> 01:24:18,935
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1021
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:22,230
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1022
01:24:32,782 --> 01:24:34,743
Mommy, Mommy, look.
A doggy!

1023
01:24:37,454 --> 01:24:41,291
Ooh, a big doggy.

1024
01:24:45,754 --> 01:24:48,256
- Ohh!
- Look out! Look out!

1025
01:24:48,381 --> 01:24:50,717
Look out!
Sandlot, sandlot, sandlot!

1026
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:53,053
Sandlot!
Let's go!

1027
01:24:53,136 --> 01:24:56,431
This way! Sandlot!
Shortcut, you guys! Let's go!

1028
01:25:10,695 --> 01:25:12,989
Where is he?

1029
01:25:13,114 --> 01:25:14,991
Does anyone see him?

1030
01:25:15,116 --> 01:25:17,285
I don't see him.

1031
01:25:22,916 --> 01:25:25,210
There he is!

1032
01:25:33,259 --> 01:25:35,178
Oh, no.

1033
01:25:57,617 --> 01:26:01,538
Aah!

1034
01:26:13,550 --> 01:26:15,635
Look out!

1035
01:26:45,582 --> 01:26:48,251
Oh, man.

1036
01:26:48,376 --> 01:26:50,420
Oh, man.

1037
01:27:00,930 --> 01:27:02,849
Come on, guys.
Help me!

1038
01:27:02,932 --> 01:27:04,851
Please!

1039
01:27:07,562 --> 01:27:12,275
Benny! Benny,
help me, please! He's hurt!

1040
01:27:15,070 --> 01:27:17,781
Come on.
I can't lift it.

1041
01:28:14,754 --> 01:28:16,673
Let's go.

1042
01:28:29,853 --> 01:28:32,022
Wow!

1043
01:28:35,817 --> 01:28:37,736
Aw.

1044
01:28:44,576 --> 01:28:47,996
- Wow!
- Now we can play forever.

1045
01:29:10,393 --> 01:29:12,270
Hello?

1046
01:29:12,395 --> 01:29:14,689
This is bad.

1047
01:29:14,773 --> 01:29:16,691
This is very bad.

1048
01:29:16,775 --> 01:29:19,861
Um, we-- we--
we brought your dog home.

1049
01:29:19,986 --> 01:29:22,489
Hercules?

1050
01:29:22,572 --> 01:29:24,491
How'd he get out?

1051
01:29:24,574 --> 01:29:28,411
I'm telling you guys,
we should've just turned it loose.

1052
01:29:29,704 --> 01:29:32,040
Um, uh, well, uh-- We, uh--

1053
01:29:32,123 --> 01:29:36,419
What happened was, we hit a baseball
into your yard. We tried to get it back.

1054
01:29:36,544 --> 01:29:40,423
- So you're the ones that've
been making all that racket.
- Yes, sir.

1055
01:29:40,548 --> 01:29:42,634
You get it?

1056
01:29:42,759 --> 01:29:45,971
Um, y-yeah.

1057
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:50,809
Well, first time...

1058
01:29:50,934 --> 01:29:54,729
that anybody ever got
the best of old Hercules.

1059
01:29:54,813 --> 01:29:58,233
Why didn't you just knock on the door?
I'd have gotten it for you.

1060
01:29:58,316 --> 01:30:00,110
Oh, my God!

1061
01:30:00,235 --> 01:30:02,278
I can't believe you!

1062
01:30:02,404 --> 01:30:06,116
- We got the ball back, didn't we?
- We almost got killed!

1063
01:30:06,241 --> 01:30:09,703
Didn't we get the ball back?
Just shut up!

1064
01:30:11,788 --> 01:30:13,707
We got the ball back.

1065
01:30:18,670 --> 01:30:21,423
Thanks for bringing him home.

1066
01:30:21,506 --> 01:30:24,092
Come on in.

1067
01:30:28,305 --> 01:30:30,849
We'll talk about this baseball.

1068
01:30:30,974 --> 01:30:32,851
Come on.

1069
01:30:42,485 --> 01:30:44,988
You in trouble,
aren't you, son?

1070
01:30:47,490 --> 01:30:50,201
Yeah, well, uh,
that was my stepdad's ball.

1071
01:30:50,327 --> 01:30:53,413
I took it without asking.

1072
01:30:53,496 --> 01:30:57,000
- It was signed by Babe Ruth.
- George signed this?

1073
01:30:57,125 --> 01:30:59,836
George Herman Ruth?
Yeah.

1074
01:30:59,961 --> 01:31:03,965
I take it back. You're not in trouble.
You're dead where you stand.

1075
01:31:06,593 --> 01:31:08,511
Hold on.

1076
01:31:10,430 --> 01:31:12,474
Hold on.

1077
01:31:28,198 --> 01:31:30,533
Here.

1078
01:31:32,118 --> 01:31:35,121
I'll trade ya.

1079
01:31:35,205 --> 01:31:38,625
That's nice of you, but that ball
really is signed by Babe Ruth.

1080
01:31:38,708 --> 01:31:43,046
So's this one, with the rest
of the 1927 Yankees.

1081
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:49,302
Oh, man.
Murderer's Row!

1082
01:31:49,386 --> 01:31:51,888
Lou Gehrig!

1083
01:31:51,972 --> 01:31:55,350
Babe Ruth! But why would you trade?

1084
01:31:55,433 --> 01:31:57,102
That one's all chewed up.

1085
01:31:57,227 --> 01:32:00,021
I got a lot of good stuff.
Look at that stuff.

1086
01:32:00,105 --> 01:32:03,358
Besides, you need it
more than I do.

1087
01:32:17,455 --> 01:32:19,374
You knew Babe Ruth?

1088
01:32:19,457 --> 01:32:23,420
George? I sure did.
And he knew me.

1089
01:32:23,503 --> 01:32:27,215
He was almost as great
a hitter as I was.

1090
01:32:27,340 --> 01:32:31,344
- I would've broken his record, but--
- You went blind.

1091
01:32:31,428 --> 01:32:33,888
Yep. I used to crowd the plate...

1092
01:32:33,972 --> 01:32:37,851
so the strike zone
almost disappeared.

1093
01:32:37,934 --> 01:32:40,437
Pitchers hate that.

1094
01:32:41,771 --> 01:32:44,899
That's the way I played--
100 % all the time.

1095
01:32:44,983 --> 01:32:48,153
Baseball was life.

1096
01:32:48,278 --> 01:32:51,239
And I was good at it, real good.

1097
01:32:51,364 --> 01:32:53,783
And then... one day,

1098
01:32:53,908 --> 01:32:55,952
a high fast one, and pow,

1099
01:32:56,077 --> 01:32:58,204
lights went out.

1100
01:33:01,207 --> 01:33:04,002
I don't think we
could take this ball.

1101
01:33:04,127 --> 01:33:06,046
I'll tell you what.

1102
01:33:06,129 --> 01:33:10,759
You guys come by once a week
and talk baseball with me,
we'll call it an even trade.

1103
01:33:15,847 --> 01:33:17,766
Deal!

1104
01:33:19,601 --> 01:33:22,646
Even though
Bill loved the Murderer's Row ball,

1105
01:33:22,771 --> 01:33:25,398
he was still plenty mad
about me having swiped...

1106
01:33:25,482 --> 01:33:29,235
his Babe Ruth autographed ball
and ruining it.

1107
01:33:29,319 --> 01:33:33,281
So I didn't feel too bad when
he grounded me for a week...

1108
01:33:33,365 --> 01:33:35,659
instead of the rest of my life.

1109
01:33:35,742 --> 01:33:37,911
Wow!

1110
01:33:37,994 --> 01:33:40,288
Things worked out
between me and him.

1111
01:33:40,372 --> 01:33:42,791
And from then on,
I didn't have any trouble...

1112
01:33:42,874 --> 01:33:46,628
just calling him Dad
all the time.

1113
01:33:46,711 --> 01:33:50,590
We all lived together
in the neighborhood
for a couple of more years--

1114
01:33:50,674 --> 01:33:53,802
mostly through junior high school--
and every summer was great.

1115
01:33:53,927 --> 01:33:57,263
But none of them ever came
close to that first one.

1116
01:33:57,347 --> 01:33:59,432
When one guy would move away,

1117
01:33:59,516 --> 01:34:02,602
we never replaced him
on the team with anyone else.

1118
01:34:02,686 --> 01:34:06,106
We just kept the game going
like he was still there.

1119
01:34:06,189 --> 01:34:08,441
You're starting
to hurt my hand.

1120
01:34:08,525 --> 01:34:10,610
Don't miss it!

1121
01:34:10,777 --> 01:34:13,113
It was weird that Benny said...

1122
01:34:13,196 --> 01:34:17,617
Babe Ruth was like the Hercules
of baseball, and The Beast's
name ended up being Hercules.

1123
01:34:17,701 --> 01:34:20,203
None of us could figure out
what that meant,

1124
01:34:20,286 --> 01:34:22,539
but we were all amazed by it.

1125
01:34:22,664 --> 01:34:24,624
I kept in touch with those guys
over the years,

1126
01:34:24,708 --> 01:34:28,295
and I found out that Yeah- Yeah's parents
shipped him off to military school.

1127
01:34:28,378 --> 01:34:32,257
After the army, he became one of the
pioneering developers of bungee jumping.

1128
01:34:32,382 --> 01:34:34,217
Of course, we all know why.

1129
01:34:34,342 --> 01:34:37,512
Bertram, well-- Bertram got
really into the '60s,

1130
01:34:37,595 --> 01:34:39,639
and no one ever saw him again.

1131
01:34:39,723 --> 01:34:43,643
Timmy and Tommy became
an architect and a contractor.

1132
01:34:43,727 --> 01:34:46,062
They started out small,
designing playground equipment...

1133
01:34:46,146 --> 01:34:48,273
and prefabricated tree houses.

1134
01:34:48,398 --> 01:34:50,275
But they became
multimillionaires...

1135
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:54,237
when they invented
mini-malls.

1136
01:34:54,321 --> 01:34:56,823
Squints grew up and married
Wendy Peffercorn.

1137
01:34:56,906 --> 01:34:58,908
They have nine kids.

1138
01:34:59,034 --> 01:35:02,704
They bought Vincent's Drugstore,
and they still own it to this day.

1139
01:35:02,787 --> 01:35:05,540
Hamilton Porter became
a professional wrestler.

1140
01:35:05,623 --> 01:35:07,876
You know him
as The Great Hambino.

1141
01:35:07,959 --> 01:35:12,672
DeNunez played triple-A ball,
but he never got to the majors.

1142
01:35:12,756 --> 01:35:15,550
He owns his own business now,
and he coaches a little league team...

1143
01:35:15,634 --> 01:35:19,220
that his sons play on
called the Heaters.

1144
01:35:19,304 --> 01:35:22,766
Hercules lived
to be 199 years old--

1145
01:35:22,891 --> 01:35:24,768
uh, in doggy years.

1146
01:35:24,893 --> 01:35:27,771
I was the last one
to move away.

1147
01:35:27,896 --> 01:35:31,066
But when I did,
the sandlot was still there.

1148
01:35:31,191 --> 01:35:35,028
After Benny pickled The Beast,
his reputation spread all over town.

1149
01:35:35,111 --> 01:35:38,698
From then on, he was known as
Benny "The Jet" Rodriguez.

1150
01:35:38,782 --> 01:35:42,369
And the nickname stuck with him
for the rest of his life.

1151
01:35:42,452 --> 01:35:45,038
Now pinch running
for the Los Angeles Dodgers,

1152
01:35:45,121 --> 01:35:48,958
Benny "The Jet" Rodriguez!

1153
01:35:50,210 --> 01:35:53,463
It is the clutch situation
of the season.

1154
01:35:53,588 --> 01:35:56,299
They say The Jet's lost
a step or two,

1155
01:35:56,424 --> 01:36:00,136
but I wouldn't be surprised
to see some fireworks here.

1156
01:36:02,430 --> 01:36:06,434
The Jet's got
a suicide lead and--

1157
01:36:06,518 --> 01:36:09,312
And there he goes! He's stealing home!
I don't believe it!

1158
01:36:09,396 --> 01:36:12,315
He's stealing home!

1159
01:36:12,399 --> 01:36:15,819
He's stealing home,
and they don't see him! The pitch!

1160
01:36:22,993 --> 01:36:25,912
He's hit the dirt!
He's safe! Safe!

1161
01:36:25,996 --> 01:36:29,040
Oh, my God!

1162
01:36:31,042 --> 01:36:33,253
Safe! Safe! Safe!

1163
01:36:33,336 --> 01:36:37,674
I don't believe it! The Jet
stole home! The Jet stole home!

1164
01:37:06,786 --> 01:37:08,038
Andante

1166
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:12,136
