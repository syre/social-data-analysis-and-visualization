1
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,086
Blood glucose fine. Liver function,
kidney function, normal.

2
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,799
Platelet count's normal.
Haemoglobin levels normal.

3
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:49,632
Blood pressure, 131 over 92.

4
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:51,919
Isn't this a little high?

5
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,675
Weight's fine. Could do with losing
a centimetre or two off your waist.

6
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:58,177
- Oh. Stool sample outstanding.
- Oh.

7
00:00:58,917 --> 00:01:01,466
No, that means you
haven't provided one yet.

8
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:03,719
Yes, of course. No, I'd remember.

9
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:06,378
You think it didn't
stink or something?

10
00:01:06,542 --> 00:01:08,670
There's nothing wrong
with you, Martin.

11
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,128
Uh, your wife tells me you
think you're mildly depressed?

12
00:01:12,292 --> 00:01:14,294
Well, I got the sack.
I'm unemployed.

13
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:17,462
- Yes. But it wasn't your fault, was it?
- That's why I'm depressed.

14
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:19,923
I got sacked for saying
something I didn't say.

15
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:21,175
Try running.

16
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,335
I said the opposite of
what I was sacked for.

17
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,252
What are you working
on at the moment?

18
00:01:25,417 --> 00:01:27,294
Uh, thinking of writing a book.

19
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:29,552
Oh! Well, that's good.
What's it about?

20
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:31,961
Russian history.

21
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,502

<i>There was no sign of Mr
Sixsmith at his home today,</i>

27
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:54,301
<i>but after a week of trying to clear his

28
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:58,759
<i>He told the Sunday Times that senior figures

There you are. Well,
that was embarrassing.

42
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,379
Father Tierney just asked me
where you disappeared to.

43
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:17,218
Well... I don't believe in God.
And I think he can tell.

44
00:03:18,042 --> 00:03:19,919
Come on.

45
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,927
- I'm worried about you, Martin.
- I did that.

46
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,677
I wish you had. You need
to get back to work.

47
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,961
What happened to that
book on Russian history?

48
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,753
No one's interested in
Russian bloody history.

49
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:31,762
I haven't seen you any place.
Where are you from?

50
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,094
Are you from Limerick, then?

51
00:04:44,542 --> 00:04:46,590
- Hello, Philomena.
- Father.

52
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,674
How have you been?
How's your new hip?

53
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,674
Oh, it's very good. It's titanium.

54
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:59,758
- I haven't seen you for a while.
- I just came into light a candle.

55
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,177
Someone special?

56
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,131
Yes.

57
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,503
I like your dress.

58
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:11,089
Did you make it yourself?

59
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,094
No. I bought it in a shop.

60
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:19,759
And anyways, me auntie told me I wasn't
supposed to speak to strange men like you.

61
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:44,132
<i>Did you let him put
his hands on you?</i>

62
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,173
Did you enjoy your sin?

63
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:49,590
Did you take your knickers down?

64
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:54,837
Answer Sister Hildegarde.
Did you take them down?

65
00:05:56,042 --> 00:05:57,168
Yes.

66
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,840
<i>Oh, Reverend Mother,</i>

67
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,594
at school, the sisters never
taught us about babies.

68
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,218
Did your mother not tell you?

69
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,469
- Her mother died ten years ago.
- Oh.

70
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,218
God rest her soul.

71
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:16,336
<i>Don't dare blame the
sisters for this.</i>

72
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,505
<i>You are the cause of this shame.
You and your indecency.</i>

73
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:33,626
I don't know what to do!

74
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:37,799
We must get a doctor. The baby's
the wrong way round. It's breech!

75
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:41,087
It's in God's hands now.
The pain is her penance.

76
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:45,835
Hail, holy Queen, Mother of Mercy!
Hail, holy Queen, Mother of Mercy!

77
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:52,261
Don't let her put my
baby in the ground!

78
00:06:52,417 --> 00:06:55,136
It's cold in there.
It's dark in there.

79
00:07:01,167 --> 00:07:04,171
Just go up and turn their
lights out in half an hour. OK?

80
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,836
Doesn't she know you
have a proper job?

81
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,004
She's short staffed.
I'm just filling in.

82
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,969
I'll be home before midnight.

83
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,969
Mother?

84
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:22,341
What is it? Are you all right?

85
00:07:37,292 --> 00:07:39,215
Who is it?

86
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:44,886
It's his birthday.

87
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:48,136
He'll be 50 today.

88
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,797
Breathe.

89
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,093
It's a boy.

90
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,127
Oh, Martin!

91
00:08:31,292 --> 00:08:32,885
- Hello, David.
- Hello.

92
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,552
- Keith you know.
- Yes, hello again.

93
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:40,168
And Sally Mitchell, this is Martin Sixsmith,
used to be the BBC's man in Moscow.

94
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:41,505
- And Washington.
- Hello.

95
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:45,251
Then he became a spin doctor for the
government, and it all went a bit tits-up.

96
00:08:45,417 --> 00:08:46,839
Is that a fair summation, Martin?

97
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,834
That's fair enough. I always say,
"if you shovel shit for long enough,

98
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,923
eventually you'll get
some on your shoes."

99
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,381
Yes, you got it on your head.
How did you manage that?

100
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:57,960
What are you up to at the moment?

101
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,674
I'm thinking of writing a
book on Russian history.

102
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,552
Or something else.
Maybe get back into journalism.

103
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:06,131
I remember you!

104
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:08,340
You're the one who sent
that terrible e-mail

105
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,709
saying it was a good day
to bury bad news on 9/11.

106
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,253
- No, that was someone else.
- Well, I thought it was you.

107
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:18,047
No, it's a common mistake. On the
day of Princess Margaret's funeral,

108
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:21,178
I sent an e-mail saying let's make
sure the only thing we "bury",

109
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,257
- today, is Princess Margaret.
- Which is slightly different.

110
00:09:24,417 --> 00:09:26,385
It's very different,
actually... But...

111
00:09:26,542 --> 00:09:29,421
If you want to get back into
journalism, you should talk to Sally.

112
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:33,884
I just do sob stories, human interest.
It's not really your cup of tea, is it?

113
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:35,009
Well...

114
00:09:35,167 --> 00:09:38,467
But I'll be happy to have a look if
you want to push any ideas my way.

115
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,719
Yes... Please.

116
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:51,713
Excuse me. Do you have a
glass of Pinot Grigio?

117
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,426
It's just red or white.

118
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:57,006
I'll have white, please.

119
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:01,045
I couldn't help overhearing
you're a journalist.

120
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,961
I know this woman, she had a
baby when she was a teenager

121
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,548
and she's kept it
secret for 50 years.

122
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,836
I only found out today.

123
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:13,001
Sorry. The baby was taken
from her by these nuns.

124
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:17,257
- They made her have him adopted.
- Mm.

125
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:20,261
And she's kept it a
secret all this time.

126
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:25,259
Well, the thing is, I'm working on a book
at the moment about Russian history.

127
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:26,464
That's my thing.

128
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:30,129
And what you're talking about would be
what they call a human interest story.

129
00:10:30,292 --> 00:10:31,794
I don't do those.

130
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:34,260
Why not?

131
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:39,469
Because "human interest story"
is a euphemism for stories about

132
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:42,003
weak-minded, vulnerable,
ignorant people,

133
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:46,468
to put in newspapers read by vulnerable,
weak-minded, ignorant people.

134
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,209
Not that you are. And, yeah,
anyway, I hope you find him.

135
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,344
Do you think I should do
a human interest story?

136
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:19,670
Hello, you must be
Philomena. I'm Martin.

137
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,835
- Hello, Martin.
- Hello again.

138
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,001
Hello.

139
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:25,545
We've got a table through
here. After you.

140
00:11:26,542 --> 00:11:28,636
Just to the left.

141
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,506
I must apologise for
the other night.

142
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:33,886
Afraid I was a bit...
Caught me at a bad moment.

143
00:11:34,042 --> 00:11:37,046
That's all right. I'm just glad
you managed to track me down.

144
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,677
I hope you don't mind coming here.
It's Mum's favourite.

145
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,336
No, no, it's... it's very nice.

146
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,343
Um, just...

147
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,386
So, Philomena, how are you?

148
00:11:52,042 --> 00:11:53,510
I'm all right.

149
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,381
I had a hip replacement
last year, Martin.

150
00:11:57,542 --> 00:11:58,634
Right.

151
00:11:58,792 --> 00:12:00,965
It's much better than the
bone one I had before.

152
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,719
And it's titanium,
so it won't rust.

153
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:07,004
Oh. That's good, otherwise they'd
have to oil you like the Tin Man.

154
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,175
Is that right?

155
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,711
No, I mean, you know,
like The Wizard Of Oz.

156
00:12:13,792 --> 00:12:17,422
- He's just joking, Mum.
- No, no, I'm just joking. No...

157
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:21,258
My mother has advanced
osteoarthritis in both her knees.

158
00:12:21,417 --> 00:12:23,795
Oh.

159
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,836
- Shall we get some salad?
- Salad, yes.

160
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,092
Yes.

161
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:38,505
Jane's the clever one in our family. She
went to university as a mature student.

162
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:40,260
You know, when you're quite old.

163
00:12:40,417 --> 00:12:43,261
Where did you go, Martin?
Oxbridge, I bet.

164
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:45,886
You've rumbled me. Oxford, yes.

165
00:12:46,042 --> 00:12:47,419
I knew you weren't a duffer.

166
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:50,863
- I don't think I've been in a Harvester before.
- Do they not have them in London?

167
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,507
No, I tend to go to a little
local place, near where I live.

168
00:12:53,667 --> 00:12:55,544
- And where's that?
- Knightsbridge.

169
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,757
Oh. Well, that must
be very expensive.

170
00:13:00,917 --> 00:13:03,340
I love these little bits
of toast on mine...

171
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,093
And are you married, Martin?

172
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:11,130
- Yes, I am. To Kate. 20 years.
- That's good. That's grand.

173
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,386
I did love him, you know.

174
00:13:19,042 --> 00:13:22,376
<i>I've kept what happened to me
buried away for 50 years.</i>

175
00:13:23,917 --> 00:13:27,797
<i>My father just left me with
the nuns, he was so ashamed.</i>

176
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,960
<i>He told everyone I was dead.</i>

177
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,585
<i>My family never visited me.</i>

178
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:38,884
<i>After you'd had your baby, you had
to stay in the abbey for four years.</i>

179
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:42,717
<i>In order to repay the sisters for
taking you in, you had to work.</i>

180
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:49,633
<i>The worst jobs were in the laundry.
That's where they put me.</i>

181
00:13:49,792 --> 00:13:53,296
<i>I worked there seven days a week,
the whole time I was there.</i>

182
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,337
<i>I worked there with my
best friend, Kathleen.</i>

183
00:14:08,042 --> 00:14:11,216
<i>We were allowed to see our
children for an hour a day.</i>

184
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,469
- Come on.
- That was all.

185
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,802
Walk, don't run!

186
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,218
- Mary!
- Mummy.

187
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:51,507
<i>Anthony was best friends with
Kathleen's daughter, Mary.</i>

188
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:54,511
<i>The two of them were inseparable.</i>

189
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:00,458
Look at that. He won't
let her out of his sight.

190
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,010
What's the matter?

191
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:08,626
The girls in the kitchen said that
Mother Barbara had Mary up at the house.

192
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:10,669
What do you think
they wanted with her?

193
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,301
Phil.

194
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,677
I'm sure it's nothing
to worry about.

195
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,506
I won't be a minute.

196
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:23,508
- Phil, I've got something for you.
- Kathleen's worried sick.

197
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:27,797
She thinks they'll take Mary from her.
I told her they'd tell her first for sure.

198
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,426
Look.

199
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,802
You can't tell anyone
you've got it.

200
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,675
- I bet the father was handsome.
- He was. How did you get this?

201
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:42,963
I borrowed a Box Brownie and took it
when Reverend Mother wasn't looking.

202
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:46,169
Thank you.

203
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:54,506
Whenever I look at that photo of Anthony,
I say a little prayer for Anunciata,

204
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:57,170
who saved his life when
I gave birth to him.

205
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,173
She died a long time ago now...

206
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,756
But if she hadn't taken
that, I'd have nothing.

207
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:08,342
So, were you just trapped
there the whole time?

208
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,299
You could only leave
if you paid them £100.

209
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:15,965
But where would I get
that kind of money?

210
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,469
And where would I go?

211
00:16:24,292 --> 00:16:26,886
<i>I remember that day so clearly.</i>

212
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:31,086
<i>We all knew what it meant
when a big car arrived.</i>

213
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:35,011
<i>Kathleen was inconsolable.</i>

214
00:16:35,167 --> 00:16:37,169
<i>She knew this time
they'd come for Mary.</i>

215
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,381
No, no, no, no.

216
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,594
Come away from there!

217
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,426
What are you doing out here?

218
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,674
I had a stomach ache,
Sister Hildegarde.

219
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:17,922
It's my time of the month.

220
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,757
You're not unique in that regard.

221
00:17:20,917 --> 00:17:23,215
Put your mind to your
work and it will pass.

222
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:55,965
Phil, it's choir practice.

223
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:05,294
You'll be in trouble
if you don't go.

224
00:18:28,042 --> 00:18:30,295
<i>Normally, I loved to sing.</i>

225
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:33,841
<i>It was one of the only things
I enjoyed in that place.</i>

226
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,754
<i>But all I could think
about was poor Kathleen.</i>

227
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:55,341
- Philomena, they're taking Anthony.
- No, no.

228
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,173
- They're taking him away.
- No.

229
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:04,340
Where is he?

230
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:22,300
Anthony!

231
00:19:23,917 --> 00:19:25,294
Anthony!

232
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,460
Anthony!

233
00:19:56,417 --> 00:19:57,919
Anthony!

234
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,218
Anthony!

235
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,593
Anthony!

236
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,256
Anthony!

237
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,127
Anthony!

238
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:25,588
They'd only come for Mary, but Anthony
wouldn't let her out of his sight.

239
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,047
They were inseparable.

240
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,960
I think what they did
to you was evil.

241
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,968
No, no, no, I don't like that word.

242
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,093
No, no. Evil's good.

243
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:37,219
Story-wise, I mean.

244
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,798
Some of the nuns were very nice.

245
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:45,962
It was a breech birth. They wouldn't
even give her any painkillers.

246
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:48,002
Excellent.

247
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:50,135
Again, story-wise.

248
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,423
So, can we go and
talk to these nuns?

249
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:56,962
Uh, yes, well, you could try. Maybe
you'll have more luck than Mum's had.

250
00:20:57,125 --> 00:21:00,174
I've been several times over
the years to ask where he was.

251
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,961
And they're very helpful,
they're not like they used to be.

252
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,048
They said they'd try
and trace him for me.

253
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:06,676
- But they haven't?
- No.

254
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:13,635
Can you help me find him, Martin?

255
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,093
Well, it's a very
interesting story.

256
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,799
I'm taking Mum to Ireland
for a few days next week.

257
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:22,007
Why don't you come with us?
You could visit Roscrea with her.

258
00:21:22,167 --> 00:21:24,795
Yes, there's plenty of room.
It's a Vauxhall Cavalier.

259
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:29,801
Oh, no. I mean, thank you.
But... I like to fly.

260
00:22:01,167 --> 00:22:02,419
Hello. Sorry I'm late.

261
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:03,880
- Hello, Martin.
- Hi, Martin.

262
00:22:04,042 --> 00:22:05,885
I had a bit of trouble
with the hire car.

263
00:22:06,042 --> 00:22:08,420
- Well, this is lovely, isn't it, Jane?
- There you go.

264
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:11,302
I see why you wouldn't want to
squash up with us in the Cavalier.

265
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:14,302
No, no. It wasn't that. It was...
I just had a few things to do.

266
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,211
- Sure you don't want me to come, Mum?
- You're not coming?

267
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:20,379
No, I told Jane we'll be fine
on our own, just the two of us.

268
00:22:20,542 --> 00:22:23,261
- Isn't that right, Martin?
- Yeah. That's fine.

269
00:22:23,417 --> 00:22:26,671
I've put a few things in your bag.
I'll see you tonight.

270
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,752
- Thanks, Martin.
- OK.

271
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:46,337
- What kind of a car is this?
- A BMW.

272
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,049
- That's German.
- Mm-hm.

273
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:51,085
Would you like a Tune, Martin?

274
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,344
If I hum it, will you play it?

275
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,127
No, would you like a Tune?

276
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:57,169
Yes. I'm just...

277
00:22:58,542 --> 00:23:00,010
Thanks.

278
00:23:00,167 --> 00:23:01,885
Ooh.

279
00:23:05,167 --> 00:23:07,386
That's for good luck.

280
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:13,209
I've always thought that Saint Christopher
was a bit of a Mickey Mouse saint.

281
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:16,044
I used to be an altar boy.

282
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:18,210
Do you believe in God, Martin?

283
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:20,969
Well, where do you start?

284
00:23:22,542 --> 00:23:25,386
I've always thought that was a
very difficult question to...

285
00:23:25,542 --> 00:23:27,510
give a simple answer to.

286
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,344
- Do you?
- Yes.

287
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:27,927
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

288
00:24:33,417 --> 00:24:35,840
I'm one of the lucky ones, Martin.

289
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,379
Some of the mothers and babies
didn't even survive the childbirth.

290
00:24:39,542 --> 00:24:41,340
Gosh.

291
00:24:42,042 --> 00:24:44,966
- Can I help you?
- I'm Philomena Lee.

292
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:48,004
- I made an appointment.
- Yes. Come in, Philomena.

293
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:50,670
This is my friend Martin
Sixsmith, News At Ten.

294
00:24:50,833 --> 00:24:53,382
Well, it's BBC News,
actually, but not any more.

295
00:24:53,542 --> 00:24:55,761
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

296
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:03,302
- Sister Claire will be with you shortly.
- Thank you.

297
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,377
May I use the bathroom?

298
00:25:06,542 --> 00:25:09,136
- It's downstairs on...
- I know where it is.

299
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:14,210
Will I get you both some tea?

300
00:25:14,375 --> 00:25:16,127
Yes, thank you.

301
00:26:18,292 --> 00:26:20,135
<i>Anthony!</i>

302
00:26:27,583 --> 00:26:29,506
<i>Anthony!</i>

303
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:32,468
<i>Anthony!</i>

304
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:36,210
Anthony!

305
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:39,585
Anthony!

306
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:44,963
Anth... ony!

307
00:27:03,625 --> 00:27:05,753
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

308
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,969
- I'm Sister Claire.
- Yes, hello.

309
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:12,709
I was just admiring your picture
of Jayne Mansfield there.

310
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:16,209
No, that's Jane Russell. Jayne
Mansfield was the blonde one.

311
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:18,844
Yes, of course, yes. But
they were both very big.

312
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,676
I mean the two of them,
they were huge. Their careers.

313
00:27:23,833 --> 00:27:27,258
- Which one of them died in a car crash?
- Jayne Mansfield, yes.

314
00:27:27,417 --> 00:27:29,920
- Why is she on the wall?
- Sorry, I didn't catch your name.

315
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:33,417
- Martin Sixsmith.
- Martin Sixsmith, News At Ten.

316
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:35,927
Well, I was with the
BBC, but not any more.

317
00:27:36,708 --> 00:27:39,632
Hello, Philomena.
Very nice to meet you.

318
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:41,760
- I'm Sister Claire.
- Sister Claire.

319
00:27:41,917 --> 00:27:44,841
Now, when was the last time
you came to see us, Philomena?

320
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,173
It was well before your
time, Sister Claire.

321
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:51,213
I spoke to Sister Hildegarde
on the telephone

322
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:54,174
and when I came here she
wasn't well enough to see me.

323
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:57,257
She's still with us,
but she's very frail now.

324
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,298
Oh, Martin, have
some buttered brack.

325
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:02,131
Wouldn't mind.

326
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:08,752
Mm. That's very nice.
It's like son of pan dolce?

327
00:28:08,917 --> 00:28:12,376
- It is fruit bread, Martin.
- Yes. No, I know. It's lovely.

328
00:28:12,542 --> 00:28:16,592
Well, now, I don't know if they
told you last time, Philomena,

329
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:19,549
but most of our records were
destroyed in the big fire.

330
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:21,460
- Oh?
- Fire?

331
00:28:21,625 --> 00:28:27,211
Well, it was before my time. So I'm
afraid I have no news of Anthony.

332
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:42,377
I still go to Mass and...

333
00:28:44,792 --> 00:28:48,672
...I don't want to cause any fuss
or point the finger at anybody,

334
00:28:48,833 --> 00:28:50,961
or blame the Church in any way.

335
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:56,383
I only want to know if he's all right.
I don't even need to see him.

336
00:28:58,792 --> 00:29:04,925
I have visions of him and he's
homeless and nobody loves him.

337
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,210
Philomena, we can't take
away your pain,

338
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:15,800
but we can walk through
it with you, hand in hand.

339
00:29:17,417 --> 00:29:18,760
Um...

340
00:29:18,917 --> 00:29:22,251
These older nuns...
Sorry to interrupt.

341
00:29:22,417 --> 00:29:25,421
These older nuns, perhaps they could
help us with some of the details?

342
00:29:25,583 --> 00:29:27,881
Most of them have passed away.

343
00:29:28,042 --> 00:29:30,136
Right. What about the
ones that haven't?

344
00:29:30,292 --> 00:29:32,920
I don't think you're going to
get much sense out of them.

345
00:29:33,083 --> 00:29:35,177
But can we try?

346
00:29:36,833 --> 00:29:38,835
I don't think that's
going to be possible.

347
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,923
Why not?

348
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:44,257
I'm happy to answer any
questions Philomena has.

349
00:29:44,417 --> 00:29:48,217
- Well, I'm asking you a question.
- You're a journalist.

350
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:50,298
Yes, I am. Well, I used to be.

351
00:29:50,458 --> 00:29:53,337
- Martin's a Roman Catholic.
- Yes... Well, no, I used to be.

352
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,505
I'd feel more comfortable if I could
speak to Philomena in private.

353
00:30:25,625 --> 00:30:27,548
Hello.

354
00:30:27,708 --> 00:30:29,051
Can I help?

355
00:30:29,667 --> 00:30:32,341
- Oh, sorry. I was just...
- Are you looking for something?

356
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,877
What's down here?

357
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:36,966
- Those are private quarters.
- Oh. OK.

358
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:42,506
I'll wait outside.

359
00:31:22,583 --> 00:31:24,677
Sorry, I was just
having a look round.

360
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:36,927
What did she say to you?

361
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:40,417
Oh, she said you were a
journalist and that...

362
00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:45,635
you were trying to manipulate me and that
I should be careful what I say to you.

363
00:31:46,042 --> 00:31:48,215
She also gave me this.

364
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:52,719
- Do you want me to open it?
- Mm-hm.

365
00:31:57,625 --> 00:32:01,255
Well, it's a contract,
signed by you in 1955.

366
00:32:01,917 --> 00:32:06,548
It says, "I hereby relinquish full claim
forever to my said child Anthony Lee.

367
00:32:06,708 --> 00:32:07,925
I further undertake..."

368
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:10,427
"..never to attempt to
see, interfere with

369
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:14,838
or make any claim to the said
child at any future time."

370
00:32:16,875 --> 00:32:18,752
I'll never find him.

371
00:32:19,167 --> 00:32:23,092
If they coerced you in any way to sign
this, we can challenge them legally.

372
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,673
Marlin, no one coerced me.

373
00:32:25,833 --> 00:32:27,881
I signed of my own free will.

374
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,594
It's funny, isn't it?

375
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,378
All the pieces of
paper designed to...

376
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:41,216
help you find him
have been destroyed.

377
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:44,629
But guess what? The one piece of paper
designed to stop you finding him

378
00:32:44,792 --> 00:32:46,840
has been lovingly preserved.

379
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,675
God in His infinite wisdom decided
to spare that from the flames.

380
00:32:51,542 --> 00:32:55,968
I signed it because I believed I'd committed
a terrible sin and had to be punished.

381
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:01,426
But what made it so much
worse was that I enjoyed it.

382
00:33:02,542 --> 00:33:04,636
- What?
- The sex.

383
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:06,501
Oh...

384
00:33:06,667 --> 00:33:09,841
It was wonderful, Martin.
I thought I was floating on air.

385
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:14,925
He was so handsome...
and the way he held me in his arms.

386
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:19,629
The thing is I didn't even know
I had a clitoris, Martin.

387
00:33:19,792 --> 00:33:21,385
Right?

388
00:33:21,542 --> 00:33:25,467
And after the sex was over, I thought
anything that feels so lovely must be wrong.

389
00:33:27,167 --> 00:33:29,044
Fucking Catholics.

390
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:33,423
Sorry.

391
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:37,167
I spent 30 years as a nurse.
I've heard worse than that.

392
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:43,215
It's just, why would God bestow upon us a
sexual desire that he then wants us to resist?

393
00:33:43,875 --> 00:33:49,587
Is it some weird game he's invented to
alleviate the boredom of being omnipotent?

394
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,343
It baffles me.

395
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,923
And I think I'm pretty clever.

396
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:56,211
Well, maybe you're not.

397
00:33:59,625 --> 00:34:03,505
- How'd it go?
- What, from the Sisters of Little Mercy?

398
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:05,761
Right, so just tea and cake, then?

399
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:10,302
That's all they've ever
given you, isn't it, Mum?

400
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:14,006
It's not their fault, Jane.

401
00:34:14,167 --> 00:34:16,545
They had a fire and all
the records were lost.

402
00:34:16,708 --> 00:34:19,131
- No, thank you. It's past your bedtime.
- Thank you.

403
00:34:19,292 --> 00:34:22,341
Now, he's just poured
it now. Slainte.

404
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:24,506
Mother.

405
00:34:28,958 --> 00:34:31,928
- Right. Night, Martin.
- Night, Jane.

406
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:35,417
- Night-night, Martin.
- Night, Philomena. Sleep well.

407
00:34:38,542 --> 00:34:39,964
Cheers.

408
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:42,219
- Been up to the Abbey?
- Mm.

409
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,343
Yes. Yes, it's um...

410
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,962
Things obviously very different now.
The nuns are different.

411
00:34:48,125 --> 00:34:50,753
Not the same ones they had when
the Magdalen girls were there.

412
00:34:50,917 --> 00:34:53,511
Sure. They're all gone now!

413
00:34:53,667 --> 00:34:57,717
We've had a few staying here, looking to find
what happened to their sons or daughters.

414
00:34:57,875 --> 00:34:59,627
Not many of them get
any joy from there.

415
00:34:59,792 --> 00:35:03,126
And the big fire that destroyed everything.
Do you know how that started?

416
00:35:03,292 --> 00:35:06,262
- I should think they put a match to it.
- Who?

417
00:35:06,417 --> 00:35:09,626
The Sisters. Sure they had a great
fire on the field out the back.

418
00:35:09,792 --> 00:35:11,886
What, so the Abbey wasn't on fire?

419
00:35:12,042 --> 00:35:15,751
They had a bloody big bonfire. Burnt
all the records. Thousands of 'em.

420
00:35:15,917 --> 00:35:18,136
- Why? I mean...
- This is years ago.

421
00:35:18,292 --> 00:35:21,296
I suppose they were embarrassed
about selling babies to America.

422
00:35:21,458 --> 00:35:23,460
And they don't want
people telling tales.

423
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:27,209
- That's me mother.
- You say they sold babies to Americans?

424
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:30,254
A lot of the Yanks came over
to Ireland to look for babies.

425
00:35:30,417 --> 00:35:32,511
They were the only ones
who could afford them.

426
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:34,419
£1,000.

427
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:38,258
Jane Russell bought a baby from
Derry in 1952... the film star.

428
00:35:38,417 --> 00:35:41,876
- I can't believe they sold babies.
- She came in here looking for Bourbon,

429
00:35:42,042 --> 00:35:44,886
but they had to give her
a glass of Paddy instead.

430
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:47,921
If you were a Catholic with
£1,000, you could buy a baby.

431
00:35:48,083 --> 00:35:51,166
Jane Russell bought one
to take home with her.

432
00:35:51,333 --> 00:35:53,051
But I'm not one to repeat gossip.

433
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:55,210
No, no, I can see that.

434
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:58,254
- Slainte.
- Yes, cheers.

435
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:18,426
<i>Sally, you told me to call you if I came up
with something and this fell into my lap.</i>

436
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:21,336
- Go on.
- It's quite interesting, actually.

437
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:25,550
I think there are themes about people
searching for their family trees

438
00:36:25,708 --> 00:36:28,712
and the whole Irish Diaspora...

439
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:31,048
Don't use words like
diaspora, Martin.

440
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:33,506
I can't spell it and people
don't know what it means.

441
00:36:33,667 --> 00:36:35,465
<i>The exodus that followed
the Irish famine.</i>

442
00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:39,209
No, no, no. I'm genuinely not
interested in what it means.

443
00:36:39,375 --> 00:36:40,376
OK.

444
00:36:40,542 --> 00:36:42,670
Who are the goodies?
Who are the baddies?

445
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:45,962
Well, it's about a
little old Irish lady,

446
00:36:46,125 --> 00:36:50,926
a retired nurse, who is searching for
her long lost son who was taken -

447
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:55,384
snatched from her at
birth - by... evil nuns.

448
00:36:56,625 --> 00:37:00,334
So how does it end? And it's got
to be really happy or really sad.

449
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,879
Either he's chairman of IBM
or a hobo, it doesn't matter.

450
00:37:04,042 --> 00:37:08,050
The years melted away as
a 50-year silence was

451
00:37:08,076 --> 00:37:11,656
broken by two simple
words, "Hello, Mum."

452
00:37:11,792 --> 00:37:13,044
I could write it now.

453
00:37:15,292 --> 00:37:17,511
I didn't know you were so cynical.

454
00:37:17,667 --> 00:37:20,591
My guess is that Anthony was
adopted and sent to America.

455
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:24,300
The Abbey dealt almost exclusively
with American customers.

456
00:37:24,458 --> 00:37:28,088
- I can't believe they sold babies.
- They were trying to give him a better life.

457
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,753
- They tried to make money out of him!
- There's a problem.

458
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:34,922
I got through to the Sacred Heart
Adoption Society in Cork this morning.

459
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:37,802
They referred me to the
Irish Adoption Board,

460
00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:40,461
who referred me back to the
Sacred Heart Adoption Society.

461
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,468
- Around in circles!
- They won't help us.

462
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:45,629
But I spoke to some contacts from
my Washington days last night,

463
00:37:45,792 --> 00:37:48,341
and there are avenues we
can pursue in America.

464
00:37:49,125 --> 00:37:53,380
The stumbling block is I can only get so
far speaking on your behalf, Philomena.

465
00:37:53,542 --> 00:37:58,423
But as his mother, they would be legally
bound to provide you with the information.

466
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:01,052
Are you suggesting you take my
mother to America with you?

467
00:38:01,208 --> 00:38:05,133
If you want. My editor's
agreed to foot the bill.

468
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:08,466
How would you feel about
going to America with Martin?

469
00:38:09,167 --> 00:38:11,044
Uh... I... I don't know.

470
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:12,835
I could come with you if you like.

471
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,128
No, no, no, you have your work.

472
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:19,126
I'm worried that Martin will have to go all
that way with a daft old woman like me.

473
00:38:19,292 --> 00:38:21,420
- I don't think you're daft.
- Go away, would you?

474
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:23,677
Or old.

475
00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:29,295
I think I would like to go.

476
00:38:31,417 --> 00:38:34,216
I'd like to know if Anthony
ever thought of me...

477
00:38:36,667 --> 00:38:38,886
...cos I've thought
of him every day.

478
00:38:47,208 --> 00:38:48,960
Ooh, Washington. Lovely.

479
00:38:49,917 --> 00:38:53,501
- Did you pack your baggage yourself?
- Yes. My daughter helped me.

480
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:57,587
I'm getting the royal treatment,
Martin. I feel like the Pope.

481
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,752
Well, it'll save your hip.

482
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:04,344
Is that an interesting book?
I've just finished mine.

483
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:08,505
Uh.. Yeah, no, mine's rather dull.
It's about the October Revolution.

484
00:39:08,667 --> 00:39:11,876
- Political horse-trading...
- Oh, mine's about horses.

485
00:39:12,042 --> 00:39:15,251
It's about this fellow, Robert,
and he's engaged to this duchess.

486
00:39:15,417 --> 00:39:18,591
And he's only the son of a doctor,
so he's done very well for himself.

487
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:21,549
But this woman,
this duchess, she's terrible.

488
00:39:21,708 --> 00:39:25,008
She's as vain as you like, and she's
always looking at herself in the mirror

489
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:26,419
and all that sort of thing.

490
00:39:26,583 --> 00:39:29,086
Anyway, she thinks he's
as dull as ditch-water

491
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:33,005
so he takes up an interest in the horses
so he can get in with the upper classes.

492
00:39:33,167 --> 00:39:35,886
And, of course, he meets this
girl down at the stables.

493
00:39:36,042 --> 00:39:38,170
And she's not even a
doctor's daughter.

494
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:41,633
Her father's a farmhand and
he only has the one foot.

495
00:39:41,792 --> 00:39:44,170
- Oh, dear.
- But of course they fall in love.

496
00:39:44,333 --> 00:39:46,427
And now he's torn between
becoming a duke -

497
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:50,213
if he marries the duchess, he'll become
lord of the manor and all that...

498
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:52,377
- OK.
- ..and the stable girl who he loves,

499
00:39:52,542 --> 00:39:54,340
but she hasn't a penny to her name.

500
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,128
Well, the big day's coming,
the wedding, and this girl...

501
00:39:57,292 --> 00:40:02,253
This girl, she's lovely. She
says Robert has to do his duty.

502
00:40:02,417 --> 00:40:05,796
He's already spoken for.
And he's being measured for a suit.

503
00:40:05,958 --> 00:40:09,337
You can tell his heart's not in it cos
all the while he's thinking about

504
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,218
the horses and the stable girl.

505
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:14,709
So they're all waiting for him
at the church, all the hoi polloi,

506
00:40:14,875 --> 00:40:16,876
but the thing is,
Martin, this duchess,

507
00:40:16,902 --> 00:40:19,952
she only wants Robert to spite
the fella she's really after.

508
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:24,543
And then towards the end she finds out that
the stable girl has designs on Robert.

509
00:40:24,708 --> 00:40:27,640
But before that, the father
with the one foot dies

510
00:40:27,666 --> 00:40:30,194
and he says to Robert,
"Follow your heart."

511
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:33,792
The duchess gives the stable girl her
marching orders and she packs her things.

512
00:40:33,958 --> 00:40:37,132
There's a pony and trap waiting
outside and she gets in, she says,

513
00:40:37,292 --> 00:40:38,669
"Do you know where we're going?"

514
00:40:38,833 --> 00:40:41,757
And the driver turns round,
and if it isn't your man Robert!

515
00:40:41,917 --> 00:40:45,251
And he says, "I'm taking you to a place
where no one can hurt you any more."

516
00:40:45,417 --> 00:40:48,421
Well, I didn't see that coming,
Martin, not in a million years.

517
00:40:48,583 --> 00:40:50,210
It's nice when there's a surprise.

518
00:40:50,375 --> 00:40:52,798
- Sounds like a real page-turner.
- You can borrow it.

519
00:40:52,958 --> 00:40:54,960
- That's OK.
- No, no. I've just finished it now.

520
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:58,004
Well, I feel like
I've almost read it.

521
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:02,048
The Slipper And The Horse Shoe.

522
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,843
Oh, there's a series of them.

523
00:41:10,833 --> 00:41:12,255
Champagne or Buck's Fizz?

524
00:41:12,417 --> 00:41:14,886
- No, thank you.
- Oh. No, thank you.

525
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:21,711
- It's free.
- Oh. I say! I'll have a Buck's Fizz.

526
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,300
Thank you. This is lovely, Martin.

527
00:41:30,917 --> 00:41:32,919
You have to pay for
everything on Ryanair.

528
00:41:33,083 --> 00:41:35,802
- Well, they don't have club class.
- Slainte.

529
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:39,751
Martin!

530
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:42,136
- Alex, how are you?
- Not seen you since you...

531
00:41:42,292 --> 00:41:45,091
left the department. I was
gonna call you, actually.

532
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,923
- Still friends?
- Absolutely.

533
00:41:47,083 --> 00:41:49,006
I hope you didn't think
I dropped you in it.

534
00:41:49,167 --> 00:41:50,840
Don't worry about it.
The fog of war.

535
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,673
Yeah, collateral damage.

536
00:41:53,792 --> 00:41:55,715
So, what are you up to?
Off to the primaries?

537
00:41:55,875 --> 00:41:57,593
- Yes, yes.
- No. He's helping me look...

538
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:01,755
I'm just... We're just here... It's
a human interest story. Journalism.

539
00:42:02,792 --> 00:42:05,261
Well, good luck with it.
Listen, I better scoot back.

540
00:42:05,417 --> 00:42:07,260
OK.

541
00:42:07,417 --> 00:42:10,261
I'm sorry, Martin. Should we
pretend we don't know each other?

542
00:42:10,417 --> 00:42:13,091
No. No, no, no, it's... It's just
someone I used to work with.

543
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,673
A spin doctor. I'm
trying to avoid them.

544
00:42:16,792 --> 00:42:20,342
- Is that first class in there?
- It's just a perk of the job.

545
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:25,713
Just cos you're in first class, it
doesn't make you a first-class person.

546
00:42:26,625 --> 00:42:28,719
He's all right.

547
00:42:30,583 --> 00:42:33,632
I think he needs a
good swipe of shite.

548
00:42:36,708 --> 00:42:38,585
Yes, you're probably right.

549
00:43:16,958 --> 00:43:20,462
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to Washington Dulles Airport.</i>

550
00:43:39,042 --> 00:43:41,511
<i>Martin, did you have a little
chocolate on your pillow?</i>

551
00:43:41,667 --> 00:43:43,419
Yes, I did, yes.

552
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:45,301
- How the other half lives, eh?
- Yes.

553
00:43:45,458 --> 00:43:48,792
- Would you look at the view!
- Wow. Yeah.

554
00:43:48,958 --> 00:43:51,052
Mine's of an air conditioning duct.

555
00:43:54,042 --> 00:43:57,216
Ah. It's Caroline from the records
office. Better get this. Hello.

556
00:43:57,375 --> 00:43:59,343
Well, that's conjecture,
guess work.

557
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,879
Good guess work. Send over the
long list, then I can sort of...

558
00:44:03,042 --> 00:44:06,342
<i>Martin Lawrence is going undercover.</i>

559
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,719
Great. Fabulous.
I'll talk to you in the morning.

560
00:44:08,875 --> 00:44:10,718
OK. Bye-bye.

561
00:44:14,917 --> 00:44:16,794
Shall we go for a walk,
get rid of the jet lag?

562
00:44:16,958 --> 00:44:19,131
You said you wanted to visit
the Lincoln Memorial?

563
00:44:19,292 --> 00:44:20,919
We could go and see Mr Lincoln.

564
00:44:21,083 --> 00:44:25,634
Or we could watch, on television,
Big Momma's House.

565
00:44:25,792 --> 00:44:29,001
It's about a little black man
pretending to be a fat black lady.

566
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:31,761
They've just showed some
of it on the television.

567
00:44:31,917 --> 00:44:34,716
And they're all chasing after him.

568
00:44:34,875 --> 00:44:37,128
It looked hilarious, Martin.

569
00:44:40,833 --> 00:44:42,927
Isn't he wonderful?

570
00:44:43,292 --> 00:44:45,841
I've always wanted to see
him in his big chair.

571
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,753
Well, he was a big man.

572
00:44:50,083 --> 00:44:53,383
Literally - six foot four.
Tallest American President.

573
00:44:53,542 --> 00:44:56,751
Well, you can see that.
He's tall even sitting down.

574
00:44:57,625 --> 00:45:01,755
I had a friend whose daughter paid for her
to go to Florida for her 70th birthday.

575
00:45:01,917 --> 00:45:05,751
She said to me, "Phil, the size of
the portions, you wouldn't believe."

576
00:45:05,917 --> 00:45:08,591
If you just go... Let's just
take a quick picture, see.

577
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,002
You go stand by the line.

578
00:45:10,167 --> 00:45:12,420
- Is this for the article?
- It is. Just go back further.

579
00:45:12,583 --> 00:45:14,836
Only I'm a little bit worried,
because if we find him,

580
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,879
he might be very disapproving
of talking to the papers.

581
00:45:18,042 --> 00:45:19,294
Families are private things.

582
00:45:19,458 --> 00:45:22,177
I know. Go and stand back there.
That's true, they are private,

583
00:45:22,333 --> 00:45:24,938
but tracking him down's an
expensive business, and

584
00:45:24,964 --> 00:45:27,364
so it's sort of like a
quid pro quo, isn't it?

585
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:31,255
- What does that mean?
- Well, it literally means this for that.

586
00:45:31,417 --> 00:45:34,876
Don't worry. I won't write anything you're
unhappy with. I want to tell the truth.

587
00:45:35,042 --> 00:45:37,511
Yes. That's the thing
I'm worried about.

588
00:45:37,667 --> 00:45:39,920
Should I smile or
should I be serious?

589
00:45:40,083 --> 00:45:44,213
Erm... Let's do one happy,
one not so happy.

590
00:45:50,292 --> 00:45:53,876
I'm getting scared, now
we're getting closer.

591
00:45:54,458 --> 00:45:58,258
All these years, wondering whether
Anthony was in trouble or in... prison,

592
00:45:58,417 --> 00:46:00,044
or goodness knows where.

593
00:46:00,542 --> 00:46:03,921
As long as I didn't know, I could always
tell myself he was happy somewhere

594
00:46:04,083 --> 00:46:06,427
and that he was doing all right.

595
00:46:06,583 --> 00:46:08,756
But what if he died in Vietnam?

596
00:46:08,917 --> 00:46:11,636
Or came back with no legs,
or lived on the street...

597
00:46:14,917 --> 00:46:17,261
Don't upset yourself. Hm?

598
00:46:17,417 --> 00:46:20,671
We don't know what we don't know. We'll
deal with that when we get to it.

599
00:46:20,833 --> 00:46:22,927
Well, what if he was a
drug addict, Martin?

600
00:46:24,458 --> 00:46:26,210
Or what if he was obese?

601
00:46:28,167 --> 00:46:29,544
Obese?

602
00:46:29,708 --> 00:46:33,167
I watched this documentary that
says a lot of Americans are huge.

603
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:36,052
What if that's happened to him?

604
00:46:36,792 --> 00:46:38,512
What on earth makes you
think he'd be obese?

605
00:46:38,583 --> 00:46:41,336
Because of the size
of the portions.

606
00:46:48,958 --> 00:46:50,835
Hello?

607
00:46:51,583 --> 00:46:53,631
No, I've got a bathrobe, Philomena.

608
00:46:55,167 --> 00:47:00,378
Yes, there are two in every
room. And slippers.

609
00:47:01,542 --> 00:47:04,671
OK, you've just got a bit of jet lag.
Just try and get your head down.

610
00:47:05,958 --> 00:47:07,960
All right, night-night.

611
00:47:08,708 --> 00:47:10,551
- How is everyone?
<i>- Yeah. We're good.</i>

612
00:47:10,708 --> 00:47:13,211
<i>Danny won his rugby match
today, nearly scored a try.</i>

613
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:15,218
- That's fantastic.
<i>- How's Philomena?</i>

614
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:20,427
Well, I've finally seen, first hand, what
a lifetime's diet of the Reader's Digest,

615
00:47:20,583 --> 00:47:24,258
the Daily Mail and romantic fiction
can do to a person's brain.

616
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,128
She keeps telling the hotel
staff how kind they are.

617
00:47:28,292 --> 00:47:30,169
She must think they're volunteers.

618
00:47:30,333 --> 00:47:32,961
She told four people today
they were one in a million.

619
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,093
What are the chances of that?

620
00:47:35,333 --> 00:47:38,212
<i>Come on, she's just
a little old Irish lady.</i>

621
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,252
Hi. ls everything all right?

622
00:48:00,417 --> 00:48:05,253
Martin, I just wanted to tell you
something earlier but it slipped my mind.

623
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:09,800
And then I thought I'd tell you on
the phone but I forgot the number.

624
00:48:09,958 --> 00:48:11,301
OK.

625
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,130
Well, what I want to say, Martin, is thank
you for helping me look for my son.

626
00:48:16,292 --> 00:48:17,384
Oh...

627
00:48:17,542 --> 00:48:19,636
I know you got the
sack from your job...

628
00:48:19,792 --> 00:48:22,295
I mean, not the News At Ten
one, but that other one.

629
00:48:23,042 --> 00:48:25,136
Well, their loss is my gain.

630
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,127
Thank you.

631
00:48:29,292 --> 00:48:32,262
- Well, good night, Martin.
- Good night, Philomena.

632
00:49:18,208 --> 00:49:21,382
<i>Hello, Caroline,
it's Martin Sixsmith.</i>

633
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:26,047
I just wanted to check... Yeah, the
file with the immigration cuttings?

634
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,798
I know you checked it.
Could you send that through?

635
00:49:29,958 --> 00:49:32,461
We don't really have
Mexicans in England.

636
00:49:32,625 --> 00:49:35,879
We have Indians instead,
and everyone loves curry.

637
00:49:37,292 --> 00:49:41,923
Martin. Martin. They've
got omelettes over there.

638
00:49:42,083 --> 00:49:44,711
<i>- Thank you.
- Pancakes, and waffles, any filling.</i>

639
00:49:44,875 --> 00:49:46,593
- Cereal, bacon and sausage.
- I know.

640
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:48,150
- Anything you want.
- I saw. I saw.

641
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:50,127
- Breakfast is included, isn't it?
- It is.

642
00:49:50,292 --> 00:49:53,136
It's just it's too early for me.
My stomach hasn't woken up yet.

643
00:49:53,292 --> 00:49:57,092
Mine wakes up before I do. I'm having
a ham and Swiss cheese omelette.

644
00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:00,003
- Will I get you one?
- No, I... I'm not hungry.

645
00:50:00,167 --> 00:50:01,840
- What about blueberries?
- Coffee?

646
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,092
No, thank you.

647
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:06,800
If you want to help yourself to breakfast,
we have two buffets, hot and cold.

648
00:50:06,958 --> 00:50:09,086
- I know. She's just told me.
- Fresh fruit, cereal,

649
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:10,968
omelettes with your
choice of filling.

650
00:50:11,125 --> 00:50:13,378
- I know what's on display.
- We also have pancakes.

651
00:50:13,542 --> 00:50:15,965
Thank you. Trying to have
a private conversation.

652
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:18,051
My apologies, sir.

653
00:50:21,125 --> 00:50:24,095
There's no need to be rude.
She's a very nice person.

654
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:27,379
I know. I'm sure she's one in a
million, or one in a hundred thousand.

655
00:50:27,792 --> 00:50:30,215
- What do you mean?
- You've said it to about ten people,

656
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:32,127
so that's just maths.

657
00:50:32,292 --> 00:50:34,135
You should be nice to the
people on the way up

658
00:50:34,292 --> 00:50:36,215
cos you might meet them
again on the way down.

659
00:50:36,375 --> 00:50:39,424
Now, you of all people
should understand that.

660
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:43,177
I'd rather you were rude to me than
the nice people who work here.

661
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:45,927
Well, I'm sorry. I'm just trying
to help you find your son.

662
00:50:46,083 --> 00:50:48,256
That's why we're here. So...

663
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,094
Can I have some quiet time?

664
00:51:01,542 --> 00:51:04,466
- Were you born in Mexico?
- I'm from Chihuahua.

665
00:51:04,625 --> 00:51:08,584
You must like nachos. My granddaughter
Natalie got me into them.

666
00:51:09,583 --> 00:51:14,134
I've never been to Mexico, but I believe
it's lovely, apart from the kidnappings.

667
00:51:14,833 --> 00:51:15,959
Oh!

668
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:37,627
Oh. Er...

669
00:52:47,333 --> 00:52:49,381
- There you go.
- Thank you.

670
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:56,050
They've run out of blueberries so
I got you raspberries instead.

671
00:52:57,625 --> 00:52:59,673
I'm sorry. Is it a quiet time?

672
00:53:10,167 --> 00:53:12,261
That's my Anthony.

673
00:53:19,875 --> 00:53:21,548
He's dead, isn't he?

674
00:53:21,708 --> 00:53:23,802
Yes. I'm sorry.

675
00:53:29,542 --> 00:53:31,544
No.

676
00:53:33,083 --> 00:53:35,085
I'm sorry.

677
00:53:35,792 --> 00:53:37,794
I'm so sorry.

678
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:18,218
- He's dead.
<i>- Who's dead?</i>

679
00:54:18,375 --> 00:54:20,719
The son. He died eight years ago.

680
00:54:20,875 --> 00:54:24,049
Oh, dear. And what did he die of?

681
00:54:24,208 --> 00:54:25,801
I don't know. I didn't find out.

682
00:54:25,958 --> 00:54:28,052
- I'm at the airport.
- You're at the airport?

683
00:54:28,208 --> 00:54:31,007
Well, she just wants to get
back, be with her daughter.

684
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:34,296
<i>- What about the story?</i>
- Well, he's dead.

685
00:54:34,458 --> 00:54:36,756
Dead or alive, happy or sad.

686
00:54:36,917 --> 00:54:40,126
<i>They're both good.
Spin it. Find a story.</i>

687
00:54:40,292 --> 00:54:44,627
Look, if I stay here and she goes home,
no one's going to answer my questions.

688
00:54:44,792 --> 00:54:46,385
Then keep her there.

689
00:54:46,542 --> 00:54:47,839
What?

690
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,254
Come on, she's in bits. It's like
she's lost him all over again.

691
00:54:51,417 --> 00:54:53,294
That's great. Write that line down.

692
00:55:09,083 --> 00:55:11,552
- You signed a contract.
- You serious?

693
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:14,052
<i>Yes. Call me when
you've got something.</i>

694
00:55:25,208 --> 00:55:27,210
Sorry, that was my editor.

695
00:55:28,208 --> 00:55:31,462
I suppose you'll have to use
the not-so-happy-photo now?

696
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:35,381
Yes. I suppose so.

697
00:55:41,667 --> 00:55:44,341
I remember that day at the fair.

698
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:47,583
His father made me laugh by
pretending to be an old man.

699
00:55:48,583 --> 00:55:51,257
And I made him laugh by
pretending to be an old woman.

700
00:55:54,125 --> 00:55:56,127
And now I am one.

701
00:55:56,292 --> 00:55:59,967
I'll never know if Anthony
ever even thought about me.

702
00:56:00,958 --> 00:56:03,256
And I'll never be
able to say sorry.

703
00:56:10,083 --> 00:56:12,211
We start boarding in about an hour.

704
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,800
Tell me, Martin, do we have
what they call flexible tickets?

705
00:56:19,875 --> 00:56:20,922
Yes, I think so.

706
00:56:21,083 --> 00:56:23,757
Where you can change your flight
if you change your plans?

707
00:56:23,917 --> 00:56:25,260
Yes, but...

708
00:56:25,417 --> 00:56:27,920
Supposing we didn't get on
the aeroplane tonight?

709
00:56:30,083 --> 00:56:34,293
Because I've been sitting here waiting
for a sign, and I haven't had one.

710
00:56:34,458 --> 00:56:38,133
And so I've made the decision myself
and I'd like to stay a little longer.

711
00:56:39,667 --> 00:56:42,216
Well, if that's what
you want to do?

712
00:56:43,208 --> 00:56:45,302
It is.

713
00:56:46,375 --> 00:56:49,504
I'd like to talk to someone
who actually met him.

714
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,343
All right, then we'll stay.

715
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:02,761
I've been sent a picture of
Anthony, if you want to see it.

716
00:57:02,917 --> 00:57:04,590
Oh.

717
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:07,299
- Yes, please.
- With President Reagan.

718
00:57:10,208 --> 00:57:12,427
It's from a woman we
could meet tomorrow...

719
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:15,798
...called Marcia Weller.

720
00:57:16,167 --> 00:57:19,671
- She's an ex-colleague of Anthony's.
- He looks very smart.

721
00:57:20,458 --> 00:57:23,541
Now, would you like a drink?
Brandy, isn't it?

722
00:57:23,708 --> 00:57:25,585
They're all gone.

723
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:31,085
Martin. This man
looks just like you.

724
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:46,127
It is me.

725
00:57:47,833 --> 00:57:49,927
Michael Hess.

726
00:57:51,125 --> 00:57:52,468
- I met him.
- Where?

727
00:57:52,625 --> 00:57:54,218
- At the White House.
- Dear God!

728
00:57:54,375 --> 00:57:56,469
About ten years ago when
I was with the BBC.

729
00:57:56,625 --> 00:57:58,548
- What was he like?
- I can't remember.

730
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:02,087
- It was a Republican thing.
- You must remember something.

731
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:04,799
He was by the door when we went...
I shook hands with him.

732
00:58:04,958 --> 00:58:07,507
Well, what kind of a
handshake did he have?

733
00:58:07,917 --> 00:58:11,000
It was firm. I mean, I would remember
if he'd had a weak handshake.

734
00:58:11,167 --> 00:58:13,590
You don't get to that position
with a weak handshake.

735
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:15,548
So he had a firm
handshake, what else?

736
00:58:16,583 --> 00:58:19,086
- He was smart.
- I always kept him smart.

737
00:58:19,875 --> 00:58:21,969
And did you remember
anything he said?

738
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:25,301
- "Hello."
- "Hello. Hello."

739
00:58:25,458 --> 00:58:26,550
Might've been "hi".

740
00:58:26,708 --> 00:58:28,210
- "Hello."
- He was polite.

741
00:58:28,375 --> 00:58:32,380
Well... Now, well, he was smart,
and he had a firm handshake.

742
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:35,295
- He said hello, which was nice.
- He said hello. Hello.

743
00:58:35,917 --> 00:58:38,386
- He was polite.
- Oh, Martin!

744
00:58:45,167 --> 00:58:49,126
I...knew your son for
about ten years.

745
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,881
He was senior legal counsel to both
the Reagan and Bush administrations.

746
00:58:56,542 --> 00:58:59,045
He didn't do too badly,
did he, Philomena?

747
00:59:01,417 --> 00:59:04,261
He'd never have got a job like
that if he'd stayed with me.

748
00:59:06,083 --> 00:59:08,177
I think he'd have
worked at McEverleys.

749
00:59:08,958 --> 00:59:11,302
That's a firm of
solicitors in Castlebar.

750
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,253
Did he ever mention
Ireland, Marcia?

751
00:59:15,417 --> 00:59:17,385
I don't think so.

752
00:59:17,542 --> 00:59:19,795
Although I do have a number
for his sister, Mary,

753
00:59:19,958 --> 00:59:21,960
- who came over from Ireland with him.
- Great.

754
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:24,503
- I can put you in touch.
- Great, that's excellent.

755
00:59:24,667 --> 00:59:26,669
He looks very happy here.

756
00:59:28,833 --> 00:59:30,380
Who's this fella?

757
00:59:31,208 --> 00:59:33,802
That's his friend Pete.

758
00:59:37,458 --> 00:59:42,168
- And were you his girlfriend, Marcia?
- Oh...  No.

759
00:59:43,917 --> 00:59:46,420
I don't know if you knew,
but he was gay.

760
00:59:47,708 --> 00:59:51,087
I used to accompany him when
he'd go to official functions

761
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:54,675
because being gay was frowned
on in the Republican Party.

762
00:59:59,375 --> 01:00:02,174
But he was very charming
and charismatic.

763
01:00:03,542 --> 01:00:06,341
Tell me, did he
father any children?

764
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:09,629
Philomena, Marcia's just told
us that Anthony was gay.

765
01:00:09,792 --> 01:00:13,626
Well, I always knew that. But I just
wondered if he might be bi-curious.

766
01:00:13,792 --> 01:00:16,215
- Bi-curious?
- A lot of nurses I worked with were gay

767
01:00:16,375 --> 01:00:19,879
but one of them called Brendan
told me he was bi-curious.

768
01:00:20,042 --> 01:00:23,046
I don't think he could
make up his mind, Marcia.

769
01:00:23,208 --> 01:00:26,052
He didn't have any children.
I'm sorry.

770
01:00:29,458 --> 01:00:31,301
Did Pete love him?

771
01:00:31,458 --> 01:00:33,301
Yes, he did.

772
01:00:34,167 --> 01:00:37,341
Phil, how did you know he was gay?

773
01:00:37,625 --> 01:00:40,253
Well, he was a very
sensitive little boy.

774
01:00:40,417 --> 01:00:44,593
And as the years rolled on, I always
wondered whether he might be.

775
01:00:45,292 --> 01:00:49,877
When I saw the photograph of him in the
dungarees, there was no doubt in my mind.

776
01:01:13,375 --> 01:01:14,877
<i>Peter, what do you think?</i>

777
01:01:15,042 --> 01:01:18,012
<i>I think she's in a bad mood.
She's kind of got crabby today, huh?</i>

778
01:01:18,167 --> 01:01:19,259
<i>Unlike you.</i>

779
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:28,128
Why did you keep this a
secret for 50 years?

780
01:01:29,042 --> 01:01:33,001
What I'd done was a sin
and I kept it all hidden away.

781
01:01:33,792 --> 01:01:37,717
And then I thought to myself
that keeping it all hidden away

782
01:01:37,875 --> 01:01:40,594
was also a sin because
I was lying to everybody.

783
01:01:43,083 --> 01:01:46,007
And as it went on I tied
myself up in knots,

784
01:01:46,167 --> 01:01:51,003
worrying which was the worse sin of the
two, having the baby or the lying.

785
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:54,504
Well, in the end, I couldn't
make up my mind, Martin.

786
01:01:55,667 --> 01:01:59,422
I was going to ask you, Martin, if it'd
be possible not to use my real name

787
01:01:59,583 --> 01:02:01,176
when you write the story?

788
01:02:01,333 --> 01:02:05,167
Perhaps you could call me Nancy?
I've always loved that name, Nancy.

789
01:02:05,333 --> 01:02:07,210
I have a niece called Nancy.

790
01:02:07,375 --> 01:02:09,173
Oh, no, maybe they'd
think it's her.

791
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:13,133
- What about Anne? Anne Boleyn?
- Anne Boleyn?

792
01:02:13,292 --> 01:02:15,215
That's a lovely name.
Somebody had that...

793
01:02:15,375 --> 01:02:19,300
We'll have to use your real name, Philomena.
That's the way these things work.

794
01:02:31,042 --> 01:02:32,635
- Mary?
- Yes.

795
01:02:32,792 --> 01:02:37,093
Hello, it's Martin. This is Philomena
Lee. Anthony's mother.

796
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:39,344
Well, Michael's mother.

797
01:02:42,042 --> 01:02:43,919
OK.

798
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,547
That's our mother.

799
01:02:46,708 --> 01:02:48,802
I mean, our adoptive mother.

800
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,594
Was she a nice lady, Mary?
She looks a nice lady.

801
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:57,051
You know, I'm not gonna lie to you. We
didn't have the happiest childhood.

802
01:02:57,208 --> 01:03:01,418
Marge was OK, but our father, Doc,
he could be a very hard man.

803
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:06,844
Stop torturing her!

804
01:03:08,292 --> 01:03:10,795
And that's him with Pete Olsson.

805
01:03:12,375 --> 01:03:14,469
Mike and Pete were...

806
01:03:14,625 --> 01:03:18,584
That's all right, Mary. I know
Anthony was a gay homosexual.

807
01:03:19,375 --> 01:03:23,585
And we met Marcia, who I believe
was his beard. Is that right, Martin?

808
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:25,423
Yes, that's about right.

809
01:03:25,583 --> 01:03:30,384
It must have been terrible, having
to keep it a secret his whole life.

810
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:35,216
- I assume my son died from AIDS.
- Yes.

811
01:03:36,167 --> 01:03:40,422
He wasn't too happy the last couple of
years of his life working for Reagan.

812
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:42,176
He was pretty messed up about it.

813
01:03:42,333 --> 01:03:44,506
The Republicans withdrew
funding for AIDS research

814
01:03:44,667 --> 01:03:47,750
because they blamed the
epidemic on gay lifestyles.

815
01:03:47,917 --> 01:03:50,505
Right, because some of
them wouldn't wear condoms

816
01:03:50,531 --> 01:03:52,652
because they said it
spoilt the feeling.

817
01:03:56,208 --> 01:03:58,006
Where is he buried, Mary?

818
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:02,343
Dad wanted him buried in the family plot
in St Louis, but Pete wouldn't allow it.

819
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:04,719
There was a huge fight.

820
01:04:04,875 --> 01:04:08,300
I didn't go in the end.
I didn't want to get involved.

821
01:04:08,458 --> 01:04:11,962
- You can talk to Pete about it.
- Yes, we have Pete's number.

822
01:04:12,125 --> 01:04:15,049
I think we're going to pay him
a visit, aren't we, Philomena?

823
01:04:18,083 --> 01:04:20,085
Mm...

824
01:04:20,542 --> 01:04:24,376
Can I just ask you one thing, Mary?
There's something I need to know.

825
01:04:24,542 --> 01:04:28,422
Did Anthony ever mention Ireland,
or where he'd come from?

826
01:04:32,125 --> 01:04:35,550
Not really, no. We didn't
really talk about that.

827
01:04:37,083 --> 01:04:39,177
No. Why would you?

828
01:04:43,583 --> 01:04:46,917
- Do you want some sugar, or some milk?
- If you wouldn't mind.

829
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:49,177
Thank you very much
for your hospitality.

830
01:05:07,917 --> 01:05:11,876
It seems odd that she was in the same
room as someone who knew her mother,

831
01:05:12,042 --> 01:05:14,090
and yet she asked you
no questions about her.

832
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:16,627
I don't think it's odd.

833
01:05:16,792 --> 01:05:20,046
She'd just be asking questions
about someone she didn't know.

834
01:05:24,292 --> 01:05:27,262
I'd like to go to confession.
We passed a church on the way here.

835
01:05:27,792 --> 01:05:30,341
Why do you want to
go to confession?

836
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:32,127
To confess my sins, of course.

837
01:05:32,292 --> 01:05:34,636
What sins?

838
01:05:34,792 --> 01:05:37,671
The Catholic Church should
go to confession, not you.

839
01:05:37,833 --> 01:05:39,506
"Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

840
01:05:39,667 --> 01:05:42,216
I incarcerated a load of young
women against their will,

841
01:05:42,375 --> 01:05:45,504
used them as slave labour, then sold
their babies to the highest bidder."

842
01:05:45,667 --> 01:05:47,089
I hope God isn't listening to you.

843
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:50,129
Well, I don't believe in God.
So, look, no thunderbolt.

844
01:05:50,292 --> 01:05:51,669
What are you trying to prove?

845
01:05:51,833 --> 01:05:55,292
Nothing, just that you don't need religion
to lead a happy and balanced life.

846
01:05:55,458 --> 01:05:57,301
And you're happy and
balanced, are you?

847
01:05:57,458 --> 01:05:59,927
I'm a journalist, Philomena.
We ask questions.

848
01:06:00,083 --> 01:06:03,053
We don't believe something just
because we're told it's the truth.

849
01:06:03,208 --> 01:06:06,883
Yet what does the Bible say? "Happy are
those who do not see yet believe."

850
01:06:07,042 --> 01:06:08,885
Hooray for blind
faith and ignorance.

851
01:06:09,042 --> 01:06:12,876
And what do you believe in? Picking holes
in everyone else and being a smart aleck?

852
01:06:13,625 --> 01:06:15,298
Taking photos whenever you like?

853
01:06:17,958 --> 01:06:21,041
I read a very funny headline in a
satirical newspaper the other day,

854
01:06:21,208 --> 01:06:22,551
about the earthquake in Turkey.

855
01:06:22,708 --> 01:06:25,257
It said, "God outdoes
terrorists yet again."

856
01:06:25,417 --> 01:06:27,294
Why God feels the need
to suddenly wipe out

857
01:06:27,458 --> 01:06:29,756
hundreds of thousands of
innocent people escapes me.

858
01:06:29,917 --> 01:06:32,045
You should ask Him about
that while you're in there.

859
01:06:32,208 --> 01:06:34,131
He'll probably say He
moves in mysterious ways.

860
01:06:34,292 --> 01:06:37,341
No, I think He'd say you
we're a feckin' eejit.

861
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,173
Hello.

862
01:06:56,458 --> 01:06:57,835
Hello?

863
01:06:58,500 --> 01:06:59,968
<i>- Oh, hello.</i>
- Hi, Sally.

864
01:07:00,125 --> 01:07:01,468
<i>- What have you got?</i>
- Guess what.

865
01:07:01,625 --> 01:07:05,255
He was a big-shot lawyer for both the
Reagan and Bush administrations.

866
01:07:05,417 --> 01:07:07,215
<i>You're kidding. That's amazing!</i>

867
01:07:07,375 --> 01:07:11,585
And at the same time he was a
closet homosexual who died of AIDS.

868
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:15,333
<i>Oh... This is perfect for
the weekend section.</i>

869
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,377
And... I met him.

870
01:07:17,542 --> 01:07:18,964
- You knew him?
- Yeah.

871
01:07:19,125 --> 01:07:22,755
- So there's a personal angle?
<i>- Yeah, that's one of the angles.</i>

872
01:07:22,917 --> 01:07:26,296
But people need to know what happened
to him. There's a real injustice here.

873
01:07:26,458 --> 01:07:28,927
<i>What about the evil nuns?
What's happening with them?</i>

874
01:07:29,083 --> 01:07:32,633
Still there. They haven't gone away.
If anything, they're a bit more evil.

875
01:07:33,333 --> 01:07:34,676
<i>It's great, Martin.</i>

876
01:07:34,833 --> 01:07:36,676
I'll call you back in a bit.

877
01:07:37,625 --> 01:07:39,593
Speak up now, dear.
Don't be afraid.

878
01:08:02,667 --> 01:08:07,127
Have faith, my dear.
God will forgive you.

879
01:08:50,875 --> 01:08:54,880
Phil? Phil, you were right.
I was being a feckin' eejit.

880
01:08:55,042 --> 01:08:57,591
- And I'm sorry...
- I was doing some thinking in there.

881
01:08:57,750 --> 01:09:01,084
I'm going to get a loan from the
Bradford and Bigley, Martin.

882
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:03,218
- Bingley.
- Because I don't have a mortgage.

883
01:09:03,375 --> 01:09:05,878
And you can get an
extension for £10,000.

884
01:09:06,042 --> 01:09:09,592
My friend Rene did that.
She had a conservatory built.

885
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:11,627
Well, I don't need a conservatory.

886
01:09:11,792 --> 01:09:14,215
So I can give you all
the money and then...

887
01:09:15,083 --> 01:09:18,917
And then that'll cover
the costs of the hotels

888
01:09:19,083 --> 01:09:21,927
and all the flights and everything
and you won't be out-of-pocket,

889
01:09:22,083 --> 01:09:24,677
and you won't publish the story
cos I don't want it published.

890
01:09:24,833 --> 01:09:26,801
I don't want anyone to
know about this, ever.

891
01:09:26,958 --> 01:09:31,589
Phil, you've done nothing wrong. You're
entitled to know who your son was.

892
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:33,673
Well, you heard what Mary said.

893
01:09:33,833 --> 01:09:35,676
She said he never gave
me a second thought.

894
01:09:35,833 --> 01:09:38,552
He wasn't my Anthony, he was
somebody else's Michael.

895
01:09:38,708 --> 01:09:41,587
- He probably hated the thought of me.
- You don't know that.

896
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:43,627
I should never have let
him out of my sight.

897
01:09:43,792 --> 01:09:46,545
We just need to talk
to Pete Olsson.

898
01:09:53,833 --> 01:09:55,631
<i>Can I help you?</i>

899
01:09:55,792 --> 01:09:58,341
Hello. I'm trying to set up a
meeting with Pete Olsson.

900
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:01,800
<i>- I believe you've called before, sir.</i>
- Yes. I've called a couple of times

901
01:10:01,958 --> 01:10:03,130
and no one's calling me back.

902
01:10:03,292 --> 01:10:05,420
I feel like I'm hitting my
head against a brick wall.

903
01:10:05,583 --> 01:10:08,382
<i>We have explained Mr Olsson is too
busy to deal with this matter.</i>

904
01:10:08,542 --> 01:10:10,636
- Yes, yes.
<i>- So, I am unable to put you through...</i>

905
01:10:10,792 --> 01:10:13,213
Right, but I think if you
give me his personal number,

906
01:10:13,239 --> 01:10:14,867
I think he'll be OK
with that, I do.

907
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,002
<i>- I can't give out personal numbers.</i>
- I know.

908
01:10:17,167 --> 01:10:21,001
But I don't understand why he won't
meet with Philomena for just an hour.

909
01:10:21,167 --> 01:10:23,044
<i>- Thank you. Goodbye.
- I mean, it's not a...</i>

910
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:43,878
Philomena? You all right?

911
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:56,670
I'm sorry, sir, there's no answer.

912
01:10:56,833 --> 01:11:00,212
Well, she wouldn't have gone
anywhere by herself.

913
01:11:01,208 --> 01:11:05,088
It's probably nothing, but
she's very old and Irish.

914
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:08,129
And she's a relative? I can't let
you in unless she's a relative.

915
01:11:08,292 --> 01:11:09,544
Yes, she's my mother.

916
01:11:10,583 --> 01:11:12,585
Concierge!

917
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:18,252
Phil? Mum?

918
01:11:23,583 --> 01:11:25,426
Hello?

919
01:11:26,708 --> 01:11:28,585
Mum?

920
01:11:31,333 --> 01:11:33,381
- There you are!
- What's the matter?

921
01:11:33,542 --> 01:11:35,965
- I wondered where you were.
- Is your mother OK now?

922
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:37,877
- Yes, thank you.
- OK, sir.

923
01:11:40,083 --> 01:11:42,131
I had to say that to
get him to let me in.

924
01:11:42,292 --> 01:11:46,718
You shouldn't have the balcony door shut
if you can't hear the door to your room.

925
01:11:46,875 --> 01:11:49,549
I was just having a
little cry, that's all.

926
01:11:49,708 --> 01:11:51,335
Right.

927
01:11:51,792 --> 01:11:53,294
Are you going to come back inside?

928
01:11:53,458 --> 01:11:55,538
You didn't think I was going
to jump off the balcony?

929
01:11:55,583 --> 01:11:57,460
No, of course not.

930
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:01,174
Did you get through to Pete Olsson?

931
01:12:01,333 --> 01:12:04,303
Just to his office.
He wasn't there.

932
01:12:06,875 --> 01:12:09,173
He doesn't want to see me, does he?

933
01:12:09,333 --> 01:12:11,586
Some people have a problem
dealing with the past.

934
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:15,334
Not you, though. But I'm
sure he'll come round.

935
01:12:21,792 --> 01:12:23,794
<i>Your chariot awaits.</i>

936
01:12:25,917 --> 01:12:27,919
<i>I got it in yellow.</i>

937
01:13:20,458 --> 01:13:23,712
Now, Martin, there's something
I want to say to you.

938
01:13:23,875 --> 01:13:26,128
Now I've made a decision
and my mind's made up.

939
01:13:26,292 --> 01:13:28,135
Nothing you can say is
going to change it.

940
01:13:28,292 --> 01:13:31,922
I appreciate everything you've done for
me, and thank you for looking after me.

941
01:13:32,083 --> 01:13:34,381
And I've loved the hotels,
the food and everything,

942
01:13:34,542 --> 01:13:37,216
but this isn't working out
the way I wanted it to.

943
01:13:37,375 --> 01:13:40,584
So, tomorrow I think we ought to get
on a plane and go back to England.

944
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:42,878
There it is. Now
that's an end to it.

945
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:46,709
Don't try and change my mind by saying
clever things about this and that

946
01:13:46,875 --> 01:13:49,378
just cos you went to
Oxbridge and I didn't.

947
01:13:52,458 --> 01:13:54,460
I went to Oxford. Oxford.

948
01:13:54,625 --> 01:13:57,003
Oxbridge is a portmanteau
of Oxford and Cambridge,

949
01:13:57,167 --> 01:14:00,922
- where two words are joined together.
- I don't give a... shiny shoe about that.

950
01:14:01,083 --> 01:14:03,836
- It's all the same to me!
- We should go and visit Pete Olsson.

951
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,469
You can go on your own!
I'm not prepared to go all that way

952
01:14:06,625 --> 01:14:09,925
to hear someone else tell me
I didn't give two hoots about Anthony

953
01:14:10,083 --> 01:14:12,677
and that I abandoned my child
and all the rest of it.

954
01:14:12,833 --> 01:14:13,959
What's that?

955
01:14:14,125 --> 01:14:16,127
- What?
- On the side of the glass there.

956
01:14:16,292 --> 01:14:18,169
- What? What's...
- There. This.

957
01:14:19,833 --> 01:14:21,801
It's a Celtic harp.

958
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:24,131
So we should go home.
I'll mind my own business.

959
01:14:24,292 --> 01:14:28,217
I want to watch David Attenborough on
television and I'll be happy with that.

960
01:14:29,167 --> 01:14:31,135
And what's that?

961
01:14:32,833 --> 01:14:34,756
That's a Celtic harp.

962
01:14:34,917 --> 01:14:39,343
Why would someone who cared so little about
where he came from wear something so Irish?

963
01:14:41,125 --> 01:14:45,130
Well, perhaps he played
the harp. He was gay.

964
01:14:46,125 --> 01:14:48,219
He didn't play the harp.

965
01:15:47,875 --> 01:15:49,673
Well, there it is.

966
01:15:55,333 --> 01:15:58,542
I could never have given
him a life like this.

967
01:15:59,333 --> 01:16:02,542
Oh, look, Martin,
a little red Mazda.

968
01:16:11,042 --> 01:16:12,669
Bye.

969
01:16:13,167 --> 01:16:15,010
That's him.

970
01:16:15,167 --> 01:16:16,885
That's Pete Olsson.

971
01:16:17,042 --> 01:16:18,760
See you.

972
01:16:22,917 --> 01:16:25,295
What do we do now?

973
01:16:25,458 --> 01:16:28,007
- We doorstep him.
- What's that?

974
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:32,050
It's what nasty journalists do
when they want to speak to someone

975
01:16:32,208 --> 01:16:34,302
who doesn't want to speak to them.

976
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,219
This shouldn't take long.

977
01:17:04,583 --> 01:17:06,460
M...

978
01:17:19,708 --> 01:17:21,676
- Peter Olsson.
- Yes?

979
01:17:22,417 --> 01:17:24,966
I'm Martin Sixsmith. I'm
here with Philomena Lee,

980
01:17:25,125 --> 01:17:27,548
the mother of your late
partner Michael Hess.

981
01:17:30,792 --> 01:17:32,009
Wait.

982
01:17:33,583 --> 01:17:35,381
Can I just ask you one question?

983
01:17:35,958 --> 01:17:38,381
Can you get your
foot out of my door?

984
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:44,801
Come on.

985
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:48,923
Hello. Hello?

986
01:17:49,542 --> 01:17:51,795
Sir, you can leave or
I'm calling the police.

987
01:18:16,917 --> 01:18:19,295
I'm sorry, I haven't
been very helpful.

988
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:24,709
Never mind. At least you tried.

989
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:36,219
What are you doing?

990
01:18:36,375 --> 01:18:37,843
Wait here.

991
01:18:56,875 --> 01:18:59,799
Yeah, get off my property or I'm...

992
01:19:01,833 --> 01:19:04,177
I just want to talk
to you about my son.

993
01:19:05,167 --> 01:19:08,842
He was taken from me. And I've
been looking for him ever since.

994
01:20:29,917 --> 01:20:31,760
<i>Whoa...</i>

995
01:21:03,833 --> 01:21:05,835
Would you look at him, Martin.

996
01:21:10,292 --> 01:21:12,386
- Wait.
- What?

997
01:21:14,583 --> 01:21:15,880
What? What's wrong?

998
01:21:16,042 --> 01:21:18,716
You went to Ireland?
You went to Roscrea?

999
01:21:19,667 --> 01:21:21,761
Yeah. Yeah, I took him.

1000
01:21:22,792 --> 01:21:25,466
He was looking for you, Philomena.

1001
01:21:27,542 --> 01:21:30,625
- That nun, I saw her at Roscrea.
- Sister Hildegarde.

1002
01:21:30,792 --> 01:21:33,011
She's older now but that
was definitely her.

1003
01:21:33,292 --> 01:21:37,172
They always told me they
didn't know where Anthony was.

1004
01:21:38,417 --> 01:21:41,796
But... they... they told us
that they couldn't find you.

1005
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:48,880
They said that you had er...
abandoned him as a baby.

1006
01:21:49,042 --> 01:21:52,125
She's been looking for him! She's spent
her whole life trying to find him.

1007
01:21:52,292 --> 01:21:55,341
I did not abandon my child.

1008
01:21:59,667 --> 01:22:01,840
He's er... He's there now.

1009
01:22:03,917 --> 01:22:08,252
- What do you mean?
- I had this huge standoff with his... father.

1010
01:22:08,417 --> 01:22:13,548
He wanted him buried in the US,
but it was your son's dying wish.

1011
01:22:15,208 --> 01:22:17,302
He said he wanted to go home.

1012
01:22:19,958 --> 01:22:21,710
He's buried at Roscrea.

1013
01:23:19,042 --> 01:23:21,044
We've come full circle.

1014
01:23:22,042 --> 01:23:23,885
Yes.

1015
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:27,754
The end of all our exploring will
be to arrive where we started

1016
01:23:27,917 --> 01:23:29,760
and know the place
for the first time.

1017
01:23:29,917 --> 01:23:33,626
That's lovely, Martin.
Did you just think of that?

1018
01:23:34,292 --> 01:23:35,714
No, it's TS Eliot.

1019
01:23:36,625 --> 01:23:39,128
Well, never mind.
It's still very nice.

1020
01:23:42,083 --> 01:23:43,756
Shall we go in?

1021
01:23:43,917 --> 01:23:46,670
You're not going to make a
scene in there, are you?

1022
01:23:48,167 --> 01:23:49,794
I just want to ask a few questions.

1023
01:23:50,917 --> 01:23:53,670
I don't want any tea, and
I don't want any cake.

1024
01:24:11,958 --> 01:24:14,302
- Do come in, Philomena.
- Thank you.

1025
01:24:21,417 --> 01:24:25,001
Sister Claire's asked if you
can wait in here for her.

1026
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:36,379
Now remember, Martin.
It's not their fault.

1027
01:24:36,542 --> 01:24:38,761
They didn't know Anthony
had a different name.

1028
01:24:50,958 --> 01:24:52,710
One of them did.

1029
01:24:52,875 --> 01:24:54,877
Martin!

1030
01:25:13,458 --> 01:25:15,506
Goodbye, Sister. See you
at Mass, bright and early.

1031
01:25:15,667 --> 01:25:18,511
Excuse me. What are you doing?
You're not allowed in here.

1032
01:25:18,667 --> 01:25:22,422
- He just walked straight in.
- This is completely inappropriate behaviour!

1033
01:25:24,208 --> 01:25:26,506
Sister Hildegarde, it's OK,
I'm not going to hurt you.

1034
01:25:26,667 --> 01:25:29,591
I just want to ask you a question.
I'm a friend of Philomena Lee.

1035
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:31,844
I saw you on a video with her son.

1036
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,549
Now, when you knew they
were looking for each other,

1037
01:25:34,708 --> 01:25:36,802
why did you keep them apart?

1038
01:25:36,958 --> 01:25:38,926
We'll call the guards
unless you leave now.

1039
01:25:39,083 --> 01:25:40,835
I'm not leaving until
she answers me.

1040
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,630
I'm sorry, I think your whole
manner is absolutely disgusting.

1041
01:25:44,792 --> 01:25:47,636
I'll tell you what's disgusting,
is lying to a dying man.

1042
01:25:47,792 --> 01:25:51,217
You could have given him a few moments
with his mother before he passed away

1043
01:25:51,375 --> 01:25:52,501
but you chose not to.

1044
01:25:52,667 --> 01:25:54,294
- That's disgusting.
- Come on, Sister.

1045
01:25:54,458 --> 01:25:56,210
You don't have to listen to this.

1046
01:25:56,375 --> 01:25:58,753
- Not very Christian, is it?
- Wait!

1047
01:26:04,458 --> 01:26:06,552
Let me tell you something.

1048
01:26:07,542 --> 01:26:12,594
I have kept my vow of
chastity my whole life.

1049
01:26:14,125 --> 01:26:19,382
Self-denial and mortification of the flesh...
that's what brings us closer to God.

1050
01:26:19,542 --> 01:26:20,634
Sister Hildegarde...

1051
01:26:20,792 --> 01:26:24,296
Those girls have nobody
to blame but themselves,

1052
01:26:24,322 --> 01:26:26,824
and their own carnal incontinence.

1053
01:26:26,958 --> 01:26:28,926
Sister Hildegarde, please!

1054
01:26:29,083 --> 01:26:30,460
You mean they had sex?

1055
01:26:31,125 --> 01:26:35,210
What's done is done. What do you
expect us to do about it now?

1056
01:26:35,375 --> 01:26:37,048
Nothing.

1057
01:26:38,292 --> 01:26:40,636
There's nothing to be done or said.

1058
01:26:42,208 --> 01:26:45,212
I've found my son.
That's what I came here for.

1059
01:26:45,375 --> 01:26:47,844
- Martin.
- Hang on. I'll tell you what you can do.

1060
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,550
Say sorry. How about that? Apologise.
Stop trying to cover things up.

1061
01:26:51,708 --> 01:26:53,756
Get out there and clear
all the weeds and crap

1062
01:26:53,917 --> 01:26:56,716
off the graves of the mothers and
babies that died in childbirth.

1063
01:26:56,875 --> 01:26:59,424
Their suffering was
atonement for their sins.

1064
01:26:59,583 --> 01:27:03,008
- One of the mothers was 14 years old!
- Martin, that's enough.

1065
01:27:03,167 --> 01:27:07,047
The Lord Jesus Christ will be
my judge, not the likes of you.

1066
01:27:07,208 --> 01:27:10,758
Really? I think if Jesus was here, he'd
tip you out of that fucking wheelchair

1067
01:27:10,917 --> 01:27:14,342
- and you wouldn't get up and walk.
- Stop! Stop! I'm sorry.

1068
01:27:15,333 --> 01:27:17,461
I didn't want to bring him
in here to make a scene.

1069
01:27:17,625 --> 01:27:21,175
Why are you apologising? Anthony was dying
and she still wouldn't tell him about you.

1070
01:27:21,333 --> 01:27:23,131
But it happened to me. Not you.

1071
01:27:23,292 --> 01:27:25,636
It's up to me what I do
about it. It's my choice.

1072
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:28,798
So, what? You're just
going to do nothing?

1073
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:34,343
No.

1074
01:27:37,917 --> 01:27:39,510
Sister Hildegarde...

1075
01:27:42,667 --> 01:27:46,126
I want you to know...
that I forgive you.

1076
01:27:50,292 --> 01:27:52,044
What? Just like that?

1077
01:27:52,875 --> 01:27:56,960
It's not just like that. That's hard.
That's hard for me.

1078
01:27:58,125 --> 01:28:00,469
But I don't want to hate people.

1079
01:28:01,208 --> 01:28:03,586
I don't want to be like you.

1080
01:28:05,708 --> 01:28:07,631
Look at you.

1081
01:28:08,542 --> 01:28:10,965
I'm angry.

1082
01:28:11,125 --> 01:28:13,628
It must be exhausting.

1083
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:21,380
Sister Claire, I wonder would you be so
kind as to take me to my son's grave.

1084
01:28:38,208 --> 01:28:39,801
Well...

1085
01:28:41,833 --> 01:28:43,835
I couldn't forgive you.

1086
01:29:10,833 --> 01:29:13,052
It's all right. I've calmed down.

1087
01:29:13,917 --> 01:29:16,215
I just want to buy something.

1088
01:30:07,208 --> 01:30:09,256
He knew I'd find him here.

1089
01:30:16,333 --> 01:30:18,552
I'm not going to publish the story.

1090
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:23,835
It's between you and him.

1091
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:30,252
I got you something.

1092
01:30:32,042 --> 01:30:34,010
Oh, Martin.

1093
01:30:35,375 --> 01:30:37,377
Thank you.

1094
01:30:55,542 --> 01:31:00,753
You know, I just decided... I did
want you to tell my story after all.

1095
01:31:01,958 --> 01:31:04,427
People should know
what happened here.

1096
01:31:34,250 --> 01:31:37,925
Did I tell you, Martin, I've finished
that book? The Saddle And The Loom.

1097
01:31:38,083 --> 01:31:41,053
- Would you like to read it?
- Erm...

1098
01:31:43,083 --> 01:31:45,336
Why don't you tell me about it?

1099
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:48,879
Well... there's this weaver.

1100
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,254
She's quite plain really. Well,
she's pretty but she's plain.

1101
01:31:53,417 --> 01:31:54,464
I like plain girls.

1102
01:31:54,625 --> 01:31:58,004
Yes, well, and she's been told that she
has to work all through the night,

1103
01:31:58,167 --> 01:32:00,261
to weave a beautiful cloak,

1104
01:32:00,417 --> 01:32:04,797
of the finest silk for the master
to wear on his wedding day.

1105
01:32:04,958 --> 01:32:10,840
So in the morning she shows him the cloak and
she asks him, "What do you think, kind sir?"

1106
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,753
And he says, "it's beautiful.

1107
01:32:13,917 --> 01:32:17,296
I've never seen anything more
beautiful in my whole life."

1108
01:32:17,458 --> 01:32:20,007
But guess what? He's not
even looking at the cloak.

1109
01:32:20,167 --> 01:32:21,919
He's looking at her!

1110
01:32:22,083 --> 01:32:25,587
Well, I didn't see that coming,
Martin. Not in a million years.
