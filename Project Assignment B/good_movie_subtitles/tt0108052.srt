1
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,520
- Name?
- Horowitz, Salomon.

2
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,560
- Schneider, Sarah.
- Birnbaum, Olga?

3
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,720
- Over there. Over there!
- Come here!

4
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,920
- Isak Hudes.
- Hudes, Isak.

5
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,080
Zucker, Helena.

6
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,600
Zucker, Helena!

7
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,480
- Hirsch, Salomon?
- Mandel, Maria.

8
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,920
- Hauptman, Chaim!
- Weisman! Weisman, Marcus!

9
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,800
- Feber, Ludwig!
- Feber, Ludwig.

10
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,840
Elsa Bauman.

11
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,240
-Josef Klein.
- Klein.

12
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,120
- Davidowich, Ignacy.
- Paula Biffer. - Nadel, Rachela.

13
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,760
- Steiner, Gertruda.
- Steiner, Hilda.

14
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,080
- Jerzy, you know who that man is?
- I don't know.

15
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,640
Let's get together, please.

16
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,440
Smile. Good!

17
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,920
Yes, sir.

18
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,640
Bring them over
a round of drinks.

19
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:03,720
Very good, sir.
And who shall I say they are from?

20
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,760
You can say
they are from me.

21
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,600
- From the gentleman.
- Where?

22
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,040
Do you know him?

23
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,460
-Find out who he is.
-Yes, sir!

24
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,040
Agnieszka, I would give anything
to hear you sing tonight...

25
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,840
...but I know you won't.

26
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,000
You embarrass me.

27
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,160
What's he doing?

28
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,360
Stay here.

29
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,940
How are you doing?

30
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:19,360
You'd leave a woman
alone at the table in a place like this?

31
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,560
Sweetheart, you're the picture
of loneliness.

32
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,520
What a lovely fragrance.
You are breaking my heart.

33
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,080
An extra chair, please.
Vodka for my friend.

34
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,300
- And for the lady?
- Pernod!

35
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,880
"There's a wood sale
in Green Forest... "

36
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,860
"... a wood sale!"

37
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,520
"Wood is being sold in the Green Forest. "

38
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,120
Come to the table, girls!
Drink with us!

39
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,440
"Left around the corner,
right around the corner... "

40
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,080
"... there is wood sale everywhere. "

41
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,120
Come to us!
Merry us!

42
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:03,340
"The whole trunk costs only one taler.
one taler. "

43
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:08,160
"The whole trunk costs only one taler,
one taler. "

44
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,820
- Thank you.
- I'll tell you what I mean by cooperative.

45
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,240
Two days after the law is passed
that all Jews have to wear the star...

46
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,460
...the Jewish tailors are
turning them out by the gross in a variety...

47
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,560
...of fabrics
at three zloty each.

48
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,160
Tell me about
your cellar wines.

49
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,960
- I have an excellent German Riesling, 1937.
- French!

50
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,200
- A Bordeaux. Chateau Latour, '28, '29?
- No, I'm sorry.

51
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,680
It's as if they have no idea
what kind of law it is.

52
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,100
As if it's the emblem
of a riding club.

53
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,980
- A Margaux, '29?
- No, no, we don't have that.

54
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,360
- Burgundy then? A Romanee-Conti, '37?
- Yes.

55
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,340
It's human nature.
"We'll do this to avoid that. "

56
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,040
That's what they have done
since thousands of years.

57
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,780
It's what they do.
They weather the storm.

58
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,400
But this storm is different. This is not
the Romans. This storm is the SS.

59
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,240
"If God wants to honor you... "

60
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,920
"... then he'll send you world wide. "

61
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:05,080
"If god wants to honor you
then he'll send you world wide. "

62
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:08,560
"Faleri, Falera... "

63
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,340
"... Faleri
Falera-ha ha ha!"

64
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,860
"Faleri, Falera!"

65
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,280
"He sends you away world wide"

66
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,660
-Martin?
-Yes, sir!

67
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,800
Who is that man?

68
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,420
That's Oskar Schindler!

69
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,700
"Faleri, Falera
ha ha ha!"

70
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,260
"He sends you away world wide. "

71
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:40,640
"Faleri, Falera!"

72
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,180
"He sends you away world wide. "

73
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,240
To Krakow!

74
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,280
<i>Attention, all Jews!</i>

75
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,860
<i>From now on, Jewish art...</i>

76
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,140
<i>...meat preparing is forbidden.</i>

77
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,380
<i>Announcement for all Jews!
From now on...</i>

78
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,600
- Rabbi...
- Private property cannot be confiscated.

79
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,600
- How long are the schools going to be closed?
- I do not know the answer..

80
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,840
- Article 47: Pillage is formally prohibited.
- You don't know anything!

81
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,740
- I am familiar with the Hague Convention.
- Religious...

82
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,940
They come into our house
and tell us we don't live there any more.

83
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,640
It now belongs
to a certain SS officer.

84
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,900
Please!
I only know what they tell me.

85
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,900
And what they tell me
changes from day to day!

86
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,240
Aren't you supposed
to be able to help?

87
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,280
I mean, what if I just
took this thing off?

88
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,000
- What are they going to do about it?
- They will shoot you.

89
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,000
- Why don't you stop this silly talk?
- Itzhak Stern!

90
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,160
I'm looking
for Itzhak Stern.

91
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,660
Are you Itzhak Stern or not?

92
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,800
- I am.
- Where can we talk?

93
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,760
There's a company
you did the books for, on Lipowa Street.

94
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,160
Made what?
Pots and pans?

95
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,200
By law, I have to tell you, sir,
I'm a Jew.

96
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,040
Well, I'm a German.
So there we are.

97
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,280
- A good company, you think?
- Modestly successful.

98
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,440
I know nothing about enamelware.
Do you?

99
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,240
I was just
the accountant.

100
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,140
Simple engineering though,
wouldn't you think?

101
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,740
Change the machines around,
whatever you do...

102
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,240
...you could make other
things, couldn't you?

103
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:23,000
Field kits, mess kits.
Army contracts.

104
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,180
Once the war ends,
forget it, but for now it's great.

105
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,080
You can make a fortune,
don't you think?

106
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,800
I think most people right now
have other priorities.

107
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,680
Like what?

108
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,880
I'm sure you'll do just fine,
once you get the contracts.

109
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,880
In fact, the worse things get,
the better you'll do.

110
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,520
Oh, well, I can get the signatures
I need. That's the easy part.

111
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,160
Finding the money
to buy the company, that's hard.

112
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,960
You don't have any money?

113
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,120
Not that kind of money.
You know anybody?

114
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,000
Jews, yeah.

115
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,540
Investors.
You must have contacts...

116
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,440
...in the Jewish business community
working here.

117
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,220
What community?
Jews can no longer own businesses.

118
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,160
- That's why this one's in receivership.
- But they wouldn't own it.

119
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,280
I'd own it. I'd pay them
back in product- pots and pans.

120
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,320
- Pots and pans!
- Something they can use.

121
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,920
Something they can
feel in their hands.

122
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,120
They can trade it on the black market,
do whatever they want.

123
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,720
Everybody's happy!

124
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,040
If you want, you could
run the company for me.

125
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,880
Let me understand.

126
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,500
They'd put up all the money,
I'd do all the work.

127
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:35,000
What, if you don't mind
my asking, would you do?

128
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,040
I'd make sure it's known
the company's in business.

129
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,340
I'd see that it had
a certain panache.

130
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:43,420
That's what I'm good at.
Not the work, not the work.

131
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,800
The presentation!

132
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07,200
I'm sure I don't know anybody
who'll be interested in this.

133
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,580
Well, they should be,
Itzhak Stern.

134
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,940
Tell them they should be.

135
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,020
<i>Attention, attention!</i>

136
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:32,140
<i>All Jews!
From now on, it's forbidden...</i>

137
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,000
I've got a client who'll sell marks
for zloty at 2.45 to 1.

138
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,200
Wool, mink collar.
It's a nice coat.

139
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,200
She'll trade it
for ration coupons.

140
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,520
- Wicks, for lamps.
- You have a truckload of wicks?

141
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,560
What am I going to do
with a truckload of wicks?

142
00:14:57,595 --> 00:14:59,480
9 by 12, 9 by 14.

143
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,560
I don't know.
Big, beautiful, Persian.

144
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,760
-What?
- You don't recognize this?

145
00:15:08,761 --> 00:15:11,161
-It's shoe polish.
-In metal containers?

146
00:15:11,196 --> 00:15:12,160
You asked for shoe polish.

147
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,320
In metal containers.
This is glass, it's not what I asked for.

148
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,320
What's the difference?

149
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,320
- What's the difference?
- What's the difference?

150
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,920
My client sold it to his client,
who sold it to the German Army.

151
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:27,220
Only by the time it got there, because
of the freezing cold, it broke. All 10,000 units.

152
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,660
This is not my problem.

153
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,360
- This is not his problem.
- This is not your problem?

154
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,780
- This is not my problem.
- All right!

155
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,120
The German Army wants
to find out where it came from.

156
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,060
- I am going to make sure they find out.
- Now it's your problem.

157
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,620
You be quiet!

158
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,240
Metal containers.

159
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,560
Hello!

160
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,840
Pardon me for interfering,
but that's a nice shirt.

161
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,200
Nice shirt.

162
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,440
Do you know
where I can find a nice shirt like that?

163
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,120
Like this?

164
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,280
It's illegal to buy or sell
anything on the street.

165
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,920
We don't do that.
We're here to pray.

166
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,240
Do you have any idea
how much a shirt like this costs?

167
00:16:21,275 --> 00:16:24,040
Nice things cost money.

168
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,940
How many?

169
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,160
I'm going to need some other
things, too, as things come up.

170
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,800
- This won't be a problem.
- From time to time.

171
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,200
<i>Attention! Attention!</i>

172
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,120
- Name? Address?
- Fill in the forms!

173
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,880
Go on, go on!
Don't push each other!

174
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,880
- You come here!
- Stay there!

175
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,880
<i>Attention! Attention!
All Jews are enforced...</i>

176
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,320
<i>...to live in the Jewish district.</i>

177
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:33,600
<i>Not getting the residence
from the registry office...</i>

178
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,280
<i>...will be against decree 44/91
and judged through the military court.</i>

179
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,980
This is obviously the right place.
How are you doing?

180
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,800
Goodbye, Jews!
Goodbye, Jews!

181
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,640
Goodbye,Jews!
Goodbye,Jews!

182
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,800
<i>Goodbye, Jews!</i>

183
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,400
<i>Goodbye, Jews!
Goodbye, Jews!</i>

184
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,120
Oh, my God!

185
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,880
Oy, God!
Oh, my God!

186
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,620
Oh, my God!

187
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,160
It could not be better.

188
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,680
- It could be worse.
- How? Tell me.

189
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,360
How on earth
could it possibly be worse?

190
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:56,961
<i>Good morning!</i>

191
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,880
- Hey, Goldberg.
- Poldek.

192
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,080
- What's this?
- Uh, the Jewis assembly has its own police now.

193
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,700
- You don't say.
- Coordination service!

194
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,320
I'm a policeman now,
could you believe it? It's hard to believe.

195
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,320
Oh, no, it's not hard to believe.

196
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,380
It's a good racket, Poldek.
The only racket here.

197
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,940
Look, maybe I could put in
a good word for you with my superiors.

198
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,200
- Your superiors?
- Come on, they're not as bad as everyone says.

199
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,400
Well, they're worse than everyone says,
but it's a lot of money.

200
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,960
A lot of money!

201
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,680
Give me my housing assignment.

202
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:44,000
- Come on.
- You look funny in that hat, Goldberg.

203
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,400
You look like a clown, you know?

204
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,860
He's a very important man.

205
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,760
Just give him
two minutes of your time.

206
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:59,520
Since when did time cost money?
Just sit down and listen...

207
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,960
...please!
Sir?

208
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,000
For each thousand you invest,
I will repay you with...

209
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,960
- Two hundred.
- ... 200 kilos of enamelware a month...

210
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,260
...to begin in July
and to continue for one year.

211
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,000
After which time, we're even.
That's it. It's very simple.

212
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,920
- Not good enough.
- It's not good enough!

213
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,960
Not good enough?

214
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:24,060
Look where you're living. Look where
you've been put. "Not good enough! "

215
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,720
A couple of months ago
you'd be right, not anymore.

216
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,760
Money's still money.

217
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:35,340
No, it is not!
That's why we are here.

218
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,320
Trade goods...

219
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,820
...that's the only currency
that'll be worth anything in the ghetto.

220
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,160
Things have changed, my friend.

221
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,760
Did I call this meeting?

222
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,860
You told Mr Stern
you wanted to speak to me.

223
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,120
I'm here.
I've made you a fair offer.

224
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:54,960
Fair would be
a percentage in the company.

225
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,560
Forget the whole thing.
Get out!

226
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,960
How do we know
that you will do what you say?

227
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,560
Because I said I would.

228
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,720
You want a contract?
To be upheld by what court?

229
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,000
I said what I'll do.
That's our contract.

230
00:22:30,001 --> 00:22:35,301
Five, six, seven...

231
00:22:35,302 --> 00:22:38,702
...eight, nine...

232
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:54,480
The standard SS rate for Jewish
skilled labourers is seven marks a day...

233
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,260
...five for unskilled and women.

234
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,300
This is what you pay
the Reich Economic Office.

235
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,880
The Jews themselves
receive nothing.

236
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,200
Poles you pay wages.
Generally, they get a little more.

237
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,760
- Are you listening?
- What was that about the SS?

238
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,000
The rate? The what?

239
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,220
The Jewish worker's salary,
you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker.

240
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,400
- He gets nothing.
- But it's less.

241
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,580
- It's less than what I would pay a Pole.
- It's less?

242
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,560
That's the point
I'm trying to make.

243
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,120
Poles cost more.

244
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,160
Why should I hire Poles?

245
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,240
An enamelware factory,
over at, Lipowa Street.

246
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,220
It, uh, it, um...
It's owned by a German.

247
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,680
But it's outside the ghetto,
so you can barter for extra goods...

248
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,400
...for eggs, I don't know
what you need...

249
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,120
...with the Polish workers.
You can't get it here.

250
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,680
Also, he's asking for ten
healthy women for the...

251
00:23:46,715 --> 00:23:48,320
I'm healthy!

252
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,200
Bring your sister, okay?

253
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,500
You need to convince them you have
a trade, something valuable to the war effort.

254
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,840
- Like what?
-I'm a musician. - What if you don't?

255
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:06,160
- Your name goes on a list.
- Your name is on the list, they put you on trucks...

256
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,240
- No, no, no, that's not true.
- You're a musician?

257
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,920
- Yeah.
- I'd find a good hiding place if I were you.

258
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,620
- I'm not going to hide like some animal.
- There are places to hide.

259
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,460
The next!

260
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,080
I'm a graduate
of the University of Lwow.

261
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,780
I used to work at the
hydroelectric station in Roznow...

262
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,680
Blue card!

263
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:36,880
I'm gonna get the necessary papers
because this card is no good any more.

264
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,480
You can stay in this line all day,
you'll still get one of these.

265
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,960
They are no good.
You'll have to leave the line now...

266
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:47,440
...then you'll get a blue card, a Blauschein,
to say that you are an essential worker.

267
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,640
I'll get these papers
for you at Pankiewicz.

268
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,840
Pharmacist.
Just there, look!

269
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,540
<i>Guess who is here?</i>

270
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,240
Poldek!
Enjoying the weather, Poldek?

271
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,860
- Enjoying the lines?
- Need some shoe polish?

272
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,340
In metal container maybe!

273
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:07,040
Not essential? I think you misunderstand
the meaning of the word.

274
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,320
No blue card, sir.
Stand over there.

275
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:12,040
Move. Next!

276
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,880
What do you mean,
"Not essential"?

277
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:20,940
I teach history and literature.
Since when it's not essential?

278
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,880
He's metal polisher.

279
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,020
- It was not right?
- It's very good. He's 53 years old.

280
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,200
- It's too new.
-Thank you.

281
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,400
You're crazy.
You left it in your drawer.

282
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,240
How many times
have I told you?

283
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:55,320
Your work certificate,
you keep in your pocket at all times.

284
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,080
And you leave everything
in your drawer.

285
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,680
How many times I've told you?

286
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,280
I'm a metal polisher!

287
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,060
<i>Take the round sheet of tin...</i>

288
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,000
...dip it in soap emulsion.

289
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:22,560
<i>Then place it centrally in the press.</i>

290
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,400
We obtain the soup pot.
The soup pot!

291
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,720
Soup pot!

292
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,880
Grosz, Mrs Grosz, stay together.

293
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,520
Look, sir, I have ten work permits here
for the German enamel factory...

294
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:58,580
...and signed by Mr Bankier
and myself.

295
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:03,280
<i>If it's carbonized,
clean it with a file.</i>

296
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:07,720
But don't touch both the electrodes
at the same time.

297
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:11,080
You'll get electrocuted.
Here, have a try.

298
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,120
Roll the metal
under the press...

299
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,620
...but be very careful
unless you want your fingers...

300
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,760
...to become part of the teapot!

301
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:27,460
- Occupation?
- I'm a writer. I play the flute.

302
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,720
But Moses is a skilled metalworker.

303
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,120
He can make tin pots.
He can make tanks.

304
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,020
He can make whatever
Mr Schindler asks.

305
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,640
He's highly skilled.
Give him your card.

306
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:40,240
Moses, give him your card.

307
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:47,100
<i>Now, dip the basin with the tongs
into the enamel solution.</i>

308
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:53,420
<i>And after swiveling it around,
carefully place it aside to drip-dry.</i>

309
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:59,520
And whatever he asks you, allow me
just to represent you and speak for you.

310
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,320
Don't say a word!

311
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,800
Filing, billing, keeping
track of my appointments, shorthand.

312
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:08,720
- Typing, obviously. How is your typing?
- Uh, all right.

313
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,720
Please!

314
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:05,120
You need a secretary.
Pick one.

315
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:09,920
I don't know how.
They're all so... qualified.

316
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,800
You have to choose.

317
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,680
Big smile, big smile!

318
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,640
If you would,
look after my guest.

319
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:45,460
Um, boxed teas are good.
Coffee, pâté, um...

320
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,240
...kielbasa sausage,
cheeses, Beluga caviar...

321
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,280
...and, of course, who could live
without German cigarettes?

322
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,760
Get me as many
as you can find.

323
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,760
And some more fresh fruit.

324
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,680
The real rarities,
oranges, lemons, pineapples.

325
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,080
I need several boxes of Cuban cigars.
The best.

326
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,385
And dark unsweetened chocolate...

327
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,680
...not in the shape of ladyfingers,
the chunk chocolate.

328
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,645
Big as my hand,
you sample at wine tastings.

329
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,880
We're going to need lots of cognac.
The best, Hennessy.

330
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,760
Dom Perignon champagne.
Um, get L 'espadon sardines...

331
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,520
...and, oh,
try to find nylon stockings.

332
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,840
<i>It is my distinct pleasure
to announce...</i>

333
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:30,380
<i>...the fully operational status
of German enamel factory...</i>

334
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,880
<i>...manufacturers of superior
enamelware crockery...</i>

335
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:40,160
<i>...expressly designed
and crafted for military use.</i>

336
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,840
<i>Utilizing only
the most modern equipment...</i>

337
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:47,760
<i>...D.E.F.'s staff of highly skilled and
experienced artisans and journeymen...</i>

338
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,240
<i>...deliver a product
of unparalleled quality...</i>

339
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,120
<i>...enabling me to proffer,
with absolute confidence and pride...</i>

340
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,680
<i>...a full line
of field and kitchenware...</i>

341
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,680
<i>...unsurpassable in all respects
by my competitors.</i>

342
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,880
See attached list
and available colours.

343
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,960
Anticipating the enclosed bids
will meet with your approval...

344
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:12,720
...looking forward to a long and
mutually prosperous association...

345
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,820
...I extend to you in advance
my sincerest gratitude...

346
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,800
...and very best regards.
Oskar Schindler.

347
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,160
Yeah, I need 700 gross
from here for next Thursday.

348
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,880
Nine hundred,
no, make it ten for Wednesday.

349
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,720
All this stuff here goes to Madritsch's
factory on Tuesday of next week.

350
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,120
My father was fond of saying,
"You need three things in life... "

351
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:51,620
"... a good doctor,
a forgiving priest... "

352
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,320
"... and a clever accountant. "

353
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:01,440
The first two,
I've never had much use for.

354
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,880
But the third!

355
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:13,940
Just pretend, for Christ's sake!

356
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,920
Is that all?

357
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,600
I'm trying to thank you.

358
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,680
I'm saying I couldn't
have done this without you.

359
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,880
The usual thing would be
to acknowledge my gratitude.

360
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,640
It would also, by the way,
be the courteous thing.

361
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,360
You're welcome.

362
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,320
Get out of here!

363
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,040
<i>Klonowska, who is it?</i>

364
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:23,000
She's so embarrassed.
Look at her.

365
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,200
You know something?
You would like her.

366
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,200
- Oskar, please!
- What?

367
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,560
I don't have to like her...
just because you do.

368
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,240
It doesn't work that way.

369
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,320
You've done well here.

370
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,120
You look wonderful.

371
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:10,200
- Be careful of the step, miss.
- Mrs Schindler, Marek.

372
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,900
- It's not a charade, all this?
- Charade? How could it be a charade?

373
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,600
- The clothes, the car, the apartment.
- Wait a minute.

374
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,740
Take a guess how many
people are on my payroll.

375
00:34:30,741 --> 00:34:31,941
Oskar!

376
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:36,900
My father, at the height of his success,
had 50. I've got 350.

377
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:41,360
350 workers on the factory floor,
with one purpose.

378
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,400
To make pots and pans?

379
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,240
To make money.
For me!

380
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,740
Does anyone ask about me?

381
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:03,260
Back home?
Everybody. All the time.

382
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:12,680
They won't soon forget the name
Schindler here, I can tell you that.

383
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:16,400
"Oskar Schindler"
they'll say.

384
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,920
"Everybody remembers him. "

385
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:24,040
"He did something extraordinary. "

386
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:29,040
"He did something
no one else did. "

387
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:35,040
"He came here with nothing,
a suitcase...

388
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:40,960
"... and built a bankrupt
company into a major manufactory. "

389
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,080
"And left with
a steamer trunk... "

390
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:48,560
"... two steamer trunks
full of money. "

391
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,680
"All the riches of the world. "

392
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,040
It's comforting to see
that nothing's changed.

393
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,360
You're wrong, Emilie.

394
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,360
There's no way I could have
known this before but...

395
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:07,120
...there was always
something missing.

396
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:11,120
In every business I tried,
I can see now, it wasn't me that failed.

397
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,840
Something was missing.

398
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,360
Even if I'd known what it was,
there's nothing I could have done about it...

399
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,840
...because you can't
create this thing.

400
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:26,960
And it makes all the difference
in the world between success and failure.

401
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,520
Luck?

402
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,640
War!

403
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:00,720
Should I stay?

404
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:04,460
It's a beautiful city.

405
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,500
I asked you if I should stay.

406
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:13,120
It's up to you.

407
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,360
Promise me, Oskar.
No doorman or maitre d' will ever presume...

408
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,600
...I'm anyone other
than Mrs. Schindler, and I'll stay.

409
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,880
Goodbye, darling.

410
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:50,800
I could try to read this
or I could eat my lunch while it's still hot.

411
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,700
We're doing well?

412
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,040
- Yes.
- Better this month than last?

413
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,260
- Yes.
- Any reason to think next month will be worse?

414
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,000
The war could end.

415
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,520
- What?
- There is a machinist outside...

416
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,560
...who'd like to thank you
personally for giving him a job.

417
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:19,600
Every day he comes. He's very grateful.
It'll just take a minute.

418
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,520
Mr Lowenstein!

419
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:37,120
I want to thank you, sir...

420
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,780
...for giving me
the opportunity to work.

421
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:42,720
You're welcome.
I'm sure you're doing a great job.

422
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:46,920
The SS beat me up.
They would have killed me...

423
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:51,480
...but I am essential
to the war effort, thanks to you.

424
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,480
That's great.

425
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,740
I work hard for you.

426
00:38:55,820 --> 00:39:00,000
- I'm sure you do.
- I'll continue to work hard for you.

427
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,960
That's great. Thanks.

428
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,320
- God bless you, sir.
- All right.

429
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:08,000
You are a good man.

430
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,320
- He saved my life.
- Yes, he did.

431
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,820
- God bless him.
- Yeah. Come on.

432
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,840
God bless you!

433
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,900
I'm sorry, Herr Direktor,
but you're running very late.

434
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:37,360
This is for the major, sir.

435
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,280
And this is for his niece, Greta.
It's her birthday.

436
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,960
- Greta as in Garbo.
- Don't ever do that to me again.

437
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,520
Go. Go, go, drive!
Don't bow.

438
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:49,400
- Did you notice that man had one arm?
- Did he?

439
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,040
- What's his use?
- Very useful.

440
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:01,760
- How?
- Very useful! Success!

441
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,020
<i>You'll be given brooms and shovels...</i>

442
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,960
<i>...each of you will grab one
and start cleaning the street.</i>

443
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,920
We'll be late for work.

444
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,880
You shouldn't
think of them as yours, Oskar.

445
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,820
You need to understand that
some of the officers here...

446
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,560
...don't give a damn
about production.

447
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,560
To them, it's a matter of,
um, national priority...

448
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,940
...that Jews
be made to shovel snow.

449
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,360
<i>It's got nothing to do
with reality, Oskar.</i>

450
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,440
<i>You know it and I know it.</i>

451
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,680
<i>Jews shoveling snow!</i>

452
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:13,280
<i>It's got a, um,
ritual significance.</i>

453
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,160
- Come with me.
- I am an essential worker.

454
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,840
- Essential worker?
- Yes.

455
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,120
- I work for Oskar Schindler.
- Essential worker for Oskar Schindler.

456
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,480
- A one-armed Jew? Twice as useless!
- Yes, yes.

457
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:34,400
I lost a day
of production, Rolf.

458
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,520
<i>I work for Oskar Schindler.</i>

459
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,480
Danka, look at the snow.
Look at the snow. Look at the snow!

460
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,040
I lost a worker.
I expect to be compensated.

461
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,920
File a grievance with the
Economic Office. It's your right.

462
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,580
- Would it do any good?
- Of course not!

463
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,860
A big shot from the SS Budget
and Construction Office came to lunch...

464
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,040
...and he told us that to believe
the Jewish skilled worker had a place...

465
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:09,640
...in Reich economics
was a treasonable idea.

466
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:17,520
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?

467
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:20,460
He was a metal press operator.

468
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,320
Quite skilled.

469
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,120
Mr. Director!

470
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,480
Shit. I don't believe it.

471
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,720
Stern, is that you?

472
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:04,760
No, it's Poldek.
It's about Stern.

473
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:08,560
<i>Leave your luggage
on the platform.</i>

474
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,640
<i>Clearly label it.</i>

475
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:14,760
<i>Given name first,
then your surname.</i>

476
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,320
<i>Do not bring
your baggage with you.</i>

477
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,160
<i>It will follow you later.</i>

478
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:23,460
<i>Leave your luggage
on the platform.</i>

479
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:25,260
<i>Clearly label it.</i>

480
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:29,200
<i>Leave your luggage
on the platform.</i>

481
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,480
Stern?

482
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:37,000
- He's on the list.
- He is?

483
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,840
- Well, let's find him.
- I'm sorry. You can't have him.

484
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,620
He's on the list. If he were an essential
worker, he would not be on the list.

485
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,440
I'm talking to a clerk.
What is your name?

486
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:48,480
- Sir, the list is correct.
- I didn't ask you about the list.

487
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,480
- I asked you your name.
- Klaus Tauber.

488
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,520
Tauber!

489
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:58,280
Squad leader, this gentleman
thinks a mistake's been made.

490
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:00,960
My plant manager is
somewhere on this train.

491
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,840
If it leaves with him on it,
it'll disrupt production...

492
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:04,940
...and the Armaments Board
will want to know why.

493
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:07,520
-Attention! The train is about to leave.
-Is he on the list?

494
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:11,640
Yes, sir. Itzhak Stern.

495
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:17,240
Well, the list is correct, sir.
There is nothing I can do.

496
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:20,080
- What is your name?
-Close and secure all doors.

497
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,440
- My name? My name is Kunder.
- This train is now leaving.

498
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,800
- Kunder.
- Hauptscharführer Kunder.

499
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,800
- K-U-N-D-E-R.
- And what's yours?

500
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,920
Schindler.
S-C-H-I-N-D-L-E-R.

501
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,240
Gentlemen, thank you very much.

502
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,840
I think I can guarantee you
you'll both be in...

503
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,480
...Southern Russia
before the end of the month. Good day.

504
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,360
Stern!

505
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,280
- Stern!
- Stern!

506
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,280
Itzhak Stern!

507
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,960
Stern!
Itzhak Stern!

508
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,640
- Stern! Stern!
- Itzhak Stern!

509
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,200
-Stern!
-Sir!

510
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:07,280
- Stern!
- Herr Direktor!

511
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:10,120
My apologies.

512
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,000
- Stop the train! He's here!
- I apologize.

513
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:17,840
- Stop the train!
- Stop the train! Stop it!

514
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:33,480
Sign here. Initial there.

515
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:37,780
Makes no difference to us,
you understand. This one, that one.

516
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,040
It's the inconvenience to the list.

517
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,720
- It's the paperwork.
- I somehow left my work card at home.

518
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:47,400
I tried to explain them
it was a mistake, but...

519
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:51,400
- ... I'm sorry, it was stupid!
- What if I got here five minutes later?

520
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,080
Then where would I be?

521
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,440
I woke up from a dream
this morning.

522
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:47,600
I was broke and sharing a room
with 12 people I didn't know...

523
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:53,440
...only to discover I was broke and
sharing a room with 12 people I didn't know.

524
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:56,040
- You laugh about it?
- I have to laugh.

525
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,640
You are living behind walls.

526
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:03,600
The walls I can deal with.
It's the restrictions to my life I'm tired of.

527
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:06,220
Those walls keep them out.
That's all I care about.

528
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,360
I like it here.
There's a kind of, I don't know...

529
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,640
...ancestral squalor to it all.

530
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:13,800
- You are a slave to these people.
- No one envies us any more.

531
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,920
- I'm smart!
- Oh, yes, you're smart!

532
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,200
- You're a real genius.
- You had your chance.

533
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:22,720
Today, today I actually found time
to organize a thought.

534
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,480
I can't remember
the last time I did that.

535
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:27,280
When's the last time
we did this?

536
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,760
When's the last time
we stood around and talked?

537
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:33,040
No one ordered me
onto a truck today.

538
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,280
No one took my business
away from me.

539
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,320
You don't really have
a business to take.

540
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,600
There's nowhere down from here.

541
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,840
This is it.
This is the bottom.

542
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:45,720
The ghetto is,
liberty!

543
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:54,640
This street divides the ghetto
just about in half.

544
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:59,880
Right side, Ghetto A:
Civil employees...

545
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,720
...industrial workers and so on.

546
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:07,620
Left side, Ghetto B:
Surplus labour...

547
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,320
...the elderly and infirm mostly.

548
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:12,720
Which is where you'll
want to start, huh?

549
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,100
Do you have any questions, sir?

550
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:18,400
Ja, why is the top down?
I'm fucking freezing.

551
00:49:20,101 --> 00:49:22,801
We expect a labor force of
25.000 to 30.000.

552
00:49:22,802 --> 00:49:26,102
Segregated of course.
The men in the barracks near the guarry...

553
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,700
-... the women on the other side of the wire.
-My place is where?

554
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:30,500
-There, sir.
-There?

555
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:33,280
-Yes, the villa.
-You call that a villa?

556
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:35,300
- Their synagogue, can you see it?
- That's not a villa!

557
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:39,060
- We' to turn it into the camp stables.
- It's a house!

558
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:42,060
What's that over there?

559
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,280
Playground.
Fifty-one.

560
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:49,760
And we have a dentist,
shoemaker, practical physicians.

561
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:55,280
There they are, sir.

562
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,640
One of you is, uh,
a very lucky girl.

563
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:06,360
There is an opening for a job...

564
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:10,160
...away from all this,
backbreaking work...

565
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:13,680
...at my new villa.

566
00:50:13,681 --> 00:50:15,081
Uh...

567
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:21,060
...which of you has
domestic experience?

568
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:27,960
Yeah, on second thought,
I don't really want someone else's maid.

569
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:31,320
All those annoying habits
I have to undo.

570
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,680
I don't want
to give you my cold.

571
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,720
Uh, what's your name?

572
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:43,120
- Helen Hirsch.
- What?

573
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,920
Helen Hirsch.

574
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,480
- What? I can't hear.
- Helen Hirsch.

575
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,760
- Yes!
- Take it all down!

576
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,860
<i>-Back to your work!
-To work!</i>

577
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:12,880
<i>Take it down! It is not safe!</i>

578
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:16,200
She says the foundation was
poured wrong. She's got to take it down.

579
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:19,240
I told her it's the barracks,
not the fucking Hotel Europa.

580
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:23,400
Fucking Jew bitch engineer.
You fucking bitch!

581
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:27,560
Herr Kommandant.
The entire foundation...

582
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:30,280
...has to be torn down
and repoured.

583
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:33,640
If not, there will be
at least a subsidence...

584
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:36,200
...at the southern end
of the barracks.

585
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,760
Subsidence, and then collapse.

586
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:41,480
- And you are an engineer?
- Yes!

587
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,880
My name is Diana Reiter.
I'm a graduate...

588
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,240
...of Civil Engineering
from the University of Milan.

589
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:50,600
Ah, an educated Jew,
like Karl Marx himself.

590
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:00,920
- Sergeant!
- Yes, sir!

591
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,880
- Shoot her.
- What?

592
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,320
Commander!
I'm only trying to do my job.

593
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,920
Yeah, I'm doing mine.

594
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,360
Sir, she's foreman
of construction.

595
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,760
We are not going to have arguments
with these people.

596
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,760
Okay!

597
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:22,920
No!
Shoot her here, on my authority!

598
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:38,080
-It will take more than that.
-I'm sure, you are right!

599
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:49,040
Take it down, repour it,
rebuild it. Like she said.

600
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:53,200
We have more to see, but we have
only one more hour of light.

601
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:06,960
<i>Today is history.</i>

602
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:10,720
<i>Today will be remembered.</i>

603
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:18,280
Years from now, the young
will ask with wonder about this day.

604
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:23,760
Today is history,
and you are part of it.

605
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:26,325
Six hundred years ago...

606
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:30,040
<i>...when elsewhere they were putting
the blame for the Black Death...</i>

607
00:53:30,075 --> 00:53:33,640
...Kazimiers The Great,
so called...

608
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,880
...told the Jews
they could come to Krakow.

609
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:39,440
- Chaja, bread.
- They came.

610
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:42,520
- Not that fat. No, less.
- They trundled their belongings into the city.

611
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:45,320
- Yes, a bit less.
- They settled...

612
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:49,920
<i>...they took hold.
They prospered...</i>

613
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:54,880
<i>...in business, science,
education, the arts.</i>

614
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,860
<i>They came here with nothing.</i>

615
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:00,000
<i>Nothing!</i>

616
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,560
<i>And they flourished.</i>

617
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:09,120
<i>For six centuries
there has been a Jewish Krakow.</i>

618
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:12,280
<i>Think about that.</i>

619
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:14,320
<i>By this evening...</i>

620
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:18,440
<i>...those six centuries
are a rumour.</i>

621
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:21,880
They never happened.

622
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:25,800
Today is history!

623
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:47,600
Get off and line up
in a two row!

624
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,900
Come on, quicker!

625
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:58,740
I think we will start,
with Ghetto B.

626
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,100
- All right?
- Start from both sides?

627
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:11,780
- No, no! I would like you to start there.
- The right side?

628
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,340
-And then move around.
- All right!

629
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:20,920
<i>Label them clearly.
They will follow you later on.</i>

630
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:25,280
<i>Leave your luggage!</i>

631
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:28,860
<i>Label them clearly.</i>

632
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:32,360
<i>They'll follow you later on.</i>

633
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:34,960
- Open up!
- Lakoom.

634
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,960
<i>Come down!</i>

635
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,000
<i>Jews, all out!</i>

636
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:37,240
<i>Put on something warm
and come out.</i>

637
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:45,360
<i>To Chodi Square!</i>

638
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:57,360
Gold, Chaim!
Go to Chodi Square.

639
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,560
- Gold, Chaim!
- Yes, Chaim Gold.

640
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,960
Shoot him!

641
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:14,200
<i>Put on something warm
and go to Chodi Square.</i>

642
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:17,280
No baggage!
No baggage!

643
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:21,400
<i>-Go through.
-No baggage! No baggage!</i>

644
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:24,080
Hey, little boy.
How old are you, huh?

645
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:27,960
Huh, what's your name?
What's your name, huh?

646
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:30,480
I said, no luggage!

647
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,860
Don't pack, no luggage!

648
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:35,960
Go to Chodi Square!
Leave your luggage here!

649
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,880
- Blue card!
- Chodi Square!

650
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:40,820
What's this bag doing here?

651
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:43,800
Everybody to Chodi Square!

652
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:03,460
We're getting out through the sewers.
I have to check if they're clear.

653
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:06,100
- Mila, pack some things. Nothing bigger...
- I can't go in the sewers.

654
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:10,200
I told you
I won't go in the sewers.

655
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:16,440
You can go. Yes, you can.

656
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:20,200
I won't go in the sewers.

657
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:34,800
-Move!
-Over there! Over there! Move!

658
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,040
Your card, Jew?

659
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:39,120
Your papers, Jew?

660
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:41,960
Your papers, Jew!

661
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,380
That line!

662
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:47,020
Your papers?

663
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:50,340
I'm not going up
because of your goddamn papers!

664
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:54,600
Your goddamn papers!

665
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:14,220
Why are you shooting?
Are you crazy?

666
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,800
In this traffic,
you could have shot me!

667
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,980
The bullet passed me by so close!

668
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:21,800
-Sorry!
-Now you say sorry? You're crazy!

669
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:25,000
<i>Stay away! Stay away!</i>

670
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:32,460
<i>Don't talk, don't talk!
Just go to the trucks!</i>

671
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:35,320
<i>Keep on walking, keep on walking!
Don't talk!</i>

672
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,740
<i>Come here, you fuckin' Jew!</i>

673
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:49,160
<i>Stand still!
I said, stand still!</i>

674
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:46,880
She's good as dead.
Leave her.

675
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:50,440
Give me a moment.
Just let me bring her inside.

676
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:59,240
You can join her,
or join the line.

677
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:06,120
- Women to the left!
- Wilhelm! - Rose!

678
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,565
-Men to right.
-Women to the left!

679
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,560
- Women to the left.
- Let me go! I won't leave my husband!

680
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:19,680
Women to the left,
and men to the right.

681
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:24,680
Your government
is in the wrong country!

682
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,320
Mama! Mama!

683
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,480
Mila!

684
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:46,660
Oh, God, Danka!

685
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:54,420
- You have a blue card.
- Blue card doesn't matter any more.

686
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:57,660
- They are cleaning out the ghetto.
- There's not enough room for you.

687
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:01,300
What are you talking about? We tried it
before. There's more than enough room.

688
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:04,260
- I changed my mind!
- Mama!

689
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:08,620
Look at the space in there.
Now look at me. You are just scared.

690
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:10,860
I can fit the girl, but not you.

691
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:13,300
- Mama, I'm coming out!
- Stay where you are.

692
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:15,440
I'd rather you be here
than who knows where.

693
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:17,500
<i>Mama!</i>

694
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:39,220
Commander!

695
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:40,820
Very good saluting.

696
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:44,660
I respectfully report I've been given orders
to clear the bundles from the road.

697
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:47,580
So there will be no obstructions
to the thoroughfare.

698
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:52,980
Finish and join the lines,
little Polish clicking soldier.

699
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:15,860
Mrs. Dresner?

700
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:17,900
Yes.

701
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:20,180
Oh, you are a friend
of my son's.

702
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:22,320
Don't worry, I'll go quietly.
I'll be no trouble.

703
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:26,780
No, get under the stairs. They'll be done
searching soon. You'll be safe there.

704
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:30,100
- Please hide! Please!
- Warmed by the sun.

705
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:32,500
Hide under the stairs!

706
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:36,920
I've searched the building.
There's no one here.

707
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,900
- Okay, then we're going to the next block.
-Understood!

708
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:50,020
- Danka!
- Mama!

709
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:57,300
Hello, Adam.

710
01:04:57,380 --> 01:04:59,460
Hello, Danka.

711
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:08,980
Come with me.
I will put you in the good line.

712
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:13,780
Do you know the saying,
"An hour of life is still life"?

713
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:17,940
You are not a boy any more.
I'm saying a blessing for you.

714
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:54,340
Oh, please, let's go.
Let's go, please!

715
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,420
Come on!

716
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:04,380
Mark it...

717
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:06,420
...mark it!

718
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:33,620
- What is it? Is it Bach?
- No, no. It's Mozart.

719
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:35,660
- Mozart?
- Yes!

720
01:09:54,580 --> 01:09:57,940
- Can we still manage today?
- No way!

721
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:04,440
We can't manage it.

722
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:07,860
I wish this fucking
night were over.

723
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:47,800
<i>Appeal!
Line up! In rows of five!</i>

724
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:50,580
<i>Line up!</i>

725
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:54,980
<i>Line up!</i>

726
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:59,820
<i>Come on, in rows of five!</i>

727
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:02,140
Caps off!

728
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:05,420
Sort the names!

729
01:11:05,421 --> 01:11:09,021
Those who're announced will raise
their hands and shout a clear "Yes"!

730
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:11,700
<i>Yes!</i>

731
01:11:14,180 --> 01:11:15,225
<i>Yes!</i>

732
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:18,420
- Keller, Fanni!
- Yes!

733
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:22,780
- Adalbert, Hermann!
- Yes!

734
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:25,140
- Faber, Dorothea!
- Yes!

735
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:28,500
- Goldstein, Pola!
- Yes!

736
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:31,840
-Warmberger, Markus!
-Yes!

737
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:35,860
Edelstein, Max!

738
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:55,540
Disband!

739
01:11:57,620 --> 01:12:01,000
The worst is over.
We are workers now.

740
01:12:30,820 --> 01:12:33,860
<i>No excuses!</i>

741
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:41,460
Oh, God, Amon!

742
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:50,020
<i>Go to your barracks immediately!</i>

743
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:33,140
<i>Come here, come here!</i>

744
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:35,540
<i>Come on, come here!</i>

745
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:41,260
Amon, you're
such a damned fuckin' child!

746
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:43,700
Wakey, wakey.

747
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:56,440
- Make coffee.
- Make it yourself.

748
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:15,180
<i>The SS will manage
certain industries itself inside Plaszow.</i>

749
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,540
<i>A metalworks, brush factory...</i>

750
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:20,660
<i>...another for reprocessing
jewish clothing from the ghettos...</i>

751
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:23,160
<i>...for use by
bombed-out families back home.</i>

752
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:26,460
But it's private industry like yours
that stands to benefit most...

753
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:29,140
...by moving inside the wire of
Commandant Amon Goeth's camp...

754
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:31,660
No, no, no. Sit, sit.
Julian, how are you?

755
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:33,120
Good to see you, my friend.

756
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:36,100
- Oskar Schindler.
- Leo John.

757
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:42,360
- Franz, good to see you.
- Hello, Oskar. Glad you could join us.

758
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:45,840
- My pleasure. Julius.
- How are you? You lost weight.

759
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:49,660
Only in the shoulders.
Please, everybody, sit down.

760
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:52,300
How are you doing?
Oskar Schindler.

761
01:14:53,940 --> 01:14:57,220
- We started without you.
- Fine. I miss anything good?

762
01:14:57,700 --> 01:15:00,420
I was explaining to Herr Bosch
and Herr Madritsch...

763
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:03,200
...some of the benefits of moving
their factories into Plaszow.

764
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:05,800
I meant the food.

765
01:15:07,940 --> 01:15:11,660
Since your labour is housed on-site,
it's available to you at all times.

766
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:14,300
You can work them
all night if you want.

767
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:18,660
Your factory policies, whatever they've
been in the past, they'll continue to be.

768
01:15:18,740 --> 01:15:20,780
They'll be respected.

769
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:24,940
I have to know, where do you get a suit
like that? What is that? Is that silk?

770
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:26,900
Of course!

771
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:31,100
Yeah, it's, it has a nice sheen
about it.

772
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:32,980
- Thank you.
- Very nice.

773
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:36,640
I'd say I'd get you one, but the man
who made it is probably dead.

774
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:39,220
I don't know.

775
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:42,800
<i>I go to work the other day.</i>

776
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:44,880
<i>Nobody's there.</i>

777
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:48,500
<i>Nobody tells me about this.
I have to find out. I have to go in.</i>

778
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:52,020
<i>Everybody's gone.</i>

779
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:54,100
No!

780
01:15:54,980 --> 01:15:56,980
No!

781
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:02,020
They're not gone.
They're here.

782
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:06,960
They're mine!
Every day that goes by, I'm losing money.

783
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,780
Every worker that is shot costs me money.
I have to find somebody else.

784
01:16:09,781 --> 01:16:10,625
I have to trade them!

785
01:16:10,660 --> 01:16:13,660
We are going to be making so much
money that none of this is going to matter.

786
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:17,060
It's bad business.

787
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,380
Thank you.

788
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:31,900
Leave the bottle.

789
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:35,220
Take that.

790
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:38,780
Lena, thank you.

791
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:50,960
Scherner told me
something else about you.

792
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:55,000
Yeah? What's that?

793
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:59,660
That you know the meaning
of the word "gratitude. "

794
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:03,000
That it's not some vague thing with you...

795
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:06,220
...like it is with others.

796
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:09,620
You want to stay where you are.

797
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:12,700
You've got things
going on the side.

798
01:17:12,780 --> 01:17:14,780
Things are good.

799
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:19,220
You don't want anybody
telling you what to do.

800
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:23,580
I can understand all that,
you know? I know you.

801
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:30,660
What you want...
is your own sub-camp.

802
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:39,020
Do you have any idea what is involved?
The paperwork alone?

803
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:43,420
You've got to build the fucking thing. Getting
the fucking permits is enough to drive you crazy.

804
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:47,060
Then the engineers show up, they stand
around, they argue about drainage, foundations...

805
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:52,300
...codes, exact specifications, fences 4
kilometres long, 1,200 kilograms of barbed wire...

806
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:55,500
...6,000 kilograms of electrified
fences, ceramic insulators...

807
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:57,100
...three cubic metres
of air space per prisoner.

808
01:17:57,140 --> 01:18:01,160
I'm telling you, you want to shoot
somebody. I've been through it. I know.

809
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:04,860
Well, you know.
You've been through it.

810
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:09,860
You could make things
easier for me.

811
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:14,620
I'd be grateful.

812
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:20,260
<i>Clear the road!</i>

813
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:33,740
<i>Keep moving!
Keep moving!</i>

814
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:42,340
<i>-Keep moving!
-Turn left!</i>

815
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:50,880
Where's Stern?

816
01:18:53,820 --> 01:18:57,820
Goldberg and Chilowicz,
make sure I see my cut...

817
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:01,260
...from the, uh,
factory owners in this camp...

818
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:04,520
...leaving you to take care
of my main account...

819
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:07,760
...the Schindler account.

820
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:11,820
He wants his independence.
I gave it to him.

821
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:14,700
But independence costs money.

822
01:19:14,780 --> 01:19:17,500
This you understand?

823
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:23,660
Look at me!

824
01:19:33,860 --> 01:19:37,860
Don't forget
who you are working for now.

825
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:49,940
<i>- Yes!
- Make sure he stays. He's a slippery bastard!</i>

826
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:53,620
<i>Yes!
Now, girls, everyone.</i>

827
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:58,900
- We need more wine.
- More wine!

828
01:19:58,980 --> 01:20:02,380
<i>Stand on my friend.
Don't let him leave.</i>

829
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:21,140
- What happens in life...
-Cheers, cheers!

830
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,930
Thank you, Mr. Director.

831
01:20:25,965 --> 01:20:27,940
Cheers, Mr. Director!

832
01:20:31,940 --> 01:20:35,260
- What are you doing?
- What? Scratching my head.

833
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:39,620
Makes them think we have lice.
Helps make them keep their distance.

834
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:42,100
- Do you have lice?
- Do you have your notebook?

835
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:45,640
The calendar on my desk has the birthdays
of our SS friends' wives and children.

836
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:47,980
Don't forget to send something.

837
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:51,480
Record pay-offs to the Main Administration
and Economics Office, the Armaments...

838
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:53,880
- Slowly, Stern, slowly.
- The Armaments Board...

839
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:58,260
...Governor General's Division of the
Interior and Chief of Police as "fees"...

840
01:20:58,340 --> 01:21:00,340
...and make them
on the first of each month...

841
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:02,720
...as opposed to individual pay-offs
to our SS contacts.

842
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,760
The list is
in the lower drawer of my desk...

843
01:21:04,761 --> 01:21:07,761
-... which you...
-"First of month... "

844
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:10,440
SS contacts: List, lower drawer
of my desk, which you handle...

845
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:14,700
...as cash contributions to legitimate
charities sent to each official's office.

846
01:21:14,780 --> 01:21:18,060
Dealings with our black market contacts,
listed as suppliers...

847
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:20,960
-... in the legitimate ledger, are more complicated.
- Forget it!

848
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:25,300
- What do you mean, you can't forget it!
- It gives me a headache!

849
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:35,020
- I couldn't get you out of here.
- I'll be all right.

850
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:39,260
Anyway, I'm here almost every week.
Wednesdays, usually.

851
01:21:39,340 --> 01:21:42,760
I'll look in on you,
see how you're doing.

852
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:47,980
Here,
put these in your pocket.

853
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:50,020
Come on!

854
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:58,180
Mr. Director, don't let things fall apart.
I've worked too hard.

855
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:10,620
Thanks for...
Good luck!

856
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:33,860
Attention! Caps off!

857
01:22:43,061 --> 01:22:46,061
-Work!
-Back to work!

858
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:03,520
-What are you making?
-Hinges, sir!

859
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:09,180
Yeah, I've got some workers coming in
tomorrow. Where are they from again?

860
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:11,240
Yugoslavia, Mr. Commander!

861
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:13,780
I've got to make room.

862
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:19,460
- Make me a hinge.
- Yes, sir!

863
01:23:49,420 --> 01:23:52,500
Keep going, you're doing well.

864
01:23:52,580 --> 01:23:54,580
Says he's doing well.

865
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:03,540
Oh, that's very good.

866
01:24:03,620 --> 01:24:07,220
But I'm a bit confused,
and perhaps you can help me.

867
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:10,780
What I don't understand
is that you've been working...

868
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:15,220
.. since I think, what,
about 6.00 this morning?

869
01:24:15,740 --> 01:24:20,180
Yet such a small pile of hinges.

870
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:50,980
- Oh, Christ.
- May I try that, sir?

871
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:53,140
Check the angle lever.
Maybe it's bent.

872
01:24:53,220 --> 01:24:56,420
No, no. You wouldn't hear a click
if it was the angle lever.

873
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,880
- Maybe the pin shaft is greasy.
- Yeah, come on.

874
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:02,000
What did I just say?
Here.

875
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:05,920
Mr. Commander!

876
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:11,280
I beg to report that my heap
of hinges was so unsatisfactory...

877
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:15,220
...because the machines
were being recalibrated this morning.

878
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:19,940
I was put on to shoveling coal.

879
01:25:42,820 --> 01:25:44,820
Strange, huh?

880
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:46,780
Yeah!

881
01:25:51,260 --> 01:25:54,420
Thank you, Muek.

882
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:58,060
Ah, Lisiek. Don't touch the leather,
it's just been oiled.

883
01:25:58,140 --> 01:25:59,920
- Squad leader!
- Oh, for me?

884
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:03,580
-Oh, thank you very much, Mr Director.
-Mr. Director!

885
01:26:03,660 --> 01:26:06,100
Mr. Director!

886
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:11,020
Mr. Director!

887
01:26:12,820 --> 01:26:13,940
<i>He was making hinges slowly.</i>

888
01:26:13,980 --> 01:26:19,020
So the man can turn out a hinge in
less than a minute. Why the long story?

889
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:49,540
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome!

890
01:26:52,580 --> 01:26:56,300
- Nobody knows who stole the chicken?
- Tell him about the chicken.

891
01:26:56,380 --> 01:27:00,980
A man walks around with a chicken
and nobody notices this.

892
01:27:01,060 --> 01:27:03,540
Save yourselves.

893
01:27:03,620 --> 01:27:05,940
<i>Tell him about the chicken.</i>

894
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:22,980
Still nobody knows?

895
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:37,780
It was you!
You committed this crime!

896
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:40,180
- No, sir.
- But you know who, though.

897
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:42,420
- Yes.
- Who?

898
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:45,420
Him!

899
01:27:48,740 --> 01:27:52,500
- He's very gifted.
- Yeah, sure. Bring him over.

900
01:27:55,180 --> 01:27:58,900
Sir, thank you.

901
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:07,460
- Thank you again, Mr. Director!
- You're welcome again.

902
01:28:07,540 --> 01:28:09,920
It's an honour to work
for such a great company.

903
01:28:09,921 --> 01:28:10,921
It's great to have you!

904
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:14,500
I promise to learn everything there's
to know about enamelware production.

905
01:28:14,501 --> 01:28:16,001
That's great!

906
01:28:27,100 --> 01:28:31,300
- Hello? Miss Elsa Krause is here.
- I only need five minutes.

907
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:33,980
She wants to speak
to Mr. Director.

908
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:54,820
Yes.

909
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:01,560
He won't see you.

910
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:32,500
Please, sit down.

911
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:38,560
- Pernod? Cognac?
- Uh, no. No, thank you.

912
01:29:39,460 --> 01:29:42,860
So, what can I do for you?

913
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:49,180
They say that no one dies here.

914
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:52,680
They say your factory is a haven.

915
01:29:54,140 --> 01:29:56,500
They say you are good.

916
01:29:59,380 --> 01:30:01,500
Who says that?

917
01:30:01,580 --> 01:30:03,660
Everyone.

918
01:30:09,700 --> 01:30:12,100
My name is Regina Perlman,
not Elsa Krause.

919
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:15,600
I've been living in Krakow
on false papers since the ghetto massacre.

920
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:17,220
My parents are in Plaszow.

921
01:30:17,300 --> 01:30:21,620
Their names are
Chana and Jakob Perlman.

922
01:30:21,700 --> 01:30:25,220
They are older people. They are killing
older people now in Plaszow.

923
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:29,420
They bury them
up in the forest. Look...

924
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:32,100
...I don't have any money.

925
01:30:32,180 --> 01:30:35,480
I, I borrowed these clothes.

926
01:30:37,540 --> 01:30:39,540
I'm begging you.

927
01:30:39,620 --> 01:30:43,280
Please, please
bring them here.

928
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:45,760
I don't do that.

929
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:49,400
You've been misled.
I ask one thing:

930
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:52,860
Whether or not a worker
has certain skills.

931
01:30:52,940 --> 01:30:55,340
My father is an importer,
not a metalworker.

932
01:30:55,380 --> 01:30:59,740
Such activities are illegal.
You will not entrap me!

933
01:30:59,820 --> 01:31:03,780
Cry, and I will have you arrested.
I swear to God!

934
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:15,620
People die.
It's a fact of life.

935
01:31:15,700 --> 01:31:19,180
He wants to kill everybody? Great!
What am I supposed to do about it?

936
01:31:19,260 --> 01:31:21,900
Bring everybody over?
Is that what you think?

937
01:31:21,980 --> 01:31:24,800
Send them over to Schindler.
Send them all!

938
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:28,500
His place is a haven,
didn't you know? It's not a factory.

939
01:31:28,580 --> 01:31:30,740
It's not an enterprise
of any kind.

940
01:31:30,820 --> 01:31:33,420
It's a haven for rabbis
and orphans...

941
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:36,820
...and people with
no skills whatsoever!

942
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:40,980
You think
I don't know what you're doing?

943
01:31:41,060 --> 01:31:44,500
You're so quiet all the time.
I know, I know!

944
01:31:44,580 --> 01:31:47,180
- Are you losing money?
- That's not the point!

945
01:31:47,260 --> 01:31:52,320
- What other point is...
- It's dangerous! It's dangerous to me!

946
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:58,580
You have to understand.
Goeth is under enormous pressure.

947
01:31:58,660 --> 01:32:01,780
You have to think of it
in his situation.

948
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:04,660
He's got this
whole place to run.

949
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:07,340
He's responsible
for everything here, all these people.

950
01:32:07,420 --> 01:32:10,620
He's got a lot of things
to worry about.

951
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:14,500
And he's got the war
which brings out the worst in people.

952
01:32:14,580 --> 01:32:17,940
Never the good, always the bad.
Always the bad.

953
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:24,500
But in normal circumstances he
wouldn't be like this. He'd be all right.

954
01:32:24,580 --> 01:32:27,900
There'd just be the good
aspects of him which...

955
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:31,540
He's a wonderful crook.

956
01:32:31,620 --> 01:32:35,820
A man who loves good food,
good wine, the ladies, making money...

957
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:38,100
Killing!

958
01:32:38,180 --> 01:32:40,820
He can't enjoy it.

959
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:43,860
Bejski told me the other day,
somebody escaped...

960
01:32:43,940 --> 01:32:46,840
...from a work detail
outside the wire.

961
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:50,460
Goeth lined up everybody
from the missing man's barracks.

962
01:32:50,540 --> 01:32:54,340
He shot the man to the left of Bejski,
the man to the right of him.

963
01:32:54,380 --> 01:32:58,140
He walked down the line shooting
every other man with a pistol.

964
01:33:03,020 --> 01:33:05,420
Twenty-five!

965
01:33:09,180 --> 01:33:12,700
- What do you want me to do about it?
- Nothing, nothing.

966
01:33:12,780 --> 01:33:15,020
We're just talking.

967
01:33:26,420 --> 01:33:28,060
"Perlman. "

968
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:31,620
Perlman!

969
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:34,380
Husband and wife.

970
01:33:34,460 --> 01:33:38,480
Jakob and Chana Perlman!

971
01:33:50,820 --> 01:33:53,980
Have Goldberg bring them over.

972
01:33:55,780 --> 01:33:59,060
<i>Caps off!</i>

973
01:33:59,140 --> 01:34:01,180
<i>Ready for inspection!</i>

974
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:50,900
I'm sure this will be better
than those rags, Lisiek.

975
01:34:50,980 --> 01:34:54,640
Mr. Director, I was just
helping Lisiek to find something...

976
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:57,620
...to clean the stains
from the Commander's bathtub.

977
01:34:57,700 --> 01:35:00,500
- Go clean it.
- Pardon me, Sir!

978
01:35:03,940 --> 01:35:07,120
You don't have to report to me, Helen.

979
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:09,980
You know who I am?

980
01:35:17,740 --> 01:35:20,900
I'm Schindler.

981
01:35:20,980 --> 01:35:24,360
Of course. I, I have heard and...

982
01:35:24,540 --> 01:35:27,560
...you have been here before.

983
01:35:29,260 --> 01:35:31,940
Here, why don't you
keep this someplace?

984
01:35:32,020 --> 01:35:35,380
- Go on, take it.
- I get extra food here.

985
01:35:35,460 --> 01:35:40,660
Well, if you don't want to eat it,
trade it. Or give it to Lisiek.

986
01:35:42,660 --> 01:35:44,940
Why not build yourself up?

987
01:35:49,240 --> 01:35:53,000
My first day here, he beat me...

988
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:56,940
...because I threw out
the bones from dinner.

989
01:35:59,860 --> 01:36:04,340
He came down to the basement
at midnight, and he...

990
01:36:04,420 --> 01:36:07,020
...he asked me where they were.

991
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:13,820
For his dogs, you understand?

992
01:36:15,780 --> 01:36:19,900
I said to him, I,
I don't know how I say this.

993
01:36:19,980 --> 01:36:23,340
I never could say it now,
I said to him...

994
01:36:23,420 --> 01:36:26,700
..."Why are you beating me?"

995
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:32,380
He said, "The reason
I beat you now...

996
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:36,520
...is because you ask
why I beat you. "

997
01:36:38,020 --> 01:36:40,860
I know your sufferings, Helen.

998
01:36:43,180 --> 01:36:45,500
It doesn't matter.

999
01:36:47,180 --> 01:36:49,980
I have accepted them.

1000
01:36:50,060 --> 01:36:52,220
Accepted them?

1001
01:36:53,980 --> 01:36:55,660
One day he will shoot me.

1002
01:36:55,700 --> 01:36:58,460
No, no, no, no,
he won't shoot you.

1003
01:36:58,540 --> 01:37:02,060
I know. I see things.

1004
01:37:02,140 --> 01:37:05,500
We were on the roof on Monday,
young Lisiek and I...

1005
01:37:05,580 --> 01:37:09,340
and we saw the Commander
come out of the front door and...

1006
01:37:09,420 --> 01:37:14,060
...and down the steps by the patio
right there below us and...

1007
01:37:14,140 --> 01:37:18,860
...and there on the steps
he drew his gun and he...

1008
01:37:18,940 --> 01:37:22,140
...shot a woman
who was passing by.

1009
01:37:23,180 --> 01:37:26,280
A woman carrying a bundle.
Through the throat.

1010
01:37:26,360 --> 01:37:29,900
Just-Just a woman
on her way somewhere, you know.

1011
01:37:29,980 --> 01:37:33,540
She was no fatter or thinner...

1012
01:37:33,620 --> 01:37:35,940
...or slower or faster
than anyone else...

1013
01:37:36,020 --> 01:37:40,920
...and I couldn't guess
what had she done.

1014
01:37:44,180 --> 01:37:47,500
The more you see
of the Commander...

1015
01:37:47,580 --> 01:37:52,600
...the more you see there is
no set rules that you can live by.

1016
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:58,520
You can't say to yourself,
"If I follow these rules, I will be safe. "

1017
01:38:00,860 --> 01:38:04,940
He won't shoot you
because he enjoys you too much.

1018
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:09,040
He enjoys you so much
he won't even let you wear the star.

1019
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:14,240
He doesn't want anyone else
to know, it's a Jew he's enjoying.

1020
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:23,620
He shot the woman from the steps
because she meant nothing to him.

1021
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:29,800
She was one of a series
neither offending or pleasing him.

1022
01:38:32,180 --> 01:38:35,220
But you, Helen!

1023
01:38:38,940 --> 01:38:44,000
It's all right.
It's not that kind of a kiss.

1024
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:50,540
Thank you!

1025
01:38:55,140 --> 01:38:56,940
Here!

1026
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:04,940
Right, the wine!

1027
01:39:11,580 --> 01:39:15,160
Wonderful party, Amon.
Thank you.

1028
01:39:22,580 --> 01:39:25,880
Why do you drink that motor oil?

1029
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:28,620
I send you
good stuff all the time.

1030
01:39:28,700 --> 01:39:32,460
Your liver's going to explode
like a hand grenade.

1031
01:39:32,540 --> 01:39:35,180
You know, I look at you...

1032
01:39:35,260 --> 01:39:37,660
...I watch you!

1033
01:39:39,940 --> 01:39:41,260
You're never drunk.

1034
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:44,800
Oh, that's...

1035
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:47,840
...that's real control.

1036
01:39:48,020 --> 01:39:50,300
Control is power.

1037
01:39:51,100 --> 01:39:53,500
That's power.

1038
01:39:56,980 --> 01:40:00,900
Is that why they fear us?

1039
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:05,460
We have the fucking power to kill,
that's why they fear us.

1040
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:09,300
They fear us because
we have the power to kill arbitrarily.

1041
01:40:09,380 --> 01:40:11,440
A man commits a crime,
he should know better.

1042
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:14,060
We have him killed,
and we feel pretty good about it.

1043
01:40:14,140 --> 01:40:18,200
Or we kill him ourselves
and we feel even better.

1044
01:40:19,260 --> 01:40:22,060
That's not power, though.

1045
01:40:22,140 --> 01:40:26,680
That's justice.
It's different than power.

1046
01:40:28,940 --> 01:40:33,900
Power is when we have
every justification to kill...

1047
01:40:33,980 --> 01:40:36,460
...and we don't.

1048
01:40:36,540 --> 01:40:39,200
You think that's power?

1049
01:40:40,980 --> 01:40:44,100
That's what the emperors had.
A man stole something...

1050
01:40:44,180 --> 01:40:45,680
...he's brought in
before the emperor...

1051
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:49,740
...he throws himself
down on the ground, he begs for mercy.

1052
01:40:49,820 --> 01:40:53,220
He knows he's going to die.

1053
01:40:55,060 --> 01:40:59,120
And the emperor, pardons him.

1054
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:03,560
This worthless man.
He lets him go.

1055
01:41:05,980 --> 01:41:08,860
I think you are drunk.

1056
01:41:09,860 --> 01:41:12,740
That's power, Amon.

1057
01:41:12,820 --> 01:41:16,620
That, is power!

1058
01:41:23,380 --> 01:41:27,140
Amon the good!

1059
01:41:28,980 --> 01:41:31,900
I pardon you!

1060
01:41:38,860 --> 01:41:39,920
What do they want?

1061
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,240
I don't know, but they're in my office
right now reviewing our books.

1062
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:46,540
As my accountant, tell me,
should I be alarmed...

1063
01:41:46,620 --> 01:41:49,165
...that the auditors
are reviewing my books?

1064
01:41:49,200 --> 01:41:51,820
- Or have you done your job properly?
- You needn't be alarmed.

1065
01:41:51,900 --> 01:41:54,020
I needn't be alarmed!

1066
01:41:58,200 --> 01:42:01,080
-I'm sorry, sir.
-Do you know how much this saddle is worth?

1067
01:42:01,140 --> 01:42:04,400
Do you know how much it costs?

1068
01:42:08,260 --> 01:42:10,180
All right!

1069
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:13,780
All right!

1070
01:42:16,980 --> 01:42:20,520
Stern, what the hell are you
doing following me around?

1071
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:32,100
<i>Barracks one, eleven...</i>

1072
01:42:32,180 --> 01:42:34,620
<i>...fifteen and thirty-two...</i>

1073
01:42:34,700 --> 01:42:37,680
<i>...apply to inspection area.</i>

1074
01:43:05,540 --> 01:43:08,040
She was smoking on the job.

1075
01:43:10,660 --> 01:43:13,720
Tell her not to do it again.

1076
01:43:28,180 --> 01:43:31,180
I have to report, sir...

1077
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:35,780
...I've been unable to remove
the stains from your bathtub.

1078
01:43:38,900 --> 01:43:42,900
- What are you using, Lisiek?
- Soap, Commander.

1079
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:47,600
Soap? Not lye?

1080
01:43:55,940 --> 01:44:00,000
Go ahead, go on, leave.
Leave, I pardon you.

1081
01:44:20,980 --> 01:44:23,560
I pardon you!

1082
01:46:10,260 --> 01:46:13,740
Although I am not a rabbi,
in these circumstances...

1083
01:46:13,820 --> 01:46:16,420
...I pray to the Almighty
that he will forgive me...

1084
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:19,460
...if I intone the blessings.

1085
01:47:09,740 --> 01:47:11,980
So...

1086
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:16,180
...this is where you come
to hide from me.

1087
01:47:16,460 --> 01:47:19,660
I came to tell you...

1088
01:47:19,940 --> 01:47:26,400
...that you, um, you really are
a wonderful cook and a well-trained servant.

1089
01:47:26,420 --> 01:47:30,660
I mean it. If you need a reference
after the war...

1090
01:47:30,740 --> 01:47:35,840
...I'd be, I'd be happy
to give you one.

1091
01:47:36,420 --> 01:47:38,100
It must get lonely down here
when you're..

1092
01:47:38,180 --> 01:47:43,000
...listening to everyone upstairs
having such a good time.

1093
01:47:48,980 --> 01:47:51,140
Does it?

1094
01:47:52,820 --> 01:47:55,140
You can answer.

1095
01:47:56,980 --> 01:48:01,220
But what's the right answer?
That's what you're thinking:

1096
01:48:01,300 --> 01:48:04,180
"What does he want to hear?"

1097
01:48:09,140 --> 01:48:14,040
The truth, Helen,
is always the right answer.

1098
01:48:15,700 --> 01:48:18,180
Yes, you're right.

1099
01:48:18,260 --> 01:48:21,540
Sometimes
we're both lonely.

1100
01:48:21,620 --> 01:48:24,500
Yes. I...

1101
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:28,620
...I mean...

1102
01:48:34,580 --> 01:48:37,860
...I would like so much to...

1103
01:48:37,940 --> 01:48:42,300
...reach out and touch you
in your loneliness.

1104
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:46,300
Wh- what would that be like,
I wonder? I mean...

1105
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:49,240
...what would be wrong with that?

1106
01:48:49,320 --> 01:48:52,900
I realize that you're not
a-a person in the...

1107
01:48:52,980 --> 01:48:56,980
...the strictest sense
of the word, but...

1108
01:48:57,360 --> 01:49:00,500
No, maybe you're right
about that too, you know, maybe what's...

1109
01:49:00,680 --> 01:49:03,940
...what's wrong isn't...

1110
01:49:04,020 --> 01:49:06,500
...it's not us!

1111
01:49:06,580 --> 01:49:08,900
It's, no, it's this!

1112
01:49:11,220 --> 01:49:15,200
I mean, when they
compare you to...

1113
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:19,280
...to, uh, vermin
and to rodents and to lice...

1114
01:49:21,900 --> 01:49:24,280
...I just, uh...

1115
01:49:26,740 --> 01:49:29,580
No, no, you,
you make a good point.

1116
01:49:29,660 --> 01:49:32,920
You make a very good point.

1117
01:49:40,020 --> 01:49:43,240
Is this the face of a rat?

1118
01:49:45,340 --> 01:49:49,300
Are these the eyes of a rat?

1119
01:49:50,820 --> 01:49:53,900
Hath not a Jew eyes?

1120
01:50:08,220 --> 01:50:13,180
I feel for you, Helen.

1121
01:50:28,360 --> 01:50:31,380
No, I don't think so.

1122
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:36,000
You're a Jewish bitch!

1123
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:41,540
You nearly talked me into it,
didn't you?

1124
01:50:45,780 --> 01:50:48,260
Bravo!

1125
01:51:09,260 --> 01:51:12,980
-Bravo!
- Cheers! Cheers!

1126
01:51:21,140 --> 01:51:27,260
On behalf of the, of the workers, sir,
I, I wish for you a happy birthday.

1127
01:51:27,340 --> 01:51:28,900
Happy birthday!

1128
01:51:28,980 --> 01:51:30,440
Well, the staff, please.

1129
01:51:30,520 --> 01:51:34,380
Thank you very much
for the lovely cake.

1130
01:51:52,060 --> 01:51:56,360
Thank you very much.
Tell them "Thank you" from me.

1131
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:15,380
The trains arrived and the people
were driven out with clubs.

1132
01:52:15,460 --> 01:52:19,440
They were lined up in front
of two big warehouses.

1133
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:23,340
One was marked "Cloak Room"
and the other "Valuables. "

1134
01:52:23,420 --> 01:52:25,740
And there they
were made to undress.

1135
01:52:25,820 --> 01:52:30,180
A Jewish boy handed them pieces
of string to tie their shoes together.

1136
01:52:30,660 --> 01:52:32,820
They shaved their hair.

1137
01:52:32,900 --> 01:52:37,620
They told them it was needed to make
something special for U-boat crews.

1138
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:41,780
And then they were herded
down a big corridor...

1139
01:52:41,860 --> 01:52:45,780
...to bunkers with
Stars of David on the doors...

1140
01:52:45,860 --> 01:52:49,620
...and signs that said
"Bath and Inhalation Room"

1141
01:52:49,700 --> 01:52:51,820
SS gave them soap.

1142
01:52:51,900 --> 01:52:57,420
They told them to breathe all the time
because it's good for disinfecting.

1143
01:52:57,500 --> 01:53:00,680
And then they gassed them.

1144
01:53:00,860 --> 01:53:03,900
Mila, why soaps?

1145
01:53:03,980 --> 01:53:05,800
So that they would agree
to go in, I think.

1146
01:53:05,880 --> 01:53:09,500
Come on, Mila, stop it.
Your bedtime stories are scaring everyone.

1147
01:53:09,580 --> 01:53:11,940
- I just don't believe it.
-Ja. You know it's ridiculous.

1148
01:53:12,020 --> 01:53:13,980
- I don't believe it either.
- I cannot believe it.

1149
01:53:14,060 --> 01:53:17,380
-I didn't say I believed it. I said I heard it.
-From who?

1150
01:53:17,460 --> 01:53:20,080
From somebody who heard it
from someone who was there.

1151
01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:24,640
You know, if they were there,
they would have been gassed.

1152
01:53:24,900 --> 01:53:27,940
- Yes!
- It doesn't make any sense.

1153
01:53:28,020 --> 01:53:30,020
We're their workforce.

1154
01:53:30,100 --> 01:53:33,700
What sense does it make
to kill your own workforce?

1155
01:53:33,780 --> 01:53:38,500
To go to all this trouble
of assembling a workforce only to...

1156
01:53:38,580 --> 01:53:41,840
No, it can't be true.

1157
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:44,920
We are very, very
important for them.

1158
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:47,940
Yes, we do now!
Goodnight.

1159
01:53:48,020 --> 01:53:51,400
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight. Sweet dreams.

1160
01:53:59,540 --> 01:54:02,060
<i>Attention, attention!</i>

1161
01:54:02,140 --> 01:54:04,420
<i>Everyone who is alive...</i>

1162
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:07,900
<i>...is to come to the roll-call area!</i>

1163
01:54:07,980 --> 01:54:12,260
- Attention, attention!
- We have to go to the roll-call area!

1164
01:54:12,340 --> 01:54:14,020
- Everyone who is alive...
The list makers are here.

1165
01:54:14,060 --> 01:54:16,660
- ... is to come to the roll-call area.
- There is going to be a selection.

1166
01:54:16,700 --> 01:54:20,980
<i>Attention, attention.
Everyone who is alive...</i>

1167
01:54:21,060 --> 01:54:24,820
<i>...is to come to the roll-call area!</i>

1168
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:40,300
-Gentlemen!
-Gentlemen!

1169
01:54:44,100 --> 01:54:46,140
100.000 Hungarian is coming.

1170
01:54:48,180 --> 01:54:51,940
<i>All stand in a single row!</i>

1171
01:54:52,020 --> 01:54:55,940
You could afford
to lose some weight, Amon.

1172
01:54:56,020 --> 01:54:58,500
And you've got to
cut down on the cognac.

1173
01:54:58,580 --> 01:55:01,380
Morning.
What's going on?

1174
01:55:01,460 --> 01:55:04,260
It's another
semi-annual physical.

1175
01:55:06,060 --> 01:55:10,660
- There!
-I've got another shipment coming in of...

1176
01:55:10,740 --> 01:55:12,780
What are they this time?

1177
01:55:12,860 --> 01:55:14,740
- Hungarians.
- Oh, yeah, Hungarians!

1178
01:55:14,820 --> 01:55:19,160
We've got to separate the sick
from the healthy to make room.

1179
01:56:14,660 --> 01:56:16,220
Look alive, Rebeka.

1180
01:56:16,300 --> 01:56:18,300
<i>Quicker!</i>

1181
01:56:38,100 --> 01:56:40,580
That's my mechanic.

1182
01:56:40,860 --> 01:56:44,180
Whose bright idea was it
to get rid of him?

1183
01:57:44,500 --> 01:57:47,360
No, no, no!
Wait, go away. She can work.

1184
01:57:47,440 --> 01:57:51,020
Come here. Look,
separate the sick from the healthy.

1185
01:57:51,100 --> 01:57:53,380
Those who can work
and those who can't. She can work.

1186
01:57:53,420 --> 01:57:57,580
You can work, you can come.

1187
01:58:34,860 --> 01:58:37,180
<i>On your feet!
On your feet!</i>

1188
01:59:19,180 --> 01:59:24,380
Those not selected for transport,
put your clothes back on.

1189
01:59:24,460 --> 01:59:29,260
- Go back to the barracks.
- Return to the barracks.

1190
01:59:34,600 --> 01:59:36,660
<i>Go back to the barracks!</i>

1191
01:59:40,020 --> 01:59:42,540
Oh, my God!

1192
02:00:03,660 --> 02:00:07,900
- Olek? Olek?
- Danka?

1193
02:00:07,980 --> 02:00:12,740
Olek? Olek?

1194
02:00:12,820 --> 02:00:16,140
Olek! Olek!

1195
02:00:22,140 --> 02:00:24,940
- Olek?
- Danka?

1196
02:00:25,020 --> 02:00:26,860
- Danka?
- Olek?

1197
02:00:26,940 --> 02:00:29,860
Back to the barracks!
Go back to your barracks!

1198
02:00:30,440 --> 02:00:33,780
- I didn't see him!
- They're hiding. I'm telling you, they're hiding.

1199
02:00:33,860 --> 02:00:37,260
I know Danka. She knows a good place.
She took all of them together.

1200
02:00:37,340 --> 02:00:39,940
<i>Back to the barracks!</i>

1201
02:00:58,700 --> 02:01:04,140
Find your own hiding place. There's
no room for you here. Go away, quick!

1202
02:01:26,660 --> 02:01:30,240
Get out. This is our place.
Get out!

1203
02:01:52,380 --> 02:01:55,580
- Oskar!
- Amon! Gentlemen!

1204
02:01:55,660 --> 02:01:58,860
- Why didn't you call me?
- I tried to call you. Here, Hujar, move.

1205
02:01:58,940 --> 02:02:01,620
- Quite a picnic, huh? Madritsch!
- Oskar!

1206
02:02:01,700 --> 02:02:04,340
They're running a little late.
It's taking longer than I thought.

1207
02:02:04,420 --> 02:02:07,180
- A drink?
- Something cold. Bowle.

1208
02:02:07,220 --> 02:02:09,740
The Bowle!

1209
02:02:11,340 --> 02:02:14,420
Oh, another beautiful day.

1210
02:02:27,020 --> 02:02:29,360
The loading of the
transport wagons is finished.

1211
02:02:29,395 --> 02:02:31,700
We can start!

1212
02:02:31,780 --> 02:02:34,140
Water! Water!

1213
02:02:34,220 --> 02:02:37,180
Water, water!

1214
02:02:44,280 --> 02:02:47,060
- To your health!
- Oh, thank you.

1215
02:02:52,700 --> 02:02:57,740
What do you say we get your fire hoses out
here and hose down the cars? Thank you.

1216
02:03:00,580 --> 02:03:02,660
Indulge me!

1217
02:03:04,040 --> 02:03:05,720
- Hujar!
- Yes, sir!

1218
02:03:05,800 --> 02:03:09,680
- Go bring the fire hoses.
- Where's the fire?

1219
02:03:12,660 --> 02:03:16,140
<i>In the windows.
That's it, that's it.</i>

1220
02:03:16,220 --> 02:03:20,180
<i>On the roof. That's it, good, good.
In the window, in the window.</i>

1221
02:03:23,140 --> 02:03:26,660
Come on. Come on.

1222
02:03:26,740 --> 02:03:28,580
That's it, more, more!

1223
02:03:33,300 --> 02:03:36,420
That's it, that's it.
More, more!

1224
02:03:36,500 --> 02:03:40,000
This is really cruel, Oskar.
You are giving them hope.

1225
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:43,700
You shouldn't do that.
That's cruel!

1226
02:03:43,780 --> 02:03:47,140
Come on, try and
reach the far end. Look out!

1227
02:03:47,220 --> 02:03:50,100
<i>Water!- More water!</i>

1228
02:03:53,560 --> 02:03:56,060
I've got some 200 metre
hoses back in Emalia.

1229
02:03:56,140 --> 02:03:57,980
I have 20 metres
at home in my garden.

1230
02:03:58,060 --> 02:04:00,140
We can reach the cars at the end.

1231
02:04:00,220 --> 02:04:02,580
What? What?

1232
02:04:06,860 --> 02:04:09,460
- Hujar!
- Yeah, sure.

1233
02:04:27,200 --> 02:04:29,420
Don't forget the roof!

1234
02:04:29,500 --> 02:04:32,180
On the roof
on the other side.

1235
02:04:32,260 --> 02:04:36,420
<i>Water!</i>

1236
02:04:38,780 --> 02:04:41,500
Lieutenant,
every time the train stops...

1237
02:04:41,580 --> 02:04:43,200
...you open the doors,
you give them water, yeah?

1238
02:04:43,280 --> 02:04:46,380
- Okay!
- Okay!. This car! This car!

1239
02:05:09,900 --> 02:05:13,100
I'm not saying you'll
regret it, but you might.

1240
02:05:13,180 --> 02:05:17,780
- You should be aware of that.
- We will have to risk regret.

1241
02:05:17,860 --> 02:05:22,040
All right, sure. It's a nice day.
I'll go for a drive with you.

1242
02:05:55,900 --> 02:05:57,740
What about you?

1243
02:05:57,820 --> 02:06:01,260
I violated
the Race and Resettlement Act.

1244
02:06:01,440 --> 02:06:05,420
Though I doubt anyone can point out
the actual provision to me.

1245
02:06:05,500 --> 02:06:08,700
I kissed a Jewish girl.

1246
02:06:12,220 --> 02:06:15,020
Did your prick fall off?

1247
02:06:32,820 --> 02:06:35,880
<i>He likes women.</i>

1248
02:06:36,860 --> 02:06:40,800
He likes good-looking women.

1249
02:06:41,420 --> 02:06:45,540
He sees a beautiful woman,
he doesn't think.

1250
02:06:47,980 --> 02:06:50,940
I mean,
he has so many women.

1251
02:06:51,020 --> 02:06:53,060
And they love him.

1252
02:06:53,140 --> 02:06:56,020
Yeah, they love him.
I mean, he is married, yeah, but he's...

1253
02:06:57,300 --> 02:07:01,020
All right, no. She was Jewish.
He shouldn't have done it.

1254
02:07:01,100 --> 02:07:04,660
But you didn't see this girl.

1255
02:07:04,740 --> 02:07:08,020
I saw this girl.
This girl was, woof...

1256
02:07:08,100 --> 02:07:10,300
...she was very good-looking.

1257
02:07:14,100 --> 02:07:16,480
They cast a spell on you,
you know, the Jews.

1258
02:07:16,560 --> 02:07:18,820
When you work closely with them,
like I do, you see this.

1259
02:07:18,900 --> 02:07:22,680
They have this power. It's like a virus.
Some of my men are infected with this virus.

1260
02:07:22,760 --> 02:07:24,900
They should be pitied, not punished.
They should receive treatment.

1261
02:07:24,980 --> 02:07:27,860
This is as real as typhus.
I see this all the time.

1262
02:07:27,940 --> 02:07:31,260
It's a matter of money?

1263
02:07:31,440 --> 02:07:33,940
You're offering me a bribe?

1264
02:07:35,380 --> 02:07:40,780
A bribe? No. No, please.
It's a gratuity.

1265
02:07:40,860 --> 02:07:42,060
Heil Hitler!

1266
02:07:46,340 --> 02:07:48,500
Hello, Amon!

1267
02:07:51,880 --> 02:07:53,500
Sit down!

1268
02:07:55,660 --> 02:07:59,180
We give you Jewish girls
at five marks a day, Oskar.

1269
02:07:59,260 --> 02:08:01,420
You should kiss us, not them.

1270
02:08:01,500 --> 02:08:05,220
God forbid you ever get
a real taste for Jewish skirt.

1271
02:08:05,300 --> 02:08:08,580
There's no future in it.
They don't have a future.

1272
02:08:09,160 --> 02:08:13,300
That's not just good,
old-fashioned, Jew-hating talk.

1273
02:08:13,380 --> 02:08:16,100
It's policy now.

1274
02:08:16,850 --> 02:08:20,650
<i>Yeah, beautiful, good!</i>

1275
02:08:26,130 --> 02:08:30,170
-Again, yes!
-Good!

1276
02:08:59,970 --> 02:09:01,170
<i>Come on faster!</i>

1277
02:09:01,250 --> 02:09:05,010
<i>Be quick!</i>

1278
02:09:05,090 --> 02:09:07,330
<i>Move your ass!</i>

1279
02:09:09,210 --> 02:09:10,490
It could be done quicker!

1280
02:09:10,570 --> 02:09:12,810
<i>Hurry up, don't sleep!</i>

1281
02:09:12,890 --> 02:09:16,850
<i>Only the whole pieces,
leave the small parts!</i>

1282
02:09:22,450 --> 02:09:23,970
What's going on here?

1283
02:09:24,050 --> 02:09:26,250
You can do it with your hands,
quick!

1284
02:09:27,030 --> 02:09:28,150
Come here!

1285
02:09:28,230 --> 02:09:30,570
Only the whole pieces,
leave the fucking small parts!

1286
02:09:40,270 --> 02:09:44,070
<i>Now you better make it quick,
get rid of this shit!</i>

1287
02:09:52,230 --> 02:09:56,530
That's it! Immortals!
Immortals are all around!

1288
02:10:01,050 --> 02:10:02,890
<i>Can you believe this?</i>

1289
02:10:02,970 --> 02:10:06,030
As if I don't have enough to do,
they come up with this?

1290
02:10:06,110 --> 02:10:10,350
I have to find every rag
buried up here and burn it.

1291
02:10:11,530 --> 02:10:14,450
The party's over, Oskar. They're closing
us down, sending everybody to Auschwitz.

1292
02:10:14,451 --> 02:10:15,851
-When?
-I don't know.

1293
02:10:15,930 --> 02:10:17,130
As soon as
I can arrange the shipments.

1294
02:10:17,210 --> 02:10:21,250
Maybe 30, 40 days.
That ought to be fun.

1295
02:10:40,870 --> 02:10:43,470
- I've been talking to Goeth.
- I know the destination.

1296
02:10:43,550 --> 02:10:46,110
These are the evacuation orders.

1297
02:10:46,190 --> 02:10:49,070
I'm to help organize the shipments,
put myself on the last train.

1298
02:10:49,150 --> 02:10:52,150
That's not what
I was going to say.

1299
02:10:52,230 --> 02:10:55,850
I made Goeth promise me
he'll put in a good word for you.

1300
02:10:55,930 --> 02:10:59,170
Nothing bad is going to happen to you
there. You'll receive special treatment.

1301
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:03,040
The directives coming in from Berlin
mention "Special Treatment" more and more often.

1302
02:11:03,120 --> 02:11:07,300
- I'd like to think that's not what you mean.
- Preferential treatment, alright?

1303
02:11:07,380 --> 02:11:12,160
- Should we invent a whole new language?
- I think so.

1304
02:11:14,260 --> 02:11:16,840
You're staying, I take it.

1305
02:11:19,900 --> 02:11:25,100
- In Krakow? What on earth for?
- What for? You have a business to run.

1306
02:11:25,680 --> 02:11:27,720
Of course, you'll have
to hire new workers. Poles, I guess.

1307
02:11:27,800 --> 02:11:31,320
They cost a little more, but...

1308
02:11:32,960 --> 02:11:35,640
What are you going to do?

1309
02:11:38,320 --> 02:11:41,320
You ran my business.

1310
02:11:43,980 --> 02:11:46,060
No, I'm going home.

1311
02:11:46,140 --> 02:11:52,080
I've done what I came here for. I've got
more money than any man can spend in a lifetime.

1312
02:12:01,480 --> 02:12:07,300
Some day, this is all
going to end, you know.

1313
02:12:10,240 --> 02:12:13,580
I was going to say
we'll have a drink then.

1314
02:12:16,960 --> 02:12:20,400
I think I better have it now.

1315
02:13:51,760 --> 02:13:55,800
I don't understand.
I mean, you want these people?

1316
02:13:55,880 --> 02:13:58,360
"These people"?
My people, I want my people.

1317
02:13:58,440 --> 02:14:01,320
Who are you, Moses?
Come on, what is this?

1318
02:14:01,400 --> 02:14:02,840
Where's the money in this?
Where's the scam?

1319
02:14:02,841 --> 02:14:04,141
It's good business.

1320
02:14:04,220 --> 02:14:05,920
It's good business
in your opinion.

1321
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:10,560
Look, you've got to move them,
the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia.

1322
02:14:10,640 --> 02:14:13,720
Pay for all that and build another camp.
Doesn't make any sense.

1323
02:14:13,800 --> 02:14:16,920
- Look, Amon, it's good for me...
- You're not telling me something.

1324
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,680
I know them. I'm familiar with them.
I don't have to train them.

1325
02:14:19,760 --> 02:14:21,780
- You're not telling me something.
- It's good for you. I'll compensate you.

1326
02:14:21,860 --> 02:14:24,280
- That's right.
- It's good for the army.

1327
02:14:24,360 --> 02:14:26,800
- You know what I'm going to make?
- What?

1328
02:14:26,880 --> 02:14:29,140
- Artillery shells.
- Everyone is making artillery shells.

1329
02:14:29,220 --> 02:14:30,960
- Tank shells, they need that.
- Tanks shells, yeah!

1330
02:14:31,040 --> 02:14:33,480
- Everybody's happy.
- Everyone's happy, except me.

1331
02:14:33,560 --> 02:14:36,440
You're probably
scamming me somehow.

1332
02:14:36,520 --> 02:14:39,400
If I'm making a hundred,
you've got to be making three.

1333
02:14:39,480 --> 02:14:42,720
And if you admit to making three,
then it's four actually. But how?

1334
02:14:42,800 --> 02:14:46,400
- I just told you.
- You did, but you didn't.

1335
02:14:48,420 --> 02:14:50,520
Yeah, all right, don't tell me.

1336
02:14:50,600 --> 02:14:54,680
I'll go along with it.
It's just irritating I can't work it out.

1337
02:14:54,760 --> 02:14:59,320
Look, all you have to do
is tell me what it's worth to you.

1338
02:14:59,400 --> 02:15:01,960
- What's a person worth to you?
- No, no, no, no.

1339
02:15:02,040 --> 02:15:05,380
What's one worth to you?

1340
02:15:12,480 --> 02:15:16,760
Poldek Pfefferberg,
Mila Pfefferberg...

1341
02:15:16,840 --> 02:15:19,280
...and uh...

1342
02:15:20,060 --> 02:15:21,640
...uh, Stagel, Stagel...

1343
02:15:21,720 --> 02:15:23,200
- Paul.
- Paul! Paul Stagel.

1344
02:15:23,680 --> 02:15:25,800
Doctor...

1345
02:15:26,980 --> 02:15:30,600
- The investors. I want all of them.
- Yes, sir.

1346
02:15:30,680 --> 02:15:33,440
Uh, Fischer. Ismail Fischer.

1347
02:15:33,475 --> 02:15:36,440
Fischer, Ismail.

1348
02:15:36,520 --> 02:15:39,960
- Josef Scharf.
- One moment, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

1349
02:15:40,040 --> 02:15:42,500
Come on, Stern.
Scharf, Scharf.

1350
02:15:44,860 --> 02:15:48,820
The children,
all the children!

1351
02:15:52,400 --> 02:15:54,440
- Herbert Stier.
- Thank you.

1352
02:15:54,520 --> 02:15:58,900
- How many?
- 400, 450.

1353
02:16:00,840 --> 02:16:03,500
More, more!

1354
02:16:08,680 --> 02:16:10,360
Good morning.

1355
02:16:25,720 --> 02:16:30,840
- Feigenbaum, Jakob.
- Wolf. Wolf Wein.

1356
02:16:34,920 --> 02:16:39,580
Feigenbaum: Lutek, Jakob, Nacha.
Yes? Nacha.

1357
02:16:39,660 --> 02:16:41,400
Nacha, that's right.

1358
02:16:41,580 --> 02:16:43,340
And Wolf.

1359
02:16:43,420 --> 02:16:45,720
How many?

1360
02:16:47,240 --> 02:16:50,780
- 600.
- More!

1361
02:16:51,960 --> 02:16:53,160
You can do
the same thing I'm doing.

1362
02:16:53,240 --> 02:16:55,840
- You might even make money at it.
- I don't know.

1363
02:16:55,920 --> 02:16:59,040
Come on, Julius, I know about
the extra food and clothes you give them.

1364
02:16:59,080 --> 02:17:01,640
Paid for out of your own pocket.
If we make a combined approach...

1365
02:17:01,720 --> 02:17:03,900
...we could get more than
4,000 out, mine and yours.

1366
02:17:03,901 --> 02:17:05,005
-Oskar!
-We could relocate them...

1367
02:17:05,040 --> 02:17:08,400
...in something like safety,
in Moravia.

1368
02:17:08,780 --> 02:17:10,540
I don't know.

1369
02:17:12,340 --> 02:17:14,960
How many cigarettes
have you smoked tonight?

1370
02:17:14,961 --> 02:17:15,861
Too many!

1371
02:17:15,940 --> 02:17:20,580
For every one you smoke,
I smoke half.

1372
02:17:20,960 --> 02:17:22,800
- I've done all I can.
- I will not accept that.

1373
02:17:22,880 --> 02:17:26,040
- No, Oskar, I can't do any more.
- I will not accept that.

1374
02:17:26,120 --> 02:17:27,720
No!

1375
02:17:37,320 --> 02:17:39,960
- How many? How many?
- 850, give or take.

1376
02:17:40,040 --> 02:17:44,720
Give or take what, Stern?
Count them. How many?

1377
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:57,960
That's it.
You can finish that page.

1378
02:18:01,960 --> 02:18:05,680
What... did... Goeth...
say about this?

1379
02:18:05,760 --> 02:18:10,240
You just told him how
many people you needed and...

1380
02:18:12,440 --> 02:18:15,040
You're not buying them?

1381
02:18:16,880 --> 02:18:19,920
You're buying them? You're
paying him for each of these names?

1382
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:23,320
If you were still working for me,
I'd expect you to talk me out of it.

1383
02:18:23,400 --> 02:18:26,560
It's costing me a fortune.

1384
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:30,820
Finish the page and leave
one space at the bottom.

1385
02:18:51,720 --> 02:18:53,880
You...

1386
02:18:59,240 --> 02:19:03,240
The list is an absolute good.

1387
02:19:03,320 --> 02:19:06,540
The list... is life.

1388
02:19:07,560 --> 02:19:12,760
All around its margins
lies the gulf.

1389
02:19:12,840 --> 02:19:16,600
Oskar, there's a clerical error here
at the bottom of the last page.

1390
02:19:16,680 --> 02:19:19,320
No, there's one more name
I want to put there.

1391
02:19:19,400 --> 02:19:23,680
I'll never find a maid as well trained as her
at Brinnlitz. They are all country girls.

1392
02:19:25,160 --> 02:19:26,520
No!

1393
02:19:35,160 --> 02:19:36,800
No!

1394
02:19:36,880 --> 02:19:38,980
- One hand of twenty-one.
- No!

1395
02:19:39,060 --> 02:19:41,800
- If you win, I pay you 7,400 reichsmarks.
- No!

1396
02:19:41,880 --> 02:19:45,500
- Hit a natural, I make it 14,800.
- No!

1397
02:19:45,580 --> 02:19:48,640
If I win,
the girl goes on my list.

1398
02:19:48,820 --> 02:19:51,880
- I can't wager Helen in a card game.
- Why not?

1399
02:19:51,960 --> 02:19:52,980
Wouldn't be right.

1400
02:19:52,981 --> 02:19:54,681
She's just going to
Auschwitz Number Two, anyway.

1401
02:19:54,720 --> 02:19:56,880
- What difference does it make?
- She's not going to Auschwitz.

1402
02:19:56,920 --> 02:20:01,160
I'd never do that to her. No, I want her
to come back to Vienna with me.

1403
02:20:01,240 --> 02:20:04,160
I want her to come
to work for me there.

1404
02:20:04,240 --> 02:20:08,560
- I want to grow old with her.
- Are you mad?

1405
02:20:08,640 --> 02:20:14,700
- Amon, you can't take her to Vienna with you.
- No, of course I can't.

1406
02:20:15,080 --> 02:20:17,560
That's what I'd like to do.

1407
02:20:17,640 --> 02:20:23,360
What I can do, if I'm any sort of a man,
is the next most merciful thing.

1408
02:20:23,440 --> 02:20:28,240
I shall take her into the woods and shoot
her painlessly in the back of the head.

1409
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:41,240
What was it you said
for a natural 21?

1410
02:20:41,420 --> 02:20:43,680
Was it 14,800?

1411
02:20:43,760 --> 02:20:47,060
<i>Jews of Schindler, to these tables!
Say your names clearly.</i>

1412
02:20:47,120 --> 02:20:50,360
- We are the family Dresner.
-Juda, Jonas...

1413
02:20:50,440 --> 02:20:52,720
...Donata and Chaja.

1414
02:20:52,800 --> 02:20:56,280
- We are Rosners. Henry, Manci...
- And Leo.

1415
02:20:56,360 --> 02:20:59,620
- And our son.
- I am Olek.

1416
02:20:59,700 --> 02:21:01,140
Maria Mischel.

1417
02:21:01,220 --> 02:21:03,960
Chaim Nowak.

1418
02:21:04,040 --> 02:21:06,300
Wulkan, Markus.

1419
02:21:06,380 --> 02:21:08,660
Michael Lemper.

1420
02:21:09,480 --> 02:21:11,560
Itzhak Stern.

1421
02:21:11,840 --> 02:21:14,800
Rebeka and Joseph Bau.

1422
02:21:15,280 --> 02:21:17,480
- Rosalia Nussbaum.
- Wilhelm Nussbaum.

1423
02:21:17,960 --> 02:21:20,240
Jakob Levartov.

1424
02:21:20,820 --> 02:21:23,460
- Farber, Rosa.
- Farber, Andrzej.

1425
02:21:23,540 --> 02:21:26,200
- Sara.
- Friehof, Fischel.

1426
02:21:27,480 --> 02:21:29,300
Mietek Pemper.

1427
02:21:29,380 --> 02:21:31,760
Poldek and Mila Pfefferberg.

1428
02:21:31,840 --> 02:21:34,240
Horowitz, Dolek.

1429
02:21:35,420 --> 02:21:37,280
Adam Levy.

1430
02:21:37,360 --> 02:21:39,520
Marcel Goldberg.

1431
02:21:39,600 --> 02:21:42,920
Klipstein, Isak David.

1432
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:44,840
Altmann, Eduard.

1433
02:21:44,920 --> 02:21:46,920
Grunberg, Miriam.

1434
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
Luftig, Eliasz.

1435
02:21:49,080 --> 02:21:51,040
Hilmann, Eduard.

1436
02:21:51,120 --> 02:21:53,300
Erna Rothberg.

1437
02:21:53,480 --> 02:21:56,300
Zuckermann, Jetti.

1438
02:21:56,580 --> 02:21:59,220
Helen Hirsch.

1439
02:22:00,240 --> 02:22:03,260
The worst is over.

1440
02:22:03,740 --> 02:22:07,700
<i>Men to this transport
and women to this transport.</i>

1441
02:22:07,780 --> 02:22:12,460
<i>Be careful! Men to this transport
and women to this transport.</i>

1442
02:22:12,540 --> 02:22:16,840
<i>Watch your step! Men to this transport
and women to this transport.</i>

1443
02:22:53,300 --> 02:22:57,640
Wonderful Olek, wonderful.

1444
02:22:57,720 --> 02:23:02,280
You know how we make
ice into water?

1445
02:23:02,960 --> 02:23:05,120
Olek, get another one!

1446
02:23:41,880 --> 02:23:44,960
<i>Position yourselves
all in a single row!</i>

1447
02:23:45,140 --> 02:23:49,760
You'll be pleased with the level
of efficiency I get from these workers.

1448
02:23:51,060 --> 02:23:53,140
Budzyn, under my command...

1449
02:23:53,220 --> 02:23:56,000
...was the envy of every other commandant
in the labour camp system.

1450
02:23:56,040 --> 02:23:57,520
- The prisoners, however...
- Excuse me!

1451
02:23:57,560 --> 02:24:00,640
...they would have rather been
somewhere else.

1452
02:24:14,080 --> 02:24:17,260
The train with the women
has already left Plaszow...

1453
02:24:17,340 --> 02:24:20,960
...and will be arriving
here very shortly.

1454
02:24:21,040 --> 02:24:23,640
I know you've had
a long journey.

1455
02:24:23,720 --> 02:24:26,840
But it's only a short walk
further to the factory...

1456
02:24:26,920 --> 02:24:32,120
...where hot soup and bread
is waiting for you.

1457
02:24:32,200 --> 02:24:34,700
Welcome to Brinnlitz!

1458
02:24:43,740 --> 02:24:46,640
- Beans in chunt?
- Beans are the best part.

1459
02:24:46,720 --> 02:24:48,880
I don't like beans.

1460
02:24:48,960 --> 02:24:52,680
Beans and meat
and potatoes and bread.

1461
02:24:52,760 --> 02:24:55,540
That's not the way
you make chunt.

1462
02:24:59,140 --> 02:25:02,240
- Eggs in chunt?
- Yes!

1463
02:25:04,340 --> 02:25:07,080
- I don't like chunt.
- No, you don't.

1464
02:25:07,120 --> 02:25:12,040
- What do you like?
- I like caviar!

1465
02:25:12,120 --> 02:25:13,480
One day on the fire...

1466
02:25:13,481 --> 02:25:15,481
-Oh, yes!
-One day...

1467
02:26:18,060 --> 02:26:19,880
Position yourselves
in front of the wagons!

1468
02:26:21,360 --> 02:26:24,560
You've got to stay together.

1469
02:26:24,640 --> 02:26:28,760
Leave the wagons!
Leave the wagons!

1470
02:26:29,640 --> 02:26:31,900
I said, leave the wagons!

1471
02:26:33,200 --> 02:26:35,520
<i>Bagaze zostawic!</i>

1472
02:26:37,760 --> 02:26:39,760
<i>Faster! Quick! Quick!</i>

1473
02:26:39,840 --> 02:26:42,000
<i>What's going on back there?</i>

1474
02:26:44,480 --> 02:26:46,320
Move it!

1475
02:26:50,920 --> 02:26:54,640
Come on, out!
Hurry up, out!

1476
02:26:54,680 --> 02:27:00,680
Thirty, thirty-five,
forty, forty-five...

1477
02:27:00,760 --> 02:27:02,600
<i>Out!</i>

1478
02:27:02,680 --> 02:27:05,000
<i>Get out!</i>

1479
02:27:05,080 --> 02:27:07,880
<i>Quicker, get out!</i>

1480
02:27:11,440 --> 02:27:13,980
<i>All of you, out!</i>

1481
02:27:14,860 --> 02:27:18,460
- Where are the list makers?
- Where are the tables?

1482
02:27:21,260 --> 02:27:22,840
<i>Move the line!</i>

1483
02:27:23,320 --> 02:27:25,240
<i>Get out!</i>

1484
02:27:29,800 --> 02:27:33,040
<i>- Quick! Get out!
- Faster!</i>

1485
02:27:35,520 --> 02:27:37,480
<i>Quicker!</i>

1486
02:27:37,520 --> 02:27:39,800
<i>Come on, be quick!</i>

1487
02:27:39,840 --> 02:27:43,200
Mama, where are we?

1488
02:27:43,780 --> 02:27:46,840
- 17, 18, 20-
- They're in Auschwitz.

1489
02:27:46,920 --> 02:27:50,720
The train was never routed here.
A paperwork mistake.

1490
02:27:58,720 --> 02:28:01,040
<i>Take off your shoes!</i>

1491
02:28:13,440 --> 02:28:16,240
<i>Quicker, quicker!</i>

1492
02:28:19,500 --> 02:28:20,960
<i>Take off your clothes!
Hurry up!</i>

1493
02:28:21,040 --> 02:28:23,600
<i>Hurry up! Stay in a row
and take off your clothes!</i>

1494
02:28:25,080 --> 02:28:26,720
<i>Quicker!</i>

1495
02:28:40,880 --> 02:28:43,720
<i>Quicker!</i>

1496
02:28:43,800 --> 02:28:46,920
<i>Take off your clothes quickly!
Hurry up!</i>

1497
02:28:50,521 --> 02:28:52,521
SHOWERS AND DISINFECTION

1498
02:28:53,800 --> 02:28:55,660
<i>Go in, hurry up!</i>

1499
02:28:58,520 --> 02:28:59,960
Quicker!

1500
02:29:00,040 --> 02:29:02,720
<i>Go to the showers, quickly!</i>

1501
02:29:04,720 --> 02:29:08,760
<i>Quicker! Quicker!</i>

1502
02:31:32,800 --> 02:31:34,600
Eyes on the necks!

1503
02:31:37,200 --> 02:31:39,880
Hands on the shoulders!

1504
02:31:39,920 --> 02:31:43,000
<i>- How old are you, mother?
- Sixty-eight.</i>

1505
02:31:43,040 --> 02:31:48,320
- Cough for me, mother.
- They say to fall against the fence is a kindness.

1506
02:31:48,600 --> 02:31:51,000
Don't kill yourself
against the fence, Clara.

1507
02:31:51,080 --> 02:31:54,800
If you do, you'll never
know what happened to you.

1508
02:31:56,580 --> 02:31:59,000
- How old are you, mother?
- Sixty-six, sir.

1509
02:31:59,080 --> 02:32:01,200
- Sir?
- Good morning.

1510
02:32:01,280 --> 02:32:04,120
A mistake has been made.
We are not supposed to be here.

1511
02:32:04,200 --> 02:32:07,800
We work for Oskar Schindler.
We are Schindler Jews.

1512
02:32:07,880 --> 02:32:11,200
- Who is Oskar Schindler?
- He had a factory in Krakow.

1513
02:32:11,280 --> 02:32:15,480
- Enamelware.
- A pot maker.

1514
02:32:15,960 --> 02:32:18,040
How old are you, mother?

1515
02:32:22,080 --> 02:32:27,660
You are not the only industrialist
who needs labour...

1516
02:32:27,840 --> 02:32:30,040
...Mr. Schindler.

1517
02:32:30,120 --> 02:32:32,880
I remember earlier this year,
IG-Color ordered...

1518
02:32:32,960 --> 02:32:38,520
...a trainload of Hungarians
for its chemical factory.

1519
02:32:38,600 --> 02:32:42,360
The train came in
through the archway...

1520
02:32:42,440 --> 02:32:47,840
...and the officer in charge
of the selection went immediately to work...

1521
02:32:47,920 --> 02:32:50,520
...and sent 2,000 of them...

1522
02:32:50,560 --> 02:32:54,000
...straight away
to "special treatment".

1523
02:32:54,680 --> 02:33:00,040
It is not my task to interfere with
the processes that take place down here.

1524
02:33:01,140 --> 02:33:06,040
Why do you think I can help you
if I can't help IG-Color?

1525
02:33:06,120 --> 02:33:09,300
Allow me to express the reason.

1526
02:33:17,400 --> 02:33:20,760
I'm not making
any judgement about you.

1527
02:33:20,800 --> 02:33:23,240
It's just that I know
that in the coming months...

1528
02:33:23,280 --> 02:33:26,920
...we're all going
to need portable wealth.

1529
02:33:29,460 --> 02:33:32,060
I could have you arrested.

1530
02:33:32,140 --> 02:33:37,200
I'm protected by powerful friends.
You should know that.

1531
02:33:39,480 --> 02:33:43,240
I do not say
I am accepting them.

1532
02:33:43,320 --> 02:33:48,400
All I say is, I'm not comfortable
with them on the table.

1533
02:34:01,420 --> 02:34:04,480
I have a shipment
coming in tomorrow.

1534
02:34:04,560 --> 02:34:06,840
I'll cut you 300 units from it.

1535
02:34:06,920 --> 02:34:10,720
New ones.
These are fresh.

1536
02:34:14,280 --> 02:34:18,140
- The train comes, we turn it around.
- Yes, yes, yes!

1537
02:34:18,220 --> 02:34:19,680
- It's yours.
- I understand.

1538
02:34:20,060 --> 02:34:22,720
I want these.

1539
02:34:25,140 --> 02:34:28,660
You shouldn't
get stuck on names.

1540
02:34:35,120 --> 02:34:39,200
That's right.
It creates a lot of paperwork.

1541
02:34:39,280 --> 02:34:43,120
Zoldinger, Ernestina!
Waldergrun, Hilda!

1542
02:34:43,200 --> 02:34:45,320
Waldergrun, Leonora!

1543
02:34:45,400 --> 02:34:48,640
Laast, Anna!
Pfefferberg, Mila!

1544
02:34:48,720 --> 02:34:52,120
Dresner, Ruth!
Dresner, Danka!

1545
02:34:52,200 --> 02:34:55,760
Nussbaum, Sidonia!
Rosner, Manci!

1546
02:34:55,840 --> 02:35:01,600
Hirsch, Helen! Grosz, Chaja Sara!
Seelenfreund, Estella!

1547
02:35:15,840 --> 02:35:17,920
<i>Move it!
Move it, quick!</i>

1548
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:22,360
<i>- Faster! Faster!
-Come on!</i>

1549
02:35:23,960 --> 02:35:26,720
<i>Quick, quick!
Faster!</i>

1550
02:35:28,520 --> 02:35:32,440
<i>- Faster!
-Hurry up!</i>

1551
02:35:40,400 --> 02:35:43,360
No! No! No!

1552
02:35:57,120 --> 02:36:00,720
No! No! No!

1553
02:36:04,240 --> 02:36:06,440
No! No! No!

1554
02:36:08,440 --> 02:36:12,240
Hey! Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?

1555
02:36:12,320 --> 02:36:16,960
These are mine! These are my workers!
They should be on my train!

1556
02:36:17,040 --> 02:36:19,560
They're skilled munitions workers!
They're essential!

1557
02:36:20,240 --> 02:36:22,720
Essential girls!

1558
02:36:24,800 --> 02:36:29,020
Their fingers polish the insides
of shell metal casings.

1559
02:36:29,100 --> 02:36:32,360
How else am I to polish the inside of
a 45 millimetre shell casing?

1560
02:36:32,440 --> 02:36:36,120
You tell me.
You tell me!

1561
02:36:37,500 --> 02:36:41,500
Back on the train!
Back on the train!

1562
02:38:31,100 --> 02:38:35,160
Under Department "W" provisions...

1563
02:38:35,240 --> 02:38:39,440
...it is unlawful
to kill a worker without just cause.

1564
02:38:39,520 --> 02:38:42,400
Under the Businesses
Compensation Fund...

1565
02:38:42,480 --> 02:38:46,600
...I am entitled to file
damage claims for such deaths.

1566
02:38:46,680 --> 02:38:49,520
If you shoot without thinking...

1567
02:38:49,600 --> 02:38:53,720
...you go to prison, I get paid.

1568
02:38:53,800 --> 02:38:56,000
That's how it works.

1569
02:38:56,080 --> 02:39:01,040
So, there will be no
summary executions here.

1570
02:39:01,800 --> 02:39:06,360
There will be no interference
of any kind with production.

1571
02:39:06,440 --> 02:39:11,380
In hopes of ensuring that, guards will
no longer be allowed on the factory floor...

1572
02:39:11,460 --> 02:39:14,980
...without my authorization.

1573
02:39:19,560 --> 02:39:24,120
For your cooperation,
you have my gratitude.

1574
02:39:24,740 --> 02:39:26,800
Come on, come!

1575
02:39:27,380 --> 02:39:29,380
<i>Oh, boy! I haven't seen
something like that since years.</i>

1576
02:39:29,460 --> 02:39:32,200
Come on, boys, come!

1577
02:39:56,840 --> 02:40:02,540
No doorman or maitre d'
will ever mistake you again...

1578
02:40:02,620 --> 02:40:04,880
...I promise.

1579
02:40:11,280 --> 02:40:14,900
- This is Itzhak Stern, my accountant.
- You must be Mrs. Schindler.

1580
02:40:14,940 --> 02:40:17,480
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Emilie has volunteered to work in the clinic.

1581
02:40:17,520 --> 02:40:19,400
- Very generous of you.
- I know.

1582
02:40:19,440 --> 02:40:22,000
We need to talk
when you have a moment.

1583
02:40:22,080 --> 02:40:24,560
This is my wife, Stern.
I don't keep any secrets from my spouse.

1584
02:40:24,640 --> 02:40:27,540
Oskar, please, attend to business.
It's much more attractive.

1585
02:40:27,620 --> 02:40:28,500
- Madam.
- Hello!

1586
02:40:28,539 --> 02:40:29,439
What is it?

1587
02:40:29,440 --> 02:40:32,120
We've received an angry complaint
from the Armaments Board.

1588
02:40:32,200 --> 02:40:34,280
The artillery shells,
tank shells, rocket casings!

1589
02:40:34,360 --> 02:40:36,920
Apparently all of them
have failed quality control tests.

1590
02:40:36,921 --> 02:40:37,921
That's to be expected!

1591
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:41,080
Start-up problems. This isn't pots
and pans. This is a precise business.

1592
02:40:41,160 --> 02:40:43,040
- I'll write them a letter.
- They're withholding payment.

1593
02:40:43,080 --> 02:40:47,080
Sure, so would I, so would you. I wouldn't
worry. We'll get it right one of these days.

1594
02:40:47,120 --> 02:40:51,400
There's a rumour you've been going
around miscalibrating the machines.

1595
02:40:51,440 --> 02:40:56,000
They could shut us down,
send us back to Auschwitz.

1596
02:40:57,080 --> 02:40:59,360
I'll call around, find out
where we can buy shells.

1597
02:40:59,440 --> 02:41:01,460
- Pass them off as ours.
- I don't see the difference...

1598
02:41:01,461 --> 02:41:02,461
...whether they're made here
or somewhere else.

1599
02:41:02,540 --> 02:41:03,900
You don't see a difference?
I see a difference.

1600
02:41:03,901 --> 02:41:05,201
You'll lose a lot of money.

1601
02:41:05,280 --> 02:41:08,440
Fewer shells will be made.
Stern, if this factory ever produces...

1602
02:41:08,520 --> 02:41:13,680
...a shell that can actually be fired,
I'll be very unhappy.

1603
02:41:13,760 --> 02:41:16,680
- Hello, madam.
- How do you do?

1604
02:41:29,560 --> 02:41:33,920
How are you doing, Rabbi?
Rabbi!

1605
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,640
Good, Mr. Director.

1606
02:41:39,760 --> 02:41:41,920
Sun's going down.

1607
02:41:44,080 --> 02:41:46,100
Yes, it is.

1608
02:41:47,280 --> 02:41:51,200
What day is this? Friday?
It is Friday, isn't it?

1609
02:41:51,280 --> 02:41:53,180
Is it?

1610
02:41:56,480 --> 02:42:01,280
What's the matter with you?
You should be preparing for the Sabbath.

1611
02:42:01,360 --> 02:42:04,100
Shouldn't you?

1612
02:42:09,880 --> 02:42:14,780
I've got some wine.
In my office. Come!

1613
02:43:26,360 --> 02:43:29,320
<i>What?</i>

1614
02:43:29,400 --> 02:43:34,120
Do you have any money,
uh, hidden away someplace...

1615
02:43:34,200 --> 02:43:37,240
...that I don't know about?

1616
02:43:40,080 --> 02:43:42,480
No!

1617
02:43:46,620 --> 02:43:50,480
Why?
Am I broke?

1618
02:43:53,340 --> 02:43:55,400
Well...

1619
02:43:56,280 --> 02:44:02,400
<i>Yesterday morning, at 2:41 a. m...</i>

1620
02:44:02,480 --> 02:44:06,280
<i>...at General Eisenhower's
headquarters...</i>

1621
02:44:06,360 --> 02:44:08,960
<i>...General Jodl...</i>

1622
02:44:09,040 --> 02:44:12,980
<i>...signed the Act
of Unconditional Surrender...</i>

1623
02:44:13,060 --> 02:44:18,840
<i>...of all German land,
sea and air forces in Europe...</i>

1624
02:44:18,920 --> 02:44:22,840
<i>...to the Allied
Expeditionary Force.</i>

1625
02:44:22,880 --> 02:44:26,880
<i>And simultaneously
to the Soviet High Command.</i>

1626
02:44:27,560 --> 02:44:31,200
<i>The German war is,
therefore, at an end.</i>

1627
02:44:31,280 --> 02:44:33,200
<i>But let us not forget for a moment...</i>

1628
02:44:33,240 --> 02:44:37,360
I think it's time the guards
came into the factory.

1629
02:44:37,440 --> 02:44:40,480
<i>...Japan, with all
her treachery and greed...</i>

1630
02:44:40,560 --> 02:44:45,840
The unconditional surrender
of Germany has just been announced.

1631
02:44:45,920 --> 02:44:50,380
At midnight tonight,
the war is over.

1632
02:44:52,200 --> 02:44:54,480
Tomorrow you'll
begin the process...

1633
02:44:54,560 --> 02:44:58,140
...of looking for survivors
of your families.

1634
02:45:00,480 --> 02:45:05,740
In most cases,
you won't find them.

1635
02:45:06,860 --> 02:45:09,560
After six long years
of murder...

1636
02:45:09,680 --> 02:45:14,800
...victims are being mourned
throughout the world.

1637
02:45:14,880 --> 02:45:17,880
We've survived.

1638
02:45:17,920 --> 02:45:22,000
Many of you have come up
to me and thanked me.

1639
02:45:23,920 --> 02:45:26,000
Thank yourselves.

1640
02:45:27,080 --> 02:45:30,320
Thank your fearless Stern...

1641
02:45:30,360 --> 02:45:32,640
...and others among you
who worried about you...

1642
02:45:32,680 --> 02:45:36,560
...and faced death
at every moment.

1643
02:45:39,380 --> 02:45:41,920
I'm a member of the Nazi party.

1644
02:45:42,040 --> 02:45:45,180
I'm a munitions manufacturer.

1645
02:45:45,260 --> 02:45:47,560
I'm a profiteer of slave labour.

1646
02:45:47,640 --> 02:45:51,200
I am a criminal.

1647
02:45:51,280 --> 02:45:56,100
At midnight you'll be free,
and I'll be hunted.

1648
02:45:56,680 --> 02:46:00,040
I shall remain with you until
five minutes after midnight...

1649
02:46:00,120 --> 02:46:06,140
...after which time,
and I hope you'll forgive me I have to flee.

1650
02:46:08,180 --> 02:46:11,760
I know you have received orders
from our commandant...

1651
02:46:11,840 --> 02:46:16,720
...which he has received from his superiors
to dispose of the population of this camp.

1652
02:46:16,800 --> 02:46:19,080
Now would be
the time to do it.

1653
02:46:19,160 --> 02:46:24,900
Here they are, they're all here.
This is your opportunity.

1654
02:46:28,840 --> 02:46:32,400
Or you could leave...

1655
02:46:32,480 --> 02:46:34,700
...and return
to your families as men...

1656
02:46:34,780 --> 02:46:38,520
...instead of murderers.

1657
02:47:17,060 --> 02:47:21,060
In memory of the countless
victims among your people...

1658
02:47:21,140 --> 02:47:25,160
...I ask us to observe
three minutes of silence.

1659
02:48:17,600 --> 02:48:22,600
- Thank you, Mr. Jereth.
- Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

1660
02:48:22,680 --> 02:48:24,960
Open wide.

1661
02:48:26,560 --> 02:48:28,580
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

1662
02:48:46,360 --> 02:48:48,560
Thank you, Mr. Jereth!

1663
02:49:11,600 --> 02:49:15,740
As soon as peace occurs,
I want...

1664
02:49:15,820 --> 02:49:19,780
...um, I want that cloth
distributed to the workers.

1665
02:49:19,815 --> 02:49:22,300
Two and a half metres each.

1666
02:49:22,380 --> 02:49:25,440
Also, each person is
to get a bottle of vodka.

1667
02:49:25,520 --> 02:49:28,420
They won't drink it.
They know its value.

1668
02:49:28,500 --> 02:49:31,840
Likewise those Egipshi cigarettes
we organized.

1669
02:49:31,920 --> 02:49:35,980
It'll be done.
Everything you ask.

1670
02:49:54,320 --> 02:49:58,420
We've written a letter,
trying to explain things...

1671
02:49:58,500 --> 02:50:01,540
...in case you are captured.

1672
02:50:02,800 --> 02:50:05,860
Every worker has signed it.

1673
02:50:15,500 --> 02:50:17,340
Thank you!

1674
02:50:43,060 --> 02:50:45,280
It is Hebrew, from the Talmud.

1675
02:50:45,360 --> 02:50:51,180
It says:
"Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire. "

1676
02:51:28,500 --> 02:51:31,840
I could have got more out.

1677
02:51:32,980 --> 02:51:35,380
I could have got more.
I don't know.

1678
02:51:35,960 --> 02:51:37,680
If I just...

1679
02:51:38,760 --> 02:51:39,820
I could have got more.

1680
02:51:39,900 --> 02:51:45,160
Oskar, there are 1,100 people who are
alive because of you. Look at them.

1681
02:51:45,540 --> 02:51:47,920
If I'd made more money...

1682
02:51:51,760 --> 02:51:56,400
I threw away so much money.

1683
02:51:58,280 --> 02:52:01,180
You have no idea.

1684
02:52:01,260 --> 02:52:02,200
If I had just...

1685
02:52:02,280 --> 02:52:06,320
There will be generations
because of what you did.

1686
02:52:07,500 --> 02:52:09,780
I didn't do enough.

1687
02:52:09,860 --> 02:52:12,680
You did so much.

1688
02:52:15,980 --> 02:52:18,340
This car...

1689
02:52:18,420 --> 02:52:20,080
...Goeth would've bought this car.

1690
02:52:20,560 --> 02:52:25,120
Why did I keep the car?
Ten people right there.

1691
02:52:27,460 --> 02:52:30,240
Ten people.

1692
02:52:30,920 --> 02:52:33,620
Ten more people.

1693
02:52:35,380 --> 02:52:36,840
This pin...

1694
02:52:36,920 --> 02:52:40,520
...two people.

1695
02:52:41,200 --> 02:52:42,900
This is gold.

1696
02:52:42,980 --> 02:52:44,520
Two more people.

1697
02:52:44,900 --> 02:52:47,640
He would have given me
two for it, at least one.

1698
02:52:47,720 --> 02:52:50,960
He would have given me one,
one more.

1699
02:52:53,320 --> 02:52:55,980
One more person.

1700
02:52:57,560 --> 02:53:02,740
A person, Stern,
for this!

1701
02:53:04,600 --> 02:53:08,360
I could have gotten...

1702
02:53:08,440 --> 02:53:13,040
...one more person and I didn't.

1703
02:53:13,520 --> 02:53:16,840
And I, I didn't!

1704
02:54:41,720 --> 02:54:44,380
You have been liberated...

1705
02:54:44,460 --> 02:54:47,600
...by the Soviet Army!

1706
02:54:54,740 --> 02:54:56,340
Have you been in Poland?

1707
02:54:56,420 --> 02:54:59,760
I just came from Poland.

1708
02:55:00,940 --> 02:55:03,540
Are there any Jews left?

1709
02:55:08,400 --> 02:55:10,840
Where should we go?

1710
02:55:10,920 --> 02:55:12,920
Don't go east, that's for sure.

1711
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:16,080
They hate you there.

1712
02:55:16,460 --> 02:55:20,160
I wouldn't go west either,
if I were you.

1713
02:55:21,040 --> 02:55:24,040
We could use some food.

1714
02:55:25,620 --> 02:55:29,540
Isn't there a town over there?

1715
02:56:39,380 --> 02:56:42,020
Long live, Hitler!
