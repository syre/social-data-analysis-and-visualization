1
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,668
Dr. Hill.

2
00:01:56,668 --> 00:01:58,136
Dr. Bassett.

3
00:01:58,136 --> 00:01:59,638
Where's the patient?

4
00:01:59,638 --> 00:02:01,974
I hated
to drag you out of bed.

5
00:02:01,974 --> 00:02:04,276
Will you let me go
while there's still time?

6
00:02:04,276 --> 00:02:06,267
You'll soon see why I did.

7
00:02:08,081 --> 00:02:11,418
Will you tell
these fools I'm not crazy?

8
00:02:11,418 --> 00:02:13,587
Make them listen to me
before it's too late!

9
00:02:13,587 --> 00:02:15,589
I'll listen to you.

10
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:16,955
Let him go.

11
00:02:20,695 --> 00:02:21,963
Who are you?

12
00:02:21,963 --> 00:02:24,465
I'm Dr. Hill
from the state mental hospital.

13
00:02:24,465 --> 00:02:26,101
I'm not insane!

14
00:02:26,101 --> 00:02:27,603
Let him go!

15
00:02:27,603 --> 00:02:30,706
Doctor,
now you must listen to me.

16
00:02:30,706 --> 00:02:32,107
You must understand me.

17
00:02:32,107 --> 00:02:34,911
I am a doctor, too.
I am not insane.

18
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:36,379
All right.

19
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:40,611
Suppose we sit down,
and you tell me what happened?

20
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:46,123
Well, it started--

21
00:02:46,123 --> 00:02:48,626
for me,
it started last Thursday...

22
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:52,130
in response to an urgent
message from my nurse.

23
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:56,134
I'd hurried home
from a medical convention.

24
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:59,662
At first glance,
everything looked the same.

25
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,337
It wasn't.

26
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:06,137
Something evil had taken
possession of the town.

27
00:03:07,179 --> 00:03:08,649
These two.

28
00:03:08,649 --> 00:03:10,150
Here you are.

29
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,586
Thank you, sir.
There you are.

30
00:03:12,586 --> 00:03:14,076
Thank you.

31
00:03:17,091 --> 00:03:18,854
Morning, Mr. Fisher.

32
00:03:20,094 --> 00:03:21,596
Doc!

33
00:03:21,596 --> 00:03:23,097
Hiya, Sally.

34
00:03:23,097 --> 00:03:25,601
Hi. Welcome home.
I'm glad you're back.

35
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:27,302
How's Mickey and the baby?

36
00:03:27,302 --> 00:03:30,572
Fine, but everybody else
in Santa Mira needs a doctor.

37
00:03:30,572 --> 00:03:32,107
You've got an office
full of patients.

38
00:03:32,107 --> 00:03:33,910
Oh, no.
On my first day back?

39
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,346
Some of them have
been waiting for two weeks.

40
00:03:36,346 --> 00:03:38,448
Why didn't you send them
to Pursey or Carmichael?

41
00:03:38,448 --> 00:03:41,618
Most of 'em wouldn't go.
They want to see you.

42
00:03:41,618 --> 00:03:43,109
Oh?

43
00:03:49,927 --> 00:03:51,163
What's the matter with them?

44
00:03:51,163 --> 00:03:52,531
They wouldn't say.

45
00:03:52,531 --> 00:03:55,830
Usually people can't talk enough
about what's ailing them.

46
00:03:56,334 --> 00:03:58,837
For instance,
Wally Eberhard was in twice...

47
00:03:58,837 --> 00:04:01,507
and called three times,
but he wouldn't say about what.

48
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:02,675
That's funny.

49
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:04,377
Nobody would talk--
from Becky Driscoll...

50
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,879
down to that fat
traffic cop Sam Janzek.

51
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,718
Becky Driscoll?
I thought she was in England.

52
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:15,222
She got back a few days ago,
and she wanted to see you.

53
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:17,158
Are you still interested?

54
00:04:17,158 --> 00:04:20,161
My interest in married women
is strictly professional...

55
00:04:20,161 --> 00:04:23,164
or yours would have been
a lost cause long ago.

56
00:04:23,164 --> 00:04:25,835
-How was the convention?
-Wonderful.

57
00:04:25,835 --> 00:04:28,497
They wept with envy
when I read my paper.

58
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,441
Come back here!

59
00:04:32,441 --> 00:04:33,601
Jimmy!

60
00:04:34,611 --> 00:04:38,048
What's the matter,
Mrs. Grimaldi?

61
00:04:38,048 --> 00:04:40,107
It's nothing. He just don't
want to go to school.

62
00:04:42,285 --> 00:04:45,623
If I were you, I'd have
a talk with his teacher.

63
00:04:45,623 --> 00:04:47,625
I will when I get time.

64
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,727
What's the matter?
Has Joe been sick?

65
00:04:49,727 --> 00:04:51,830
No.
We gave the stand up.

66
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,166
-Too much work.
-Oh.

67
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,034
The boy's
panic should have told me...

68
00:04:56,034 --> 00:04:58,237
it was more than school
he was afraid of...

69
00:04:58,237 --> 00:04:59,872
and that littered,
closed-up vegetable stand...

70
00:04:59,872 --> 00:05:02,175
should have
told me something, too.

71
00:05:02,175 --> 00:05:03,643
When I last saw it,
less than a month ago...

72
00:05:03,643 --> 00:05:06,279
it was the cleanest
and busiest stand on the road.

73
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:08,014
That's strange.

74
00:05:08,014 --> 00:05:10,584
She was in to see you, too--
last Friday.

75
00:05:10,584 --> 00:05:13,320
I tried to get her to see
Doc Pursey, but she wouldn't.

76
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,489
She said only you
could help her.

77
00:05:15,489 --> 00:05:16,724
Whatever it was...

78
00:05:16,724 --> 00:05:20,024
it couldn't have been
too serious, I guess.

79
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,534
One minor concussion,
two cases of the common cold...

80
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:27,537
and six canceled appointments.

81
00:05:27,537 --> 00:05:30,039
Looks like you rushed me here
for nothing.

82
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:32,542
I don't understand it.
They couldn't wait to see you.

83
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:35,045
But you're still booked up solid
for the afternoon.

84
00:05:35,045 --> 00:05:38,816
I bet they don't show.
Look, there's Wally Eberhard...

85
00:05:38,816 --> 00:05:41,018
talking somebody
into buying some insurance.

86
00:05:41,018 --> 00:05:42,252
There's nothing wrong with him.

87
00:05:42,252 --> 00:05:43,618
Bill Bitner's taking
his secretary to lunch.

88
00:05:44,823 --> 00:05:46,291
And speaking of lunch...

89
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,893
will you tell whoever that is
that I'm out having mine?

90
00:05:48,893 --> 00:05:50,061
Is Dr. Bennell in?

91
00:05:50,061 --> 00:05:51,997
Yes, he's here.

92
00:05:51,997 --> 00:05:53,766
Do you suppose
he has time to see me?

93
00:05:53,766 --> 00:05:55,634
If he hasn't,
something's wrong with him.

94
00:05:55,634 --> 00:05:56,828
Go right in.

95
00:05:58,637 --> 00:06:00,265
Becky.

96
00:06:02,342 --> 00:06:03,910
Almost five years.

97
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,178
It's wonderful to be home again.

98
00:06:05,178 --> 00:06:06,413
I've been away so long...

99
00:06:06,413 --> 00:06:09,008
I feel almost like a stranger
in my own country.

100
00:06:10,017 --> 00:06:12,153
Hope you don't mind my coming
without an appointment.

101
00:06:12,153 --> 00:06:14,388
Not at all.
What'll you have?

102
00:06:14,388 --> 00:06:16,123
We're pushing appendectomies
this week.

103
00:06:16,123 --> 00:06:17,291
Oh, Miles.

104
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,595
I don't know,
maybe I clown around too much.

105
00:06:19,595 --> 00:06:21,597
Pretty soon, my patients...

106
00:06:21,597 --> 00:06:24,099
won't trust me
to prescribe aspirin for them.

107
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:25,601
Seriously, what's the trouble?

108
00:06:25,601 --> 00:06:27,770
It's my cousin.

109
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,738
Wilma?
What's the matter with her?

110
00:06:31,107 --> 00:06:32,809
She has a...

111
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,446
I guess you'd call it
a delusion.

112
00:06:35,446 --> 00:06:37,815
You know her uncle?
Uncle Ira?

113
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:39,416
Sure. I'm his doctor.

114
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:42,453
She's got herself
thinking he isn't her uncle.

115
00:06:42,453 --> 00:06:44,289
How do you mean?
That they're not really related?

116
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:46,992
She thinks
he's an impostor or something...

117
00:06:46,992 --> 00:06:48,894
someone who only looks like Ira.

118
00:06:48,894 --> 00:06:50,295
Have you seen him?

119
00:06:50,295 --> 00:06:51,529
I just came from there.

120
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:55,034
Is he Uncle Ira,
or isn't he Uncle Ira?

121
00:06:55,034 --> 00:06:56,202
Of course he is.

122
00:06:56,202 --> 00:06:58,304
I told Wilma that,
but it was no use.

123
00:06:58,304 --> 00:07:01,074
Please, would you stop by
and have a talk with her?

124
00:07:01,074 --> 00:07:02,643
Sally says I'm booked up
for the afternoon...

125
00:07:02,643 --> 00:07:05,312
but why don't you ask her
to come in and see me?

126
00:07:05,312 --> 00:07:06,802
I'll try.

127
00:07:08,315 --> 00:07:10,184
How about some lunch?

128
00:07:10,184 --> 00:07:12,516
I can't.
I'm meeting Dad at the store.

129
00:07:16,491 --> 00:07:18,460
When did you get back?

130
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,130
I came back from London
two months ago.

131
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,564
I've been in Reno.

132
00:07:22,564 --> 00:07:23,732
Reno?

133
00:07:23,732 --> 00:07:25,601
Reno.

134
00:07:25,601 --> 00:07:27,103
Dad tells me
you were there, too.

135
00:07:27,103 --> 00:07:28,605
Five months ago.

136
00:07:28,605 --> 00:07:30,607
Oh, I'm sorry.

137
00:07:30,607 --> 00:07:32,108
So was I.

138
00:07:32,108 --> 00:07:34,611
I wanted it to work.

139
00:07:34,611 --> 00:07:38,049
I guess that makes us
lodge brothers now.

140
00:07:38,049 --> 00:07:39,250
Yes.

141
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,320
Except I'm paying dues
while you collect them.

142
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,482
Ha ha ha! Miles.

143
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,967
-Hello, doc.
-How are you?

144
00:07:53,967 --> 00:07:55,134
Sam!

145
00:07:55,134 --> 00:07:57,136
At it again, eh?

146
00:07:57,136 --> 00:07:58,471
My nurse tells me
you were in last week...

147
00:07:58,471 --> 00:08:00,640
and wanted very much
to see me.

148
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,632
It wasn't anything important.

149
00:08:03,644 --> 00:08:05,646
Didn't he go to college with us?

150
00:08:05,646 --> 00:08:07,648
Quit his second year
to get married...

151
00:08:07,648 --> 00:08:10,151
like I wanted us to do.

152
00:08:10,151 --> 00:08:12,754
Just be thankful
I didn't take you seriously.

153
00:08:12,754 --> 00:08:14,289
You be thankful.

154
00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:15,757
I found out
that a doctor's wife...

155
00:08:15,757 --> 00:08:17,459
needs the understanding
of an Einstein...

156
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:19,095
and patience of a saint.

157
00:08:19,095 --> 00:08:20,596
And love?

158
00:08:20,596 --> 00:08:22,598
I wouldn't know about that.

159
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:24,600
I'm just a general practitioner.

160
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,104
Love is handled
by the specialists.

161
00:08:27,104 --> 00:08:30,107
Here's where I leave you.

162
00:08:30,107 --> 00:08:31,608
You know something?

163
00:08:31,608 --> 00:08:35,112
This is where you left me
the last time.

164
00:08:35,112 --> 00:08:36,603
Hiya, Johnny.

165
00:08:43,788 --> 00:08:45,491
Sally, I'm off.

166
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:47,659
Tell the answering service
I'll be at home.

167
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:49,128
Good night, doc.

168
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:51,230
I'm not going in there!

169
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,900
Stop all this nonsense.

170
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,137
Hey! Take it easy!

171
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:59,139
Isn't this Jimmy Grimaldi?

172
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:01,142
Yes, Doctor.
Can I talk to you a moment?

173
00:09:01,142 --> 00:09:03,077
Sure. I almost
ran you down this morning.

174
00:09:03,077 --> 00:09:05,146
You got to be careful
when you run out in the road.

175
00:09:05,146 --> 00:09:06,647
Come on.

176
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:08,137
Come on.

177
00:09:11,653 --> 00:09:13,588
Hey! Hey! Hey!

178
00:09:13,588 --> 00:09:16,091
Hey! Slow down now.

179
00:09:16,091 --> 00:09:17,826
School isn't as bad as all that.

180
00:09:17,826 --> 00:09:19,395
School isn't what upsets him.

181
00:09:19,395 --> 00:09:20,763
It's my daughter-in-law.

182
00:09:20,763 --> 00:09:23,266
He's got the crazy idea
she isn't his mother.

183
00:09:23,266 --> 00:09:24,767
She isn't! She isn't!

184
00:09:24,767 --> 00:09:26,369
Don't let her get me!

185
00:09:26,369 --> 00:09:29,498
Nobody's going
to get you, Jimmy.

186
00:09:36,014 --> 00:09:37,682
How long has this been going on?

187
00:09:37,682 --> 00:09:40,452
An hour ago,
I found him in the cellar.

188
00:09:40,452 --> 00:09:43,788
He wouldn't say anything until
I started to phone his mother.

189
00:09:43,788 --> 00:09:45,624
That's when he said Anna
wasn't his mother.

190
00:09:45,624 --> 00:09:48,127
Could you keep him
with you for a day or so?

191
00:09:48,127 --> 00:09:50,763
Give him one of these every
four hours during the day.

192
00:09:50,763 --> 00:09:52,631
Call me tomorrow and let me know
how he's feeling.

193
00:09:52,631 --> 00:09:54,134
Yes, Doctor, thank you.

194
00:09:54,134 --> 00:09:56,303
Don't let her get me!

195
00:09:56,303 --> 00:09:58,328
Nobody's going to get you.

196
00:10:05,113 --> 00:10:06,647
All right, Jimmy.

197
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,149
Open your mouth.

198
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,650
Shut your eyes.

199
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,753
In the words of the poet...

200
00:10:11,753 --> 00:10:13,689
I'll give you something
to make you wise.

201
00:10:13,689 --> 00:10:17,159
That's a good boy, Jimmy.

202
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:19,195
I'm not going home ever.

203
00:10:19,195 --> 00:10:21,531
You're staying at your
grandmother's. Call his mother.

204
00:10:21,531 --> 00:10:22,866
She's not my mother!

205
00:10:22,866 --> 00:10:25,201
All right. Run along.
Everything's going to be OK.

206
00:10:25,201 --> 00:10:26,736
You be a good boy now.

207
00:10:26,736 --> 00:10:28,172
Good night, Doctor.

208
00:10:28,172 --> 00:10:29,366
Good night.

209
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:33,711
I've changed my mind.
I'm not going directly home.

210
00:10:33,711 --> 00:10:35,179
I'm going to stop off
and see Wilma Lentz.

211
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:36,882
Should I call the boy's mother?

212
00:10:36,882 --> 00:10:38,884
Yes.
Tell her what happened...

213
00:10:38,884 --> 00:10:41,052
and that I suggested
the boy spend the night...

214
00:10:41,052 --> 00:10:42,713
at his grandmother's house.

215
00:10:50,696 --> 00:10:52,198
Hello, Miles.

216
00:10:52,198 --> 00:10:54,668
Nice to see you, Wilma.
Becky.

217
00:10:54,668 --> 00:10:56,103
Let's have it.

218
00:10:56,103 --> 00:10:57,771
You talked to him.
What do you think?

219
00:10:57,771 --> 00:10:59,006
It's him.

220
00:10:59,006 --> 00:11:01,074
He's your Uncle Ira, all right.

221
00:11:01,074 --> 00:11:02,599
He is not.

222
00:11:10,251 --> 00:11:12,221
How is he different?

223
00:11:12,221 --> 00:11:13,355
That's just it.

224
00:11:13,355 --> 00:11:16,358
There is no difference
you can actually see.

225
00:11:16,358 --> 00:11:18,694
He looks, sounds, acts,
and remembers...

226
00:11:18,694 --> 00:11:19,896
like Uncle Ira.

227
00:11:19,896 --> 00:11:21,464
Then he is your Uncle Ira.

228
00:11:21,464 --> 00:11:24,868
You see that?
No matter how you feel, he is.

229
00:11:24,868 --> 00:11:27,370
But he isn't.
There's something missing.

230
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,741
He's been a father to me
since I was a baby.

231
00:11:30,741 --> 00:11:32,310
Always when he talked to me...

232
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:35,947
there was a special look
in his eye.

233
00:11:35,947 --> 00:11:37,249
That look's gone.

234
00:11:37,249 --> 00:11:40,052
What about memories?
There must be certain things...

235
00:11:40,052 --> 00:11:42,521
that only you and he
would know about.

236
00:11:42,521 --> 00:11:43,689
There are.

237
00:11:43,689 --> 00:11:46,125
I've talked to him about them.
He remembers them all...

238
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:49,390
down to the last small detail,
just like Uncle Ira would.

239
00:11:51,197 --> 00:11:52,699
But, Miles...

240
00:11:52,699 --> 00:11:54,201
there's no emotion.

241
00:11:54,201 --> 00:11:55,369
None!

242
00:11:55,369 --> 00:11:58,205
Just the pretense of it.

243
00:11:58,205 --> 00:12:00,207
The words, gesture,
the tone of voice...

244
00:12:00,207 --> 00:12:03,177
everything else is the same,
but not the feeling.

245
00:12:05,013 --> 00:12:07,482
Memories or not,
he isn't my Uncle Ira.

246
00:12:07,482 --> 00:12:09,551
Wilma, I'm on your side.

247
00:12:09,551 --> 00:12:11,320
My business
is people in trouble...

248
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,755
and I'm going to find
a way to help you.

249
00:12:12,755 --> 00:12:15,524
No one could possibly
impersonate your Uncle Ira...

250
00:12:15,524 --> 00:12:18,127
without you
or your Aunt Eleda or even me...

251
00:12:18,127 --> 00:12:20,130
seeing a million
little differences.

252
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,199
I want you to realize that.

253
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,334
Think about it,
and then you'll know...

254
00:12:24,334 --> 00:12:27,638
that the trouble is inside you.

255
00:12:27,638 --> 00:12:30,108
Wilma, where are you?

256
00:12:30,108 --> 00:12:32,010
Out on the lawn.

257
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,911
Say nothing to her.

258
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:36,849
Why, Miles,
I didn't know you were here.

259
00:12:36,849 --> 00:12:38,050
Welcome home.

260
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,285
Hello, Mrs. Lentz.

261
00:12:39,285 --> 00:12:41,453
Did you ask Miles
to stay for dinner?

262
00:12:41,453 --> 00:12:42,621
Can't tonight.

263
00:12:42,621 --> 00:12:43,889
I'm making spoon bread.

264
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:45,392
Please, don't tempt me.

265
00:12:45,392 --> 00:12:46,626
Maybe next time.

266
00:12:46,626 --> 00:12:48,628
Wilma, where are my glasses?

267
00:12:48,628 --> 00:12:50,563
I think
they're on the mantelpiece.

268
00:12:50,563 --> 00:12:51,894
I'll go with you.

269
00:13:03,145 --> 00:13:05,147
Am I going crazy?

270
00:13:05,147 --> 00:13:07,149
Don't spare me.
I've got to know.

271
00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:09,151
No, you're not.
Even these days...

272
00:13:09,151 --> 00:13:11,821
it isn't as easy to go crazy
as you might think.

273
00:13:11,821 --> 00:13:13,589
But you don't have to be
losing your mind...

274
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:16,025
to need psychiatric help.

275
00:13:16,025 --> 00:13:18,561
I'd like you to see
a doctor friend of mine.

276
00:13:18,561 --> 00:13:21,398
-A psychiatrist?
-Dan Kauffman.

277
00:13:21,398 --> 00:13:25,266
I'll make an appointment
for you tomorrow.

278
00:13:26,704 --> 00:13:28,807
All right.

279
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:31,332
But it's a waste of time.
There's nothing wrong with me.

280
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:38,707
Better break this up,
or he'll start wondering.

281
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:41,854
Wondering what?

282
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:44,390
If I don't suspect.
You've been a big help...

283
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,227
and I don't want either of you
to worry about me.

284
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:48,462
I'll be all right.

285
00:13:48,462 --> 00:13:50,030
Sure you will.

286
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,132
Staying here, Becky?
Or may I drive you home?

287
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:53,667
Would you like me to stay?

288
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:56,471
Of course not.
Good night.

289
00:13:56,471 --> 00:13:57,961
Good night.

290
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,652
Nice having Becky
back again, eh, boy?

291
00:14:10,652 --> 00:14:12,143
Sure is.

292
00:14:17,026 --> 00:14:18,361
In the back of my mind...

293
00:14:18,361 --> 00:14:20,131
a warning bell was ringing.

294
00:14:20,131 --> 00:14:21,866
Sick people
who couldn't wait to see me...

295
00:14:21,866 --> 00:14:23,868
then suddenly
were perfectly all right.

296
00:14:23,868 --> 00:14:26,170
A boy claiming
his mother wasn't his mother.

297
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,239
A woman claiming her uncle
wasn't her uncle.

298
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:29,608
But I didn't listen.

299
00:14:29,608 --> 00:14:31,543
Obviously, the boy's mother
was his mother.

300
00:14:31,543 --> 00:14:34,679
I had seen her.
And Uncle Ira was Uncle Ira.

301
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:36,815
There was no doubt of that
after I talked to him.

302
00:14:36,815 --> 00:14:39,118
Miles, he is Ira?

303
00:14:39,118 --> 00:14:41,888
Of course he is.
What do you mean?

304
00:14:41,888 --> 00:14:44,056
It's just Wilma's so positive.

305
00:14:44,056 --> 00:14:45,626
Will she be all right?

306
00:14:45,626 --> 00:14:47,127
I think so.

307
00:14:47,127 --> 00:14:49,062
I'm a doctor,
according to my diploma...

308
00:14:49,062 --> 00:14:51,498
but I don't really know
what Wilma's trouble is.

309
00:14:51,498 --> 00:14:53,801
I could start talking
psychiatrical jargon...

310
00:14:53,801 --> 00:14:56,794
but it's out of my line
and in Dan Kauffman's.

311
00:14:58,573 --> 00:15:01,075
I wish you didn't have
to go home for dinner.

312
00:15:01,075 --> 00:15:04,068
I don't.
Dad's eating out with a friend.

313
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,650
I could pick you up
at 7:00.

314
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,151
Well...

315
00:15:09,151 --> 00:15:11,755
It's summer,
and the moon is full.

316
00:15:11,755 --> 00:15:12,956
"I know a bank...

317
00:15:12,956 --> 00:15:15,792
MILES,  
"where the wild thyme grows."

318
00:15:15,792 --> 00:15:17,487
You haven't changed a bit.

319
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,378
Whup! Whoa! Watch out!

320
00:15:33,378 --> 00:15:34,613
Sorry.

321
00:15:34,613 --> 00:15:36,982
Hey, Miles,
when did you get back?

322
00:15:36,982 --> 00:15:38,218
This morning.
How are you, Danny?

323
00:15:38,218 --> 00:15:39,385
This is Miss Driscoll.

324
00:15:39,385 --> 00:15:41,321
Dr. Kauffman--
our one and only psychiatrist.

325
00:15:41,321 --> 00:15:43,523
Watch out what you say.
Ed, you remember Becky.

326
00:15:43,523 --> 00:15:45,058
I should.
I brought her into the world.

327
00:15:45,058 --> 00:15:46,560
You did us all a favor.

328
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,329
This saves me a phone call.

329
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:51,098
I've got a kid and a woman
who need a witch doctor.

330
00:15:51,098 --> 00:15:52,833
Boy says his father
isn't his father...

331
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,970
and the woman says her sister
isn't her sister?

332
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:56,571
That's pretty close.

333
00:15:56,571 --> 00:15:58,573
I knew you'd been
studying hypnosis...

334
00:15:58,573 --> 00:16:00,375
but when did you start
reading minds?

335
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,877
He doesn't have to read them.

336
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,846
I've sent him a dozen patients
since it started.

337
00:16:03,846 --> 00:16:05,882
What is it?
What's going on?

338
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,384
I don't know.
A strange neurosis...

339
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,187
evidently contagious--
an epidemic of mass hysteria.

340
00:16:11,187 --> 00:16:12,985
In two weeks,
it's spread all over town.

341
00:16:14,091 --> 00:16:15,392
What causes it?

342
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:18,020
Worry about
what's going on in the world.

343
00:16:19,663 --> 00:16:21,666
Make room
for Wilma Lentz tomorrow.

344
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,302
Send her in around 2:00.
Good night.

345
00:16:24,302 --> 00:16:25,462
So long, Danny.

346
00:16:30,543 --> 00:16:34,113
This is the oddest thing
I ever heard of.

347
00:16:34,113 --> 00:16:36,048
Let's hope we don't catch it.

348
00:16:36,048 --> 00:16:38,051
I'd hate to wake up
some morning...

349
00:16:38,051 --> 00:16:39,719
and find out you weren't you.

350
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:42,055
I'm not the high-school
kid you used to romance.

351
00:16:42,055 --> 00:16:43,290
How could you tell?

352
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,457
You really want to know?

353
00:16:44,457 --> 00:16:45,617
Mm-hmm.

354
00:16:52,567 --> 00:16:55,230
Mmm.
You're Becky Driscoll.

355
00:16:57,639 --> 00:16:59,641
Hey, Santa Mira's looking up.

356
00:16:59,641 --> 00:17:02,144
Has ever since you got back.

357
00:17:02,144 --> 00:17:05,148
Is this an example
of your bedside manner, Doctor?

358
00:17:05,148 --> 00:17:07,639
No, ma'am.
That comes later.

359
00:17:18,529 --> 00:17:20,030
Good evening, Doctor.

360
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,000
What happened
to the crowd tonight?

361
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,628
I don't know.
It's been this way for weeks.

362
00:17:26,137 --> 00:17:28,873
At least we don't
have to wait for a table.

363
00:17:28,873 --> 00:17:31,143
Take your pick.
Here or here.

364
00:17:31,143 --> 00:17:32,979
Here, I think.
Shall we?

365
00:17:32,979 --> 00:17:34,146
Mm-hmm.

366
00:17:34,146 --> 00:17:35,548
Where's the band?

367
00:17:35,548 --> 00:17:38,552
Business slumped,
so I had to let them go.

368
00:17:38,552 --> 00:17:39,820
There's the jukebox, though.

369
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,588
Shall we dance?

370
00:17:41,588 --> 00:17:43,557
I hope you didn't
let the bartender go.

371
00:17:43,557 --> 00:17:45,559
I'm the bartender.
Martinis?

372
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:47,391
Two. Dry.

373
00:17:48,563 --> 00:17:50,724
Very dry.

374
00:17:52,066 --> 00:17:54,802
Miles, I don't care
what Dr. Kauffman says.

375
00:17:54,802 --> 00:17:56,071
I'm worried.

376
00:17:56,071 --> 00:17:57,840
You are in the capable hands...

377
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,075
of your personal physician.

378
00:18:00,075 --> 00:18:01,577
Oh, Doctor.

379
00:18:01,577 --> 00:18:04,080
Ah, there's our evening.

380
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,570
Sorry.

381
00:18:08,151 --> 00:18:10,086
Thanks.

382
00:18:10,086 --> 00:18:11,588
Dr. Bennell.

383
00:18:11,588 --> 00:18:15,192
Jack Belicec wants you
to come to his house right away.

384
00:18:15,192 --> 00:18:17,028
He says it's urgent.

385
00:18:17,028 --> 00:18:19,019
Thank you.

386
00:18:20,531 --> 00:18:22,534
Better hold those drinks.

387
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:23,702
Emergency.

388
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:26,204
At least they called
before we ordered dinner.

389
00:18:26,204 --> 00:18:27,372
How hungry are you?

390
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:28,674
I can wait.

391
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:30,043
It may be a while.

392
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:31,544
I'll go with you.

393
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:33,535
Sorry.
We'll be back later.

394
00:18:48,563 --> 00:18:50,554
There's Jack.

395
00:19:03,345 --> 00:19:04,948
What's the matter?
Teddy sick?

396
00:19:04,948 --> 00:19:06,683
No.

397
00:19:06,683 --> 00:19:08,952
Thank heaven.
I thought you'd never arrive.

398
00:19:08,952 --> 00:19:10,353
Then who is sick?

399
00:19:10,353 --> 00:19:11,588
Nobody.

400
00:19:11,588 --> 00:19:14,392
Then why'd you
drag me away from my dinner?

401
00:19:14,392 --> 00:19:16,561
You won't believe it
until you see it.

402
00:19:16,561 --> 00:19:17,862
Hello, Becky.

403
00:19:17,862 --> 00:19:19,454
-Hello, Becky.
-Hi, Teddy.

404
00:19:23,936 --> 00:19:26,505
Could you forget
you're a doctor a while?

405
00:19:26,505 --> 00:19:27,773
Why?

406
00:19:27,773 --> 00:19:29,876
I don't want you
calling the police.

407
00:19:29,876 --> 00:19:32,345
Quit acting like a writer.

408
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:34,905
Maybe you can tell me.
You're the doctor.

409
00:19:45,192 --> 00:19:48,185
Miles, put the light on
over the pool table.

410
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,471
Go on. Pull it down.

411
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,622
What do you make of it?

412
00:20:49,631 --> 00:20:50,799
Who is he?

413
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,199
I have no idea.

414
00:20:58,975 --> 00:21:01,637
Its face, Miles.
It's vague.

415
00:21:02,645 --> 00:21:05,316
Like the first impression
that's stamped on a coin.

416
00:21:05,316 --> 00:21:06,483
It isn't finished.

417
00:21:06,483 --> 00:21:07,651
You're right.

418
00:21:07,651 --> 00:21:09,653
All the features
but no details...

419
00:21:09,653 --> 00:21:11,422
no character, no lines.

420
00:21:11,422 --> 00:21:13,358
It's no dead man.

421
00:21:13,358 --> 00:21:15,360
Have you got
an ink pad around the house?

422
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,429
There's one in the desk.
Why?

423
00:21:17,429 --> 00:21:19,598
I want to take
the corpse's fingerprints.

424
00:21:19,598 --> 00:21:21,901
Of course
it's a dead man.

425
00:21:21,901 --> 00:21:24,637
I don't know,
but I've got a feeling that...

426
00:21:24,637 --> 00:21:27,506
I know this sounds crazy,
but if I should do an autopsy...

427
00:21:27,506 --> 00:21:30,601
I think I'd find every organ
in perfect condition...

428
00:21:32,613 --> 00:21:35,878
as perfect
as the body is externally...

429
00:21:37,885 --> 00:21:39,888
everything in working order.

430
00:21:39,888 --> 00:21:42,948
All set to go. Hold that down.

431
00:21:48,564 --> 00:21:50,332
These are blank.

432
00:21:50,332 --> 00:21:52,635
Waiting for the final
finished face...

433
00:21:52,635 --> 00:21:54,270
to be stamped onto it.

434
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,907
But whose face?

435
00:21:56,907 --> 00:21:58,772
Tell me that.

436
00:21:59,976 --> 00:22:02,137
We could all use a drink.

437
00:22:04,414 --> 00:22:05,716
Bourbon all right?

438
00:22:05,716 --> 00:22:06,918
Fine.

439
00:22:06,918 --> 00:22:08,486
Not for me, thanks.

440
00:22:08,486 --> 00:22:10,788
Miles, answer me.
Whose face?

441
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:12,657
I haven't the slightest idea...

442
00:22:12,657 --> 00:22:13,959
have you?

443
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:17,362
How tall would you say
that thing is?

444
00:22:17,362 --> 00:22:19,364
Oh, 5'10", thereabouts.

445
00:22:19,364 --> 00:22:21,366
How much does it weigh?

446
00:22:21,366 --> 00:22:24,871
It's pretty thin.
Maybe 140 pounds.

447
00:22:24,871 --> 00:22:28,136
Jack's 5'10"
and weighs 140 pounds.

448
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:30,543
Ow!

449
00:22:30,543 --> 00:22:32,880
Teddy, will you stop
talking nonsense?

450
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,884
I'm sorry, darling,
but it isn't nonsense.

451
00:22:36,884 --> 00:22:39,888
Becky, you don't think
it's nonsense, do you?

452
00:22:39,888 --> 00:22:41,256
Of course it is.

453
00:22:41,256 --> 00:22:42,891
Jack's standing here
in front of you.

454
00:22:42,891 --> 00:22:45,327
Of course I am,
bleeding to death.

455
00:22:45,327 --> 00:22:46,494
Excuse me.

456
00:22:46,494 --> 00:22:47,662
You know what?

457
00:22:47,662 --> 00:22:49,927
I'm afraid you may live.

458
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,469
Here, this should fix it.

459
00:22:53,469 --> 00:22:55,404
Miles,
shouldn't we call the police...

460
00:22:55,404 --> 00:22:58,408
and have them take
that dead body out of here?

461
00:22:58,408 --> 00:23:01,411
I'm afraid
it isn't just a dead body.

462
00:23:01,411 --> 00:23:02,901
Thanks.

463
00:23:12,857 --> 00:23:14,348
I wonder if...

464
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:16,862
What?

465
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,697
I wonder
if there's any connection.

466
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:20,466
What do you mean?

467
00:23:20,466 --> 00:23:22,869
There's something
strange afoot in Santa Mira.

468
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:27,374
Dr. Kauffman calls it
an epidemic of mass hysteria.

469
00:23:27,374 --> 00:23:29,876
Becky's cousin's got it,
for one.

470
00:23:29,876 --> 00:23:32,113
She thinks that her uncle
and her aunt...

471
00:23:32,113 --> 00:23:33,881
aren't her uncle and her aunt.

472
00:23:33,881 --> 00:23:36,384
There's several cases
of such delusion.

473
00:23:36,384 --> 00:23:39,387
This isn't you yet...

474
00:23:39,387 --> 00:23:42,380
but there is
a structural likeness.

475
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:45,127
It's fantastic.

476
00:23:45,127 --> 00:23:47,229
There must be some reason
this is here.

477
00:23:47,229 --> 00:23:49,232
Would you be willing
to sit up...

478
00:23:49,232 --> 00:23:51,167
and see what your friend's
next move is?

479
00:23:51,167 --> 00:23:54,637
If nothing happens by morning,
call the police.

480
00:23:54,637 --> 00:23:56,139
If something happens...

481
00:23:56,139 --> 00:23:57,975
call me, will you?

482
00:23:57,975 --> 00:23:59,636
You know I will.

483
00:24:05,917 --> 00:24:07,752
Good night.
Take it easy.

484
00:24:07,752 --> 00:24:08,920
Sure.

485
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,255
Nothing will happen.

486
00:24:10,255 --> 00:24:11,489
Good night, Becky.

487
00:24:11,489 --> 00:24:12,657
If it does...

488
00:24:12,657 --> 00:24:15,559
it'll make a charming,
bloodcurdling mystery story.

489
00:24:23,437 --> 00:24:26,106
I was careful
not to let Becky know...

490
00:24:26,106 --> 00:24:27,374
but I was really scared.

491
00:24:27,374 --> 00:24:30,544
Dan Kauffman's explanation
of what was wrong in town...

492
00:24:30,544 --> 00:24:31,946
mass hysteria...

493
00:24:31,946 --> 00:24:34,938
couldn't explain away that body
on Jack's billiard table.

494
00:24:48,097 --> 00:24:51,067
Come in
while I turn the lights on.

495
00:24:51,067 --> 00:24:52,402
You're a forward wench...

496
00:24:52,402 --> 00:24:54,404
dragging me into a dark hallway
to be kissed.

497
00:24:54,404 --> 00:24:56,739
I'm dragging you
into a dark hallway...

498
00:24:56,739 --> 00:24:58,976
because I'm scared of the dark
tonight.

499
00:24:58,976 --> 00:25:01,145
I'd better stay
and tuck you in.

500
00:25:01,145 --> 00:25:02,669
That way lies madness.

501
00:25:04,715 --> 00:25:06,551
What's wrong with madness?

502
00:25:06,551 --> 00:25:08,382
Madness.
Now good night.

503
00:25:16,362 --> 00:25:19,365
It's about time
you two got home.

504
00:25:19,365 --> 00:25:22,301
Dad, what are you doing
in the basement this late?

505
00:25:22,301 --> 00:25:23,704
Working in my shop.

506
00:25:23,704 --> 00:25:24,938
Want a nightcap, doc?

507
00:25:24,938 --> 00:25:26,273
No, thanks.
It's kind of late.

508
00:25:26,273 --> 00:25:28,375
I'll take a rain check.
Good night.

509
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:29,877
Good night.

510
00:25:29,877 --> 00:25:31,378
Good night.

511
00:25:31,378 --> 00:25:33,370
Good night, Miles.

512
00:26:05,316 --> 00:26:07,252
Aaah!

513
00:26:07,252 --> 00:26:08,921
Look, Jack!

514
00:26:08,921 --> 00:26:10,923
It's you! It's you!

515
00:26:10,923 --> 00:26:12,858
No, no!
You mustn't go near it!

516
00:26:12,858 --> 00:26:14,861
Get out of here! Please!

517
00:26:14,861 --> 00:26:16,351
Please!

518
00:26:17,363 --> 00:26:18,830
Miles!

519
00:26:20,366 --> 00:26:21,868
What happened, Jack?

520
00:26:21,868 --> 00:26:24,371
Teddy says the thing
in our place is me...

521
00:26:24,371 --> 00:26:27,274
right down
to the cut on my hand.

522
00:26:27,274 --> 00:26:28,709
I didn't wait to look.

523
00:26:28,709 --> 00:26:30,878
It's alive! It's alive!

524
00:26:30,878 --> 00:26:33,381
The hand was cut and bleeding!

525
00:26:33,381 --> 00:26:36,384
And the position
of the body had changed!

526
00:26:36,384 --> 00:26:38,113
Here, here. Take this.

527
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,519
I'll call Danny Kauffman.

528
00:27:04,182 --> 00:27:05,350
Hello?

529
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,552
Hello, Danny?

530
00:27:06,552 --> 00:27:07,720
Yeah?

531
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,022
Something's happened.
I've got to see you.

532
00:27:10,022 --> 00:27:12,124
Will you get over here fast?

533
00:27:12,124 --> 00:27:14,159
It's important.

534
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,594
Oh...OK.

535
00:27:19,366 --> 00:27:20,533
He's on his way.

536
00:27:20,533 --> 00:27:22,369
I'll make some coffee
and be right with you.

537
00:27:22,369 --> 00:27:23,803
Good deal, Miles.
Thanks.

538
00:27:26,173 --> 00:27:28,641
What about Becky?
Do you think she's all right?

539
00:27:39,421 --> 00:27:42,125
Dad, what are you
doing in the basement this late?

540
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:43,490
Working in my shop.

541
00:27:46,029 --> 00:27:47,830
I don't know what it was...

542
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,132
call it a premonition...

543
00:27:49,132 --> 00:27:52,136
but suddenly, I had the feeling
that Becky was in danger.

544
00:27:52,136 --> 00:27:54,127
I had to get to her
as quickly as possible.

545
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,296
I was going
to ring the bell...

546
00:28:16,296 --> 00:28:18,526
but then I had a hunch
I'd better be careful.

547
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:21,429
Something was wrong
in this house.

548
00:31:11,558 --> 00:31:12,993
Becky.

549
00:31:12,993 --> 00:31:14,160
Becky!

550
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,491
Becky!

551
00:31:48,032 --> 00:31:50,535
Miles, will you tell me
what happened?

552
00:31:50,535 --> 00:31:51,870
The same thing.

553
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,305
I found another one...

554
00:31:53,305 --> 00:31:55,006
in the cellar
at Becky's house...

555
00:31:55,006 --> 00:31:57,542
coming to life
while I stood there watching it.

556
00:31:57,542 --> 00:31:59,045
It was Becky.

557
00:31:59,045 --> 00:32:01,881
Yeah? I want to see
one of these bodies.

558
00:32:01,881 --> 00:32:03,349
All right.

559
00:32:03,349 --> 00:32:06,218
You're going to bed,
and you're staying with her.

560
00:32:06,218 --> 00:32:08,488
Put on your clothes.
We'll go to Jack's first.

561
00:32:08,488 --> 00:32:09,990
Got any coffee around here?

562
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:12,559
Yeah.
You'll find some in the kitchen.

563
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,494
He doesn't believe me, Beck.

564
00:32:14,494 --> 00:32:16,656
He will.

565
00:32:28,677 --> 00:32:30,579
Somebody's playing games!

566
00:32:30,579 --> 00:32:32,715
Rough ones.

567
00:32:32,715 --> 00:32:35,352
There's a blood spot.

568
00:32:35,352 --> 00:32:37,887
What you saw was the body
of a murdered man.

569
00:32:37,887 --> 00:32:39,522
Did you examine it carefully?

570
00:32:39,522 --> 00:32:40,690
Yes.

571
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:42,793
I don't know
what's happened to it.

572
00:32:42,793 --> 00:32:45,162
It wasn't an ordinary body.
There wasn't a mark on it.

573
00:32:45,162 --> 00:32:47,298
I checked it, too.
Not a scratch.

574
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,532
You can kill a man...

575
00:32:48,532 --> 00:32:50,534
by shoving an ice pick
into the base of his brain...

576
00:32:50,534 --> 00:32:53,071
leaving a puncture so small
the naked eye can't see.

577
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:55,707
You're ignoring the fact
this wasn't a normal body.

578
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:57,409
What about the hand
Teddy mentioned?

579
00:32:57,409 --> 00:33:00,780
I heard lots of things
Teddy said and none made sense.

580
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:03,016
Hold on, pal.
I was here, too.

581
00:33:03,016 --> 00:33:04,784
So was Miles.

582
00:33:04,784 --> 00:33:07,053
Look, we took his fingerprints.

583
00:33:07,053 --> 00:33:09,957
Look at that.
Tell me why it didn't have any.

584
00:33:09,957 --> 00:33:12,593
He didn't want any,
so he took them off with acid.

585
00:33:12,593 --> 00:33:14,361
Stop trying
to rationalize everything.

586
00:33:14,361 --> 00:33:16,196
We have a mystery on our hands.

587
00:33:16,196 --> 00:33:17,666
Sure. A real one.

588
00:33:17,666 --> 00:33:20,168
Whose body was it,
and where is it now?

589
00:33:20,168 --> 00:33:21,836
A completely normal mystery.

590
00:33:21,836 --> 00:33:24,673
Whatever it is, it's well within
the bounds of human experience.

591
00:33:24,673 --> 00:33:26,342
Don't blow things
out of proportion.

592
00:33:26,342 --> 00:33:28,711
I wouldn't if I hadn't
looked in Becky's cellar.

593
00:33:28,711 --> 00:33:30,546
How do you explain the body
I saw there?

594
00:33:30,546 --> 00:33:32,114
I don't think you saw one.

595
00:33:32,114 --> 00:33:33,449
And the body here?

596
00:33:33,449 --> 00:33:35,852
I know you saw it.
Three others saw it, too.

597
00:33:35,852 --> 00:33:37,587
But I dreamed up
the second one?

598
00:33:37,587 --> 00:33:39,690
Doctors can have
hallucinations, too.

599
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,758
The mind is a strange
and wonderful thing.

600
00:33:41,758 --> 00:33:44,128
I'm not sure it'll ever be able
to figure itself out.

601
00:33:44,128 --> 00:33:46,698
Everything else, maybe--
from the atom to the universe--

602
00:33:46,698 --> 00:33:48,099
everything except itself.

603
00:33:48,099 --> 00:33:50,601
Nevertheless,
I saw Becky's double...

604
00:33:50,601 --> 00:33:52,037
and the body that we saw here...

605
00:33:52,037 --> 00:33:54,206
bore an uncomfortable
resemblance to Jack.

606
00:33:54,206 --> 00:33:55,874
Mighty uncomfortable.

607
00:33:55,874 --> 00:33:58,206
Let's go to Becky's
and have a look.

608
00:34:02,048 --> 00:34:04,551
Where's your
girlfriend's double?

609
00:34:04,551 --> 00:34:06,712
OK, skeptic,
lift the lid.

610
00:34:18,366 --> 00:34:19,801
There's a body here,
all right.

611
00:34:19,801 --> 00:34:21,503
-It's Becky's double.
-It sure is.

612
00:34:21,503 --> 00:34:22,834
Take another look.

613
00:34:26,509 --> 00:34:29,278
Now you see it,
now you don't.

614
00:34:29,278 --> 00:34:32,248
It was there--
half-hidden by that blanket.

615
00:34:32,248 --> 00:34:35,419
You said
you saw it there just now.

616
00:34:35,419 --> 00:34:36,587
I thought I did.

617
00:34:36,587 --> 00:34:38,489
Why did you come here
tonight?

618
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:40,190
You'd seen a dead man
at Jack's...

619
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,525
an average-sized man.

620
00:34:41,525 --> 00:34:43,695
The face in death
was smooth and unlined...

621
00:34:43,695 --> 00:34:46,264
bland in expression,
which often happens.

622
00:34:46,264 --> 00:34:47,699
You had just become aware...

623
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:50,568
of a curious, unexplainable,
epidemic mass hysteria.

624
00:34:50,568 --> 00:34:53,706
Men, women, and children
suddenly convinced themselves...

625
00:34:53,706 --> 00:34:55,574
that their relatives weren't
their relatives at all...

626
00:34:55,574 --> 00:34:57,843
so your mind
started playing tricks...

627
00:34:57,843 --> 00:34:59,980
and reality became unreality.

628
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,916
The dead man became
Jack's double in your eyes.

629
00:35:02,916 --> 00:35:04,084
Come off it, Dan.

630
00:35:04,084 --> 00:35:06,286
I know
it's all hard to believe...

631
00:35:06,286 --> 00:35:09,056
but these things happen--
even to witch doctors like me.

632
00:35:09,056 --> 00:35:11,826
I saw her here!
She was real!

633
00:35:11,826 --> 00:35:13,861
You saw her
in every tiny detail...

634
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:16,230
as vividly as anyone
has ever seen anything...

635
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,600
but only in your mind.

636
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,501
Danny, talk all night,
but you're not convincing me.

637
00:35:23,505 --> 00:35:26,176
What are you doing in my cellar?

638
00:35:26,176 --> 00:35:29,179
Using it for an office.
These gentlemen are patients...

639
00:35:29,179 --> 00:35:31,477
badly in need
of psychiatric treatment.

640
00:35:32,749 --> 00:35:34,485
They've been having nightmares.

641
00:35:34,485 --> 00:35:35,786
If you're drunk,
you'd better sober up quick.

642
00:35:35,786 --> 00:35:37,021
The police are coming.

643
00:35:37,021 --> 00:35:38,355
No, we're not drunk.

644
00:35:38,355 --> 00:35:40,491
Nothing that simple.
Pull up a chair.

645
00:35:40,491 --> 00:35:42,026
Why, you're all crazy.

646
00:35:42,026 --> 00:35:44,462
What's going on down there?

647
00:35:44,462 --> 00:35:46,498
Hello, Nick.
Glad to see you.

648
00:35:46,498 --> 00:35:50,535
You saved these two characters
a trip to the station.

649
00:35:50,535 --> 00:35:54,273
They want to report
finding a body and losing it.

650
00:35:54,273 --> 00:35:56,042
Where? When?

651
00:35:56,042 --> 00:35:58,077
At my place about 7:00.

652
00:35:58,077 --> 00:36:00,681
Why did you
wait so long to report it?

653
00:36:00,681 --> 00:36:02,149
You know better than that, doc.

654
00:36:02,149 --> 00:36:05,719
It was a curious sort
of a body...

655
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:09,090
and then it wasn't there
anymore.

656
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:12,493
I have a good mind
to throw you both in jail.

657
00:36:12,493 --> 00:36:14,863
If you'd seen it,
you'd understand why we waited.

658
00:36:14,863 --> 00:36:18,033
Thin man...5'10"...

659
00:36:18,033 --> 00:36:19,902
fingerprints burned off
with acid?

660
00:36:19,902 --> 00:36:23,272
Just seen it on the slab
in the morgue.

661
00:36:23,272 --> 00:36:24,506
Turned up
in a burning haystack...

662
00:36:24,506 --> 00:36:28,011
on Mike Gessner's south pasture
two hours ago.

663
00:36:28,011 --> 00:36:30,413
Now break it up!

664
00:36:30,413 --> 00:36:32,005
Go on home!

665
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:42,682
You win.
Pick up the marbles.

666
00:36:49,234 --> 00:36:50,402
Good morning.

667
00:36:50,402 --> 00:36:51,733
Good morning.

668
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,576
Orange juice.

669
00:36:56,576 --> 00:36:58,444
Thank you.

670
00:36:58,444 --> 00:37:00,179
How do you
like your eggs?

671
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:01,849
Any way you'd like.

672
00:37:01,849 --> 00:37:03,117
Boiled, two minutes?

673
00:37:03,117 --> 00:37:04,285
Two minutes?

674
00:37:04,285 --> 00:37:05,786
Mm-hmm.

675
00:37:05,786 --> 00:37:07,048
OK.

676
00:37:08,088 --> 00:37:09,658
You know...

677
00:37:09,658 --> 00:37:12,727
dragging you out of bed
last night was some trouble...

678
00:37:12,727 --> 00:37:14,062
but it was worth it.

679
00:37:14,062 --> 00:37:15,188
Seriously, Miles.

680
00:37:16,498 --> 00:37:18,160
What was that?

681
00:37:21,504 --> 00:37:22,664
Who is it?

682
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,376
It's the gas man.

683
00:37:26,376 --> 00:37:27,604
Morning, doc.

684
00:37:29,379 --> 00:37:30,981
Good morning, Charlie.

685
00:37:30,981 --> 00:37:32,249
I guess I'm a little jittery.

686
00:37:32,249 --> 00:37:34,184
Not getting enough sleep.

687
00:37:34,184 --> 00:37:35,920
I won't bother you anymore.

688
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,156
Putting a meter outside
on the patio.

689
00:37:38,156 --> 00:37:39,357
OK.

690
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:41,693
The eggs will be hard-boiled.

691
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:43,227
Did you do this
for your husband?

692
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:44,396
Mm-hmm.

693
00:37:44,396 --> 00:37:46,098
Didn't your wife
do this for you?

694
00:37:46,098 --> 00:37:48,968
Yes. She liked to cook.

695
00:37:48,968 --> 00:37:51,136
That's one of the reasons
why I'm single--

696
00:37:51,136 --> 00:37:54,174
I never was there
when dinner was on the table.

697
00:37:54,174 --> 00:37:55,642
Take my advice...

698
00:37:55,642 --> 00:37:57,344
and don't get mixed up
with a doctor.

699
00:37:57,344 --> 00:37:58,712
They're seldom at home.

700
00:37:58,712 --> 00:38:00,715
What would you say
if I told you...

701
00:38:00,715 --> 00:38:03,217
I was already
mixed up with a doctor?

702
00:38:03,217 --> 00:38:05,653
I'd say it was too good
to be true.

703
00:38:05,653 --> 00:38:08,189
Things like this
can happen all of a sudden.

704
00:38:08,189 --> 00:38:09,624
What's "all of a sudden"
about two people...

705
00:38:09,624 --> 00:38:11,615
who've been friends
most of their lives?

706
00:38:12,828 --> 00:38:14,162
Good morning.

707
00:38:14,162 --> 00:38:15,764
Good morning.

708
00:38:15,764 --> 00:38:17,065
I thought
I smelled some coffee.

709
00:38:17,065 --> 00:38:18,234
Why didn't you give me a call?

710
00:38:18,234 --> 00:38:19,535
I didn't want to wake Teddy.

711
00:38:19,535 --> 00:38:22,271
She's wide-awake.
Got a good sleep.

712
00:38:22,271 --> 00:38:24,007
Good.

713
00:38:24,007 --> 00:38:26,910
But I don't feel
she should go home right away.

714
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:30,180
Would you mind taking in
boarders for a while?

715
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:33,517
Or do you have something else
in mind?

716
00:38:33,517 --> 00:38:36,187
I was toying with an idea...

717
00:38:36,187 --> 00:38:37,655
but you can stay.

718
00:38:37,655 --> 00:38:39,391
Here, Jack.

719
00:38:39,391 --> 00:38:41,518
Thank you, doll.
I'll take it to Teddy.

720
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,673
Miles, did you make
that appointment for me...

721
00:38:53,673 --> 00:38:54,841
with the psychiatrist?

722
00:38:54,841 --> 00:38:56,343
Yes. 2:00.

723
00:38:56,343 --> 00:38:59,546
I don't need him.
I feel like such a fool.

724
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:02,083
I woke up this morning,
and everything was all right.

725
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:04,419
-You don't know my relief.
-Yes, I do.

726
00:39:04,419 --> 00:39:07,055
Will you call Becky
and tell her? She was worried.

727
00:39:07,055 --> 00:39:08,222
All right.

728
00:39:08,222 --> 00:39:09,725
She's at your house.

729
00:39:09,725 --> 00:39:11,260
At your house? Why?

730
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,854
It's a long story,
but she'll tell you about it.

731
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,341
Becky's still at his house.

732
00:39:35,186 --> 00:39:36,654
All right.

733
00:39:38,857 --> 00:39:40,225
Good morning.

734
00:39:40,225 --> 00:39:42,160
Good morning, Sally.

735
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,629
Take a peek at what's
in the reception room.

736
00:39:48,601 --> 00:39:51,037
Mother,
why don't we go home?

737
00:39:51,037 --> 00:39:52,801
In a little while,
Jimmy.

738
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:59,008
He certainly made
a quick recovery.

739
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,652
I guess we all have.

740
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:05,887
But driving home...

741
00:40:05,887 --> 00:40:08,223
I had a lot of questions
and no answers.

742
00:40:08,223 --> 00:40:11,193
How could Jimmy and Wilma
seem so normal now?

743
00:40:11,193 --> 00:40:13,129
Surely I had done nothing
to cure them.

744
00:40:13,129 --> 00:40:17,065
Maybe they wanted me
to feel secure, but why?

745
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,569
Well...

746
00:40:19,569 --> 00:40:21,571
I hope
you didn't forget the steaks.

747
00:40:21,571 --> 00:40:23,073
I never forget anything.

748
00:40:23,073 --> 00:40:26,109
Don't worry about him.
He's completely housebroken.

749
00:40:26,109 --> 00:40:27,778
I need a martini, Beck.

750
00:40:27,778 --> 00:40:28,946
Onion or olive?

751
00:40:28,946 --> 00:40:31,249
Doesn't matter.
I want to pour it on the coals.

752
00:40:31,249 --> 00:40:32,450
They just won't burn.

753
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:34,385
A martini isn't dry enough.

754
00:40:34,385 --> 00:40:36,588
I'll get you something
that'll start it.

755
00:40:36,588 --> 00:40:38,249
For drinking purposes.

756
00:40:39,858 --> 00:40:41,393
You're looking shipshape.

757
00:40:41,393 --> 00:40:42,951
Thank you, sir.

758
00:40:52,872 --> 00:40:54,204
Here we are.

759
00:41:16,866 --> 00:41:18,858
Jack! Jack!

760
00:41:23,373 --> 00:41:24,533
Ugh.

761
00:41:28,413 --> 00:41:30,745
They're like huge seedpods!

762
00:41:31,349 --> 00:41:34,341
This must be how that
body in my closet was formed.

763
00:41:36,188 --> 00:41:37,656
Where are they from?

764
00:41:37,656 --> 00:41:39,992
I don't know.
If they are seeds or seedpods...

765
00:41:39,992 --> 00:41:41,860
they must grow someplace
on a plant.

766
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:44,698
And somebody or something wants
this duplication to take place.

767
00:41:44,698 --> 00:41:46,366
But when they're finished...

768
00:41:46,366 --> 00:41:47,534
what happens to our bodies?

769
00:41:47,534 --> 00:41:48,768
I don't know.

770
00:41:48,768 --> 00:41:50,937
When the process is complete,
probably the original...

771
00:41:50,937 --> 00:41:52,372
is destroyed or disintegrates...

772
00:41:52,372 --> 00:41:53,541
No! Wait!

773
00:41:53,541 --> 00:41:55,009
Sorry,
but I take a dim view...

774
00:41:55,009 --> 00:41:56,644
of watching my own destruction
take place.

775
00:41:56,644 --> 00:41:58,980
There isn't any danger
until they're completely formed.

776
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,781
We learned that last night
at your house.

777
00:42:00,781 --> 00:42:02,784
Your blank
didn't change right away.

778
00:42:02,784 --> 00:42:04,809
Not until you fell asleep.

779
00:42:06,588 --> 00:42:09,591
Miles, when the change
does take place...

780
00:42:09,591 --> 00:42:11,628
do you suppose
there's any difference?

781
00:42:11,628 --> 00:42:12,895
There must be.

782
00:42:12,895 --> 00:42:15,732
Wilma noticed it.
So did little Jimmy.

783
00:42:15,732 --> 00:42:18,067
So did I.

784
00:42:18,067 --> 00:42:20,437
My father.

785
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:23,040
That must be
what he was doing...

786
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,843
in the cellar last night--
placing one of these.

787
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:27,011
I'm sorry.

788
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:29,080
I felt something wrong,
but I thought it was me...

789
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,749
because I'd been away
for so long.

790
00:42:30,749 --> 00:42:33,084
They must be destroyed,
all of them!

791
00:42:33,084 --> 00:42:34,586
They will be--
every one of them.

792
00:42:34,586 --> 00:42:36,856
We're going to have
to search every building...

793
00:42:36,856 --> 00:42:38,124
every house in town.

794
00:42:38,124 --> 00:42:39,825
Men, women, and children
have to be examined.

795
00:42:39,825 --> 00:42:41,060
We've got some phoning to do.

796
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,361
I'm going to stay
and watch them.

797
00:42:42,361 --> 00:42:43,529
I'm staying with you.

798
00:42:43,529 --> 00:42:44,764
Don't call the police!

799
00:42:44,764 --> 00:42:45,999
Nick Grivett
didn't find any body...

800
00:42:45,999 --> 00:42:47,557
on a burning haystack!

801
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,143
Why don't you call
Danny? Maybe he can help.

802
00:42:55,143 --> 00:42:56,611
Danny?

803
00:42:56,611 --> 00:42:57,812
No.

804
00:42:57,812 --> 00:42:59,580
I'm afraid it's too late
to call Danny, too.

805
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,049
What are you going to do?

806
00:43:01,049 --> 00:43:02,217
Get help.

807
00:43:02,217 --> 00:43:05,243
I hope whatever's taking place
is confined to Santa Mira!

808
00:43:13,129 --> 00:43:14,297
Operator.

809
00:43:14,297 --> 00:43:16,399
This is Dr. Bennell.
This is an emergency.

810
00:43:16,399 --> 00:43:19,570
I want to talk to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation in L.A.

811
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:21,005
Can you convince them?

812
00:43:21,005 --> 00:43:22,340
I've got to.

813
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:23,941
Where did they come from?

814
00:43:23,941 --> 00:43:26,744
So much has been
discovered these past few years.

815
00:43:26,744 --> 00:43:27,912
Anything is possible.

816
00:43:27,912 --> 00:43:29,748
Maybe the results
of atomic radiation...

817
00:43:29,748 --> 00:43:32,050
on plant life or animal life...

818
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:35,587
some weird alien organism,
a mutation of some kind.

819
00:43:35,587 --> 00:43:38,291
Why should they take the form
of people--of us?

820
00:43:38,291 --> 00:43:40,426
I don't know.

821
00:43:40,426 --> 00:43:41,627
Whatever it is...

822
00:43:41,627 --> 00:43:43,429
whatever intelligence
or instinct it is...

823
00:43:43,429 --> 00:43:47,101
that can govern the forming
of human flesh and blood...

824
00:43:47,101 --> 00:43:48,969
out of thin air is...

825
00:43:48,969 --> 00:43:50,504
well,
it's fantastically powerful...

826
00:43:50,504 --> 00:43:52,673
beyond any comprehension,
malignant.

827
00:43:52,673 --> 00:43:53,908
All that body
in your cellar needed...

828
00:43:53,908 --> 00:43:56,277
was a mind, and it was...

829
00:43:56,277 --> 00:43:58,713
And it was taking mine
while I was asleep.

830
00:43:58,713 --> 00:44:00,815
I could take
that pitchfork myself, and--

831
00:44:00,815 --> 00:44:03,152
On your call
to Los Angeles, Doctor...

832
00:44:03,152 --> 00:44:04,720
they don't answer.

833
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,289
Try again! That office
is open day and night!

834
00:44:07,289 --> 00:44:10,087
If they've taken over
the phone office, we're dead.

835
00:44:25,243 --> 00:44:27,234
Is that me?

836
00:44:57,512 --> 00:44:59,714
This is an emergency!
Emergency!

837
00:44:59,714 --> 00:45:01,773
Look, there's been--Hello?

838
00:45:03,319 --> 00:45:05,555
Operator,
get me a better connection.

839
00:45:05,555 --> 00:45:06,988
I'll try, Doctor.

840
00:45:08,524 --> 00:45:09,692
It's no use.

841
00:45:09,692 --> 00:45:11,695
All the Los Angeles circuits
are dead.

842
00:45:11,695 --> 00:45:14,598
OK, try Sacramento!
Give me the state capital.

843
00:45:14,598 --> 00:45:16,623
I want to talk to the governor.

844
00:45:18,469 --> 00:45:21,172
The Sacramento
circuits are busy, Doctor.

845
00:45:21,172 --> 00:45:22,730
I'll call you back.

846
00:45:24,609 --> 00:45:26,444
All right.

847
00:45:26,444 --> 00:45:27,934
All right.
I'll wait for your call.

848
00:45:31,817 --> 00:45:33,808
I'll take the phone outside.

849
00:45:37,457 --> 00:45:39,226
Jack, they've got the phone.

850
00:45:39,226 --> 00:45:42,195
You and the girls take your car
and make a run for it.

851
00:45:42,195 --> 00:45:44,097
First town you get to,
yell for help.

852
00:45:44,097 --> 00:45:45,298
What about you?

853
00:45:45,298 --> 00:45:46,701
That phone
is gonna ring soon.

854
00:45:46,701 --> 00:45:49,170
If nobody answers,
they'll block the roads.

855
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:50,338
I'll stall them.

856
00:45:50,338 --> 00:45:51,606
Then what?

857
00:45:51,606 --> 00:45:53,007
Try and find out
what's in back of this.

858
00:45:53,007 --> 00:45:54,643
-I'm staying.
-No!

859
00:45:54,643 --> 00:45:56,474
Miles,
don't ask me to leave you.

860
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,448
Jack, get going.

861
00:45:59,448 --> 00:46:01,016
Miles, I can't--

862
00:46:01,016 --> 00:46:02,518
Somebody's got to go,
or we don't get help!

863
00:46:02,518 --> 00:46:04,153
Please,
let's get out of here!

864
00:46:04,153 --> 00:46:05,882
Watch out for yourselves.

865
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:10,193
Go over by the phone.
Stay there.

866
00:46:10,193 --> 00:46:11,490
If it rings, call me.

867
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:52,240
Hello.

868
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,675
Is Dr. Bennell there?

869
00:46:53,675 --> 00:46:55,911
-Yes. I'll get him.
-Never mind.

870
00:46:55,911 --> 00:46:58,213
Just tell him the Sacramento
circuits are still busy...

871
00:46:58,213 --> 00:46:59,882
and ask him if he wants me
to keep trying.

872
00:46:59,882 --> 00:47:01,250
All right. Hold on.

873
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:03,353
Miles,
the circuits are still busy!

874
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:04,721
Tell her to keep trying!

875
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:06,882
Also, try San Francisco
and Washington!

876
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:14,699
We're getting
out of here right now.

877
00:47:14,699 --> 00:47:15,933
Where are we going?

878
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:17,093
Sally's!

879
00:47:19,637 --> 00:47:21,607
We're still unable
to get through to Los Angeles.

880
00:47:21,607 --> 00:47:23,976
Do you wish me to keep trying?

881
00:47:23,976 --> 00:47:25,204
Dr. Bennell?

882
00:47:26,445 --> 00:47:28,113
Dr. Bennell?

883
00:47:28,113 --> 00:47:29,916
I needed
someone I could trust...

884
00:47:29,916 --> 00:47:33,052
and I figured Sally, my nurse,
was my best bet.

885
00:47:33,052 --> 00:47:36,222
I decided to try to phone her
to see if she was at home.

886
00:47:36,222 --> 00:47:38,225
Maybe they hadn't
taken over the pay phones.

887
00:47:38,225 --> 00:47:40,494
I'll try the pay phone.

888
00:47:40,494 --> 00:47:42,496
Hey, Mac!

889
00:47:42,496 --> 00:47:44,264
Oh, hi, doc.
How are you?

890
00:47:44,264 --> 00:47:46,935
Will you get me
a couple gallons fast?

891
00:47:46,935 --> 00:47:49,104
Sure.
Martha, doc's in a hurry!

892
00:47:49,104 --> 00:47:50,469
Get the windshield, will you?

893
00:47:53,675 --> 00:47:56,668
I have to have the keys
to open the gas tank.

894
00:47:58,948 --> 00:48:01,417
Somebody sick out this way?

895
00:48:01,417 --> 00:48:03,252
There's been an accident.

896
00:48:03,252 --> 00:48:05,389
Funny.
We haven't heard about it.

897
00:48:05,389 --> 00:48:07,024
It just happened.

898
00:48:07,024 --> 00:48:09,459
Before I could
even get her number...

899
00:48:09,459 --> 00:48:11,561
I saw Mac closing
the trunk of my car.

900
00:48:11,561 --> 00:48:12,864
He could have been
checking my spare tire...

901
00:48:12,864 --> 00:48:14,499
but I didn't think so.

902
00:48:14,499 --> 00:48:15,667
That should do it.

903
00:48:15,667 --> 00:48:16,868
Thank you.

904
00:48:16,868 --> 00:48:18,069
All set?

905
00:48:18,069 --> 00:48:19,604
-All set, doc.
-Fine. Thanks.

906
00:48:19,604 --> 00:48:22,096
-Put it on my bill, will you?
-Sure, doc.

907
00:48:41,729 --> 00:48:43,629
What's the matter?

908
00:49:09,593 --> 00:49:11,993
We've got to make it
to Sally's house.

909
00:49:21,807 --> 00:49:24,677
I wasn't sure
I could trust anyone...

910
00:49:24,677 --> 00:49:27,168
but I took a chance
and drove to Sally's anyway.

911
00:49:33,353 --> 00:49:36,056
When I saw several cars
in front of the house...

912
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,614
I decided to play it safe.

913
00:49:43,531 --> 00:49:44,832
What's wrong?

914
00:49:44,832 --> 00:49:46,834
Probably nothing,
but we're not going in there...

915
00:49:46,834 --> 00:49:48,070
until I'm sure it's safe.

916
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:50,239
Slide under the wheel
and get out of here fast...

917
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:52,571
if anybody shows up
looking for us.

918
00:50:19,738 --> 00:50:21,440
The baby asleep yet, Sally?

919
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,376
Not yet,
but she will be soon...

920
00:50:23,376 --> 00:50:25,578
and there'll be no more tears.

921
00:50:25,578 --> 00:50:27,413
Shall I put this in her room?

922
00:50:27,413 --> 00:50:29,081
Yes. In her playpen.

923
00:50:29,081 --> 00:50:32,319
No, wait.
Maybe I'd better take it.

924
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,720
Why don't you go in, Miles?

925
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,415
We've been waiting for you.

926
00:50:41,963 --> 00:50:44,165
Becky, start the car!
Quick!

927
00:50:44,165 --> 00:50:45,894
Becky, get going!

928
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:58,348
Attention, all units...

929
00:50:58,348 --> 00:51:01,251
attention, all units--
apprehend and detain...

930
00:51:01,251 --> 00:51:04,154
Dr. Miles Bennell
and Becky Driscoll...

931
00:51:04,154 --> 00:51:05,523
now believed heading north...

932
00:51:05,523 --> 00:51:07,491
in a black and white
Ford sedan...

933
00:51:07,491 --> 00:51:12,597
license number 2-X-3-7-7-9-6.

934
00:51:12,597 --> 00:51:14,733
All units designated
as roadblocks...

935
00:51:14,733 --> 00:51:16,268
move to your stations.

936
00:51:16,268 --> 00:51:17,469
It is urgent.

937
00:51:17,469 --> 00:51:19,271
These two persons
must be detained...

938
00:51:19,271 --> 00:51:21,506
and not permitted
to leave Santa Mira.

939
00:51:21,506 --> 00:51:23,668
Repeat--it is urgent...

940
00:51:26,546 --> 00:51:31,285
Be on the lookout for a 1 955
black and white Ford sedan...

941
00:51:31,285 --> 00:51:35,745
license number 2-X-3-7-7-9-6.

942
00:52:10,995 --> 00:52:13,532
We'll try to make it
to my office.

943
00:52:13,532 --> 00:52:15,022
Cut into that alley
on the right.

944
00:53:46,235 --> 00:53:48,905
Do you think he'll come back?

945
00:53:48,905 --> 00:53:51,941
I don't think they'll
check again before morning.

946
00:53:51,941 --> 00:53:55,035
By then, Jack should be here
with help.

947
00:54:00,584 --> 00:54:03,421
What if
Jack doesn't get through?

948
00:54:03,421 --> 00:54:04,989
He's gotta get through.

949
00:54:04,989 --> 00:54:06,858
Here. Take two of these.

950
00:54:06,858 --> 00:54:08,849
They'll help you to stay awake.

951
00:54:26,413 --> 00:54:28,916
We can't close our eyes
all night.

952
00:54:28,916 --> 00:54:30,508
We may wake up changed...

953
00:54:31,953 --> 00:54:34,080
into something evil and inhuman.

954
00:54:35,824 --> 00:54:37,525
In my practice,
I've seen how people...

955
00:54:37,525 --> 00:54:40,196
have allowed their humanity
to drain away.

956
00:54:40,196 --> 00:54:43,933
Only, it happens slowly
instead of all at once.

957
00:54:43,933 --> 00:54:45,801
They didn't seem to mind.

958
00:54:45,801 --> 00:54:47,870
But just some people.

959
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:50,373
All of us--a little bit.

960
00:54:50,373 --> 00:54:53,944
We harden our hearts
and grow callous.

961
00:54:53,944 --> 00:54:55,912
Only when we have to fight
to stay human...

962
00:54:55,912 --> 00:54:59,584
do we realize how precious
it is to us...

963
00:54:59,584 --> 00:55:00,915
how dear...

964
00:55:03,454 --> 00:55:05,012
as you are to me.

965
00:55:15,535 --> 00:55:17,837
Maybe that's Jack
trying to find us.

966
00:55:17,837 --> 00:55:20,101
He'd know better
than to use the phone.

967
00:55:21,841 --> 00:55:22,968
Where is he?

968
00:55:24,211 --> 00:55:25,473
Why doesn't he come?

969
00:55:36,491 --> 00:55:38,083
Just like any Saturday morning.

970
00:55:40,763 --> 00:55:43,366
Len Pearlman, Bill Bittner...

971
00:55:43,366 --> 00:55:47,069
Jim Clark and his wife Shirley
and their kids...

972
00:55:47,069 --> 00:55:48,839
people I've known all my life.

973
00:55:48,839 --> 00:55:50,033
What time is it?

974
00:55:52,209 --> 00:55:55,078
Seven forty-five.

975
00:55:55,078 --> 00:55:57,114
Yeah, I know.

976
00:55:57,114 --> 00:55:58,416
It's too early to be so busy.

977
00:55:58,416 --> 00:56:01,486
What are they doing here?

978
00:56:01,486 --> 00:56:03,488
There's the answer.

979
00:56:03,488 --> 00:56:06,058
There must be strangers in town.

980
00:56:06,058 --> 00:56:09,028
They're waiting for the bus
to come and go.

981
00:56:09,028 --> 00:56:11,690
There isn't another one
through here until 1 1 :00.

982
00:57:06,125 --> 00:57:08,184
Farmers.

983
00:57:09,428 --> 00:57:12,665
Grimaldi, Pixley...

984
00:57:12,665 --> 00:57:14,000
Gessner!

985
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,502
Crescent City.

986
00:57:15,502 --> 00:57:19,539
If you have Crescent City
families, step to truck one.

987
00:57:19,539 --> 00:57:21,608
Crescent City...

988
00:57:21,608 --> 00:57:23,611
the first truck.

989
00:57:23,611 --> 00:57:25,113
Redbank.

990
00:57:25,113 --> 00:57:28,116
All with Redbank families
or contacts...

991
00:57:28,116 --> 00:57:30,184
go to truck number two.

992
00:57:30,184 --> 00:57:33,222
All with Redbank families
or contacts...

993
00:57:33,222 --> 00:57:34,623
truck number two.

994
00:57:34,623 --> 00:57:36,458
Havenhurst...

995
00:57:36,458 --> 00:57:38,127
the third truck.

996
00:57:38,127 --> 00:57:40,296
Havenhurst--
the third truck.

997
00:57:40,296 --> 00:57:42,932
Mill Town--the third truck.

998
00:57:42,932 --> 00:57:46,136
Mill Town--the third truck.

999
00:57:46,136 --> 00:57:48,138
Valley Springs...

1000
00:57:48,138 --> 00:57:49,640
the third truck.

1001
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:51,375
Valley Springs...

1002
00:57:51,375 --> 00:57:52,877
First our town...

1003
00:57:52,877 --> 00:57:55,880
then all the towns around us.

1004
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,381
It's a malignant disease...

1005
00:57:57,381 --> 00:57:59,384
spreading through
the whole country.

1006
00:57:59,384 --> 00:58:01,219
That's all for today.

1007
00:58:01,219 --> 00:58:03,653
Be ready again tomorrow.

1008
00:58:17,137 --> 00:58:20,107
I can't wait for Jack
any longer. Stay here.

1009
00:58:20,107 --> 00:58:21,275
You're not going out there?

1010
00:58:21,275 --> 00:58:22,843
I've got to stop them!

1011
00:58:22,843 --> 00:58:24,505
Wait! We're safe here!

1012
00:58:28,917 --> 00:58:30,852
They're not here.
I hope we're not too late.

1013
00:58:30,852 --> 00:58:32,286
Jack! Thank God!

1014
00:58:33,723 --> 00:58:36,025
The whole town's been
taken over by the pods!

1015
00:58:36,025 --> 00:58:39,528
Not quite.
There's still you and Becky.

1016
00:58:39,528 --> 00:58:41,531
Miles, it would have
been so much easier...

1017
00:58:41,531 --> 00:58:42,966
if you'd gone to sleep
last night.

1018
00:58:42,966 --> 00:58:45,799
Relax.
We're here to help you.

1019
00:58:47,471 --> 00:58:49,540
You know better than that.

1020
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:51,042
Where do you want us
to put them?

1021
00:58:51,042 --> 00:58:52,410
Would you like
to watch them grow?

1022
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:54,779
-No, thanks.
-Put them in there.

1023
00:58:54,779 --> 00:58:57,982
There's nothing to be afraid of.
We're not going to hurt you.

1024
00:58:57,982 --> 00:58:59,852
Once you understand,
you'll be grateful.

1025
00:58:59,852 --> 00:59:02,187
Remember how Teddy and I
fought against it.

1026
00:59:02,187 --> 00:59:03,489
We were wrong.

1027
00:59:03,489 --> 00:59:04,990
You mean Teddy doesn't mind?

1028
00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:07,494
Of course not.
She feels exactly the way I do.

1029
00:59:07,494 --> 00:59:08,995
Let us go!

1030
00:59:08,995 --> 00:59:10,230
If we leave town,
we won't come back.

1031
00:59:10,230 --> 00:59:13,767
We can't let you go.
You're dangerous to us.

1032
00:59:13,767 --> 00:59:15,369
Don't fight it, Miles.
It's no use.

1033
00:59:15,369 --> 00:59:18,839
Sooner or later,
you'll have to go to sleep.

1034
00:59:18,839 --> 00:59:21,475
I'll wait for you in the hall.

1035
00:59:21,475 --> 00:59:24,646
Miles,
you and I are scientific men.

1036
00:59:24,646 --> 00:59:26,815
You can understand the wonder
of what's happened.

1037
00:59:26,815 --> 00:59:29,618
Just think.
Less than a month ago...

1038
00:59:29,618 --> 00:59:31,486
Santa Mira
was like any other town--

1039
00:59:31,486 --> 00:59:32,922
people with nothing
but problems.

1040
00:59:32,922 --> 00:59:35,925
Then out of the sky
came a solution.

1041
00:59:35,925 --> 00:59:38,928
Seeds drifting through space
for years...

1042
00:59:38,928 --> 00:59:40,930
took root in a farmer's field.

1043
00:59:40,930 --> 00:59:42,933
From the seeds came pods...

1044
00:59:42,933 --> 00:59:45,335
which had the power
to reproduce themselves...

1045
00:59:45,335 --> 00:59:49,072
in the exact likeness
of any form of life.

1046
00:59:49,072 --> 00:59:51,576
So that's how it began...

1047
00:59:51,576 --> 00:59:53,510
out of the sky.

1048
00:59:55,346 --> 00:59:58,350
Your new bodies
are growing in there.

1049
00:59:58,350 --> 01:00:01,353
They're taking you over
cell for cell...

1050
01:00:01,353 --> 01:00:02,855
atom for atom.

1051
01:00:02,855 --> 01:00:04,356
There's no pain.

1052
01:00:04,356 --> 01:00:06,091
Suddenly, while you're asleep...

1053
01:00:06,091 --> 01:00:09,529
they'll absorb your minds,
your memories...

1054
01:00:09,529 --> 01:00:13,099
and you're reborn
into an untroubled world.

1055
01:00:13,099 --> 01:00:15,603
Where everyone's the same?

1056
01:00:15,603 --> 01:00:17,605
Exactly.

1057
01:00:17,605 --> 01:00:19,574
What a world.

1058
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:22,610
We're not the last humans left.

1059
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:24,513
They'll destroy you!

1060
01:00:24,513 --> 01:00:27,583
Tomorrow,
you won't want them to.

1061
01:00:27,583 --> 01:00:29,073
Tomorrow, you'll be one of us.

1062
01:00:33,723 --> 01:00:35,225
I love Becky.

1063
01:00:35,225 --> 01:00:37,660
Tomorrow, will I feel the same?

1064
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:40,330
There's no need for love.

1065
01:00:40,330 --> 01:00:42,233
No emotion?

1066
01:00:42,233 --> 01:00:46,570
Then you have no feelings,
only the instinct to survive.

1067
01:00:46,570 --> 01:00:49,373
You can't love or be loved!
Am I right?

1068
01:00:49,373 --> 01:00:50,976
You say it
as if it were terrible.

1069
01:00:50,976 --> 01:00:53,678
Believe me, it isn't.
You've been in love before.

1070
01:00:53,678 --> 01:00:57,182
It didn't last.
It never does.

1071
01:00:57,182 --> 01:01:00,753
Love, desire, ambition, faith--

1072
01:01:00,753 --> 01:01:03,856
without them, life's so simple,
believe me.

1073
01:01:03,856 --> 01:01:06,792
I don't want any part of it.

1074
01:01:06,792 --> 01:01:08,695
You're forgetting
something, Miles.

1075
01:01:08,695 --> 01:01:09,863
What's that?

1076
01:01:09,863 --> 01:01:12,127
You have no choice.

1077
01:01:16,704 --> 01:01:19,173
I guess we haven't any choice.

1078
01:01:19,173 --> 01:01:20,367
Good.

1079
01:01:29,985 --> 01:01:32,579
I want to love and be loved!

1080
01:01:35,392 --> 01:01:36,960
I want your children.

1081
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,963
I don't want a world
without love or grief or beauty.

1082
01:01:39,963 --> 01:01:42,233
I'd rather die.

1083
01:01:42,233 --> 01:01:43,734
No.

1084
01:01:43,734 --> 01:01:44,928
No.

1085
01:01:47,605 --> 01:01:50,609
Not unless there's no other way.

1086
01:01:50,609 --> 01:01:52,244
Why didn't they
give us a shot...

1087
01:01:52,244 --> 01:01:54,746
or a sleeping pill or something?

1088
01:01:54,746 --> 01:01:58,238
Drugs dull the mind.
Maybe that's the reason.

1089
01:02:06,859 --> 01:02:09,363
No. It wouldn't work.

1090
01:02:09,363 --> 01:02:12,266
I might get one or even two,
but I couldn't get three.

1091
01:02:12,266 --> 01:02:13,934
You're forgetting something,
darling--me.

1092
01:02:13,934 --> 01:02:15,135
It isn't three against one.

1093
01:02:15,135 --> 01:02:17,331
It's three against two.
Give me a knife.

1094
01:02:18,707 --> 01:02:20,197
No.

1095
01:03:26,249 --> 01:03:27,409
There.

1096
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:37,522
Go by the desk.

1097
01:03:57,516 --> 01:03:59,519
What's going on in there?

1098
01:03:59,519 --> 01:04:02,189
Miles!
Unlock the door!

1099
01:04:02,189 --> 01:04:03,924
Miles, open the door!

1100
01:04:03,924 --> 01:04:05,592
Open the door, Miles!

1101
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:07,253
JACK,   Aah!

1102
01:04:09,831 --> 01:04:10,991
Open the door!

1103
01:04:23,712 --> 01:04:25,840
Oh! Aah!

1104
01:04:27,217 --> 01:04:28,411
Oh!

1105
01:04:36,794 --> 01:04:39,194
Our only hope is
to make it to the highway.

1106
01:04:52,245 --> 01:04:53,746
That does it.

1107
01:04:53,746 --> 01:04:56,516
The only other way
is out the front door...

1108
01:04:56,516 --> 01:04:58,184
and there's bound
to be somebody watching.

1109
01:04:58,184 --> 01:04:59,743
We'll have to chance it.

1110
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:16,704
Keep your eyes
a little wide and blank.

1111
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:18,195
Show no interest or excitement.

1112
01:05:42,233 --> 01:05:45,737
Well, Sam,
we're finally with you.

1113
01:05:45,737 --> 01:05:46,972
They were supposed
to let me know.

1114
01:05:46,972 --> 01:05:49,608
The chief said he'd phone
the station, then call me.

1115
01:05:49,608 --> 01:05:52,245
He phoned,
but the line was busy.

1116
01:05:52,245 --> 01:05:54,179
He's calling again now.

1117
01:05:55,515 --> 01:05:57,016
Aah!

1118
01:05:57,016 --> 01:05:58,483
Watch out!

1119
01:06:01,255 --> 01:06:02,984
I'm sorry, Miles.

1120
01:06:54,648 --> 01:06:56,182
This is Janzek.
They got away.

1121
01:06:56,182 --> 01:06:57,410
Turn the main siren on.

1122
01:07:07,461 --> 01:07:09,225
Hey! Stairs!

1123
01:07:28,719 --> 01:07:30,744
It's only a few steps more.

1124
01:07:44,236 --> 01:07:46,033
Come on!
They went this way!

1125
01:08:07,829 --> 01:08:10,264
They're over there!

1126
01:09:36,328 --> 01:09:38,430
Miles, I can't.

1127
01:09:38,430 --> 01:09:40,432
I can't go on.

1128
01:09:40,432 --> 01:09:42,263
Yes, you can.

1129
01:10:39,165 --> 01:10:41,292
Here's her sweater!
They must be in the tunnel!

1130
01:10:51,278 --> 01:10:54,112
Look, Tommy,
you go that way!

1131
01:11:00,621 --> 01:11:03,625
Give up!
You can't get away from us!

1132
01:11:03,625 --> 01:11:07,322
We're not going to hurt you!
Give up!

1133
01:11:17,941 --> 01:11:19,510
They're not in the tunnel.

1134
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:21,745
All right, everybody, outside.
Come on.

1135
01:11:21,745 --> 01:11:24,236
Let's check the hills.
Everybody, move.

1136
01:11:30,755 --> 01:11:35,192
Miles,
I can't stay awake much longer.

1137
01:11:36,896 --> 01:11:39,632
I think they're all gone now.

1138
01:11:39,632 --> 01:11:42,999
We'd better start, or we'll
never make it to the highway.

1139
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:44,671
Miles, I've never heard
anything so beautiful.

1140
01:12:44,671 --> 01:12:46,040
It means we're not
the only ones left...

1141
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:48,175
to know what love is.

1142
01:12:48,175 --> 01:12:51,378
Stay here, and pray
they're as human as they sound.

1143
01:12:51,378 --> 01:12:52,743
Bye, darling.

1144
01:13:47,241 --> 01:13:51,245
This is station KCAA,
the 24-hour platter parade...

1145
01:13:51,245 --> 01:13:52,542
the station of music--

1146
01:14:23,181 --> 01:14:24,341
Becky.

1147
01:14:26,684 --> 01:14:27,912
Becky!

1148
01:14:32,658 --> 01:14:33,818
Becky?

1149
01:14:35,895 --> 01:14:37,697
Becky, where are you?!

1150
01:14:37,697 --> 01:14:39,392
I'm here, Miles.

1151
01:14:42,202 --> 01:14:44,204
You didn't go to sleep?

1152
01:14:44,204 --> 01:14:45,706
I'm so tired.

1153
01:14:45,706 --> 01:14:48,943
They weren't people.
It was more of them.

1154
01:14:48,943 --> 01:14:50,645
They're growing thousands
of pods in greenhouses.

1155
01:14:50,645 --> 01:14:52,547
We've got to get away.

1156
01:14:52,547 --> 01:14:54,616
I'm exhausted, Miles.

1157
01:14:54,616 --> 01:14:56,607
I can't make it.

1158
01:15:13,070 --> 01:15:15,732
We can't make it
without sleep.

1159
01:15:17,575 --> 01:15:19,566
Yes, we can.

1160
01:15:36,095 --> 01:15:40,100
I went to sleep,
Miles, and it happened.

1161
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:41,897
Oh, Becky.

1162
01:15:43,737 --> 01:15:45,072
They were right.

1163
01:15:45,072 --> 01:15:47,075
I should never have left you.

1164
01:15:47,075 --> 01:15:49,771
Stop acting like a fool,
Miles, and accept us.

1165
01:15:51,646 --> 01:15:52,943
No.

1166
01:15:54,316 --> 01:15:55,751
Never!

1167
01:15:55,751 --> 01:15:57,353
He's in here!

1168
01:15:57,353 --> 01:15:59,388
He's in here!

1169
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:01,515
Get him! Get him!

1170
01:16:09,766 --> 01:16:12,670
I've been afraid
a lot of times in my life...

1171
01:16:12,670 --> 01:16:14,572
but I didn't know
the real meaning of fear...

1172
01:16:14,572 --> 01:16:18,643
until I had kissed Becky.

1173
01:16:18,643 --> 01:16:21,079
A moment's sleep,
and the girl I loved...

1174
01:16:21,079 --> 01:16:23,815
was an inhuman enemy
bent on my destruction.

1175
01:16:23,815 --> 01:16:26,285
That moment's sleep
was death to Becky's soul...

1176
01:16:26,285 --> 01:16:28,020
just as it had been
for Jack and Teddy...

1177
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:29,889
and Dan Kauffman
and all the rest.

1178
01:16:29,889 --> 01:16:31,457
Their bodies were now hosts...

1179
01:16:31,457 --> 01:16:34,894
harboring an alien form
of life, a cosmic form...

1180
01:16:34,894 --> 01:16:37,598
which, to survive,
must take over every human man.

1181
01:16:37,598 --> 01:16:39,400
So I ran, I ran...

1182
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,869
I ran as little Jimmy
had run the other day.

1183
01:16:41,869 --> 01:16:44,038
My only hope was to get away
from Santa Mira...

1184
01:16:44,038 --> 01:16:45,306
to get to the highway...

1185
01:16:45,306 --> 01:16:47,571
to warn the others
of what was happening.

1186
01:17:02,391 --> 01:17:04,227
Wait!

1187
01:17:04,227 --> 01:17:06,730
Let him go!
They'll never believe him.

1188
01:17:06,730 --> 01:17:08,265
Help! Help!

1189
01:17:08,265 --> 01:17:09,566
Wait!

1190
01:17:09,566 --> 01:17:11,899
Help! Help! Wait!

1191
01:17:13,104 --> 01:17:16,941
Wait! Stop!
Stop and listen to me!

1192
01:17:16,941 --> 01:17:18,443
Listen to me!

1193
01:17:18,443 --> 01:17:22,448
Those people that are coming
after me! They're not human!

1194
01:17:22,448 --> 01:17:24,383
Listen to me!
We're in danger!

1195
01:17:24,383 --> 01:17:26,251
Get out of here!

1196
01:17:26,251 --> 01:17:28,754
You're in danger! Please!

1197
01:17:28,754 --> 01:17:30,390
Get out of here!
Go on!

1198
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:31,858
Get moving!

1199
01:17:31,858 --> 01:17:33,860
They're after all of us!

1200
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:35,261
All of us!

1201
01:17:35,261 --> 01:17:36,963
Listen to me!

1202
01:17:36,963 --> 01:17:40,229
There isn't a human being
left in Santa Mira!

1203
01:17:41,502 --> 01:17:43,270
Stop!

1204
01:17:43,270 --> 01:17:45,773
Pull over! I need your help!

1205
01:17:45,773 --> 01:17:47,275
Something terrible's happened!

1206
01:17:47,275 --> 01:17:48,810
You're drunk!
Get out of the street!

1207
01:17:48,810 --> 01:17:50,801
Get out of here! Go on!

1208
01:18:02,792 --> 01:18:05,329
Are you crazy,
you big idiot?

1209
01:18:05,329 --> 01:18:08,799
Look!
You fools! You're in danger!

1210
01:18:08,799 --> 01:18:11,301
Can't you see?
They're after you!

1211
01:18:11,301 --> 01:18:13,238
They're after all of us!

1212
01:18:13,238 --> 01:18:15,306
Our wives, our children,
everyone!

1213
01:18:15,306 --> 01:18:17,442
They're here already!

1214
01:18:17,442 --> 01:18:19,277
You're next!

1215
01:18:19,277 --> 01:18:20,946
You're next!

1216
01:18:20,946 --> 01:18:22,448
You're next!

1217
01:18:22,448 --> 01:18:23,949
You're next!

1218
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:25,439
You're next!

1219
01:18:33,460 --> 01:18:36,563
You don't believe
a word of this, do you?

1220
01:18:36,563 --> 01:18:38,199
Sure, it's fantastic,
but it happened.

1221
01:18:38,199 --> 01:18:40,301
Don't just sit there
measuring me for a straitjacket!

1222
01:18:40,301 --> 01:18:42,792
Do something! Get on the phone!
Call for help!

1223
01:18:44,405 --> 01:18:46,772
What's the use?

1224
01:19:02,392 --> 01:19:05,362
What do you think?
Will psychiatry help?

1225
01:19:05,362 --> 01:19:08,132
If all this
is a nightmare, yes.

1226
01:19:08,132 --> 01:19:09,467
Of course it's a nightmare.

1227
01:19:09,467 --> 01:19:12,471
Plants from another world
taking over human beings.

1228
01:19:12,471 --> 01:19:14,063
Mad as a March hare.

1229
01:19:17,242 --> 01:19:19,144
What have we here?

1230
01:19:19,144 --> 01:19:20,879
He ran his truck
through a red light.

1231
01:19:20,879 --> 01:19:22,782
Greyhound bus
smacked him broadside...

1232
01:19:22,782 --> 01:19:24,050
and tipped him over.

1233
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:25,451
Put him in the O.R.

1234
01:19:25,451 --> 01:19:27,253
Will you take over Bennell
for me?

1235
01:19:27,253 --> 01:19:28,521
Certainly.

1236
01:19:28,521 --> 01:19:29,957
How badly is he hurt?

1237
01:19:29,957 --> 01:19:32,482
Both legs, left arm,
broken all to bits.

1238
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,195
We had to dig him out...

1239
01:19:35,195 --> 01:19:38,833
from under the most
peculiar things I ever saw.

1240
01:19:38,833 --> 01:19:40,168
What things?

1241
01:19:40,168 --> 01:19:41,336
I don't know what they are.

1242
01:19:41,336 --> 01:19:42,971
I never saw them before.

1243
01:19:42,971 --> 01:19:45,940
They looked like, uh,
great big seedpods.

1244
01:19:45,940 --> 01:19:48,277
Seedpods?

1245
01:19:48,277 --> 01:19:49,812
Where was the truck
coming from?

1246
01:19:49,812 --> 01:19:51,143
Santa Mira.

1247
01:19:56,486 --> 01:19:59,823
Get on your radio
and sound an all-points alarm.

1248
01:19:59,823 --> 01:20:01,691
Block all highways
and stop all traffic...

1249
01:20:01,691 --> 01:20:04,183
and call every law enforcement
agency in the state.

1250
01:20:05,997 --> 01:20:09,000
Operator, get me the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

1251
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,331
Yes, it's an emergency!
