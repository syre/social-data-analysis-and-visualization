The two share a table in a caf\u00e9 together and to kill the time they talk about how they met their partners-to-be. Rikki, handsome but primitive in the Desi way, says that he met his fianc\u00e9, Anaida Raza, at the H\u00f4tel Ritz Paris, the same night that Diana, Princess of Wales and Dodi Al-Fayed left the hotel to take their last journey together. Rikki explains \"When two lovers die, another two are born\", as he fell in love with Anaida that night. Alvira says she met her fianc\u00e9, the dashing lawyer Steve Singh at Madame Tussauds in London when he saved her from death by a falling Superman wax model. The encounter changed her life and she was smitten by the lawyer who also helped her sue Madame Tussauds for substantial damages. As Rikki and Alvira talk they begin to enjoy each other's company and their different backgrounds cease to matter. They exchange numbers and go to meet their partners. However, it is then revealed that they had not gone to meet their respective partners. Rikki is in fact at the train station to meet his business partner, while Alvira is meeting her relatives. As they leave the station separately, they realize they are in love, but believe their love is unrequited, each of the other. The two get in touch when Alvira calls Rikki, pretending it was a wrong number. They decide to meet up at a disco where there is a dance competition but both try to maintain the fiction that they are engaged. Out of desperation, Rikki hires Laila, a prostitute, to pose as Anaida, and Alvira asks Satvinder -- a mummy's boy/optician -- to pretend to be Steve. The four meet at a club and take part in the dance competition, while throwing insults at each other. Rikki and Laila emerge as the winners but Alvira is jealous and storms out in tears. Satvinder goes to Rikki's flat and tells him that he has fallen in love with Laila. He also tells him that Alvira is not engaged to him. Rikki, realizing what has happened, goes to see Alvira, who is at first moping in bed and later tries to convince her cousin not to marry her. Rikki calls her from a neighbor's window.

Causing earthquakes, tidal waves, and a dust cloud that soon covered most of the Northern hemisphere, it changed the face of our planet forever. Leaving Russia destroyed, and turning Europe into a snow- covered \u00bbdeath zone\u00ab, Bay-Leder 7 was the end of civilization as we know it. For Tom Parker, head of security at the American Embassy in Berlin, it was also the end of all he held dear - having to leave his wife and his daughter in the German capitol, he effectively sentenced them to a cold death. Three years later, most of the survivors have set up shop in the habitable territories in the equator regions. It's a harsh life, with little hope of Earth's climate ever reverting back to normal. When a military command center registers a long forgotten experimental satellite going green, an expedition is set up to find the base from where it is controlled. Halfway across the \u00bbdeath zone\u00ab that was once Europe, the expedition's plane is destroyed by a mysterious force, controlled from the ruins of Berlin, a city that was considered dead and buried - under 30 feet of ice and snow. Fearing a threat to the New United Northern States, the President orders a new expedition to find and destroy the base and the satellite. Tom Parker volunteers to lead a group of highly trained specialists on a suicide trek to Berlin - with ground vehicles, no reliable intel, and zero radio contact. He is determined to find out who is still living in Berlin - secretly hoping that his wife and daughter are among the survivors. Tom's group also consists of Anna Starndorf, beautiful head of the company that owned and operated the satellite, Colonel Waters, the cynical military commander, and Sarah Henley, a former British SAS member # trained to kill. The flight to the outer circles of the \u00bbdeath zone\u00ab goes without a hitch. The expedition members suit up for the drop. Breaking through the clouds, the team gets its first real look at the world below: ice and snow, as far as the eye can see. Only a few buildings remain above snow level - including the Eiffel Tower. From there it's an epic trek across the icy plains of central Europe to Berlin. When the group finally makes it to Berlin, Parker and his men find out that a group of survivors has found a new home in the subway system of the former German capitol. Their leader turns out to be Gregor Starndorf - Anna's father. When he had discovered the means to activate the prototype microwave power satellite from an abandoned facility, he devised a brillant plan to use it to heat up the atmosphere over Europe, causing the weather to kickstart again. But there is someone in the facility who plans to exact revenge on a world that has seemingly abandoned them...", "Response": "True", "Poster": "http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0ODIyNDQxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTYxMjIzMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "imdbID": "tt0362942", "Type": "movie", "Awards": "N/A"}, "tt0055562": {"Metascore": "N/A", "Genre": "Sci-Fi", "Writer": "Shin Morita, Akihiro Watanabe (story)", "Year": "1961", "imdbVotes": "1,971", "Language": "Japanese", "Actors": "Shin'ichi Chiba, Ry\u00fbko Minakami, Mitsue Komiya, Seiichir\u00f4 Kameishi", "Title": "Invasion of the Neptune Men", "Runtime": "74 min", "Country": "Japan", "Director": "K\u00f4ji Ohta", "imdbRating": "2.0", "Rated": "N/A", "Released": "19 Jul 1961", "Plot": "(English version) Slow-moving aliens from the planet Neptune, wearing nosecone-shaped space helmets, attempt to invade Earth in a winged rocketship.
