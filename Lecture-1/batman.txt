'''Batman''' is a fictional [[superhero]] who appears in American comic books published by [[DC Comics]], as well as in a number of movie, television, and video game adaptations. The character was created by artist [[Bob Kane]] and writer [[Bill Finger]], and first appeared in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #27 (May 1939). Originally named "the Bat-Man", the character is also referred to by such epithets as "the Caped Crusader",<ref name="Fleisher">Fleisher, Michael L. ''The Encyclopedia of Comic Book Heroes Volume 1 Batman'' Collier Books 1976 ISBN 978-0-02-080090-3 p. 31</ref> "the Dark Knight",<ref name="Fleisher"/> and "the World's Greatest Detective".<ref name="Fleisher"/>

Batman is the [[secret identity]] of '''Bruce Wayne''', an American billionaire, industrialist, and philanthropist. Having witnessed the murder of his parents as a child, he swore revenge on criminals, an oath tempered with a sense of justice. Wayne trains himself both physically and intellectually and dons a [[Batsuit|bat-themed costume]] to fight crime.<ref name="dc-ency">{{cite book | last = Beatty | first = Scott | author-link = | contribution = Batman | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 40–44 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = London | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1}}</ref> Batman operates in the fictional [[Gotham City]], assisted by various supporting characters including his crime-fighting partner, [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], his butler [[Alfred Pennyworth]], the police commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|Jim Gordon]], and occasionally the heroine [[Batgirl]].

Batman became popular soon after his introduction and gained his own comic book title, ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'', in 1940. As the decades wore on, differing interpretations of the character emerged. The late 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series used a [[Camp (style)|camp]] aesthetic which continued to be associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in 1986 with ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], followed by ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke]]'' by [[Alan Moore]] and ''[[Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth]]'' by [[Grant Morrison]]. The success of [[Warner Bros.]]' live-action ''[[Batman in film|Batman]]'' feature films have helped maintain public interest in the character.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/film-and-tv/features/the-big-question-what-is-the-history-of-batman-and-why-does-he-still-appeal-873780.html | title=The Big Question: What is the history of Batman, and why does he still appeal? | work=[[The Independent]] | date=July 22, 2008 | location=London| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080729223151/http://www.independent.co.uk:80/arts-entertainment/film-and-tv/features/the-big-question-what-is-the-history-of-batman-and-why-does-he-still-appeal-873780.html | archivedate=2008-07-29 }}</ref>

An American cultural icon, Batman has been [[Batman franchise media|licensed and adapted into a variety of media]], from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world such as toys and video games. The character has also intrigued psychiatrists with many trying to understand the character's psyche. In May 2011, Batman placed second on IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/2 | title=Batman – Top 100 Comic Book Heroes | publisher=IGN Entertainment | accessdate=2011-05-27| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140220133403/http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/2 | archivedate=2014-02-20 }}</ref> after [[Superman]].

==Publication history==
{{See also|List of Batman comics}}

===Creation===
In early 1939, the success of [[Superman]] in ''[[Action Comics]]'' prompted editors at the comic book division of [[National Publications]] (the future DC Comics) to request more superheroes for its titles. In response, [[Bob Kane]] created "the Bat-Man."<ref>[[Les Daniels|Daniels, Les]]. ''Batman: The Complete History''. Chronicle Books, 1999. ISBN 978-0-8118-4232-7, p. 18</ref> Collaborator [[Bill Finger]] recalled "Kane had an idea for a character called 'Batman', and he'd like me to see the drawings. I went over to Kane's, and he had drawn a character who looked very much like Superman with kind of ... reddish tights, I believe, with boots ... no gloves, no gauntlets ... with a small [[domino mask]], swinging on a rope. He had two stiff wings that were sticking out, looking like bat wings. And under it was a big sign ... BATMAN."<ref>[[Jim Steranko|Steranko, Jim]]. ''The Steranko History of Comics 1''. Reading, PA: Supergraphics, 1970. (ISBN 978-0-517-50188-7)</ref> The bat wing like cape was suggested by Bob Kane; who was inspired by seeing [[Leonardo Da Vinci]]'s sketch of an [[ornithopter]] flying device as a child.<ref>{{cite book|title=Batman - The Complete History: The Life and Times of the Dark Knight|author=Les Daniels|url=http://books.google.com/books/about/Batman_The_Complete_History.html?id=73wknu2cVIkC|pages=18–20}}</ref>

Finger offered such suggestions as giving the character a [[cowl]] instead of a simple domino mask, a cape instead of wings, and gloves, and removing the red sections from the original costume.<ref>Daniels (1999), p. 21, 23</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Havholm, Peter|title=Corporate Authorship: A Response to Jerome Christensen|journal=Critical Inquiry|volume=30|issue=1|date=Autumn 2003|page=192|issn=00931896|doi=10.1086/380810|last2=Sandifer|first2=Philip}}</ref><ref name="Archives 3">Biography by Joe Desris, in ''Batman Archives'', Volume 3 ([[DC Comics]], 1994), p. 223.

Bruce, being a playboy, was a man of gentry. I searched for a name that would suggest colonialism. I tried Adams, Hancock ... then I thought of [[Anthony Wayne|Mad Anthony Wayne]]."<ref name="creation">Kane, Andrae, p. 44.</ref> He later said his suggestions were influenced by [[Lee Falk]]'s popular ''[[The Phantom]]'', a [[Print syndication|syndicated]] newspaper comic-strip character with which Kane was familiar as well.<ref name="autogenerated1">Kane, Andrae, p. 41.</ref>

Kane and Finger drew upon contemporary 1930s popular culture for inspiration regarding much of the Bat-Man's look, personality, methods and weaponry. Details find predecessors in [[Pulp magazine|pulp fiction]], [[comic strip]]s, [[newspaper]] headlines, and autobiographical details referring to Kane himself.<ref>Daniels, Les. ''DC Comics: A Celebration of the World's Favorite Comic Book Heroes''. New York: Billboard Books/Watson-Guptill Publications, 2003, ISBN 978-0-8230-7919-3, p. 23.</ref> As an aristocratic hero with a double identity, the Bat-Man had predecessors in [[the Scarlet Pimpernel]] (created by [[Baroness Emmuska Orczy]], 1903) and [[Zorro]] (created by [[Johnston McCulley]], 1919). Like them, he performed his heroic deeds in secret, averted suspicion by playing the fool in public, and marked his work with a signature symbol. Kane specifically noted the influence of the films ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1920) and ''[[The Bat Whispers]]'' (1930) in the creation of the character's iconography. Finger, drawing inspiration from pulp heroes like [[Doc Savage]], [[The Shadow]], [[Dick Tracy]], and [[Sherlock Holmes]], made the character a master sleuth.<ref>Boichel, Bill. "Batman: Commodity as Myth." ''The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and His Media''. Routledge: London, 1991. ISBN 978-0-85170-276-6, pp. 6–7.</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Batman - The Complete History: The Life and Times of the Dark Knight|author=Les Daniels|url=http://books.google.com/books/about/Batman_The_Complete_History.html?id=73wknu2cVIkC|page=31}}</ref>

In his 1989 autobiography, Kane detailed Finger's contributions to Batman's creation:
{{quote|One day I called Bill and said, 'I have a new character called the Bat-Man and I've made some crude, elementary sketches I'd like you to look at'. He came over and I showed him the drawings. At the time, I only had a small domino mask, like the one Robin later wore, on Batman's face. Bill said, 'Why not make him look more like a bat and put a hood on him, and take the eyeballs out and just put slits for eyes to make him look more mysterious?' At this point, the Bat-Man wore a red union suit; the wings, trunks, and mask were black. I thought that red and black would be a good combination. Bill said that the costume was too bright: 'Color it dark gray to make it look more ominous'. The cape looked like two stiff bat wings attached to his arms. As Bill and I talked, we realized that these wings would get cumbersome when Bat-Man was in action, and changed them into a cape, scalloped to look like bat wings when he was fighting or swinging down on a rope. Also, he didn't have any gloves on, and we added them so that he wouldn't leave fingerprints.<ref name=autogenerated1 />}}

===Subsequent creation credit===
Kane signed away ownership in the character in exchange for, among other compensation, a mandatory byline on all Batman comics. This byline did not originally say "Batman created by Bob Kane"; his name was simply written on the title page of each story. The name disappeared from the comic book in the mid-1960s, replaced by credits for each story's actual writer and artists. In the late 1970s, when [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]] began receiving a "created by" credit on the Superman titles, along with [[William Moulton Marston]] being given the byline for creating [[Wonder Woman]], Batman stories began saying "Created by Bob Kane" in addition to the other credits.

Finger did not receive the same recognition. While he had received credit for other DC work since the 1940s, he began, in the 1960s, to receive limited acknowledgment for his Batman writing; in the letters page of ''Batman'' #169 (February 1965) for example, editor [[Julius Schwartz]] names him as the creator of the [[Riddler]], one of Batman's recurring villains. However, Finger's contract left him only with his writing page rate and no byline. Kane wrote, "Bill was disheartened by the lack of major accomplishments in his career. He felt that he had not used his creative potential to its fullest and that success had passed him by."<ref name="creation" /> At the time of Finger's death in 1974, DC had not officially credited Finger as Batman co-creator.

[[Jerry Robinson]], who also worked with Finger and Kane on the strip at this time, has criticized Kane for failing to share the credit. He recalled Finger resenting his position, stating in a 2005 interview with ''[[The Comics Journal]]'':
{{quote|Bob made him more insecure, because while he slaved working on Batman, he wasn't sharing in any of the glory or the money that Bob began to make, which is why... [he was] going to leave [Kane's employ]. ... [Kane] should have credited Bill as co-creator, because I know; I was there. ... That was one thing I would never forgive Bob for, was not to take care of Bill or recognize his vital role in the creation of Batman. As with Siegel and Shuster, it should have been the same, the same co-creator credit in the strip, writer and artist.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Groth |first=Gary |authorlink=Gary Groth |date=October 2005 |title=Jerry Robinson |journal=The Comics Journal |volume=1 |issue=271 |pages=80–81 |issn=0194-7869 |url=http://www.tcj.com/?option=com_content&task=view&id=350&Itemid=48 |accessdate=2007-11-18|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131224083859/http://www.tcj.com/?option=com_content&task=view&id=350&Itemid=48 |archivedate=2013-12-24 }}</ref>}}

Although Kane initially rebutted Finger's claims at having created the character, writing in a 1965 open letter to fans that "it seemed to me that Bill Finger has given out the impression that he and not myself created the <nowiki>''</nowiki>Batman, t' {{sic}} as well as Robin and all the other leading villains and characters. This statement is fraudulent and entirely untrue." Kane himself also commented on Finger's lack of credit. "The trouble with being a 'ghost' writer or artist is that you must remain rather anonymously without 'credit'. However, if one wants the 'credit', then one has to cease being a 'ghost' or follower and become a leader or innovator."<ref>''[[Comic Book Artist]]'' 3. Winter 1999. [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]</ref>

In 1989, Kane revisited Finger's situation, recalling in an interview, {{quote|In those days it was like, one artist and he had his name over it [the comic strip] — the policy of DC in the comic books was, if you can't write it, obtain other writers, but their names would never appear on the comic book in the finished version. So Bill never asked me for it [the byline] and I never volunteered — I guess my ego at that time. And I felt badly, really, when he [Finger] died.<ref>"Comic Book Interview Super Special: Batman" Fictioneer Press, 1989</ref>}}

===Early years===
[[File:Detective Comics 27.jpg|thumb|Batman made his debut in ''Detective Comics'' #27 (May 1939). Cover art by [[Bob Kane]].]]

The first Batman story, "The Case of the Chemical Syndicate", was published in ''Detective Comics'' #27 (May 1939). Finger said, "Batman was originally written in the style of the pulps,"<ref>Daniels (1999), p. 25.</ref> and this influence was evident with Batman showing little remorse over killing or maiming criminals. Batman proved a hit character, and he received his own solo title in 1940, while continuing to star in ''Detective Comics''. By that time, National was the top-selling and most influential publisher in the industry; Batman and the company's other major hero, Superman, were the cornerstones of the company's success.<ref>Wright, Bradford W. ''Comic Book Nation''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 2001. ISBN 978-0-8018-7450-5, p. 19.</ref> The two characters were featured side-by-side as the stars of ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'', which was originally titled ''World's Best Comics'' when it debuted in fall 1940. Creators including [[Jerry Robinson]] and [[Dick Sprang]] also worked on the strips during this period.

Over the course of the first few Batman strips elements were added to the character and the artistic depiction of Batman evolved. Kane noted that within six issues he drew the character's jawline more pronounced, and lengthened the ears on the costume. "About a year later he was almost the full figure, my mature Batman," Kane said.<ref name = "vapzdg">Daniels (1999), p. 29.</ref> [[Batman's utility belt|Batman's characteristic utility belt]] was introduced in ''Detective Comics'' #29 (July 1939), followed by the [[boomerang]]-like batarang and the first bat-themed vehicle, the [[Batplane]], in #31 (Sept. 1939). The character's origin was revealed in #33 (Nov. 1939), unfolding in a two-page story that establishes the brooding persona of Batman, a character driven by the death of his parents. Written by Finger, it depicts a young Bruce Wayne witnessing his parents' murder at the hands of a mugger. Days later, at their grave, the child vows that "by the spirits of my parents [I will] avenge their deaths by spending the rest of my life warring on all criminals."<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Bill Finger]]|penciller=[[Bob Kane]]|inker=[[Sheldon Moldoff]]|issue=33|title=Detective Comics|story=The Batman and How He Came to Be|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|date=Nov. 1939|pages=1–2}}</ref><ref>[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=560 ''Detective Comics'' #33] (Nov. 1939), [[Grand Comics Database]] {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5msHPiGRt|date =2010-01-18}}</ref><ref>John Jefferson Darowski, "[http://www.pdfdownload.org/pdf2html/pdf2html.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontentdm.lib.byu.edu%2FETD%2Fimage%2Fetd2158.pdf&images=yes The Mythic Symbols of Batman]" December 2007.

The early, pulp-inflected portrayal of Batman started to soften in ''Detective Comics'' #38 (April 1940) with the introduction of [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], Batman's kid sidekick.<ref name = "Wright_p17">Wright, p. 17.</ref> Robin was introduced, based on Finger's suggestion Batman needed a "[[Dr. Watson|Watson]]" with whom Batman could talk.<ref>Daniels (1999), p. 38.</ref> Sales nearly doubled, despite Kane's preference for a solo Batman, and it sparked a proliferation of "kid sidekicks."<ref>Daniels (2003), p. 36.</ref> The first issue of the solo spin-off series ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' was notable not only for introducing two of his most persistent enemies, the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] and [[Catwoman]], but for a story in which Batman shoots some monstrous giants to death. That story prompted editor [[Whitney Ellsworth]] to decree that the character could no longer kill or use a gun.<ref name="dan42">Daniels (1999), p. 42</ref>

By 1942, the writers and artists behind the Batman comics had established most of the basic elements of the Batman mythos.<ref name = "Boichel_p9">Boichel, p. 9.</ref> In the years following World War II, DC Comics "adopted a postwar editorial direction that increasingly de-emphasized social commentary in favor of lighthearted juvenile fantasy." The impact of this editorial approach was evident in ''Batman'' comics of the postwar period; removed from the "bleak and menacing world" of the strips of the early 1940s, Batman was instead portrayed as a respectable citizen and paternal figure that inhabited a "bright and colorful" environment.<ref>Wright, p. 59.</ref>

===1950s and early 1960s===
Batman was one of the few superhero characters to be continuously published as interest in the genre waned during the 1950s. In the story "The Mightiest Team in the World" in ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' #76 (June 1952), Batman teams up with Superman for the first time and the pair discovers each other's secret identity.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Edmund Hamilton]]|penciller=[[Curt Swan]]|story=The Mightiest Team In the World|title=Superman #76|date=June 1952|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> Following the success of this story, ''World's Finest Comics'' was revamped so it featured stories starring both heroes together, instead of the separate Batman and Superman features that had been running before.<ref>Daniels (1999), p. 88.</ref> The team-up of the characters was "a financial success in an era when those were few and far between";<ref>Daniels (1999), p. 91.</ref> this series of stories ran until the book's cancellation in 1986.

Batman comics were among those criticized when the comic book industry came under scrutiny with the publication of psychologist [[Fredric Wertham]]'s book ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'' in 1954. Wertham's thesis was that children imitated crimes committed in comic books, and that these works corrupt the morals of the youth. Wertham criticized Batman comics for their supposed [[homosexual]] overtones and argued that Batman and Robin were portrayed as lovers.<ref>Daniels (1999), p. 84.</ref> Wertham's criticisms raised a public outcry during the 1950s, eventually leading to the establishment of the [[Comics Code Authority]]. The tendency towards a "sunnier Batman" in the postwar years intensified after the introduction of the Comics Code.<ref>Boichel, p. 13.</ref> Scholars have suggested that the characters of [[Batwoman]] (in 1956) and the pre-[[Barbara Gordon]] [[Bette Kane|Bat-Girl]] (in 1961) were introduced in part to refute the allegation that Batman and Robin were gay, and the stories took on a campier, lighter feel.<ref>{{cite journal |last=York |first=Christopher |title=All in the Family: Homophobia and Batman Comics in the 1950s |journal=The International Journal of Comic Art |year=2000 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=100–110 |url= }}</ref>

In the late 1950s, Batman stories gradually became more science fiction-oriented, an attempt at mimicking the success of other DC characters that had dabbled in the genre.<ref>Daniels (1999), p. 94.</ref> New characters such as Batwoman, [[Ace the Bat-Hound]], and [[Bat-Mite]] were introduced. Batman's adventures often involved odd transformations or bizarre space aliens. In 1960, Batman debuted as a member of the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #28 (Feb. 1960), and went on to appear in several Justice League comic series starting later that same year.

==="New Look" Batman and camp===
By 1964, sales on Batman titles had fallen drastically. Bob Kane noted that, as a result, DC was "planning to kill Batman off altogether."<ref>Daniels (1999), p. 95.</ref> In response to this, editor [[Julius Schwartz]] was assigned to the Batman titles. He presided over drastic changes, beginning with 1964's ''Detective Comics'' #327 (May 1964), which was cover-billed as the "New Look". Schwartz introduced changes designed to make Batman more contemporary, and to return him to more detective-oriented stories. He brought in artist [[Carmine Infantino]] to help overhaul the character. The [[Batmobile]] was redesigned, and Batman's costume was modified to incorporate a yellow ellipse behind the bat-insignia. The space aliens, time travel, and characters of the 1950s such as Batwoman, Ace, and Bat-Mite were retired. Batman's butler Alfred was killed off (though his death was quickly reversed) while a new female relative for the Wayne family, Aunt Harriet, came to live with Bruce Wayne and [[Dick Grayson]].<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Bill Finger]]|penciller=[[Sheldon Moldoff]]|story=Gotham Gang Line-Up!|title=[[Detective Comics]]|issue=328|date=June 1964|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref>

The debut of the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series in 1966 had a profound influence on the character. The success of the series increased sales throughout the comic book industry, and ''Batman'' reached a circulation of close to 900,000 copies.<ref>Benton, Mike. ''The Comic Book in America: An Illustrated History''. Dallas: Taylor, 1989. ISBN 978-0-87833-659-3, p. 69.</ref> Elements such as the character of [[Batgirl]] and the show's [[Camp (style)|campy]] nature were introduced into the comics; the series also initiated the return of Alfred. Although both the comics and TV show were successful for a time, the camp approach eventually wore thin and the show was canceled in 1968. In the aftermath, the Batman comics themselves lost popularity once again. As Julius Schwartz noted, "When the television show was a success, I was asked to be campy, and of course when the show faded, so did the comic books."<ref>Daniels (1999), p. 115.</ref>

Starting in 1969, writer [[Dennis O'Neil]] and artist [[Neal Adams]] made a deliberate effort to distance Batman from the campy portrayal of the 1960s TV series and to return the character to his roots as a "grim avenger of the night."<ref>Wright, p. 233.</ref> O'Neil said his idea was "simply to take it back to where it started. I went to the DC library and read some of the early stories. I tried to get a sense of what Kane and Finger were after."<ref>Pearson, Roberta E.; Uricchio, William.

ISBN 978-0-85170-276-6, p. 18.</ref>

O'Neil and Adams first collaborated on the story "[[The Secret of the Waiting Graves]]" (''Detective Comics'' #395, January 1970). Few stories were true collaborations between O'Neil, Adams, Schwartz, and inker [[Dick Giordano]], and in actuality these men were mixed and matched with various other creators during the 1970s; nevertheless the influence of their work was "tremendous."<ref>Daniels (1999), p. 140.</ref> Giordano said: "We went back to a grimmer, darker Batman, and I think that's why these stories did so well..."<ref>Daniels (1999), p. 141.</ref> While the work of O'Neil and Adams was popular with fans, the acclaim did little to improve declining sales; the same held true with a similarly acclaimed run by writer [[Steve Englehart]] and penciler [[Marshall Rogers]] in ''Detective Comics'' #471–476 (August 1977&nbsp;– April 1978), which went on to influence the 1989 movie ''Batman'' and be adapted for ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', which debuted in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=5&id=40748|work=SciFi Wire|date=March 28, 2007|title=Batman Artist Rogers is Dead|postscript=none|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090201081512/http://www.scifi.com:80/scifiwire/index.php?category=5&id=40748|archivedate=2009-02-01}}: "Even though their Batman run was only six issues, the three laid the foundation for later Batman comics.

Earlier drafts of the 1989 Batman movie with Michael Keaton as the Dark Knight were based heavily on their work."</ref> Regardless, circulation continued to drop through the 1970s and 1980s, hitting an all-time low in 1985.<ref>Boichel, p. 15</ref>

===''The Dark Knight Returns''===
{{See also|Alternative versions of Batman}}

[[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s limited series ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' (February–June 1986), which tells the story of a 55-year old Batman coming out of retirement in a possible future, reinvigorated the character. ''The Dark Knight Returns'' was a financial success and has since become one of the medium's most noted touchstones.<ref>Daniels (1999), pp. 147, 149.</ref> The series also sparked a major resurgence in the character's popularity.<ref>Wright, p. 267.</ref>

That year Dennis O'Neil took over as editor of the Batman titles and set the template for the portrayal of Batman following DC's status quo-altering miniseries ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''. O'Neil operated under the assumption that he was hired to revamp the character and as a result tried to instill a different tone in the books than had gone before.<ref>Daniels (1999), pp. 155, 157.</ref> One outcome of this new approach was the "[[Batman: Year One|Year One]]" storyline in ''Batman'' #404–407 (February–May 1987), in which Frank Miller and artist [[David Mazzucchelli]] redefined the character's origins. Writer [[Alan Moore]] and artist [[Brian Bolland]] continued this dark trend with 1988's 48-page [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke]]'', in which the Joker, attempting to drive [[Commissioner Gordon]] insane, cripples Gordon's daughter [[Barbara Gordon|Barbara]], and then kidnaps and tortures the commissioner, physically and psychologically.

The Batman comics garnered major attention in 1988 when DC Comics created a [[Premium-rate telephone number|900 number]] for readers to call to vote on whether [[Jason Todd]], the second Robin, lived or died. Voters decided in favor of Jason's death by a narrow margin of 28 votes (see ''[[Batman: A Death in the Family]]'').<ref>Daniels (1999), p. 161.</ref> The following year saw the release of [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' feature film, which firmly brought the character back to the public's attention, grossing millions of dollars at the box office, and millions more in merchandising. However, the three sequels, Tim Burton's ''[[Batman Returns]]'' and director [[Joel Schumacher]]'s ''[[Batman Forever]]'' and ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', did not perform as well at the box office. The fourth film in the series, the Schumacher-directed ''Batman & Robin'', meanwhile, was a critical and commercial failure. The ''Batman'' movie franchise was rebooted with director and co-writer [[Christopher Nolan]]'s ''[[Batman Begins]]'' in 2005, ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' in 2008 and ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' in 2012. In 1989, the first issue of ''[[Legends of the Dark Knight]]'', the first new solo Batman title in nearly 50 years, sold close to a million copies.<ref name="introduction">Pearson, Roberta E.; Uricchio, William.

The 1993 "[[Knightfall]]" story arc introduced a new villain, [[Bane (comics)|Bane]], who critically injures Batman. Jean-Paul Valley, known as [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]], is called upon to wear the Batsuit during Bruce Wayne's convalescence. Writers [[Doug Moench]], [[Chuck Dixon]], and [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] worked on the Batman titles during "Knightfall", and would also contribute to other Batman crossovers throughout the 1990s. 1998's "[[Batman: Cataclysm|Cataclysm]]" storyline served as the precursor to 1999's "[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]", a year-long storyline that ran through all the Batman-related titles dealing with the effects of an earthquake-ravaged Gotham City. At the conclusion of "No Man's Land", O'Neil stepped down as editor and was replaced by [[Bob Schreck]].

Another writer who rose to prominence on the Batman comic series, was [[Jeph Loeb]]. Along with longtime collaborator Tim Sale, they wrote two miniseries ("[[The Long Halloween]]" and "[[Batman: Dark Victory|Dark Victory]]") that pit an early in his career version of Batman against his entire rogue's gallery (most notably [[Two-Face]], whose origin was re-envisioned by Loeb) while dealing with various mysteries involving [[serial killer]]s [[Holiday Killer|Holiday]] and [[Hangman (DC Comics)|the Hangman]]. In 2003, Loeb teamed with artist [[Jim Lee]] to work on another mystery arc: "[[Batman: Hush]]" for the main Batman book. The twelve–issue storyline has Batman and Catwoman teaming up against Batman's entire [[List of Batman Family adversaries|rogue's gallery]], including an apparently resurrected [[Jason Todd]], while seeking to find the identity of the mysterious supervillain [[Hush (comics)|Hush]]. While the character of Hush failed to catch on with readers, the arc was a sales success for DC. As the storyline was Jim Lee's first regular comic book work in nearly a decade, the series became #1 on the [[Diamond Comic Distributors]] sales chart for the first time since ''Batman'' #500 (October 1993) and Jason Todd's appearance laid the groundwork for writer [[Judd Winick]]'s subsequent run as writer on ''Batman'', with another multi-issue epic, "[[Batman: Under the Hood|Under the Hood]]", which ran from ''Batman'' #637–650.

In 2005, DC launched ''[[All-Star Batman and Robin]]'', a stand-alone comic series set outside the existing DC Universe. Written by Frank Miller and drawn by Jim Lee, the series was a commercial success for DC Comics<ref>{{cite web | author= | year=2006| title=Diamond's 2005 Year-End Sales Charts & Market Share | publisher=newsarama.com | url=http://www.newsarama.com/marketreport/05Year_End.html | archivedate=2006-05-25 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060525013002/http://www.newsarama.com/marketreport/05Year_End.html | accessdate=2006-10-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author= | year=2005| title=July 2005 Sales Charts: All-Star Batman & Robin Lives Up To Its Name | publisher=newsarama.com | url=http://www.newsarama.com/marketreport/july05sales.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060907063905/http://www.newsarama.com/marketreport/july05sales.html|archivedate=2006-09-07| accessdate=2006-10-26}}</ref> though widely panned by critics for its writing and strong depictions of violence.<ref>[http://www.craveonline.com/articles/comics/04649326/all_star_batman_and_robin.html Review by Iann Robinson], Crave Online {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5msHPxSxm|date =2010-01-18}}</ref><ref>[http://www.popmatters.com/comics/all-star-batman-robin-1-3.shtml Review by William Gatevackes], PopMatters, February 10, 2006  {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5msHPXkN2|date =2010-01-18}}</ref>

Starting in 2006, the regular writers on ''Batman'' and ''Detective Comics'' were [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Paul Dini]], with Grant Morrison reincorporating controversial elements of Batman lore (most notably, the science fiction themed storylines of the 1950s Batman comics, which Morrison revised as hallucinations Batman suffered under the influence of various mind-bending gases and extensive sensory deprivation training) into the character. Morrison's run climaxed with "Batman R.I.P.", which brought Batman up against the villainous "Black Glove" organization, which sought to drive Batman into madness. "Batman R.I.P." segued into ''[[Final Crisis]]'' (also written by Morrison), which saw the apparent death of Batman at the hands of [[Darkseid]]. In the 2009 miniseries ''[[Batman: Battle for the Cowl]]'', Wayne's former protégé Dick Grayson becomes the new Batman, and Wayne's son Damian becomes the new Robin.<ref name="comics.ign.com">{{cite web |last=Phillips |first=Dan |title=Grant Morrison's New Batman and Robin |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/986/986031p1.html |date=August 8, 2009 |work= |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2009-08-08|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120609172555/http://comics.ign.com/articles/986/986031p1.html |archivedate=2012-06-09 }}</ref><ref name="Interview">{{cite web |last=George |first=Richard |title=Morrison discusses ''Batman and Robin'' |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/961/961488p1.html |date=March 11, 2009 |work= |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2009-08-06|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120305225820/http://comics.ign.com/articles/961/961488p1.html |archivedate=2012-03-05 }}</ref> In June 2009, Judd Winick returned to writing ''Batman'', while Grant Morrison was given his own series, titled ''[[Batman and Robin (comic book)|Batman and Robin]]''.<ref name="io9">{{cite web |last=Wilkins |first=Alasdair |title=Batman Is Reborn...With A Vengeance |url=http://io9.com/5303197/batman-is-rebornwith-a-vengeance |date=June 27, 2009 |publisher=[[io9]] |accessdate=2009-08-06| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090630083351/http://io9.com/5303197/batman-is-rebornwith-a-vengeance| archivedate= 2009-06-30 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

In 2010, the storyline ''[[Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne]]'' saw Bruce travel through history, eventually returning to the present day. Although he reclaimed the mantle of Batman, he also allowed Grayson to continue being Batman as well. Bruce decided to take his war on crime globally, which is the central focus of ''[[Batman Incorporated]]''. DC Comics would later announce that Grayson would be the main character in ''Batman'', ''Detective Comics'' and ''Batman and Robin'', while Wayne would be the main character in ''Batman Incorporated''. Also, Bruce appeared in another ongoing series, ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight]]''.

===The New 52===
{{See also|The New 52}}
In September 2011, DC Comics' entire line of superhero books, including its ''Batman'' franchise, was canceled and relaunched with new #1 issues as part of [[The New 52]] reboot. Bruce Wayne is the only character to be identified as Batman and will be featured in ''Batman'', ''[[Detective Comics]]'', ''[[Batman and Robin (comic book)|Batman and Robin]]'', and ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight]]''. Dick Grayson returns to the mantle of Nightwing and appears in his own ongoing series. While many characters have their histories significantly altered to attract newer, younger readers, Batman's history remains mostly intact. ''Batman Incorporated'' was relaunched in 2012 to complete the "Leviathan" storyline.

Since the beginning of The New 52, [[Scott Snyder]] has been the writer of the flagship Batman title. His first major story arc was "[[Night of the Owls]]", where Batman confronts the [[Court of Owls]], a secret society that has controlled Gotham for centuries. The second story arc was "[[Death of the Family]]", where the Joker returns to Gotham and simultaneously attacks each member of the Batman family. The third story arc was "[[Batman: Zero Year]]", which redefined Batman's origin in The New 52. It followed ''Batman'' #0, published in June 2012, which explored the character's early years.

==Fictional character biography==
Batman's history has undergone various revisions, both minor and major. Few elements of the character's history have remained constant. Scholars [[William Uricchio]] and Roberta E. Pearson noted in the early 1990s, "Unlike some fictional characters, the Batman has no primary urtext set in a specific period, but has rather existed in a plethora of equally valid texts constantly appearing over more than five decades."<ref>Pearson, p. 185.</ref>

The central fixed event in the Batman stories is the character's [[origin story]].<ref name="pearson pg 186" /> As a little boy, Bruce Wayne is horrified and traumatized to see his parents, the physician Dr. [[Thomas Wayne]] and his wife [[Martha Wayne|Martha]], being murdered by a mugger in front of his very eyes. This drives him to fight crime in [[Gotham City]] as Batman. Pearson and Uricchio also noted beyond the origin story and such events as the introduction of Robin, "Until recently, the fixed and accruing and hence, canonized, events have been few in number,"<ref name="pearson pg 186">Pearson; Uricchio. "'I'm Not Fooled By That Cheap Disguise.'" p. 186.</ref> a situation altered by an increased effort by later Batman editors such as Dennis O'Neil to ensure consistency and continuity between stories.<ref name="pearson pg 191">Pearson, p. 191.</ref>

===Golden Age===
{{See also|Batman (Earth-Two)}}
In Batman's first appearance in ''Detective Comics'' #27, he is already operating as a crime-fighter.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Bill Finger]]|penciller=[[Bob Kane]]|story=The Case of the Chemical Syndicate|title=Detective Comics #27|date=May 1939|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> Batman's origin is first presented in ''Detective Comics'' #33 (November 1939) and is later expanded upon in ''Batman'' #47. As these comics state, Bruce Wayne is born to Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha, two very wealthy and charitable [[Gotham City]] socialites. Bruce is brought up in [[Wayne Manor]], and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight, when his parents are killed by a small-time criminal named [[Joe Chill]] while on their way home from a movie theater. That night, Bruce Wayne swears an oath to spend his life fighting crime. He engages in intense intellectual and physical training; however, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. "Criminals are a superstitious cowardly lot," Wayne remarks, "so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible..." As if responding to his desires, a [[bat]] suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to take on the persona of Batman.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=Bill Finger|penciller=Bob Kane|story=The Batman Wars Against the Dirigible of Doom|title=Detective Comics #33|date=November 1939|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref>

In early strips, Batman's career as a vigilante earns him the ire of the police. During this period, Bruce Wayne has a fiancée named [[Julie Madison]].<ref>She first appears in ''Detective Comics'' #31 (Sept. 1939)</ref> In ''Batman'' #1 takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, [[Dick Grayson]], who becomes his sidekick, [[Robin (comics)|Robin]].

===Silver Age===
The [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] in DC Comics is sometimes held to have begun in 1956 when the publisher introduced [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] as a new, updated version of [[Flash (comics)|The Flash]]. Batman is not significantly changed by the late 1950s for the continuity which would be later referred to as [[Earth-One]]. The lighter tone Batman had taken in the period between the Golden and Silver Ages led to the stories of the late 1950s and early 1960s that often feature many science-fiction elements, and Batman is not significantly updated in the manner of other characters until ''Detective Comics'' #327 (May 1964), in which Batman reverts to his detective roots, with most science-fiction elements jettisoned from the series.

After the introduction of DC Comics' [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] in the 1960s, DC established that stories from the Golden Age star the [[Batman (Earth-Two)|Earth-Two Batman]], a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman, Selina Kyle (as shown in ''[[Superman Family]]'' #211). They have a daughter, [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Helena Wayne]], who as the Huntress, becomes (along with Dick Grayson, the [[Robin (Earth-Two)|Earth-Two Robin]]) Gotham's protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or [[Green Lantern]], Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would occasionally make reference to stories from the Golden Age.<ref>One example is the Englehart/Rogers run of the late 1970s, which has editorial notes directing readers to issues such as ''Batman'' #1</ref> Nevertheless, details of Batman's history were altered or expanded upon through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in ''Batman'' #208, January/February 1969) after his parents' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Bill Finger]]|penciller=[[Sheldon Moldoff]]|story=The First Batman|title=Detective Comics|issue=235|date=September 1956|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Edmond Hamilton]]|penciller=[[Dick Sprang]]|story=When Batman Was Robin|title=Detective Comics|issue=226|date=December 1955|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> In 1980 then-editor [[Paul Levitz]] commissioned the ''Untold Legend of the Batman'' [[limited series]] to thoroughly chronicle Batman's origin and history.

Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman, whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'', starting in 1954 and continuing through the series' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. As a founding member of the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]], Batman appears in its first story, in 1960's ''[[Brave and the Bold]]'' #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, ''Brave and the Bold'' became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different [[DC Universe]] superhero each month.

In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from his mansion, [[Wayne Manor]] into a [[penthouse apartment]] atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City's crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl. Batman's adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of the Joker as a homicidal [[psychopathy|psychopath]], and the arrival of [[Ra's al Ghul]], a centuries-old terrorist who knows Batman's secret identity. In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes [[Nightwing]].<ref name="dc-ency"/>

In the final issue of ''Brave and the Bold'' in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]. He serves as the team's leader until ''Batman and the Outsiders'' #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title.

===Modern Batman===
After the 12-issue [[limited series]] ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', DC Comics [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] the histories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman's origin in the storyline "[[Batman: Year One|Year One]]" from ''Batman'' #404–407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character.<ref>{{cite book | last = Miller | first = Frank | authorlink = Frank Miller (comics)| author2 = [[David Mazzucchelli]] |author3=Richmond Lewis | title =[[Batman: Year One]] | publisher = [[DC Comics]] | year = 1987 | page = 98 | isbn = 978-1-85286-077-6}}</ref> Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman's Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham's police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman's existence. While Dick Grayson's past remains much the same, the history of [[Jason Todd]], the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Max Allan Collins]]|penciller=[[Chris Warner]]|story=Did Robin Die Tonight?|title=Batman|issue=408|date=June 1987|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred Pennyworth. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised backstory for Batman following ''Crisis'', DC launched a new Batman title called ''[[Legends of the Dark Knight]]'' in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the "Year One" period. Various stories from [[Jeph Loeb]] and [[Matt Wagner]] also touch upon this era.

In 1988's "[[Batman: A Death in the Family]]" storyline from ''Batman'' #426–429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker.<ref name="dc-ency"/> Subsequently, Batman begins exhibiting an excessive, reckless approach to his crime-fighting, a result of the pain of losing Jason Todd. Batman works solo until the decade's close, when [[Tim Drake]] becomes the new Robin.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]]|penciller=[[Norm Breyfogle]]|story=Master of Fear|title=[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]|issue=457|date=December 1990|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> In 2005, writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor as the murderous vigilante the [[Red Hood]].

Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, DC published both "[[The Death of Superman]]" storyline and "[[Knightfall]]". In that storyline's first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]] to take on the role. After the end of "Knightfall", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman's adventures, and Bruce Wayne's quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in "KnightsEnd", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains for a return to the role.<ref>Dixon, Chuck. et al. "Batman: Prodigal". ''Batman'' 512–514, ''Shadow of the Bat'' 32–34, ''Detective Comics'' 679–681, ''Robin'' 11–13. New York: DC Comics, 1995.</ref>

The 1994 company-wide crossover storyline "[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]" changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing [[Joe Chill]] from the new continuity, rendering stories such as "Year Two" non-canon.

Batman once again becomes a member of the [[Justice League]] during Grant Morrison's 1996 relaunch of the series, titled ''JLA''. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team's successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade's closing crossover arc. In 1998's "[[Batman: Cataclysm|Cataclysm]]" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake and ultimately cut off from the United States. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999's "[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]".

Meanwhile, Batman's relationship with the Gotham City Police Department changed for the worse with the events of "Batman: Officer Down" and "Batman: War Games/War Crimes"; Batman's long-time law enforcement allies Commissioner Gordon and [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]] are forced out of the police department in "Officer Down", while "War Games" and "War Crimes" saw Batman become a wanted fugitive after a contingency plan of his to neutralize Gotham City's criminal underworld is accidentally triggered, resulting in a massive gang war that ends with the [[sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]] the undisputed ruler of the city's criminal gangs. Other troubles come for Batman in the form of [[Lex Luthor]] (secretly behind the events of "No Man's Land"), who seeks revenge for Bruce Wayne cancelling all of his company's government contracts upon Luthor being elected President of the United States. Luthor arranges for the murder of Batman's on-again, off-again love interest Vesper (introduced in the mid-1990s) during the "Bruce Wayne: Murderer?" and "[[Bruce Wayne: Fugitive]]" story arcs. Though Batman is able to clear his name, he loses another ally in the form of his new bodyguard Sasha, who is recruited into the organization known as "Checkmate" while stuck in prison due to her refusal to turn state's evidence against her employer. While he was unable to prove that Luthor was behind the murder of Vesper, Batman does get his revenge with help from [[Talia al Ghul]] in ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #1–6: not only does he bring down Lex Luthor's Presidency but also engages in a hostile take-over of Luthor's corporate holdings, [[bankruptcy|bankrupting]] the villain in the process.

DC's 2005 [[limited series]] ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' reveals that JLA member [[Zatanna]] had edited Batman's memories to prevent him from stopping the League from [[lobotomy|lobotomizing]] [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]] after he raped [[Sue Dibny]]. This served as a retcon for Batman's complete distrust for his fellow superheroes after he remembers, which, under writers such as Mark Waid in the "Tower of Babel" arc in JLA, manifested itself in the form of Batman keeping extensive files on how to kill his fellow superheroes. Batman later creates the [[OMACs|Brother I]] satellite surveillance system to watch over and if necessary, kill the other heroes. It is eventually co-opted by [[Maxwell Lord]], who then kills superhero [[Blue Beetle (Ted Kord)|Blue Beetle]] to keep him from alerting the Justice League of the existence of Batman's murderous creation. The revelation of Batman's creation and his tacit responsibility for Blue Beetle's death becomes a driving force in the lead-up to the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In ''Infinite Crisis'' #7, [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] mentions that in the newly rewritten history of the "[[Multiverse (DC Comics)|New Earth]]", created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne – again, Joe Chill – was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after ''Zero Hour''. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs, though at the very end Batman reaches his apparent breaking point when Alexander Luthor Jr. seriously wounds Nightwing. Picking up a gun, Batman nearly shoots Luthor in order to avenge his former sidekick, until Wonder Woman convinces him to not pull the trigger.

Bruce publicly announces that Wayne Enterprises will aid Batman on his mission, known as "Batman, Incorporated." Due to rebooted continuity that occurred as part of DC's 2011 relaunch of all of its book, [[The New 52]], however, Grayson is restored as Nightwing with Wayne serving as the sole Batman once again. The relaunch also interrupts the publication of ''Batman, Incorporated,'' which resumed its story in 2012–13 with changes to suit the new status quo.

==Personality==
Batman's primary character traits can be summarized as "wealth; physical prowess; deductive abilities and obsession."<ref name="pearson pg 186" /> The details and tone of Batman comic books have varied over the years due to different creative teams. Dennis O'Neil noted that character consistency was not a major concern during early editorial regimes: "[[Julius Schwartz|Julie Schwartz]] did a Batman in ''Batman'' and ''Detective'' and [[Murray Boltinoff]] did a Batman in the ''Brave and the Bold'' and apart from the costume they bore very little resemblance to each other. Julie and Murray did not want to coordinate their efforts, nor were they asked to do so. Continuity was not important in those days."<ref>Pearson; Uricchio. "Notes from the Batcave: An Interview with Dennis O'Neil" p. 23.</ref>

The driving force behind Batman's character is his parents' murder. Bob Kane and Bill Finger discussed Batman's background and decided that "there's nothing more traumatic than having your parents murdered before your eyes."<ref>Daniels (1999), p. 31.</ref> Despite his trauma, he sets his mind on studying to become a scientist<ref name="ReferenceA">DETECTIVE Comics #33, November 1939, Bill Finger, Bob Kane</ref><ref name="ReferenceB">BATMAN #1 Spring 1940,Bill Finger, Bob Kane</ref> and to train his body into physical perfection<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="ReferenceB"/> to fight crime in [[Gotham City]] as Batman, an inspired idea from Wayne's insight into the criminal mind.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="ReferenceB"/>

Another of Batman's characterizations is a vigilante; in order to stop evil that started with the death of his parents, he must sometimes break laws himself. Although manifested differently by being re-told by different artists, it is nevertheless that the details and the prime components of Batman's origin have never varied at all in the comic books, the "reiteration of the basic origin events holds together otherwise divergent expressions".<ref>Pearson, p. 194.</ref> The origin is the source of the character's traits and attributes, which play out in many of the character's adventures.<ref name="pearson pg 186" />

Batman is often treated as a vigilante by other characters in his stories. Frank Miller views the character as "a [[Dionysus|dionysian]] figure, a force for [[anarchy]] that imposes an individual order."<ref>Sharrett, Christopher. "Batman and the Twilight of the Idols: An Interview with Frank Miller." ''The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and His Media''. Routledge: London, 1991. ISBN 978-0-85170-276-6, p. 44.</ref> Dressed as a bat, Batman deliberately cultivates a frightening persona in order to aid him in crime-fighting,<ref>Pearson, p. 208.</ref> a fear that originates from the criminals' own guilty [[conscience]].<ref>Dennis O'Neil, Wizard Batman Special 1998</ref>

===Bruce Wayne===
The Batman is, in his everyday identity, Bruce Wayne, a wealthy businessman living in Gotham City. Wayne averts suspicion by acting the part of a superficial, dim-witted playboy idly living off his family's fortune (amassed through investment in real estate before the city became a bustling metropolis)<ref>[[Dennis O'Neil]] ''Batman: Knightfall''. 1994, [[Bantam Books]]. ISBN 978-0-553-09673-6</ref> and the profits of [[Wayne Enterprises]], his inherited conglomerate.<ref>Daniels, 1999, p. ??</ref> He supports philanthropic causes through his nonprofit Wayne Foundation, but is more widely known as a celebrity socialite.<ref>Pearson, p. 202.</ref> In public, he pretends to be a heavy drinker, using [[ginger ale]] to suggest champagne and liberally serving alcohol to guests that he never actually consumes himself. In reality, he is a strict [[Teetotalism|teetotaler]] concerned to maintain top physical fitness and mental acuity. In public, he appears frequently in the company of fashionable women to encourage [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] gossip. In reality, there is less than meets the eye: though he leads an active romantic life, crime-fighting accounts for most of his night hours.<ref name="Inc0">{{cite comic|Writer = [[Grant Morrison|Morrison, Grant]]|Title = [[Batman Incorporated]]|Volume = 2|Issue = 0|Date = September 2012|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>

Bruce Wayne's calculated persona as a vapid, self-indulgent son of privilege finds literary precedent in Sir Percival Blakeney, hero of ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]'' stories by [[Baroness Emmuska Orczy]] (1903), and Don Diego de la Vega, hero of the [[Zorro]] tales by [[Johnston McCulley]] (1919). Like Bruce Wayne, Sir Percy and Don Diego are each members of gentry who invite contempt by publicly playing the fool. Also, like Bruce Wayne, each performs heroic deeds in secret and marks his work with a signature symbol.

The name "Bruce Wayne" was chosen for certain connotations. According to co-creator Bill Finger, "Bruce Wayne's first name came from [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert Bruce]], the Scottish patriot. Wayne, being a playboy, was a man of gentry. I searched for a name that would suggest colonialism. I tried Adams, Hancock...then I thought of [[Anthony Wayne|Mad Anthony Wayne]]."<ref>Jim Steranko ''History of the Comics'', vol. 1</ref>

Writers of Batman and Superman stories have often compared and contrasted the two. Interpretations vary depending on the writer, the story, and the timing. Grant Morrison<ref>{{cite news|last=Boucher|first=Geoff|title=Batman versus Superman as class warfare? Grant Morrison: ‘Bruce has a butler, Clark has a boss’|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2010/08/13/batman-versus-superman-as-class-warfare-bruce-has-a-butler-clark-has-a-boss/|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=Aug 13, 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20121015182152/http://herocomplex.latimes.com:80/2010/08/13/batman-versus-superman-as-class-warfare-bruce-has-a-butler-clark-has-a-boss/|archivedate=2012-10-15}}</ref> notes that both heroes "believe in the same kind of things" despite the day/night contrast their heroic roles display. He notes an equally stark contrast in their real identities. Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent belong to different social classes: "Bruce has a butler, Clark has a boss." T. James Musler's book ''Unleashing the Superhero in Us All'' explores the extent to which Bruce Wayne's vast personal wealth is important in his life story, and the crucial role it plays in his crusade against crime.<ref>T. James Musler. 2006. ''Unleashing the Superhero in Us All''.</ref>

Modern stories tend to portray Bruce Wayne as the character's facade and the Batman as the truer representation of his personality<ref>Scott Beatty, ''The Batman Handbook: The Ultimate Training Manual''. 2005, Quirk Books, p51. ISBN 978-1-59474-023-7</ref> (in counterpoint to the post-Crisis Superman, whose "[[Clark Kent]]" persona is the 'real' personality, and "Superman" is the 'mask').<ref>Aichele, G. (1997). ''Rewriting Superman.'' In G. Aichele & T. Pippin (Eds.), ''The Monstrous and the Unspeakable: The Bible as Fantastic Literature'', pp. 75–101. Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press.</ref><ref>''Superman'' vol. 2, #53</ref> In ''Batman Unmasked'', a television documentary about the psychology of the character, Associate Professor of Social Psychology at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], and an adjunct [[behavioral science|behavioral scientist]] at the [[Rand Corporation]] [[Benjamin Karney]], notes that the Batman's personality is driven by Bruce Wayne's inherent humanity; that "Batman, for all its benefits and for all of the time Bruce Wayne devotes to it, is ultimately a tool for Bruce Wayne's efforts to make the world better".

Will Brooker notes in his book ''Batman Unmasked'' that "the confirmation of the Batman's identity lies with the young audience...he doesn't have to be Bruce Wayne; he just needs the suit and gadgets, the abilities, and most importantly the morality, the humanity. There's just a sense about him: 'they trust him... and they're never wrong."<ref>{{cite book |title=Batman Unmasked |last=Brooker |first=Will |authorlink=  |year=2001 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |location=NY/London |isbn= 978-0-8264-1343-7 |page=368 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=GNRreYO91ogC&pg=PA137&dq=Unmasking+Batman |accessdate=}}</ref>

Bruce Wayne is a graduate of [[Yale Law School]], as seen in ''Detective Comics'' #439 (1974), in which the final page shows a Yale Law School diploma hanging in Bruce Wayne's office.<ref>{{cite news|title=The 10 Most Famous Graduates of Yale Law School|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/famous-graduates-of-yale-law-school-2013-9?op=1|accessdate=2013-10-09|magazine=Business Insider|date=Oct 8, 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140122113434/http://www.businessinsider.com/famous-graduates-of-yale-law-school-2013-9?op=1|archivedate=2014-01-22}}</ref>

===Dick Grayson===
{{Main|Dick Grayson}}
On two occasions former Robin [[Dick Grayson]] has served as Batman. He served briefly while Wayne recovered from spinal injuries caused by [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] in the 1993 ''Knightfall'' storyline. He assumed the mantle again in a 2009 comic book while Wayne was believed dead, and served as a second Batman even after Wayne returned in 2010. As part of DC's [[The New 52|2011 editorial mandate]], he returned to being Nightwing following the ''Flashpoint'' crossover event.

In an interview with [[IGN]], Morrison details that having Dick Grayson as Batman and [[Damian Wayne]] as Robin represented a "reverse" of the normal dynamic between Batman and Robin, with, "a more light-hearted and spontaneous Batman and a scowling, badass Robin." Morrison explains his intentions for the new characterization of Batman: "Dick Grayson is kind of this consummate superhero. The guy has been Batman's partner since he was a kid, he's led the [[Teen Titans]], and he's trained with everybody in the DC Universe. So he's a very different kind of Batman. He's a lot easier; {{sic|hide=y|He's}} a lot looser and more relaxed."<ref name="comics.ign.com"/>

==Characterization==

===Skills and abilities===
Batman has no inherent superhuman powers; he relies on "his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess."<ref name = "Wright_p17"/> In the stories, Batman is regarded as one of the world's greatest detectives, if not the world's greatest crime solver.<ref>Mike Conray, ''500 Great Comicbook Action Heroes''. 2002, Collins & Brown. ISBN 978-1-84411-004-9</ref> Batman has been repeatedly described as having a genius-level intellect, one of the greatest martial artists in the DC Universe, and having peak human physical conditioning.<ref>{{cite book |last= Greenberger |first= Robert|date= 2008|title= The Essential Batman Encyclopedia |publisher= Del Rey Books|isbn= 0345501063|accessdate= December 2014}}</ref> He has traveled the world acquiring the skills needed to aid in his crusade against crime. As a [[polymath]], his knowledge and expertise in almost every discipline known to man is nearly unparalleled by any other character in the DC Universe.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Grant Morrison]]|penciller=[[Howard Porter]]|story=War of the Worlds|title=JLA|issue=3|date=March 1997|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> Batman's inexhaustible wealth allows him access to advanced technology, and as a proficient [[scientist]], he is able to use and modify these technologies to his advantage.

Superman describes Batman as "the most dangerous man on Earth", able to defeat a team of superpowered extraterrestrials by himself in order to rescue his imprisoned teammates in Grant Morrison's first storyline in ''JLA''. Superman also considers Batman to be one of the most brilliant minds on the planet in the ''[[Superman: Doomed]]'' story arc.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Scott Lobdell]]|penciller=[[Ed Benes]] and [[Jack Herbert]]|story=Superman: Doomed|title=Superman|issue=31|date=July 2014|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref>

Batman has the ability to function under great physical pain, and to withstand [[telepathy]] and [[mind control]].  He is a master of [[disguise]], multilingual, and an expert in [[espionage]], often gathering information under the identity of Matches Malone, a notorious gangster. Batman's [[karate]], [[judo]] and [[jujutsu]] training has made him a master in stealth and [[escapology]], allowing him to appear and disappear at will and to break free of nearly inescapable [[Deathtrap (plot device)|deathtraps]] with little to no harm.

Batman is an expert in [[interrogation]] techniques and uses both law-abiding and extreme methods to extract information from suspects, such as hanging a person over the edge of a building. His [[intimidation|intimidating]] and frightening appearance alone is often all that is needed in getting information from suspects. Despite having the potential to harm his enemies, Batman's most defining characteristic is his strong commitment to justice and his unwillingness to take life, regardless of the situation he has faced. This unyielding moral rectitude has earned him the respect of several heroes in the DC Universe, most notably that of [[Superman]] and [[Wonder Woman]].

===Costume===
{{Main|Batsuit}}
Batman's costume incorporates the imagery of a bat in order to frighten criminals.<ref name="A1">Daniels (1999)</ref> The details of the Batman costume change repeatedly through various stories and media, but the most distinctive elements remain consistent: a scallop-hem cape, a cowl covering most of the face featuring a pair of batlike ears, and a stylized bat emblem on the chest, and the ever-present utility belt. The costumes' colors have traditionally been dark blue and grey,<ref name="A1" /> although this colorization arose due to the way comic book art was colored;<ref name="A1" /> the character is sometimes depicted in black and grey. Finger and Kane conceptualized Batman as having a black cape and cowl and grey suit, but conventions in coloring called for black to be highlighted with blue.<ref name="A1" />

Batman's [[batsuit]] aids in his combat against enemies, having the properties of both [[Kevlar]] and [[Nomex]]. It protects him from gunfire and other significant impacts. His gloves typically feature three scallops that protrude from long, gauntlet-like cuffs, although in his earliest appearances he wore short, plain gloves without the scallops.<ref>Daniels (1999), p. 98.</ref> The overall look of the character, particularly the length of the cowl's ears and of the cape, varies greatly depending on the artist. Dennis O'Neil said, "We now say that Batman has two hundred suits hanging in the Batcave so they don't have to look the same . . . Everybody loves to draw Batman, and everybody wants to put their own spin on it."<ref>Daniels (1999), pp. 159–60.</ref>

===Equipment===
{{See also|Batman's utility belt}}
[[File:USD205998.png|thumb|The 1966 television Batmobile, built by [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]] from a [[Lincoln Futura]] [[concept car]]]]
[[File:Batmobile-to-Wiki-by-Zachi-Evenor.jpg|thumb|The Batmobile from [[Tim Burton]]'s 1989 ''[[Batman (1989)|Batman]]'' film.]]

Batman uses a large arsenal of specialized, high-tech vehicles and gadgets in his war against crime, the designs of which usually share a bat motif. Batman historian [[Les Daniels]] credits [[Gardner Fox]] with creating the concept of Batman's arsenal with the introduction of the utility belt in ''Detective Comics'' #29 (July 1939) and the first bat-themed weapons the [[batarang]] and the "Batgyro" in ''Detective Comics'' #31 and #32 (September; October 1939).<ref name = "vapzdg"/>

Batman's primary vehicle is the [[Batmobile]], which is usually depicted as an imposing black car, often with [[Car tailfin|tailfins]] that suggest a bat's wings. Batman also has an aircraft called the [[Batplane]] (later called the "Batwing"), and he is usually shown as having a [[Batboat]], [[Bat-Sub]], and [[Batcycle]]. In proper practice, the "bat" prefix (as in Batmobile or batarang) is rarely used by Batman himself when referring to his equipment, particularly after some portrayals (primarily the 1960s [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'' live-action television show]] and the ''[[Super Friends]]'' animated series) stretched the practice to [[Camp (style)|campy]] proportions. The 1960s television series Batman has an arsenal that includes such "bat-" names as the bat-computer, bat-scanner, bat-radar, bat-cuffs, bat-pontoons, bat-drinking water dispenser, bat-camera with polarized bat-filter, bat-[[shark repellent]] bat-spray, and bat-rope. The storyline "A Death in the Family" suggests that given Batman's grim nature, he is unlikely to have adopted the "bat" prefix on his own. In [[The Dark Knight Returns]], Batman tells Carrie Kelley that the original Robin came up with the name "Batmobile" when he was young, since that is what a kid would call Batman's vehicle.

Batman keeps most of his field equipment in his [[Batman's utility belt|utility belt]]. Over the years it has shown to contain an assortment of crime-fighting tools, weapons, and investigative and technological instruments. Different versions of the belt have these items stored in compartments, often as pouches or hard cylinders attached evenly around it. Batman is often depicted as carrying a projectile which shoots a retractable grappling hook attached to a cable. This allows him to attach to distant objects, be propelled into the air, and thus swing from the rooftops of Gotham City. An exception to the range of Batman's equipment are conventional [[firearm]]s, which he refuses to use on principle, since that weapon class was used in his parents' murder. Modern depictions of Batman have him compromise for practicality, by arming his vehicles mainly for the purpose of removing obstacles or disabling enemy vehicles.

===Bat-Signal===
{{Main|Bat-Signal}}
When Batman is needed, the Gotham City police activate a [[searchlight]] with a bat-shaped insignia over the lens called the Bat-Signal, which shines into the night sky, creating a bat-symbol on a passing cloud which can be seen from any point in Gotham. The origin of the signal varies, depending on the continuity and medium.

In various incarnations, most notably the 1960s [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'' TV series]], Commissioner Gordon also has a dedicated phone line, dubbed the Bat-Phone, connected to a bright red telephone (in the TV series) which sits on a wooden base and has a transparent cake cover on top. The line connects directly to Batman's residence, [[Wayne Manor]], specifically both to a similar phone sitting on the desk in Bruce Wayne's study and the extension phone in the Batcave.

===Batcave===
{{Main|Batcave}}
The Batcave is Batman's secret headquarters, consisting of a series of subterranean caves beneath his mansion, Wayne Manor. It serves as his command center for both local and global surveillance, as well as housing his vehicles and equipment for his war on crime. It also is a storeroom for Batman's memorabilia. In both the comic ''[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat]]'' (issue #45) and the 2005 film ''[[Batman Begins]]'', the cave is said to have been part of the [[Underground Railroad]]. Of the heroes and villains who see the Batcave, few know where it is located.

{{Main|List of Batman supporting characters}}

Batman's interactions with both villains and cohorts have, over time, developed a strong supporting cast of characters.<ref name="pearson pg 186" /> [[Chief of police|Commissioner]] [[James Gordon (comics)|James "Jim" Gordon]], Batman's ally in the Gotham City police, debuted along with Batman in ''Detective Comics'' #27. Gordon has been a consistent presence ever since. As a crime-fighting [[everyman]], he shares the Batman's goals while offering, much as the character of Watson does in [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories, a normal person's perspective on the work of an extraordinary genius. Later the Batman gained a butler. Alfred Pennyworth serves as Bruce Wayne's loyal father figure and is one of the few persons to know his secret identity. The character "[lends] a homey touch to Batman's environs and [is] ever ready to provide a steadying and reassuring hand" to the hero and his sidekick.<ref name = "Boichel_p8">Boichel, p. 8.</ref> In the 1970s, [[Lucius Fox]] appeared as Bruce Wayne's business manager and technology specialist.

===Robin===
{{anchor|Robin}}
{{Main|Robin (comics)}}
A widely recognized supporting character for many years has been the young sidekick Robin.<ref>Boichel, p. 7.</ref> Bill Finger stated that he wanted to include Robin because "Batman didn't have anyone to talk to, and it got a little tiresome always having him thinking."<ref>{{cite book|last=Langley|first=Travis|title=Batman and Psychology: A Dark and Stormy Knight|year=2012|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|page=179}}</ref> The first Robin, Dick Grayson, was introduced in 1940. In the 1970s he finally grew up, went off to college and became the hero [[Nightwing]]. A second Robin, [[Jason Todd]], appeared in the 1980s. In the stories he was eventually badly beaten and then killed in an explosion set by the Joker, but later revived as an adversary using the Joker's old persona, the [[Red Hood]]. [[Carrie Kelly]], the first female Robin to appear in Batman stories, was the final Robin in the continuity of Frank Miller's graphic novels ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' and ''[[The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', fighting alongside an aging Batman in stories set out of the mainstream continuity.

The third Robin in mainstream comics is [[Tim Drake]], who first appeared in 1989. He went on to star in his own comic series. In the first decade of the new millennium, [[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Stephanie Brown]] served as the fourth in-universe Robin between the character's stints as [[Stephanie Brown (comics)|The Spoiler]] and [[Batgirl]].<ref>Langley, 180–210</ref> After Stephanie Brown's apparent death, Drake resumed the role of Robin for a time. The role eventually passed to [[Damian Wayne]], the ten-year-old son of Bruce Wayne and [[Talia al Ghul]], in the late 2000s.<ref>{{cite web  | last = Esposito | first = Joey | title = Why Damian Wayne is the Best Robin  | publisher = IGN | date = March 5, 2013 | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/06/why-damian-wayne-is-the-best-robin/ | accessdate = February 17, 2014| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20140301042547/http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/06/why-damian-wayne-is-the-best-robin| archivedate = 2014-03-01}}</ref> Damian's tenure as ''du jour'' Robin ended when the character was killed off in the pages of ''[[Batman Incorporated]]'' in 2013.<ref>{{cite web  | last = Saul | first = Josh | title = DC killing off Batman’s ‘Boy Wonder’ Damian Wayne in new comic book | publisher = The New York Post| date = February 25, 2013 | url = http://nypost.com/2013/02/25/dc-killing-off-batmans-boy-wonder-damian-wayne-in-new-comic-book/ | accessdate = February 17, 2014| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20140429184730/http://nypost.com/2013/02/25/dc-killing-off-batmans-boy-wonder-damian-wayne-in-new-comic-book/| archivedate = 2014-04-29}}</ref> Batman's next young sidekick is Harper Row, a young woman who avoids the name Robin, debuting under the codename [[Bluebird (DC Comics)|Bluebird]] in 2014.

===Villains===
{{Main|List of Batman Family adversaries}}
[[File:Batmanfoes.jpg|thumb|A gathering of Batman's villains; art by [[Jim Lee]]]]

Batman faces a variety of foes ranging from common criminals to outlandish supervillains. Many of them mirror aspects of the Batman's character and development, often having tragic origin stories that lead them to a life of crime.<ref name = "Boichel_p8"/> Batman's foes are commonly referred to as the "[[List of Batman Family adversaries|rogues gallery]]". Batman's "most implacable foe" is the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], a homicidal maniac with a clown-like appearance who, as a "personification of the irrational", represents "everything Batman [opposes]."<ref name = "Boichel_p9"/> Other long time recurring foes include [[Catwoman]] (who is sometimes an ally and [[antihero|antiheroine]]), the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]], [[Ra's al Ghul]], [[Two-Face]], the [[Riddler]], the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]], [[Mr. Freeze]], [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], and [[Bane (comics)|Bane]], among many others.

===Others===
Other supporting characters in the Batman's world include [[Barbara Gordon]], Commissioner Gordon's daughter, who has fought crime under the aliases [[Batgirl]] and, during a period in which she was confined to a wheelchair due to a gunshot wound inflicted by the Joker, the [[Hacker (computer security)|computer hacker]] Oracle; Azrael, a would-be assassin who replaces Bruce Wayne as Batman for a time; [[Cassandra Cain]], an assassin's daughter who became the new Batgirl; [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]], the sole surviving member of a mob family turned Gotham vigilante who has worked with Batman on occasion, [[Spoiler (comics)|Stephanie Brown]], the daughter of a criminal who operated as the Spoiler and temporarily as Robin, Ace the Bat-Hound, Batman's canine partner;<ref name="138D">Daniels (1995), p. 138.</ref> and Bat-Mite, an extra-dimensional imp who idolizes Batman.<ref name="138D" />

Batman is at times a member of superhero teams such as the [[Justice League of America]] and the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]. Batman has often been paired in adventures with his Justice League teammate Superman, notably as the co-stars of ''World's Finest'' and ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' series. In pre-Crisis continuity, the two are depicted as close friends; however, in current continuity, they have a mutually respectful but uneasy relationship, with an emphasis on their differing views on crime-fighting and justice. In ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #3 (December 2003), [[Superman]] observes, "Sometimes, I admit, I think of Bruce as a man in a costume. Then, with some gadget from his utility belt, he reminds me that he has an extraordinarily inventive mind. And how lucky I am to be able to call on him."<ref>{{cite comic| writer = [[Jeph Loeb|Loeb, Jeph]] | penciller = [[Ed McGuinness|McGuinness, Ed]] | inker = [[Dexter Vines|Vines, Dexter]] | title = [[Superman/Batman]] | volume =1 | story = Running Wild | issue = 3 | date = December 2003 | publisher = [[DC Comics]] }}</ref>

==Romantic Relationships==
[[File:Catwoman1-page.jpg|thumb|Batman and Catwoman have an intimate encounter in ''Catwoman'' #1 (2011). Art by Guillem March.]]
Bruce Wayne has been portrayed as being romantically involved with many women throughout his various incarnations. Some have been respected society figures, such as [[Julie Madison]], [[Vicki Vale]], and [[Silver St. Cloud]]. Some have been allies, such as [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Sasha Bordeaux]]. Some have been villainesses, such as Selina Kyle ([[Catwoman]]) and [[Talia al Ghul]]. Writers have varied in the approach over the years to the "playboy" aspect of Bruce Wayne's persona; some show his playboy reputation as a manufactured illusion to support his mission as Batman, while others have depicted Bruce Wayne as genuinely enjoying the benefits of being "Gotham's most eligible bachelor."

Batman has had many romantic relationships with female characters throughout the years, but while these relationships tend to be short, the attraction between Batman and Catwoman is present in nearly every version and medium in which the characters appear. While Catwoman has been historically portrayed as a supervillainess, Batman and Catwoman have worked together in achieving common goals and are usually depicted as having a romantic relationship. Batman has had many romantic relationships with female characters throughout the years, but while these relationships tend to be short, Batman's attraction to Catwoman is present in nearly every version and medium in which the characters appear.

After the introduction of DC Comics' [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] in the 1960s, DC established that stories from the Golden Age star the [[Batman (Earth-Two)|Earth-Two Batman]], a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman, Selina Kyle (as shown in ''[[Superman Family]]'' #211). They have a daughter named [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Helena Wayne]], who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with Dick Grayson, the [[Robin (Earth-Two)|Earth-Two Robin]]) Gotham's protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman.

In an early 1980s storyline, Selina and Bruce develop a relationship, in which the closing panel of the final story shows her referring to Batman as "Bruce". However, a change in the editorial team brought a swift end to that storyline and, apparently, all that transpired during the story arc.

Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle (out of costume) develop a relationship during ''The Long Halloween''. The story sees Selina saving Bruce from Poison Ivy. However, the relationship ends on the Fourth of July when Bruce rejects her advances twice; once as Bruce and once as Batman. In ''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]'', he stands her up on two holidays, causing her to leave him for good and to leave Gotham City for a while. When the two meet at an opera many years later, during the events of the twelve-issue story arc called ''[[Batman: Hush|Hush]]'', Bruce comments that the two no longer have a relationship as Bruce and Selina. However, ''Hush'' sees Batman and Catwoman teaming up against as allies against the entire [[List of Batman Family adversaries|rogues gallery]] and rekindling their romantic relationship. In ''Hush'', Batman reveals his true identity to Catwoman.

Batman and Catwoman are shown having a sexual encounter on a rooftop in ''Catwoman'' #1 (2011); the same issue implies that the two have had an ongoing sexual relationship.<ref name="Catwoman #1 September 2011">''Catwoman'' #1 (September 2011)</ref>

==Cultural impact==
Batman has become a pop culture icon, recognized around the world. The character's presence has extended beyond his comic book origins; events such as the release of the 1989 ''Batman'' film and its accompanying merchandising "brought the Batman to the forefront of public consciousness."<ref name="introduction" /> In an article commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the character, ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote, "Batman is a figure blurred by the endless reinvention that is modern mass culture. He is at once an icon and a commodity: the perfect cultural <!-- IMPORTANT: Please do not amend the spelling of the following word, it is a direct quotation from a UK publication and is the correct spelling for that location.

In addition, media outlets have often used the character in trivial and comprehensive surveys — ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine estimated Bruce Wayne to be the 8th-richest fictional character with his $6.9&nbsp;billion fortune, several places after [[Iron Man]], who is at 5.<ref name="forbes">{{cite web|url= http://www.forbes.com/special-report/2012/fictional-15-12/bruce-wayne.html|title=The Forbes Fictional 15, Bruce Wayne|last=Noer|first=Michael|author2=David M.

Paul Zehr]].

===In other media===
{{Main|Batman franchise media}}
The character of Batman has appeared in various media aside from comic books. The character has been developed as a vehicle for newspaper syndicated [[comic strip]]s, books, radio dramas, television, a [[Batman Live|stage show]], and several theatrical feature films. The first adaptation of Batman was as a daily newspaper comic strip which premiered on October 25, 1943.<ref>Daniels (1999), p. 50.</ref> That same year the character was adapted in the 15-part [[Serial film|serial]] ''[[Batman (serial)|Batman]]'', with [[Lewis Wilson]] becoming the first actor to portray Batman on screen. While Batman never had a radio series of his own, the character made occasional guest appearance in ''[[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|The Adventures of Superman]]'' starting in 1945 on occasions when Superman voice actor [[Bud Collyer]] needed time off.<ref name="Dan99p64">Daniels (1999), p. 64.</ref> A second movie serial, ''[[Batman and Robin (serial)|Batman and Robin]]'', followed in 1949, with [[Robert Lowery (actor)|Robert Lowery]] taking over the role of Batman. The exposure provided by these adaptations during the 1940s "helped make [Batman] a household name for millions who never bought a comic book."<ref name="Dan99p64"/>

In the 1964 publication of [[Donald Barthelme]]'s collection of short stories "Come Back, Dr. Caligari", Barthelme wrote "The Joker's Greatest Triumph." Batman is portrayed for purposes of spoof as a pretentious French-speaking rich man.<ref>Olsen, Lance. "Linguistic Pratfalls in Barthelme", ''[[South Atlantic Review]]'' 5.4 (1986), pp. 69–77.

[[File:Batman Kane.jpg|220px|thumb|left|[[Michael Keaton]] as Batman, with [[Bob Kane]] on the set of [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989)]]
The ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series, starring [[Adam West]], premiered in January 1966 on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television network. Inflected with a [[Camp (style)|camp]] sense of humor, the show became a pop culture phenomenon. In his memoir, ''Back to the Batcave'', West notes his dislike for the term 'camp' as it was applied to the 1960s series, opining that the show was instead a [[farce]] or [[Parody|lampoon]], and a deliberate one, at that. The series ran for 120 episodes, ending in 1968. In between the first and second season of the ''Batman'' television series the cast and crew made the theatrical film ''[[Batman (1966 film)|Batman]]'' (1966). [[The Kinks]] performed the theme song from the Batman series on their 1967 album [[Live at Kelvin Hall]]. The popularity of the ''Batman'' TV series also resulted in the first animated adaptation of Batman in the series ''[[The Batman/Superman Hour]]'';<ref>Boichel, p. 14.</ref> the Batman segments of the series were repackaged as ''[[The Adventures of Batman]]'' and ''Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder'' which produced thirty-three episodes between 1968 and 1977. From 1973 until 1986, Batman had a starring role in ABC's ''[[Super Friends]]'' series, which was animated by [[Hanna-Barbera]]. [[Olan Soule]] was the voice of Batman in all these series, but was eventually replaced during ''Super Friends'' by Adam West, who also voiced the character in [[Filmation]]'s 1977 series ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]]''.

In 1989, [[Warner Bros.]] released the live-action feature film ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]''; directed by [[Tim Burton]] and starring [[Michael Keaton]] as the title character. The film was a huge success; not only was it the top-grossing film of the year, but at the time was the fifth highest-grossing film in history.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=batman.htm | title= Batman (1989) | publisher=Box Office Mojo | accessdate=2007-05-27 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070513103130/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=batman.htm| archivedate= 2007-05-13 | deadurl= no}}</ref> The film also won the [[Academy Award for Best Art Direction]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1223147717805 | title = Batman | work = [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] | accessdate = 2008-10-04}}</ref> The film's success spawned three sequels: ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992), ''[[Batman Forever]]'' (1995) and ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'' (1997); the latter two of which were directed by [[Joel Schumacher]] instead of Burton, and replaced Keaton as Batman with [[Val Kilmer]] and [[George Clooney]], respectively. The second Schumacher film, while a box office success, failed to outgross any of its predecessors and was critically panned, causing Warner Bros. to cancel the planned ''[[Batman in film#Batman Triumphant|Batman Triumphant]]'' sequel and place the [[Batman in film|film series]] on hiatus.

[[File:Batmananimated32.png|thumb|Batman's appearance in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' (1992–95)]]
In 1992, ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television network; produced by [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and featuring [[Kevin Conroy]] as the voice of Batman. The series received considerable acclaim for its darker tone, mature writing, stylistic design and thematic complexity compared to previous superhero cartoons,<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/articles/758/758931p3.html "The Greatest Comic Book Cartoons of All Time"].

The futuristic series ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' also took place in this same animated continuity and featured a newer, younger [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Batman]] voiced by [[Will Friedle]], with the elderly Bruce Wayne (voiced by Conroy) as a mentor. In 2004, a new animated series titled ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' made its debut with [[Rino Romano]] as the title character. In 2008, this show was replaced by another animated series, ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', featuring [[Diedrich Bader]] as Batman. In 2013, a new [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]-animated series titled ''[[Beware the Batman]]'' made its debut, but was cancelled after one season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://toonami.tumblr.com/post/98164760488/good-news-bad-news-batman-fans|title=Good News/Bad News Batman Fans|publisher=toonami.tumblr.com |date=September 22, 2014 |accessdate=September 22, 2014}}</ref>

In 2005, ''[[Batman Begins]]'' was released to theaters as a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the Warner Bros. film series; directed by [[Christopher Nolan]] and starring [[Christian Bale]] as Batman.

[[File:Batbed.png|thumb|300px|Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson – panel from ''Batman''#84 (June 1954), page 24]]

Gay interpretations of the character have been part of the academic study of Batman since psychologist [[Fredric Wertham]] asserted in ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'' in 1954 that "Batman stories are psychologically homosexual&nbsp;... The Batman type of story may stimulate children to homosexual fantasies, of the nature of which they may be unconscious."<ref>Wertham, Fredric. ''Seduction of the Innocent''. Rinehart and Company, Inc., 1954. pp. 189–90.<br/>For discussion of Wertham's impact see Brooker (2001).</ref> Andy Medhurst wrote in his 1991 essay "Batman, Deviance, and Camp" that Batman is interesting to gay audiences because "he was one of the first fictional characters to be attacked on the grounds of his presumed homosexuality".<ref>Medhurst, Andy. "Batman, Deviance, and Camp." ''The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and His Media''. Routledge: London, 1991. ISBN 978-0-85170-276-6, p. 150.</ref>  Professor of film and cultural studies [[Will Brooker]] argues the validity of a queer reading of Batman, and that gay readers would naturally find themselves drawn to the lifestyle depicted within, whether the character of Bruce Wayne himself were explicitly gay or not. He also identifies a homophobic element to the vigour with which mainstream fandom rejects the possibility of a gay reading of the character.<ref>Brooker, Will (2001) ''Batman Unmasked: Analyzing a Cultural Icon'', Continuum. ISBN 978-1623567521, pp. 101 ff.</ref>

Creators associated with the character have expressed their own opinions. Writer Alan Grant has stated, "The Batman I wrote for 13 years isn't gay&nbsp;... everybody's Batman all the way back to Bob Kane&nbsp;... none of them wrote him as a gay character. Only Joel Schumacher might have had an opposing view."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/panel/106070953757230.htm | title=Is Batman Gay? | accessdate=28 December 2005 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081201072032/http://www.comicsbulletin.com/panel/106070953757230.htm | archivedate=5 September 2013}}</ref> Frank Miller views the character as sublimating his sexual urges into crimefighting, concluding, "He'd be ''much'' healthier if he were gay."<ref>Sharrett, p. 38.</ref> [[Grant Morrison]] said that "Gayness is built into Batman&nbsp;... Obviously as a fictional character he's intended to be heterosexual, but the basis of the whole concept is utterly gay. I think that's why people like it. All these women fancy him and they all wear fetish clothes and jump around rooftops to get to him. He doesn't care—he's more interested in hanging out with the old guy and the kid."<ref>[http://www.playboy.com/playground/entertainment/culture/the-super-psyche ''Playboy'' Grant Morrison interview], accessed 2012-05-02 {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/67oIQD5AR|date =2012-05-20}}</ref>

In 2000, DC refused permission for the reprinting of four panels (from ''Batman'' #79, 92, 105 and 139) to illustrate Christopher York's paper ''All in the Family: Homophobia and Batman Comics in the 1950s''.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Beatty |first=Bart |title=Don't Ask, Don't Tell: How Do You Illustrate an Academic Essay about Batman and Homosexuality? |journal=The Comics Journal |year=2000 |volume= |issue=228 |pages=17–18 |url= }}</ref> In 2005, painter Mark Chamberlain displayed a number of [[watercolor]]s depicting both Batman and Robin in suggestive and sexually explicit poses,<ref>{{cite web |title=Mark Chamberlain (American, 1967) |publisher=Artnet |url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/mark-chamberlain/past-auction-results|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140309070124/http://www.artnet.com/artists/mark-chamberlain/past-auction-results|archivedate=2014-03-09}}</ref> prompting DC to threaten legal action.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4167032.stm | title=Gallery told to drop 'gay' Batman | publisher=BBC News Online | date=August 19, 2005| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131104232835/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4167032.stm | archivedate=2013-11-04 }}</ref>
